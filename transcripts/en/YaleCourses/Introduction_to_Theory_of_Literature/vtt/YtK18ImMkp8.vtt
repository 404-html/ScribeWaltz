WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.410
So we arrive at our turn to socio genesis and genesis is of course here,

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.210
uh,

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.070
obviously even as we read both Galison Bactine for today,

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.410
a misleading term,
uh,
in a certain sense because,
uh,

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.540
obviously the most egregious difference between [inaudible] and [inaudible].

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.820
And once again,
you're probably saying to yourself,
well my goodness,

7
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:31.500
why have these two texts been put together?
The most egregious differences that,

8
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.640
uh,
uh,

9
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:37.641
buck teens primary primary concern is with the life world that produces a,

10
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.040
a text,
uh,

11
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:46.041
and yelless his primary concern is with the life world or perhaps better

12
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:50.910
succession of life worlds in which in which a text is received.

13
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.750
I think you can tell however,
from reading both texts and we'll be,
um,

14
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.320
conscious,
uh,
as,

15
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.980
as you go through the materials that remain on the syllabus,

16
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.280
that the relationship between the production and reception of literature or of

17
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:10.260
discourse of any kind,

18
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.410
once you factor in the social setting of such a text becomes much more

19
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:21.000
permeable,
much more fluid.

20
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.740
There's a certain sense in which the producer is the receiver,
uh,

21
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:28.230
in which the author is the reader.

22
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:33.231
They author stands in relation to a tradition to a past as a reader and the

23
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:35.520
reader in turn,
uh,

24
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:39.060
in continuing to circulate texts through history.

25
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:44.061
That is to say in playing a role as someone who keeps texts current is perhaps,

26
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.480
uh,
even concrete,
even in concrete terms,

27
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.010
a writer that what that is to say someone who expresses opinions,

28
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.400
uh,
circulates values and keeps texts.

29
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.170
As I say in circulation,
this,
I mean,
I've always felt this about,

30
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.460
about Yos as sense of what a reader is.
Um,

31
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.630
what kind of reader would it be who was responsible for the continued,

32
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.430
uh,
presence,
influence of a text through literary history,

33
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.160
who wasn't in some sense communicating and opinion.

34
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.280
This is obviously truer today than ever before when we have blogs and discussion

35
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:27.900
groups and when everybody,
everybody is circulating opinions on the Internet.
Um,

36
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.960
plainly the reader plainly the tastemaker reader as tastemaker,

37
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.190
uh,
is at the same time a writer,
uh,
just in passing,

38
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.390
uh,
this has become a digression,
but I hope it useful.
One,

39
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.130
Justin passing in this context,
one can think about,
uh,

40
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.800
a really strange pairing.
Uh,
yes.

41
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:54.801
In relation to bloom if blooms theory of strong misreading as a principle of

42
00:02:56.851 --> 00:03:01.851
literary historiography can be understood as a relationship between writers,

43
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:08.080
as readers and readers as writers.
So by the same token,

44
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.130
if we see a yellow yosses,
uh,

45
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.980
analysis of reception in these terms,

46
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.570
and if we think of reception as a necessary circulation of opinion,

47
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.780
there is after all a sense in which for a outs to the reader is a writer and the

48
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:29.860
writer as a reader,
um,
that is,
uh,
undoubtedly a remote connection,

49
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:34.861
but it is a way of seeing how both bloom and youse are figures who have strong

50
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.020
and interesting and plausible theories,
uh,
about literary history.

51
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.530
All right.
To go,
however,
back to the beginning,
back to the,

52
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.400
the sense in which we're at a watershed,

53
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.380
a or a moment of transition in this course,
leaving for the moment,
uh,

54
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.330
out of the picture,
the intermediate step of psycho genesis.
Uh,

55
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:03.070
to go back to the sense of our being in a moment of transition,
uh,
as always,

56
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:05.590
such as the calendar,
just at the wrong time.

57
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:09.220
We finally accomplish our transition.
Then we go off for spring break,

58
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.530
forget everything we ever knew,
uh,

59
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.730
and come back and start off at once again as a Tabula Rasa.

60
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.510
But we'll do our best.
We'll do it.
We'll,
we'll do our best to bridge that gap.

61
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.703
In any case,

62
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.280
if we now find ourselves understanding in reading these two texts for the first

63
00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:28.900
time,
really,
uh,

64
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:32.560
although it's not that we haven't been talking about life before,

65
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.430
obviously we have been and it's not as though,
uh,

66
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.630
the Russian formalists culminating in the structuralism of your cups and don't

67
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:44.830
talk about a referential function.
I mean,
it's not a,

68
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.900
it's unfair even to the new critics to say that somehow the world is excluded

69
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.830
from the interpretive or reading process.

70
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.340
Even though all along we've been saying things like this,

71
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.710
we still sense a difference.

72
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.650
The difference is in the perceived relationship between the texts,

73
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.700
the object of study and the life world.

74
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.070
The sense in fact in which a text is a life world.
Uh,

75
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.500
and this has,
after all,
something to do,

76
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.520
something to do with our understanding of what language is.

77
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.660
So far,

78
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.680
we've been thinking of language as a semiotic code or,
and,

79
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.410
and also,
uh,

80
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:34.000
with the strong suspicion that this semiotic code is a virtual one.

81
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.810
We have been emphasizing the degree to which we are passive in relation to,

82
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:44.110
or even as it were spoken by this language.

83
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.610
In other words,
it's been a constant in our thinking about these matters.

84
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.520
That language speaks through us,

85
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.300
but we have exercised so far,
uh,

86
00:05:55.301 --> 00:06:00.301
curious reticence about the sense in which this language is not just a code,

87
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.230
not just something that exists virtually at a given historical moment,

88
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.500
but as in fact a code made up of other people's language and other words that it

89
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:16.100
is language in circulation,

90
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.550
not just language as somehow abstractly outside of networks of circulation

91
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.800
available for use.

92
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.610
So we begin now to think of language still and the relationship between language

93
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:32.414
and speech,

94
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.690
but now it's not a language abstracted from reality.

95
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:42.770
It's a language which precisely circulates within reality.

96
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:43.250
Uh,

97
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:48.250
and as a matter of social exchange and social interaction language is now and

98
00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:55.190
hence forth on our syllabus,
a social institution.

99
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.210
It has the same in literary theory.

100
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:03.950
It has the same determinitive relationship with my individual speech.

101
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.010
I mean,
we now begin to understand,
uh,

102
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:12.070
the claim that I don't speak my own language in a different register,

103
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.490
Heather too.
It's been,
well language is there before me.

104
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:20.210
What I speak is just sort of that which I borrowed from it.

105
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.010
But now,
uh,
this takes on a new valence.
They altogether,

106
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.830
but I don't speak my language.

107
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.450
It's other people's language.
My voice,

108
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.760
the word voice is obviously is obviously under heavy pressure here.

109
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.790
Even though nobody says it goes away.

110
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.300
My voice is a voice permeated by all the sedimentation registers,

111
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.630
levels,

112
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.950
orientations of language in the world that surrounds me.

113
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:59.480
I take my language,
in other words from other people,
I stand here,

114
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.820
uh,
uh,
for my sins,

115
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.300
a lecturing in a kind of an ad Lib way.
Uh,

116
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.770
and that makes it even more pronounced in what I say.
Uh,

117
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.730
you're hearing the Internet,
you're hearing newspaper headlines,

118
00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:15.230
you're hearing slang,

119
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:20.350
you're hearing all sorts of low qeustions and rhetorical devices that it would,

120
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.660
that I'd be ashamed to call my,
uh,

121
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.490
it at least in many cases because they are in the world.

122
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.070
They're out there as we'd say.

123
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.220
And what's out there gets to the point where it's in here and the next thing you

124
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:36.830
know,

125
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.830
it becomes part of the ongoing pattern or blather of an individual.

126
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.090
It is,
in other words,

127
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:49.180
the speech of others that you're hearing when you hear and individual the extent

128
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.180
or the degree to it's,

129
00:08:53.181 --> 00:08:58.181
this might be the case is I suppose always subject to debate to debate.

130
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.240
We're going to,
we're going to take up a couple of examples but in any sense,
but,

131
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:04.380
but,
but in any case,

132
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:09.381
you can see that that without the structure of the relationship between language

133
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:13.590
and speech having really changed and in fact it won't really change as we,

134
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:18.120
as we continue along without the structure of the relationship between language

135
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:18.720
and speech.

136
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.520
Having changed the nature of this relationship and the way in which we think of

137
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:26.700
it in social terms,
uh,
is changed.

138
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.050
And the social aspect of it now comes into prominence and,

139
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.730
and will remain there now in,
in order to see how this works.

140
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:39.940
In the case of our,
of today's two authors a little more concretely,
um,

141
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:45.200
I wanted to turn a two to a couple of passages on your sheet.

142
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.010
You got my grim warning last night that if that if you didn't bring it,

143
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.830
I wouldn't have any to circulate.
Uh,

144
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.000
we'll see how well that worked and if it didn't work well,

145
00:09:57.001 --> 00:10:01.590
perhaps it will work better in the future.
In any case,
um,
first of all,

146
00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:06.180
turning to the first passage on the sheet by Bach teen,
um,

147
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.180
by the way,
if you don't have,
if you don't have the sheet,

148
00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:14.040
maybe somebody near you does a,
or maybe somebody near you has a computer,

149
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.890
uh,
which is being used for the correct purposes,

150
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.190
that can be that,
that,
that,
that,

151
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.960
that can be held somehow between the two of you.
Uh,
these are all possibilities.

152
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.750
Uh,
the,
the,
the,
the first,
the first passage on the sheet,
um,

153
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.210
by buck teen,
uh,

154
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.240
is about the relationship between what he takes to be a formalist understanding

155
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.170
of double voice sadness.
Uh,
whether I mean,
for example,

156
00:10:43.171 --> 00:10:47.610
the new critical understanding which he,
which he is not directly talking about,

157
00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:52.620
but which we could use as an example of irony that the ways of talking about not

158
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:56.370
meaning what you say.
Uh,

159
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:01.490
and he's talking about those sorts of double voice sadness in relationship to

160
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.860
our,
in contradistinction to,
uh,

161
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.880
what he means by genuine Heteroglossia.

162
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.321
And he says,

163
00:11:10.321 --> 00:11:15.321
first passage on the sheet rhetoric is often limited to purely verbal victories

164
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.970
over the word,
over ideological authority.
In other words,

165
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.710
uh,
I'm,
I'm sort of getting under your ribs,
uh,

166
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.590
uh,
if you're somehow or another,
um,

167
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.760
voicing a and authoritative or widespread or tyrannical opinion,

168
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:39.540
uh,
by some form or another of subverting it.

169
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:40.411
In other words,

170
00:11:40.411 --> 00:11:45.411
a kind of a binary relationship between what I'm saying and what's commonly

171
00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:50.130
being said out there.
When this happens,

172
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.200
when this happens,

173
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:57.160
it says buck dean rhetoric degenerates into formalistic verbal play,

174
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.810
but we repeat.
When discourse is torn from reality,

175
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:06.400
it is fatal for the word itself as well.
Words growth,

176
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:10.090
sickly,
loose,
sematic depth and flexibility.

177
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:15.270
The capacity to expand and renew their meanings in new living contexts,

178
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:21.300
they essentially die as discourse for the signifying word lives beyond itself.

179
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:27.310
That is,
it lives by directing gets purposiveness outward,

180
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.400
double voice sadness,
which is merely verbal,

181
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.750
is not structured on authentic Heteroglossia,

182
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.650
but on a mirror diversity of voices.
In other words,

183
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:43.651
it doesn't take into account the way in which there is a seepage or

184
00:12:43.751 --> 00:12:48.751
permeabilities among the possibilities and registers of meaning depending on

185
00:12:50.231 --> 00:12:53.350
extraordinarily complex,
uh,

186
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:58.380
speaking communities coming together in any aspect of discourse,

187
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:05.620
ways in which we have to think about the life world of a discourse in order to

188
00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:11.500
understand the play of voice.
Heteroglossia,
you know,

189
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.420
is the language of others.

190
00:13:13.421 --> 00:13:18.421
That's what it means in order to understand the way in which the language of

191
00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:23.590
others is playing through and permeating the text.
Um,

192
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.430
and so,
uh,
then,
uh,
the,
uh,

193
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.690
comparable response response to formalism on the part of hunts.

194
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.760
Robert House,
I should say,

195
00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:38.761
in passing that both Bactine and eos have authentic and close relations with the

196
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:42.690
Russian formalists Bactine,
uh,

197
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.500
begins in a way at the very end of the formalist tradition as a kind of second

198
00:13:47.501 --> 00:13:51.730
generation formalists but quickly moves away,
uh,

199
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:56.680
which is breaking up in the late 1920s quickly moves away from that and begins

200
00:13:56.681 --> 00:14:01.300
to write a kind of and begins to rewrite formalism in a certain sense,

201
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.980
uh,
as,
um,

202
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:08.130
a a socio genesis of discourse and our language.

203
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.360
Uh,
and by the same token,
yes,
uh,
in his theory of literary history,

204
00:14:13.361 --> 00:14:17.490
which is not a enunciated in these terms in,
uh,

205
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.220
these people,
which is,

206
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:27.190
which is not enunciated in these terms in,
um,
in,

207
00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:32.170
uh,
the texts that you have,
but rather in the long text,
uh,
which,

208
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.370
which I,
in a way,

209
00:14:33.371 --> 00:14:37.330
I wish your editor had taken from which I wish your editor had taken an excerpt

210
00:14:37.331 --> 00:14:38.260
called,
uh,

211
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:43.410
literary hisco literary history as a provocation to a literary theory.

212
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.060
You have,
you have excerpts from that on,
on your sheet.
Um,

213
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.930
in any case,
in,
in,

214
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:54.630
in Yassas understanding of the relationship,
um,

215
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.930
between,
um,
between the text and the life world.

216
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.910
Um,
I've completely lost my,
my place and my sense of what I'm doing.
Oh,

217
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:09.220
yes.
I'm talking about the Russian formalists.
I,
I'm,

218
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.700
I'm talking about the Russian formalists,
um,
uh,
yes.

219
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.340
Cobbles together as it were,

220
00:15:16.341 --> 00:15:20.090
aspects of Russian formalists historiography,

221
00:15:20.091 --> 00:15:24.680
particularly that of Yacob San Antonian off,
um,
and Maher,

222
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:29.600
a Marxist understanding of,
as it were,
the,
uh,

223
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.211
the,
the,

224
00:15:30.211 --> 00:15:35.211
the marketing and reception and consumption of literary production.

225
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.890
Uh,
and,
uh,

226
00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:41.891
and these and these pairs of ideas go together in his developing of his thesis

227
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:46.570
about literary reception to which we'll return at the end of the lecture in a,

228
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.700
in other words,
the,
uh,
the second passage on the sheet,

229
00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:53.110
which distances him with in witchy.

230
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:57.690
He wants to distance themselves somewhat from both of these influences.
Uh,

231
00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.760
it goes as follows,

232
00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:04.180
early Marxist and formalist methods in common conceived the literary fact within

233
00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:09.200
the closed circle of an aesthetics of production and representation.

234
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:13.760
In doing so,
they deprive literature of a dimension that in alien,

235
00:16:13.761 --> 00:16:18.410
ugly belongs to its aesthetic character as well as to its social function,

236
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.550
the dimension of its reception and influence.
In other words,

237
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:27.200
the way in which a text,
once it exists,
moves in the world.

238
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.760
The way in which it presents changes as we understand it,
uh,

239
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.660
and grows or diminishes,
uh,

240
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:38.570
as time passes in the world.
This is the medium,

241
00:16:38.571 --> 00:16:43.480
the social medium in which your wants to understand,
uh,
uh,

242
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.320
literary intern precisely literary interpretation as we'll see coming a little

243
00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:52.850
closer to this issue of the relationship between thinking of this kind,
uh,

244
00:16:52.851 --> 00:16:56.930
and formalists a formalist traditions in Bactine.

245
00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:02.060
Uh,
on page five 92,
the lefthand column,
uh,
toward the bottom,

246
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:05.020
I'm not going to quote this,
I'm just going to say that it's there.
Uh,

247
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.460
Bactine begins a sentence,
uh,

248
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:12.461
about as he puts it literary parody understood in the narrow sense.

249
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.240
Now what he's implying here is that the theory of parody belongs primarily to

250
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.930
Russian formalists literary historiography.
In other words,

251
00:17:23.931 --> 00:17:28.931
the relationship between a new tax than an old text is one of broadly conceived

252
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:33.680
within this discourse parody.
Um,
and so,
uh,

253
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.800
mark team picks up the word a parody in order to say also on page five,

254
00:17:39.741 --> 00:17:40.670
92

255
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.880
also to say on page five,
92,
uh,
the lefthand column,

256
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.013
um,

257
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:58.180
but halfway down Amir concern for language is,

258
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.270
and that's an odd thing to say American are for lifers.

259
00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:06.690
Americans aren't for language is but the abstract side of the concrete and

260
00:18:06.691 --> 00:18:07.380
active.

261
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:12.380
I eat dialogic Lee and gauged understanding of the Living Heteroglossia that has

262
00:18:14.731 --> 00:18:19.500
been introduced into the novel and artistically organized within it.

263
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.020
In other words,
parody.
If we,

264
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.290
if we linger merely on that literary,

265
00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:27.780
on the literariness of parody,

266
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:33.050
we simply don't have any grasp of the complexity of ways of the ways in which,

267
00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:38.910
uh,
the dialogic,
uh,
or the header or gloss will,
uh,

268
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.770
uh,
modulates,
uh,

269
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.920
and ripples and makes complicated the surface of literary discourse.

270
00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:51.180
Parody once again leaves us with a sense of the Byron of the binary.
The,

271
00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:53.680
for the previous text was this,
uh,

272
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:58.790
the secondary texts or the lake or the next text rifts off that previous text in

273
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.890
a way that we can call parotic.
Uh,
but that's binary.
That's just,

274
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.920
it's one text against another and leaves out the whole question of those,

275
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.700
of that flood or multiplicity of voices,
uh,
which,

276
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:19.560
which pervades the text.
Okay.
Now,
um,
and so then,

277
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:23.960
uh,
Yo [inaudible] has an interesting moment again back on your sheet,
uh,

278
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.550
in which he is the fourth passage on your sheet in which he is,
uh,

279
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:32.680
obviously directly responding to that passage.
Uh,

280
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.600
at the end of 10 yanos essay on literary evolution,

281
00:19:36.601 --> 00:19:39.780
which we've had on the board and which we've discussed before,

282
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.330
you remember to neon off,

283
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:46.340
makes the distinction between evolution the way in which a sequence of texts,

284
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.880
uh,
mutates as one might say,
the way in which,
in other words,

285
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:56.030
a successive texts again parody or alter a what was in the previous text and

286
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.710
modification,
which is the influence,
uh,

287
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:07.910
on texts from the outside by other sorts of historical factors,

288
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.490
which may lead to textual change.

289
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:16.410
And 10 Yanoff says that it's important,
uh,
actually for both studies,

290
00:20:16.411 --> 00:20:19.890
for the study of history and also for the study of literary history,

291
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.490
that the to be always kept clearly distinct,
um,

292
00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:29.480
in the mind of,
of the person looking at them.
Well,
yes,

293
00:20:29.481 --> 00:20:32.370
his response to that is perhaps chiefly rhetorical,

294
00:20:32.371 --> 00:20:37.290
but it nevertheless once does mark the shift in the direction of the

295
00:20:37.291 --> 00:20:41.820
understanding of language as social that I've been wanting to begin by

296
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:46.910
emphasizing y'all says the connection between literary evolution,

297
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.730
social change,

298
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:53.850
that is to say those features in society that would and do modify texts.

299
00:20:55.210 --> 00:21:00.210
The connection between literary evolution and social change does not vanish from

300
00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:03.940
the face of the earth through its mirror negation.
What is he saying?

301
00:21:03.941 --> 00:21:07.630
He's saying does not vanish from the face of the earth because 10 yards,

302
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.420
10 Jano said it did.
I mean this,
there is no doubt that,
that,

303
00:21:12.421 --> 00:21:14.650
that that's the passage.
Yeah.

304
00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:19.810
This is talking about the new literary work he goes on is received and judged

305
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:25.050
against the background of the everyday experience of life.

306
00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:28.900
In other words,
the work exists in a life world.

307
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:34.080
There is no easy or possible way of distinguishing between its formal

308
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:40.921
innovations and those sorts of innovations which are produced by continuous and

309
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:46.210
ongoing factors of social chains.
They interact,
uh,

310
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:51.270
they seep into one another in exactly the same way that all the registers and

311
00:21:52.631 --> 00:21:56.170
sedimentation of human voices,
uh,
uh,

312
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.800
interact and seep into one another in Bach teens.

313
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.630
Heteroglossia all right,

314
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:06.631
so these then are the emphases of both of these writers with respect to

315
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.440
formalists ideas,
which I've played a prominent part in most,

316
00:22:11.441 --> 00:22:13.730
if not all of the,
uh,

317
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.860
literary theory that we have studied that we've studied up until now.

318
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:23.440
All right,
now I'd like to linger a little while with [inaudible],
uh,
and then,

319
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:28.170
uh,
but before turning back to yes,
now Heteroglossia uh,

320
00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:33.160
or diversity of speech as he calls it.
Sometimes he says at one point,

321
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:37.960
again,
on page five,
92,
uh,
toward the top of the left hand column,

322
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.230
Heteroglossia is what he calls the ground of style.
And I want to,

323
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:48.390
and I want to pause to ask a little bit,
what do you mean by this expression?

324
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.880
The ground of style,
the,
the italicized passage.

325
00:22:51.881 --> 00:22:56.881
It is precisely the diversity of speech and not the unity of a normative shared

326
00:22:57.221 --> 00:23:02.190
language that is the ground of style.
In other words,
I don't,
when I spin,

327
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.730
and I've already said,
of course when I speak,
I'm not speaking to you in a,

328
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:10.810
in an official voice,
I'm not speaking,
uh,
the king's English.

329
00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.140
Uh,
in fact,
um,
on this view,

330
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.420
there's really no such thing as the king's English.

331
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.600
Nobody speaks the king's English because there is no such,

332
00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:24.690
no such isolated distilled entity that one can point to a language,

333
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.950
at least the language of most of us.
Uh,

334
00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:34.951
that is to say of everyone except people in hermetically sealed environments

335
00:23:36.761 --> 00:23:41.120
like for example,
um,
a peculiarly privileged,
uh,

336
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.180
inward looking aristocracy.

337
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:48.390
The language of virtually all of us is the language of the people,

338
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.440
the language of others.

339
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:55.960
And it is that which we have to continue to think about.
Um,

340
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.330
as we,
as,

341
00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:01.130
as we consider how a style is generated,

342
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:06.131
we speak of a style as though it were a question of purely a question of an

343
00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:09.620
authorial signature.

344
00:24:09.621 --> 00:24:14.000
Sometimes when we think of style and signature as synonymous,
oh,

345
00:24:14.001 --> 00:24:16.550
I would recognize that style anywhere.

346
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.820
Kolrud set of words worth of a few lines of Wordsworth.

347
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.810
If I'd come across these lines in the desert,
I'd have said Wordsworth,

348
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.360
well obviously there's a certain sense,

349
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:30.110
there's a certain sense in which we do recognize the style.
For example,

350
00:24:30.111 --> 00:24:31.610
the style of Jane Austin,

351
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:36.700
I suppose arguably you could think that this is the style of Dr. Johnson,

352
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.390
but most people would recognize it as the style of Jane Austen.

353
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.880
And yet at the same time as we'll see in a minute,
uh,

354
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.700
it is a style made up in ways that are very difficult finally to factor out and

355
00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:54.680
analyze of many voices.
Um,
okay.
So,

356
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:58.230
so,
um,
this would suggest,
I think,
uh,

357
00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:03.370
this idea of a style as a composite of speech segmentations,

358
00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:09.460
this idea would suggest that possibly there isn't a voice that to speak of an

359
00:25:09.891 --> 00:25:14.210
authorial voice would be a very difficult matter.
Um,

360
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.880
and in fact,
and might lead us to ask,

361
00:25:16.881 --> 00:25:21.881
does this move the idea that the socio elect speaks through the video lack the

362
00:25:22.431 --> 00:25:27.431
idea that the idea that the language of everyone is in fact the language that

363
00:25:27.891 --> 00:25:31.550
speaks my speech,
my PR,
my peculiar,
uh,

364
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:33.620
individual speech.
Um,

365
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:38.690
does this once again bring us face to face with that dreary topic,

366
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.950
the death of the officer.
Uh,
I don't think so.
Not Quite,

367
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.600
certainly not inbox teen.
Um,

368
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:50.710
who gives us a rather bracing sense of the importance of the author in a passage

369
00:25:51.321 --> 00:25:54.290
on page five 93,
the right hand column,

370
00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.580
he says it is as if the author,
uh,

371
00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:01.850
this is of course sort of coming face to face with the problem of whether there

372
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:02.960
still is an author.

373
00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:07.370
He says it is as if the author has no language of his own,

374
00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.130
but does possess his own style,

375
00:26:10.131 --> 00:26:15.131
his own organic and unitary law governing the way he plays with languages.

376
00:26:15.501 --> 00:26:19.340
So style is perhaps a Pq,

377
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:24.400
the eight ones particulare way of mediating and allocating the diversity of

378
00:26:26.361 --> 00:26:30.110
voice.
That impinges on what one's saying.
Uh,

379
00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:34.910
and the way his own real sematic and expressive intentions are refracted within

380
00:26:34.911 --> 00:26:39.911
them and hear Bach Teen Saves or preserves the author by invoking the principle

381
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:47.930
of unifying intention and the way in which we can recognize it in the discourse

382
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.420
of any given novel.
Of course,

383
00:26:51.421 --> 00:26:56.190
he goes on this play with languages and frequently the complete absence of a

384
00:26:56.191 --> 00:27:01.191
direct discourse of his own and no sense degrades the general deep seated

385
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.240
intentionality,

386
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:08.540
the overarching ideological conceptualization of the work as a whole.

387
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.050
So this is not a,
though it may seem to be in certain respects,

388
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:18.380
a question of the death of the author as provoked by let's say Fuko or roll on,

389
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:24.860
barked at at the beginning of the semester.
So it's not that,
um,

390
00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.850
exactly
all of it.
All,

391
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:33.120
everything that we've been saying so far can be seen to work in a variety of

392
00:27:33.121 --> 00:27:36.900
novels.
The novel is the privilege,
John Rhe for Bactine.
He,

393
00:27:36.901 --> 00:27:41.010
I think perhaps somewhat oversimplifying.
And this,
uh,

394
00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.160
reads the novel,
the emergence of the novel,

395
00:27:44.161 --> 00:27:48.840
the flowering and richness of the novel against the backdrop of Genres he

396
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:53.290
considers to be Mano Glassell,
uh,
the epic,
uh,

397
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:58.110
which simply speaks the unitary voice of an aristocratic tradition,

398
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:03.320
the lyric which simply speaks to the unitary voice of the sort of isolated

399
00:28:03.661 --> 00:28:05.110
romantic,
solid cyst.

400
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:10.850
And over against that and over against that you get the poly gloss will rich,

401
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.900
uh,
multiple multiplicity of voice in the novel.
As I say,

402
00:28:15.901 --> 00:28:16.734
I think that this,

403
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.730
I think that the generic contest is somewhat oversimplified because nothing is

404
00:28:20.731 --> 00:28:25.640
easier and more profitable than to read both epic and lyric,
uh,

405
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:30.420
as,
uh,
as manifestations of Heteroglossia it.
Just think of the Iliad.

406
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:34.020
What are you going to do if you really believe that it's gonna Gloss will with

407
00:28:34.021 --> 00:28:38.120
the speeches of their sites?
Well,
you know,
okay.
Um,
in,
uh,

408
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:42.270
in any case,
the basic idea,
however,
um,

409
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.750
is I think extraordinarily rich and important.

410
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.770
And I thought we could try it out by,
uh,

411
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:53.010
taking a look for a moment at the first sentence of pride and prejudice,

412
00:28:53.011 --> 00:28:57.750
which I'm sure most of you know.
Um,
and is plainly a,

413
00:28:57.751 --> 00:29:01.600
an example of the relationship between what,
uh,

414
00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:06.330
what Bactine calls common language.
It is a truth universally acknowledged.

415
00:29:06.331 --> 00:29:10.180
In other words,
it's,
it's,
it's in everybody's mouth,
you know,
uh,

416
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:15.350
plainly a result of the relationship between common language and something like

417
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:21.350
authorial reflection or what he elsewhere calls internally persuasive discourse.

418
00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:24.900
Uh,
now in traditional parlance,

419
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.230
this would be a speech which manifests irony,

420
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.380
the rhetoric of irony against which,
uh,

421
00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:36.420
Bactine sets himself in the first passage on your sheet.
Um,
I mean,

422
00:29:36.421 --> 00:29:38.390
how ridiculous that,
uh,

423
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:42.900
we'd say a Jane Austin doesn't believe this.
Um,

424
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.350
this is drawing room wisdom.
Um,

425
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:51.250
and everything in the sentence points to the ways in which it's obviously wrong,

426
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.670
even while it's being called a truth universally,

427
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.540
meaning the thousand people or so who matter.

428
00:29:59.260 --> 00:29:59.821
In other words,

429
00:29:59.821 --> 00:30:04.660
there are great many people who neither acknowledge nor care about any such

430
00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:08.020
thing.
Um,
that,
uh,
that,
um,

431
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:13.080
and then of course the idea that I'm a single man in possession of a good

432
00:30:13.961 --> 00:30:18.090
fortune or indeed otherwise,
uh,
has nothing to do,
um,

433
00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:23.110
but um,
but be in want of a wife.
Uh,
and that,
um,

434
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.900
and so obviously,
um,
this is,

435
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:30.610
this is what is being said by not the man in the street,
um,

436
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:35.440
but by a drawing room culture.
Now,

437
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:38.640
even before we turn to the ways in which,
uh,
the,
the,

438
00:30:38.641 --> 00:30:42.340
the complication of the ways in which the sentence is being undermined.

439
00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:47.620
A bear in mind that the plot of the novel confirms the truth.

440
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.450
In other words,
Darcy and Bingley,

441
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:57.480
both of them in possession of a good fortune do turn out very plainly to have

442
00:30:57.911 --> 00:31:02.020
been in want of a wife and in fact procure one,
uh,

443
00:31:02.021 --> 00:31:03.070
by the end of the novel.

444
00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:07.870
That is precisely what the plot is about so that the conventions governing the

445
00:31:07.871 --> 00:31:12.871
plot of pride and prejudice altogether confirm the truth that is in,

446
00:31:14.051 --> 00:31:16.420
not that he's eating outs in this sentence,

447
00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:20.140
even though it is a truth that is plainly to be viewed.
Ironically,

448
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.940
that in itself is,
is,
is quite extraordinary and I think reinforces our sense,

449
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.870
uh,
that this is one of the great,
uh,
first sentences,
uh,

450
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.880
in the history of fiction.
But,

451
00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:34.720
but now I'm turning to the way in which we can think of it as something other

452
00:31:34.721 --> 00:31:38.260
than a simple irony.
Of course,

453
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.000
there's this word want,

454
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:44.050
we've been thinking a lot about want lately because we've just gone through,
uh,

455
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:48.940
our psychoanalytic phase.
What exactly does this single,
what,

456
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:53.890
what is this?
What is this single man really want?
You know,

457
00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.770
I mean,
in a way,
in a way,
the,
the,
the,

458
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.320
the subtle pun in the word want,

459
00:31:59.321 --> 00:32:04.030
which means both to desire and to lack,
you know,
if I lack something,

460
00:32:04.031 --> 00:32:07.690
I don't necessarily desire it.
I just don't happen to have it.
Right.

461
00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:12.720
But on the other hand,
if I want something,
I can also be said to desire it.
Um,

462
00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.960
well why?
Well,
which is it?
Which is it,
uh,
is it,
uh,

463
00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:21.820
a kind of lack that social pressure of some sort?

464
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:26.890
Uh,
is,
is,
is calculated to fill or is it desire?

465
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.790
And if it's desire,
what on earth does it have to do with the good fortune?

466
00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.910
I mean,
the,
the,
the,
the,
there are elements of the romance plot,

467
00:32:33.911 --> 00:32:38.800
which raised precisely that question.
You know,
that desire has nothing to do,

468
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:43.730
um,
with fortune,
a convenience,
social acceptability,
comfort.

469
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:47.030
All of those things have to do with fortune,
but desire,

470
00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:52.031
we suppose having passed through our a psychoanalytic phase to be of a somewhat

471
00:32:52.431 --> 00:32:53.300
different nature.

472
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:58.630
And so the complication of the sentence has to do actually with the question of

473
00:32:59.451 --> 00:33:00.560
the way in which these,

474
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:05.480
the meanings of these words can be thought to be circulating and to create

475
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:10.160
ripples of irony of their own far more complicated than,

476
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.980
Oh,
you know,
the is much smarter than that.

477
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
So he doesn't mean that which is already a complication and produced by the fact

478
00:33:18.681 --> 00:33:20.090
that her plot bears it out.

479
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.790
How can her plot bear it out if she's being so ironic?
You know?
And,

480
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.230
and of course there's,
there's obviously,
um,
the,

481
00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:32.090
there's obviously a good deal more to say,
uh,
the,

482
00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.830
um,
um,
the,
uh,
single man in possession of a good fortune.
Uh,
uh,

483
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.890
obviously mate,
not at all want a wife,
um,

484
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:43.610
for a variety of reasons that one could mention and that can't be possibly

485
00:33:43.611 --> 00:33:48.410
completely absent from Jane Austen's mind.
Uh,
and so,
you know,

486
00:33:48.411 --> 00:33:52.570
that has to be taken to account,
uh,
uh,
in itself.
And certainly,

487
00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:57.830
and certainly it does.
MCKAYLA,
you have,
you have darkened us.

488
00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:02.130
Uh,
uh,

489
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:08.630
oh,
that's okay.
I think it's this one.
Uh,
well,

490
00:34:08.631 --> 00:34:09.980
we may have to remain dark.

491
00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:14.300
I don't want to take up too much time with it anymore.
Okay.
Okay.

492
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:19.270
Um,
yeah,
this is,
this is,
this is all right.
This is all right.
It,

493
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:24.020
it,
it puts the sentence in a whole new perspective.
So Brett,
Brett,
Brett,

494
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:27.990
perhaps I'll stop there.
Um,
but I think,
but I think you'll see it's the sauce.

495
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:32.750
It's the side of the second sentence.
The bears reflection.
Uh,
oh,
by the ways,

496
00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:37.820
if I still visible,
uh,
that bears reflection,
um,

497
00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:42.400
uh,
beyond,
you know,
I kind of simple binary of,
uh,

498
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.410
the sentence is spoken by,
um,

499
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:50.420
by the man and the drawing room,
the,
or a woman in the drawing room.

500
00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.200
It's a,
it's idiotic.
It's obviously wrong,

501
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:59.710
we'd simply can't say that the style of the author is a style that is segmented

502
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.420
by and through,
uh,

503
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.090
complexities of circulated.

504
00:35:08.091 --> 00:35:13.091
Meaning that really can't be limited by any sense of one to one relation of that

505
00:35:14.631 --> 00:35:15.464
kind.

506
00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.720
She didn't touch any,
she didn't touch any of those,

507
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.273
<v 1>Huh?</v>

508
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.220
<v 0>I've just made a darker.</v>

509
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:29.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

510
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:45.090
<v 0>All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.</v>

511
00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.700
All right.
So yes.
All right.
Um,

512
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.570
what else about Bach teen?
One more thing.
Um,

513
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.270
his idea of common language.
This is a,

514
00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:04.290
this is not a concept that is supposed to have any particular,

515
00:36:04.291 --> 00:36:08.040
any one particular value attached to it.
It's a little bit like,

516
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:12.720
like the rhizome.
Uh,
it could,
it could be good.
It could be bad.

517
00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.700
Common language could be a kind of robber Layson,

518
00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:20.340
carnivalesque subversive,
energetic,

519
00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.810
a body of voices from below,
uh,

520
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:28.680
overturning the apple carts of authority.
Uh,
and,
and,

521
00:36:28.681 --> 00:36:29.100
and,

522
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.810
and the fixed ways of a Maura been social order could be that,

523
00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:38.640
uh,
but at the same time it could itself be the authoritative,

524
00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.080
the reactionary,

525
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:45.200
the mindless common language would be that universality of acknowledgement,

526
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.170
which seems to go along with,
um,

527
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:54.350
unreflected knee jerk responses to what one observes and thinks about common

528
00:36:56.461 --> 00:36:58.620
language has that whole range.

529
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:03.740
The important thing about it is that it's out there and that it circulates and

530
00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:10.130
it re edited exists in relationship with what buck teen calls internally

531
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.190
persuasive discourse.
In other words,

532
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:19.191
the way in which the filtering together of these various sorts of language,

533
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:27.330
uh,
result in something like what we feel to be authentic.

534
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.110
I power of reflection,
uh,
a,

535
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:36.010
a posing of relation among the variety,
the,

536
00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:39.750
the various strata of language.
Um,
so that's,

537
00:37:39.751 --> 00:37:42.690
that they can speak authentically,

538
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.750
not necessarily in a way that we agree with,

539
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:51.320
but in a way that we recognize to constitute that distilled the consciousness

540
00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:57.620
that we still do call the author and to which we'll describe in some sense,

541
00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:02.000
um,
authority we feel,
um,

542
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:06.420
precisely in the a peculiar,
uh,

543
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:11.400
self mocking relationship between this sentence of bride and prejudice and the

544
00:38:11.401 --> 00:38:13.920
plot of pride and prejudice as a whole.

545
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:18.750
We feel something like the internal persuasiveness,

546
00:38:18.751 --> 00:38:23.300
the coherence of the discourse.
Um,
and um,

547
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.340
I think maybe just to,
just to sum up buck dean,

548
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:29.310
I want to quote you from the other,
uh,

549
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.360
long excerpt that you have in your ontology,

550
00:38:33.361 --> 00:38:37.090
which I would encourage you to read sometimes.
I have asked people to read it,

551
00:38:37.091 --> 00:38:40.450
but I decided to drop it this year,
but it's still a very strong,
uh,

552
00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:43.090
an interesting argument.
It's called discourse in the novel.

553
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:46.870
And I just want to read and the left hand column there,

554
00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:49.730
the bar near the bottom of the column,
the ID,

555
00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:54.770
the ideological becoming of a human being in this view is the process of

556
00:38:55.151 --> 00:38:58.600
selectively assimilating the words of others.

557
00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:03.740
Now there's the coherence of my mind of what I say insofar as it exists,

558
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:07.240
as the result of selecting out,

559
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:12.390
of selecting among in my assimilation of the words of others such that there is

560
00:39:14.171 --> 00:39:18.820
a pattern of again,
coherence.
Uh,
all right,

561
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:24.060
so finally the novel is the social text far acts a loss for buck teen for these

562
00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:25.600
reasons.

563
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:30.600
And it confirms again what we've been saying about a new way of thinking of

564
00:39:30.821 --> 00:39:35.821
language language as that which speaks us is not just language,

565
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:42.820
it's other people's language.
And we need to understand,

566
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:43.540
uh,

567
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:48.540
the experience of the process of reading and of texts as they exist and the

568
00:39:50.081 --> 00:39:55.081
nature of authorial comp composition as a at and it's simulated selective way of

569
00:39:58.841 --> 00:40:02.980
putting together other people's language.
All right?

570
00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:07.450
Now quickly,
yes,
he takes us back obviously,

571
00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:11.980
uh,
by wave eser.
Uh,
I think you can see that,

572
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:12.820
uh,

573
00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:17.590
that Yassas talk about horizons of expectation.
Uh,

574
00:40:17.591 --> 00:40:22.120
the disruption of expectation has a great deal to do with ease.

575
00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:26.440
There's understanding of the role of the reader in filling imaginative gaps that

576
00:40:26.441 --> 00:40:28.960
are left in the text,
uh,
that,
uh,

577
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:33.610
which are based on a complex relationship with a set of conventional

578
00:40:33.611 --> 00:40:38.560
expectations by way of Eser to Goddamn.
Because after all,
uh,

579
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:42.760
what y'alls has to say,
uh,
as a way of talking about God,
Hammers,

580
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:46.480
merger of horizons.
But for [inaudible],

581
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:50.680
it's not just my horizon and the horizon of the text.

582
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:55.800
It's not just those two horizons that need to meet halfway on common ground,

583
00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.400
uh,
as mutually illuminating.

584
00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:06.060
It is in fact a succession of horizons changing as,

585
00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:13.290
as modes of aesthetic and interpretive response to texts are mediated

586
00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:18.760
historically.
Uh,
as I say in a sequence,
uh,

587
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:22.180
it's not just the text was once a certain thing.

588
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.360
Now we feel it to be somehow different and in order to understand it,

589
00:41:27.731 --> 00:41:29.380
we need to meet it halfway.

590
00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:34.590
It's rather a matter of self consciously studying what has happened in between

591
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:36.980
that other time.

592
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:41.270
And this here and now the text has had a life,

593
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:46.300
it has passed through life changes and these life changes have to be understood

594
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:53.500
at each successive stage in terms of the three moments of hermaneutic grasp as

595
00:41:56.601 --> 00:41:58.810
described by God [inaudible],
uh,

596
00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:01.640
in the historical section of truth and method,

597
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:04.460
the distinction between into League era,
uh,

598
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:09.730
[inaudible] an athlete Carre understanding interpretation and application that

599
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:11.900
yells,

600
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:16.700
talks about at the beginning of his essay actually goes back to the 18th

601
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:20.300
century.
And what Y'alls has to say about it is yes,

602
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:25.390
these three moments of hermaneutic understanding exist for any reader or reading

603
00:42:26.721 --> 00:42:29.510
public at any moment,
uh,

604
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.630
in the history of the reception of a text,

605
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.880
he makes a considerable to do about distinguishing between the aesthetic

606
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:42.530
response to the text and a subsequent or,

607
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:47.390
or leisured reflectively interpretive response to the,

608
00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.393
to the text.

609
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.820
And this may seem a little confusing because he admits with Heidegger and others

610
00:42:52.821 --> 00:42:56.630
as,
as,
as,
as,
as we've,
as we've indicated ourselves in the past,

611
00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:01.530
that you can't just have a spontaneous,
uh,
uh,

612
00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:04.340
response to anything without reflection.

613
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:06.890
There's always a sense in which you already know what it is,

614
00:43:06.891 --> 00:43:09.560
which is to say a sense in which you've already interpreted it.

615
00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.510
But at the same time,
y'all,

616
00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.770
this makes a considerable point of distinguishing between these two moments,
the,

617
00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:20.560
the,
the,
the aesthetic which associates with understanding and the uh,

618
00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.400
uh,
and,
and,
and the interpretive,

619
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:26.290
which he associates with what is in the hermaneutic tradition called,
uh,

620
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:28.850
interpretation.
Now,
why does he do this?

621
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:32.420
It's a question of what he means by the aesthetic.

622
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:38.500
A text enters historical circulation and remains before the gaze of successive

623
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:47.050
audiences in history because it has been received aesthetically.

624
00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:54.310
Aesthetics is the glue that keeps the text alive through history.

625
00:43:54.591 --> 00:43:58.160
In other words,
people continue to say to one degree or another.

626
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:02.450
I like it if they don't say,
I like it.

627
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:06.950
There will never be a question of interpreting it or,

628
00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.340
or transmitting it historically because it's going to disappear.

629
00:44:10.341 --> 00:44:14.060
As Dr. Johnson said,
that book is good in vein,

630
00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:18.680
which the reader throws away.
In other words from the staff,
from the,

631
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:22.970
from the stand point of interpretation or from the standpoint of philosophical

632
00:44:22.971 --> 00:44:25.710
reflection or whatever you might wish to call it.
Um,

633
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:29.930
a book may be good just,
just incontestably good,

634
00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:34.380
but if it didn't,
please,
if it didn't give pleasure,

635
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:40.160
if it didn't sort of attach itself to a reading public aesthetically by means of

636
00:44:41.911 --> 00:44:46.911
pleasing none of what would succeed and then in the Hermeneutic,

637
00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:53.160
a process could ever take place.
So that's,
that's why,
uh,
uh,

638
00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:57.600
y'all make such a point of distinguishing between the aesthetic and the

639
00:44:57.601 --> 00:44:59.970
interpretive and that of course,
the,

640
00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:05.060
the historical study of reception is what shows us the degree to which any set

641
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.490
of,
uh,
moments of as of,

642
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:15.710
of aesthetic and interpretive reception is mediated by what has gone before it.

643
00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:17.041
In other words,

644
00:45:17.041 --> 00:45:22.041
a text gradually changes as a result of its reception.

645
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:23.970
And if we don't study it,

646
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:29.130
we're left naively supposing that it really hasn't,
that that time has passed,

647
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.830
that the past has become sort of remote from us.

648
00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:34.260
So we have certain problems interpreting,

649
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:38.220
but these problems haven't arisen from anything that could properly be called

650
00:45:38.221 --> 00:45:39.480
change.
Uh,

651
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:44.540
that there has been an unfolding process of successive interpretations whereby a

652
00:45:46.951 --> 00:45:51.030
text has gone through see changes.
It's become less popular,

653
00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:56.040
more popular,
more richly interpreted,
less richly interpreted,
uh,

654
00:45:56.070 --> 00:46:01.070
but tends to keep eddying out from what it was sense to be originally to the

655
00:46:02.821 --> 00:46:06.820
point where all sorts of,
of,
of,
uh,
creative,
uh,

656
00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:11.840
implications and sources of pleasure may arrive as we understand it in a certain

657
00:46:12.511 --> 00:46:16.560
sense.
Once again,
it's like Pierre men,
art author of Don Quixote,

658
00:46:16.561 --> 00:46:19.540
but now it's not just PR prepare,
uh,

659
00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.110
Menard and Miguel de Cervantes.
It says though,

660
00:46:22.111 --> 00:46:24.750
a succession of people perhaps writing,
you know,

661
00:46:24.751 --> 00:46:29.580
perhaps whose native language was not French necessarily,
but who knows,
German,

662
00:46:29.581 --> 00:46:34.440
Russian,
whatever.
Uh,
continuing to write in Spanish,
uh,
a text,

663
00:46:34.441 --> 00:46:36.960
which turns out to be word for word,
uh,

664
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:42.050
Don Quixote as the centuries past each one acquiring a whole new world of

665
00:46:44.521 --> 00:46:49.521
associations and implications and giving pleasure in successively new ways.

666
00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:55.500
And when we finally get to the point in the late 19th century,

667
00:46:55.501 --> 00:46:59.400
when we encounter this Frenchman Prm and are writing Don Quixote,

668
00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:04.050
the important thing would be to understand that lots of people have done it

669
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:08.040
between him and Cervantes.
This,
uh,
on this,

670
00:47:08.041 --> 00:47:13.041
this as a kind of skeletal model of how a reception history according to your

671
00:47:13.311 --> 00:47:15.120
house might work.

672
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:20.640
Now it's red at the history of reception studies,
two things.
Uh,
it's studies,

673
00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:24.000
uh,
changing horizons of expectation.
Uh,

674
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:27.030
and that's something you're familiar with,
uh,
from Eser.

675
00:47:27.031 --> 00:47:31.840
That is to say the way in which a read your has to come to terms with a

676
00:47:31.841 --> 00:47:36.841
convention surrounding expectation in any given text in order to be able to

677
00:47:37.091 --> 00:47:42.091
negotiate what's new and what's nearly merely culinary and the text.

678
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:46.870
Uh,
it involves changing horizons of expectations with dope,

679
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.840
which don't just change once in the here and now,

680
00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.630
but have changed successively through time.

681
00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:57.340
And it also involves changing semantic possibilities,

682
00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.080
uh,
or if you will,

683
00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.950
changing possibilities for and of significance.

684
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:07.960
What does the text mean for me now?
But understood,

685
00:48:07.961 --> 00:48:10.390
again,
not just as something that matters for me,

686
00:48:10.391 --> 00:48:15.391
but has successively mattered for successive generations of readers in between.

687
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:20.770
Just to take examples of how this might work in the here and now.

688
00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:26.050
There is just now on Broadway a revival of Damn Yankees,

689
00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:31.020
uh,
which is about a baseball player who sells his soul,
uh,

690
00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.000
in order to beat the Yankees.
Uh,

691
00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:37.630
and one can't help but think that the revival of interest in Dan Yankees has

692
00:48:37.631 --> 00:48:41.130
something to do with the steroid scandals,
uh,

693
00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:46.090
and the way in which so many baseball players do sell their souls in order to

694
00:48:46.091 --> 00:48:49.260
win and in order to have good careers.
Uh,

695
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:54.360
and it occurs to one that it is that it is in this sort of atmosphere of social

696
00:48:56.141 --> 00:48:57.910
and cultural center,
uh,

697
00:48:57.911 --> 00:49:01.240
that were suddenly interested in Damn Yankees again,

698
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:05.380
perhaps there will be a revival of Tony the tow truck,
uh,

699
00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:08.560
because in the economic downturn,
uh,

700
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:12.130
obviously to be rich or to be glamorous,
you know,

701
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:16.140
speedy or to be busy,
you know,
to be,
you know,
oh,
the,

702
00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:20.440
all of this becomes obsolete.
Um,
uh,
more or less irrelevant.

703
00:49:20.441 --> 00:49:24.730
And beside the point,
and what really matters is little guys helping each other,

704
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:28.990
you know,
and so,
uh,
uh,
and so Tony,
the tow truck could,

705
00:49:28.991 --> 00:49:31.210
can be revived today,
uh,

706
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:35.920
as a parable of the good life in the downturn.
Uh,

707
00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:40.840
and,
and so it will probably be read by everyone,
uh,

708
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:45.190
give,
it will give pleasure that will therefore be interpreted,
uh,

709
00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:49.360
and it will survive to live another day.
Historically,
uh,

710
00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:54.220
fulfilling the three moments of the study,
of the history of reception,

711
00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:59.200
uh,
required by,
yes.
All right.
So with that said,

712
00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:03.770
it's been a very interesting 50 minutes,
I think,
uh,
uh,
with that,

713
00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:06.910
with that said,
I hope you all have a good break,
uh,

714
00:50:06.911 --> 00:50:08.170
and we'll see you when you get back.
