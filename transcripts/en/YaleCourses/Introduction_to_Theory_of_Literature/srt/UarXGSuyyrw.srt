1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,500
Well,
postcolonial studies is a really,

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:09,501
by far the most varied and eclectic of
the identity fields that were passing in

3
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:14,790
review, uh, in this, in
this portion of the, uh,

4
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:19,620
of the course. Uh, uh, eclectic
really I've necessity of course,

5
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:24,150
because of the immense of the immense
variety of the materials are covered,

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,450
but also because of a swirling issues
and controversies within postcolonial

7
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:35,370
studies or Poco as it's
affectionately known, uh, which,

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,880
um, but which kind of pose
a number of questions, um,

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,080
from the side that, uh, that, that,

10
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:46,090
that keep things lively
to say the least. We, um,

11
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,500
are taking up only one strand,

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,450
a developmental strand in
postcolonial studies today, uh, uh,

13
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:58,980
kind of a progression from the
work of sight to the work of Baba,

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,010
which is relatively easily map simply
in terms simply in terms of the,

15
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:08,010
uh, of the intellectual
agendas of each of them.

16
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,730
But there's a great deal else going
on. And I, and I suppose I should,

17
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,790
I should just mention in passing a certain
topics that we won't be discussing,

18
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,080
uh, at least, uh, except
possibly in passing.

19
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,110
And that however you might
really be interested in
considering if you do have an

20
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:30,960
interest in this field. Um, the first,

21
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,100
the first issue of course
is who says post colonial.

22
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,290
That is who says that we're
necessarily out of colonialism.

23
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:45,291
Just because the local viceroy packs up
and goes home doesn't necessarily mean

24
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,670
that things change all that significantly
in the so called postcolonial setting.

25
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,310
Uh,
and it needs to be taken into account,

26
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:58,311
seriously considered whether or not
one isn't still in colonial or colonial

27
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,530
studies.
Uh,

28
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:06,210
and that the moniker postcolonial
postcolonial might therefore be

29
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,170
inappropriately applied.
There's also,

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,330
there's also the question,
uh,

31
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:16,530
that arises in the study of
the so called Third World,

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,840
which is obviously in itself a
controversial term. You know,

33
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:24,841
it arises as that which is not
comprised as either of the great,

34
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,970
uh, sort of trajectories of the
superpowers during the Cold War. Uh,

35
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:34,800
there is no cold cold war,
at least allegedly no cold war any longer.

36
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,810
And so the question of the status,

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,730
nature and structure of the third
world is obviously wide open.

38
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,890
But the issue I mean to touch on in terms
of postcolonial studies is whether in

39
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:51,330
fact a crises, uh, and,

40
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:51,931
uh,

41
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:56,700
and concerns with respect to the
third world are necessarily always,

42
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,790
uh, to be understood in terms of
coloniality that, you know, I mean is,

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,120
is it just that,
uh,

44
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,150
certain parts of the globe have been
colonized that constitutes them as they

45
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:14,910
are, uh, and shapes their
identity. So Aden and in a,

46
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,180
in a very interesting way,

47
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:21,190
takes this up in trying to figure out
how it is that German orientalism so very

48
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:29,050
closely resembles French orientalism.

49
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,000
Even though the Germans had no
colonial interests in the Middle East.

50
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,630
Uh, they are, uh, they,
during the whole period,

51
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,820
early 19th century in particular,

52
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,970
when German orientalism is practically
indistinguishable from the French,

53
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,800
takes up the same concerns,
has the same interest.

54
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,950
How is it that the France are
undoubtedly in some sense insides view,

55
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:53,800
uh,

56
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,800
determined by their colonial interests
and the Germans who seems so much to

57
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:03,850
reflect a French attitudes
have no colonial interests,

58
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,140
at least in the Middle East.
Uh, and it's quite, you know,

59
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,760
sort of quite honestly tries to come to
terms with this. His answer is, well,

60
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,620
German, uh, orientalism is simply
derived in scholarly terms from French,

61
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,700
uh, or anilism. It has the
stamp of that thinking, uh,

62
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,700
and reflects that thinking.
And so there you are,

63
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,670
he could have said on the other hand,
however,

64
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,800
that a certain mindset toward
the third world, and this is,

65
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:36,040
and this is the point I've been
making about this particular issue,

66
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,250
dictates a certain way of structuring
one's thought about that world,

67
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,650
irrespective of whether or not there
are colonial interest involved.

68
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,820
And so that's, that's what I
mean by raising the question, uh,

69
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,440
is coloniality always at
issue in cases of this kind.

70
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,580
Finally, there's a kind of confusion, uh,

71
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:02,860
in thinking about these
things like confusion,

72
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:07,861
which is w which is a distilled in
the history of the British east India

73
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:12,520
company, which is both nationalists
and as it were globalizing,

74
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,170
but a confusion, uh, which comes
out more in more recent, uh,

75
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:21,460
the more recent history
of, um, of coloniality.

76
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,280
And that is, well, what
drives coloniality?

77
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,310
Is it always nationalism or as seems
increasingly the case in the modern world?

78
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,790
Is it trans national,
uh,

79
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:36,460
interests of glue in globalization?
Is it,

80
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,510
in other words,

81
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:42,511
is the relationship between the colonists
and the colonized a relation of ace of

82
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:49,351
some sort of metropolitan nation
with respect to a provincial empire?

83
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,410
Or is it a relation which is dictated and
generated by the economic interests of

84
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,330
globalization?
This is a complex subject,

85
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:04,210
which generates a great deal of debate in
the field, uh, that we take up today. Uh,

86
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,130
but, um, but in a way,
I mean, it's, it's, we,

87
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,050
we can't just say, well,
nationalism isn't important anymore.

88
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:15,170
Now it's globalization because actually,
um,

89
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,270
nationalism seems to have reappeared,
ah,

90
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,240
in the Bush foreign policy even possibly
to be continued in the Obama foreign

91
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:24,350
policy.
Uh,

92
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:29,150
and so there's a complex relationship
still between nationalism and

93
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,070
globalization, uh, that, uh, needs
to be considered and thought about.

94
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,510
If these, uh, social relations
are to be clearly understood.

95
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,580
And finally there is within
postcolonial studies,

96
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,750
especially among those, uh, who, uh,

97
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,730
represent,
uh,

98
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,000
the various are colonized
interest of the world.

99
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,860
There's the question to borrow an
expression from Gaietry speeback,

100
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,750
how should the subaltern speak?
And it has to do,

101
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,580
uh, most vividly with the very
question which language should the,

102
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,870
should the subaltern speak in Spi vacs?
Own question is,

103
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,430
can the subaltern speak at all?
Uh,

104
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,590
and Saeed raises that
question as you notice, uh,

105
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,410
during the course of his
analysis. Um, but the, but,

106
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,000
but the related issue is, okay,
suppose the subaltern can't speak, uh,

107
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:29,660
I suppose, um, in Googie
Wafi Django for example,

108
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,400
can write a novel what not,
what language should it be written in,

109
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:39,620
in Googie, uh, campaigned,
uh, in his more recent career,

110
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,600
um, not to write in English
and also to urge other,

111
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,460
uh, African writers to
write in a native languages,

112
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,230
uh, and not in the language
of the colonizer. Uh,

113
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,820
and this is a, and this is a,
uh, a frequently heard opinion,

114
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,320
um, from within postcolonial studies,
but debates worlds around it.

115
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:08,030
Because of course, the means
of circulation of literary, uh,

116
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,710
influence, uh, is, uh, languages that, uh,

117
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,390
draw upon, uh, international
publishing possibilities, uh,

118
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,040
and not languages, uh, that can
only be grasped and published.

119
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,190
And disseminated locally.
So there are two,

120
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,880
you have a complicated issue, uh, but uh,

121
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,930
or controversy on both sides
of which there's much to say.

122
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,170
But as I say for us today,

123
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:41,171
it's simply a question or more simply
a question because when you've got Homi

124
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,600
Bhabha on the syllabus, there's no such
thing as simplicity. So I should say, uh,

125
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,720
it's a question of following the
trajectory or development, uh,

126
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,950
between specifically between,
uh,

127
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,680
side and Baba and then beginning
to think about say aid.

128
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:01,740
I thought we wouldn't think about it.
And we'd think instead for a moment,

129
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:06,741
at least about once again about Virginia
Wolf and the second chapter of a room

130
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:09,960
of one's own, uh, this young woman,

131
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:13,290
Mary Beaten Mary seat and Mary Carmichael,
whoever she is,

132
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,890
it sitting in the British library.
Uh,

133
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:21,330
and she's thought that she'd
spend the morning trying to
figure out, um, what, uh,

134
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,440
scholars thought about women. You
know, after all, you know, this,

135
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,030
this is sort of where the
subject is women and fiction. Um,

136
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,500
I'm supposed to be addressing these
undergraduates on this subject.

137
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,610
What do I know about women? I had
better go to the library and find out.

138
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,460
So she expects to get, uh, you know,

139
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,530
to just to find a couple of books and
she'll be all set and instead she simply

140
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:45,570
overwhelmed and she,

141
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,830
and there's this avalanche of
material and she submits, you know,

142
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,430
maybe a dozen or two, uh, call slips, uh,

143
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:56,880
and then sits back waiting for the
material to appear. And of course,

144
00:09:56,881 --> 00:10:01,590
the point of it is that everything
in the British library on the,

145
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,620
what turns out to be the voluminous
subject of women is written by Matt.

146
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,620
All right.

147
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,620
Everything and she begins to take note
of the way these things are described in

148
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,410
the, you know, sort of pre computer
database. Uh, that is to say,

149
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:24,411
how do you classify the various things
that men have to say about women.

150
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,730
And this is the way it goes.

151
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,420
Condition in Middle Ages of habits in the
Fiji Islands of worshiped as goddesses

152
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:39,530
by weaker in moral sense than idealism
of greater conscientiousness of South Sea

153
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,620
Islanders,
age of puberty,

154
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,710
among attractiveness of offered as
sacrifice to small size of brain,

155
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,170
of profounder,

156
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,180
subconsciousness of less
hair on the body of mental,

157
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:06,990
moral and physical inferiority of love,

158
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:09,990
of children of greater length,
of life,

159
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,460
of weaker muscles, of
strength, of affections,

160
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,540
of vanity,
of higher education,

161
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:22,890
of Shakespeare's opinion of Lord
Birkin heads, opinion of dean ends,

162
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,760
his opinion of library areas,

163
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,680
opinion of Dr Johnson's
opinion of Mr Oscar Browning's,

164
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:33,000
opinion of and.dot dot.
The list can continue.

165
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,230
In other words, she sits there,
she, she simply overwhelmed.

166
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,410
And what she of course is telling us is
that there's lots and lots and lots and

167
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:46,440
lots of opinions on record about women.

168
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,200
All of them expressed by men.

169
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,260
So now thinking about Edward Psyche,

170
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,170
if Edwards had taken up
Virginia Woolf's project,

171
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,400
if Edward aid had undertaken
to write a room of one's own,

172
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,870
the title of it would have
been female ism. Alright?

173
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,290
Because that's precisely
what he means by orientalism,

174
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,730
the vast body of information.
Some of it's scholarly,

175
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,140
some of it just sort of
sheerly doc's illogical.

176
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,230
The vast body of information about
people's called oriental by and large,

177
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:26,890
especially in the 19th century tradition,
uh,

178
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,050
Osi eads main concern is the
peoples of the Middle East. Uh,

179
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,450
and he shows how it is that there's a,

180
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,070
there's a certain reason why this is
an appropriate term to use for that

181
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:43,510
tradition of scholarship and philology
in the 19th century. In any case,

182
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,250
the vast body of material
published about these people.

183
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,830
And there are, and it's perfectly
true that there, there's the,

184
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,570
there are the infinitely long shelves
of the library devoted to multivolume

185
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,950
treatises on this topic.

186
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,480
All of them written by us in the West us,

187
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:09,630
you know about this other
who is perpetually in our
imaginary and constructed by

188
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:15,790
us in the variety of ways.

189
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,660
That side discusses a page 1811,
uh,

190
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:25,440
the right hand column. I'm sorry. Ah,

191
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,500
yes. The right hand column. He says
toward the bottom of the column,

192
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,280
orientalism is premised upon exteriority.

193
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,550
That is on the fact that the orientalist
poet or scholar makes the Orient Speak,

194
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:45,330
describes the orient renders his
mysteries playing for and to the West.

195
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,380
Just as in Wolf Man's opinions about
women getting themselves expressed in

196
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:53,320
books.

197
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,320
Make the subject of woman clear
to the an audience of men.

198
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,600
All right,
so

199
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,940
let me in bef before moving in with
some more depth and precision into sides

200
00:14:11,161 --> 00:14:12,150
text.
Uh,

201
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,220
let me quickly explain what I mean by
saying that's I aid and Baba constitute a

202
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:19,810
kind of sequence.

203
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,080
I'm thinking in particular of Elaine Show
Walters distinction between feminists

204
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,540
and Gyno.
Critical criticism.

205
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,400
You remember the distinction which is
echoed by the way in gates, his essay,

206
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:38,650
the distinction is first you get criticism
in which the treatment of women in

207
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:43,090
literature by men is
the focus of attention.

208
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,080
And then subsequently
you get criticism in wet.

209
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,940
The women's tradition,

210
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:53,810
the voice of women
themselves is the focus. Uh,

211
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,830
and uh,

212
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:59,150
as Showalter believes the more
fruitful terrain for criticism.

213
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,900
So you can see that in that, that in
that context, in way of making it,

214
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,900
by way of making that distinction,

215
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,730
you can see that site is decidedly
phase one because of course,

216
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,910
or anilism is about the treatment of
the Middle Eastern other by the West.

217
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,800
Uh,
and so it is sort of,

218
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,100
it can be slotted in to that same moment,

219
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,390
but what's interest and then Homi Bhabha,
uh,

220
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,380
is obviously in a variety
of ways, uh, takes up, uh,

221
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,300
the subject position of the
colonized of the subaltern.

222
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:40,070
He doesn't leave out the subject
position of the, uh, of the colonizer,

223
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,500
uh, because he sees them as
being radically interrelated. Uh,

224
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,540
but he plainly is as interested in a
variety of ways of talking about the

225
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:54,560
traditions of the colonized as he
is of talking about the way in which

226
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:59,450
colonization takes place and
expresses itself. So in that sense,

227
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,610
we can see aid and Baba as
belonging to these two phases,

228
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,800
uh,
as mapped by show Walter.

229
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:11,480
And as I say also in passing by gates.
But actually,

230
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,560
and I'm sorry for the confusion
of this heading, actually,

231
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:20,561
there's another way in which side and
Baba can be understood as phase one and

232
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:21,830
phase two.

233
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:27,130
And that has much more to do with
the tradition of literary theory,

234
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,830
which in their ways both show Walter and
gates have rejected insisting that one

235
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:38,831
needs to commandeer white male
literary theory for one's own purposes.

236
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,700
I suppose it's a question how it does,

237
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,400
how this issue doesn't come
up inside eight and Baba,

238
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,550
it could perhaps be answered by saying
that precisely in the situation of

239
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:56,510
colonialism, uh, the intellectuals,

240
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,410
a third world colonized intellectuals,
nevertheless,

241
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,690
are educated, uh, in, uh,

242
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,220
high octane male,
uh,

243
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:12,250
metropolitan institutions by which of
course one means primarily Oxford and

244
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:15,470
Cambridge. Um, and so
in a certain sense, uh,

245
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,290
they come to identify,
um, and this is not a,

246
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,400
this is not actually a thing,

247
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:26,600
apart from Baba has argument
about, uh, about hybridity.

248
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,750
They come to identify in some measure
with the educational agenda of the

249
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:38,480
colonizer and participate in it.
Now that speculative,

250
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:43,481
it may simply be that we have missed out
on those moments when I'm [inaudible]

251
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:50,090
and Baba to maybe talking about the
way in which the white male traditional

252
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,860
literary theory needs to be appropriated.
But for the moment,

253
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:58,861
what I want to point out is this side's
are anilism works very much in the

254
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:03,360
historical moment of what
we call structure Elysium.

255
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,720
That is to say it's primary concern
is with the binary opposition,

256
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,780
a mutual and interdependent
binary opposition of central
self and decentralized

257
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,280
other, uh, including as
we'll see in a minute,

258
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,020
the way in which the construction of
the otherness of the other is actually

259
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:32,730
covertly. Also at the same
time, a means of constructing,

260
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,880
defining d limited than delimiting,

261
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,830
the nature of selfhood or in
this case of being western.

262
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,020
And so there's a fundamental by
binarism insights point of view,

263
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:50,970
which by the way has also been often
been criticized and it's been criticized,

264
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:51,450
uh,

265
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:56,370
most often from the standpoint
of Baba whom you can see.

266
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,840
Because if only because he's constantly
referring to dairy dies. Famous Essay,

267
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,110
the double session of which is about
Malheur, may, uh, about all. And,

268
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,720
and also because,
uh,

269
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:10,650
he appropriates a great deal of
the language and style of Derrida.

270
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,800
You can see that Baba takes with respect
to the binarism of structuralism,

271
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,410
a deconstructive attitude.
In other words,

272
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:24,411
his sense of these
relations breaks down into,

273
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:30,260
at the very least a redoubling sense
of what he calls double consciousness.

274
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,840
So that one can't clearly identify
colonizer and colonized as a binary

275
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,200
opposition.
It's more complicated than that.

276
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,320
And it's a series of issues that turns
on a highly Derridean sense of what one

277
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:48,300
might mean by difference.

278
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,340
And so all I'm out of say
is that the relations I eat,

279
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:57,600
Baba is phase one,
phase two in that regard as well.

280
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,943
And by the way,

281
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:04,070
this is a tendency that one can find in
other forms of litter of theory having

282
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:06,960
to do with identity.

283
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,140
The relationship between the classical
feminism that we have been discussing so

284
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:18,021
far and the gender theory that we
will be discussing on Tuesday is one,

285
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,860
especially in the case of
Julio Butler is once again, uh,

286
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,930
a relation that could be understood as
between structuralism and deconstruction.

287
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,270
So, um, so, so there too,

288
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,390
you have a not completely overlapping but
from the standpoint of our concerns in

289
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,230
literary theory,

290
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,380
nevertheless rather interesting a way in
which this succession [inaudible] Baba

291
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:48,760
is phase one, phase two in two
different ways, uh, that can be,

292
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,700
uh, identified I think
usefully. All right,

293
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:56,860
so that then about their relationship.
So what,

294
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,460
what about site? How do
we, how do we get at, um,

295
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,600
the issues that side wants to talk about,
um,

296
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,170
and understand the way in which
he thinks they have integrity. Um,

297
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,250
before I think I'd like actually to begin
with a word or two about truth because

298
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,630
side,
uh,

299
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,800
makes it clear that in a way,

300
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:26,490
the demonization of orientalism that
his project undertakes isn't really

301
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:35,731
undertaken because orientalism
is necessarily a pack of lies.

302
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,800
He's, he, maybe he waffled
a little bit about this,

303
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,950
but it's not really ultimately the
point for him whether or anilism lies or

304
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,410
tells the truth.
This is,

305
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,000
this is the way he puts it on page
1802 in the right hand column,

306
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,340
a third qualification,

307
00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,270
one ought never to assume that
the structure of orientalism
is nothing more than

308
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,710
a structure of lies or myths,

309
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,240
which were the truth about them
to be told would simply blow away.

310
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,950
I myself believe that orientalism is
more particularly valuable as a sign of

311
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:16,630
European Atlantic power over the orient
than it is as a verb Riddick discourse

312
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:19,180
about the RN. Uh, nevertheless,

313
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,360
what we must respect and try to grasp is
the sheer knitted together strength of

314
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,550
orientalist discourse. In
other words, you know, I mean,

315
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,700
so one of Napoleon's adjutants during
Napoleon's campaign through Egypt wrote a

316
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,480
10 volume east wide leg reaped.

317
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,350
Many of the texts whom to whom Cy
aid mansions in passing in his,

318
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,670
uh, in his introduction to
orientalism are just as long.

319
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,130
I mean you've got 50 volume,

320
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:53,340
sort of a gigantic scholarly
undertakings and you've got to admit,

321
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:58,180
well, you know, if they're saying that
much, there's gotta be something in it.

322
00:22:58,181 --> 00:23:02,920
That's true. Um, there is after
all a great deal of knowledge, uh,

323
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:06,880
of a certain kind, at least that
has gone into thinking of this kind.

324
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,290
And so one can't just say,
my point is that none of it's true.

325
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,270
And so he'd, uh, is at pains to
make a distinction therefore,

326
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,830
between truth and value.
It's not that, um,

327
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,780
orientalist discourse is
necessarily true or false.

328
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:31,260
It is the case though that it is
insidiously d valuing of its object of

329
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:39,841
attention that there is an
implicit Eurocentrism which
side does go so far as to

330
00:23:42,341 --> 00:23:46,670
consider a form of racism
in our animalism quiet,

331
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,700
irrespective of any measure or degree
of truth that what are after all the

332
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:57,040
meticulous researches have a lot
of these characters turn up. Uh,

333
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,370
for example, on page 18, 12, uh,

334
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,460
the lefthand column,
he says,

335
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
my analysis of the orientalist
text therefore places emphasis.

336
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:12,530
This is about a third of the way down,

337
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:17,650
which is by no means invisible for
such representative on the evidence,

338
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:23,141
which is by no means invisible for such
representations as representations not

339
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,320
as natural descriptions of the Orient.

340
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:32,330
Now we might pause for amendment minute
over that as a possible object of

341
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:33,630
critique,
uh,

342
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,430
yet because at the end of his essay or
at the end of the introduction as you

343
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:39,980
have it, uh, you notice side saying, look,

344
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:44,660
I don't take up here the question of
how one might actually write correctly

345
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,780
about, you know, about these people.
He doesn't take up, for example,

346
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:55,610
the question of what it might
be like to be, um, uh, uh,

347
00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:00,670
sort of a representative
of these minorities,

348
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,360
uh, or colonized figures
and to write about oneself.

349
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:10,910
He doesn't really take up the question
whether the bias of somebody else writing

350
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:12,200
about me.
You know,

351
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:16,230
a man writing about a woman is
worse than the bias of my own pride,

352
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,130
preconceptions and
prejudices about myself.

353
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,070
He admits that he doesn't really have,

354
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:27,071
and advanced theory that's a cure is
one kind of representation as true or

355
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:29,440
authentic and secure is.

356
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,170
And other kind of
representation as biased, uh,

357
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,910
and inauthentic. He says, another
scholar will perhaps take this up.

358
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,650
I leave it alone in my book
and it is left alone. Uh,

359
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,360
the problem being that the claim
remains that that he, that he does,

360
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,390
um, uh, anticipating, uh,

361
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,790
many other people who have
written on this subject,

362
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,910
he does impugn orientalism as mere
representation at is to say as not,

363
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:00,950
uh,

364
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,950
as the opposite because it is a
representation the opposite of a natural

365
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:12,110
evocation of an ethos or world.
Um,

366
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,030
so we just do want to put a little
question mark in the margin then say there

367
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:21,890
and say, well, fine, fine. Granted,
this is all representation. Uh,

368
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,630
where is the text? Where could
the text be that would be natural?

369
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,070
Is there,
for example,

370
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,630
any such thing as we've asked ourselves
over the course of this semester as a

371
00:26:32,631 --> 00:26:36,200
natural sign,
the sign being arbitrary,

372
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,410
it does place us already pretty
securely in the realm of representation.

373
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:47,190
All right? All of these
questions then posed a buy sides,

374
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,340
a sense of the relationship between
truth and value in the history of

375
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:57,300
orientalist scholarship. Now,
where is he coming from? Uh,

376
00:26:57,301 --> 00:27:00,720
he's quite open about it. Uh, and um,

377
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,360
and it's perhaps worth pausing over.

378
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:08,361
And I over an idea common to the two
scholar theorists who matter most to him.

379
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,880
Michel Foucault and the Italian
Marxist on Antonio Gramsci.

380
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,190
Uh, first of all, uh, just uh,
to pass and review, uh, his,

381
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:24,570
the way in which he's indebted
to ground g on page 1803,

382
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,890
the lefthand column

383
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:32,810
sites as culture of course is to be found
operating within civil society where

384
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:37,440
the influence of ideas of institutions
and of other persons works not through

385
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:42,000
domination,
but by what Graham she calls consent.

386
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,021
That was,

387
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:48,021
it's not just a question of having
forced down your throat certain ideas or

388
00:27:48,691 --> 00:27:50,910
concepts or laws for that matter,

389
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,810
but a circulation of knowledge.

390
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,160
So called of feeling
about things of ideology,

391
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,260
which through consent
establishes certain attitudes,

392
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,980
uh, uh, of bias. And
so this is what Graham,

393
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,690
she,

394
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:14,690
the distinction that grime she makes
between the way in which one is imposed on

395
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:21,110
by actual power and authority and the
way in which one is imposed on by the

396
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:26,961
circuit by the circulations of what
we've been exposed to in the past,

397
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,320
uh,

398
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,320
as being called ideology seems
so to continue in any society,

399
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:36,270
not totalitarian says Sa Ead,

400
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,510
certain cultural forms predominate over
others just as certain ideas are more

401
00:28:41,941 --> 00:28:43,710
influential than others.

402
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:49,040
The form of this cultural leadership
is what Graham she has identified as

403
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:54,600
hegemony and this is the ta and this
is a term that you will frequently and

404
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,090
counter particularly in Marxist criticism,

405
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:02,270
but it is also a term very closely related
to what for most western readers is

406
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:07,320
more famous in the work
of Michel Foucault,

407
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:11,550
the term power or sometimes
power slash knowledge.

408
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:17,150
As you will learn in the excerpt from
Foodco that you'll be reading on Tuesday,

409
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Fuko light grumpshe sheet
makes a distinction between
power merely as that which

410
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:29,271
is exercised by the police or by the
legal arm of society or by the dictator or

411
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:32,700
by the government.

412
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,870
And power as the ways,

413
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:41,990
the frequently insidious ways in which
knowledge is circulated and made hedge.

414
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,403
I'm on it.

415
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,520
That is to say made
authoritative and Fuko is,

416
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:55,741
pat is fascinated by the structure of
this circulation of knowledge that is in

417
00:29:57,701 --> 00:30:01,870
fact the essential subject
matter of all of his late work,

418
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:07,020
the way in which we are thinking that
we are sort of free contemplative agents

419
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:11,230
in the world.
In fact,

420
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:16,231
browbeaten by structures of opinion
circulating around us that low us into

421
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:21,250
feeling that we're in the
presence of the truth.

422
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:26,370
Whereas of course we're
only in the presence of one
form or another of motivated

423
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:28,880
bias.
Uh,

424
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,960
so both grumpshe and Fuko make the
distinction between absolute power.

425
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,440
And as Graham,
she calls it hegemony.

426
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,680
And as Fuko calls it power knowledge,

427
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:45,670
Saeed is talking here
about power knowledge.

428
00:30:45,671 --> 00:30:50,671
He's not talking about the imposition of
law through force or any other means on

429
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:52,810
a colonized world.

430
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:57,930
He's talking about the way in which
opinions construct that world and

431
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,780
simultaneously reinforce the authority
of those who generate the opinions he

432
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:06,520
does.
However,

433
00:31:06,521 --> 00:31:10,800
and I think it's important to point
this relatively subtle distinction. Oh,

434
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,780
he does, however, disagree. Um,

435
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,220
from Fuko in one respect. On page 18, 13,

436
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,720
he goes back to what we
already know about food co,

437
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,490
which is who co's interested interest
in the author function as opposed to the

438
00:31:27,491 --> 00:31:32,440
author authors generally speaking,
Fuko wants to say,

439
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,690
or not authorities,
uh,

440
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,980
but simply but simply
vessels of forms of opinion,

441
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,280
certain authors who come very close to
being an authority we call founders of

442
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:49,920
discursivity, but even in their cases,
it's the nature of the discourse. Uh,

443
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,290
and not their existence as authors,
which is important.

444
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,150
Side wants to say,

445
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,300
I take authors a little bit more seriously
than that and he does on page 1813 in

446
00:32:01,811 --> 00:32:06,610
the right hand column where he says
food Coby leaves that in general,

447
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,700
the individual texts or author
counts for very little empirically.

448
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:17,340
That is to say through my experience
empirically in the case of orientalism and

449
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:22,750
perhaps nowhere else I find this
not to be. So, in other words,

450
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:25,480
the authors,
the central philologists and,

451
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:30,540
and social historians and explorers
and demographers who have written so

452
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:36,210
extensively on this part of
the world are authorities.

453
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:41,390
They are the oracles
from which generalized,

454
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:46,010
uh, and ultimately commonplace
opinions disseminate, uh,

455
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,740
as power knowledge.
And it's not a question,

456
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:53,860
therefore a kind of silent drumbeat of
opinion expressing itself over and over

457
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:58,640
again, which is more what
interests Fuko. So, uh,

458
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:03,560
so site as I say, uh, distinguishes
himself, uh, subtly, uh,

459
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:07,220
from Foodco in that regard.
Well, nevertheless, uh,

460
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,170
confessing openly,
uh,

461
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:14,171
the influence both of food co and
grumpshe fee on his way of approaching his

462
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:15,524
material.

463
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:21,440
So the circulation a of power, uh, as,

464
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,120
as a circulation of power.

465
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:28,121
I should say the effect of orientalism
is something that ultimately concerns

466
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:30,290
Saeed.
Well,

467
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:34,970
he says the somewhat rhetorically because
he obviously does concern if that it

468
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,160
has an effect on the peoples in question.

469
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,400
But what ultimately concerns side is
the effect of orientalism on the Euro

470
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:45,140
centric mind.
Indeed,

471
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:50,260
the degree to which it even can be said
to construct the euro centric mind.

472
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:53,630
Page 1806,
the right hand column.

473
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:02,260
My real argument is that orientalism
is and does not simply represent a

474
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:06,950
considerable dimension of modern
political intellectual culture.

475
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,450
And as such,

476
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:13,430
has less to do with the orient
than it does with our world.

477
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:18,820
Now here you can see the degree to which
side is saying something very similar

478
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,730
to what Tony Morrison said in her essay.

479
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:28,270
The existence of black as
absence needs to be understood.

480
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:30,411
For example,

481
00:34:30,411 --> 00:34:34,820
if we're studying the history of
American literature as the means of

482
00:34:34,821 --> 00:34:37,310
constructing whiteness,
of the,

483
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:42,430
of that which liberates whiteness from
the forms of constraints under which it's

484
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:49,070
been chafing at the beat at the bit.
And Morrison of course,

485
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:52,050
develops this argument
beautifully and she, uh,

486
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:57,190
quite clearly takes it from the Fourth
Chapter of Hegel's phenomenology of mind,

487
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,010
uh,

488
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,840
as a way of understanding
the master slave dialectic.

489
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,330
In other words, in Hagle, uh,
it's clear, uh, as Hagle, uh,

490
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:12,370
develops the idea that master and slave
are absolutely necessary to each other

491
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,610
in a structure of mutuality.
The master isn't,

492
00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:21,611
the master can't define himself as free
or a superior without the existence of

493
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:25,790
the slave.
The trickiness that the slave learns.

494
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:30,910
Being in this position of subordination
involving the development of all sorts

495
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:35,540
of complicated skills means
ultimately that the slave, uh,

496
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:37,040
becomes as it were,

497
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,140
that which drives the
master technologically and
ultimately controls the master,

498
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,150
uh, in a kind of, uh,

499
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,680
a fable of class reversal,
uh, which is, uh,

500
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:54,240
which continues to reverse itself again
and again and again on various grounds.

501
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,870
Um, this is, uh, the fable, uh,

502
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:03,050
the or w which at the same time is a
philosophy of class relations that we find

503
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:09,000
that that structure's Morrison's
argument, uh, and which I think also, uh,

504
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,220
also structures sides.

505
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,430
And I want to make the transition to Baba,
um,

506
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,040
because obviously this is a
form of binarism, uh, the, the,

507
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,540
uh,

508
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:25,540
the two signifiers in relation to each
other need each other in the way that we

509
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:31,290
described when we were discussing.
So Sir and structuralism,

510
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,550
I said,

511
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,690
I can't simply say that our
red light has positive value.

512
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,830
You remember the whole argument?
I have to see, uh, the red,

513
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:45,890
the red light in the context of the
semiotics system to which it belongs.

514
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,440
I have to see it as being different from
or opposed to something else in order

515
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:56,880
to grasp it. I cannot know it
positively. In other words,

516
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,310
I can only know it negatively.

517
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:03,840
This basic concept of
structuralism in the,

518
00:37:03,841 --> 00:37:08,841
so Syria and tradition is what creates
is what shapes binary arguments of the

519
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:12,600
kind that one finds in [inaudible].

520
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:17,630
We know ourselves negatively
as the not other is.

521
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:22,230
The bet is, is, is the basic
principle, the theoretical principle,

522
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:25,620
which under which underlies,
uh, obviously, uh,

523
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,240
aspect of the argument which are also
as a side says empirical. I mean, yeah,

524
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:32,670
I can say it's a structuralist idea,

525
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,910
but I really believe it because
I've seen it in operation.

526
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:40,200
It's not just structure, it was him.
In other words, it shares, however,

527
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:42,520
with structuralism, uh, a,

528
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,650
a theoretical predisposition and Baba,

529
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,300
if you look at page 18,

530
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:53,301
79 openly criticizes the premise
of binarism of this kind,

531
00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:00,840
not just anybody binarism but he
actually does go directly back to Hagle.

532
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,411
In other words,

533
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:06,411
he identifies the source of thinking
of this kind bottom of 1879 right hand

534
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:12,051
column when he says it is this ambivalence
that makes the boundaries of colonial

535
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:16,410
positionality,
the division of self,

536
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:19,230
other the question of colonial power,

537
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,130
the differentiation of colonizer,
colonized,

538
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:28,370
different from both the Hungarian
master slave dialectic or,

539
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:31,200
and he goes on to mention other things,

540
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:36,040
but I just want to focus on this
as a moment in which Baba is,

541
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,600
uh, is, is, is,

542
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:42,660
is distinguishing himself as clearly
as he can from the project of Saeed.

543
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:48,580
Alright, now this, the passage I just
read begins with the word ambivalence.

544
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,570
What does Baba mean by ambivalence?

545
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:57,280
Let's try to start there and
see if we can work our way into.

546
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,260
Bob has complex thinking on these matters.
Uh,

547
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:04,660
first by way of the notion of ambivalence.
Well,

548
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,930
and I'm going to put this in terms
of an historical example. Uh, I,

549
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,460
because I hope that will
make it a little clearer.

550
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,420
There is the ambivalence of the
colonizer toward the colonized.

551
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:22,810
In other words, it's not just one
mindset that drives colonization.

552
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,970
In the historical experience
of England in the east,

553
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,380
in the east India company,
there are two distinct phases,

554
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,560
phases which actually repeat themselves
recurrently even throughout the 20th

555
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:38,734
century.

556
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,860
The first in the 18th century is the
period of the government of the east India

557
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:46,060
Company by Warren Hastings,

558
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:51,690
who in a certain sense was interested
in what we call going native and also

559
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,000
encouraged,
uh,

560
00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,030
all of his provincial administrators to
do likewise Hastings and other words,

561
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:05,790
insight in terms knew a great
deal about the or analyzed other.

562
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,760
He knew all the local
languages and dialects.

563
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,710
He knew all the customs he knew, he
really knew everything there was to know.

564
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,310
Uh,

565
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:20,310
and in a certain sense was a person who
did go native while at the same time,

566
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,940
uh, wielding an iron with
an iron grip of authority,

567
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:29,680
power over the colonized other,
his ambivalence,

568
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:34,780
it himself then embodies a
certain ambivalence in not
giving an edge as to the

569
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:38,680
actual control of authority,

570
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:43,830
while at the same time seeming
to become one with the other.

571
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,320
But then there's the
historical ambivalence,

572
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:51,670
which expresses itself in a completely
different attitude and attitude,

573
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:56,290
which surfaced in the east India company.
Early in the 19th century,

574
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,390
uh, under the, uh, under the
supervisor ship of Charles Grant.

575
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,660
Now, Charles Grant, uh, was, uh,

576
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,720
as a d there had been a tremendous
revival of fundamentalist religion,

577
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,970
mainly methodism in England.
Uh,

578
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:18,030
and this and this evangelical enthusiasm
spread itself into the interest of the

579
00:41:18,881 --> 00:41:22,540
empire.
And so Charles Grant and others like him,

580
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:27,000
no had no longer had any interest
at all and going native, uh,

581
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,230
but on the other, but,
but on the contrary,

582
00:41:29,231 --> 00:41:34,231
insisted that a standard of
Englishness and in the staff,

583
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,560
the standard of the English Bible,

584
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,420
the coming of the English book that
Bhabha talks about at the beginning of his

585
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:43,970
essay be firmly implanted,

586
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:49,270
and that the imposition of Englishness
on the colonized other be the agenda of

587
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:55,730
colonization. The famous
historian, Thomas Babington,

588
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:00,170
Macaulay, uh, codified this attitude, uh,

589
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:02,780
in Wa in a famous document he wrote,

590
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,840
and it'd be assumed to be infamous
document called the minute on education,

591
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:08,510
uh,

592
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:13,510
which insisted that the
education of the Indian peoples,

593
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,470
uh, in the, uh,

594
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,310
under the regime of the east
India company B be conducted,

595
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:23,930
can strictly according to English models
that missionaries no longer try to

596
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:28,040
adapt their ideas to local
customs, uh, and folkways,

597
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:32,900
but that everything be strictly
anglicised. So this is a completely,

598
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:38,260
completely different attitude toward
colonization and it can be understood as a

599
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:43,480
sort of historical ambivalence.
Um, I'd actually, I,

600
00:42:43,481 --> 00:42:48,481
I'd actually like to pause over an
example of what you might call the Warren

601
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:52,610
Hastings moment. Um, uh, vicious example,

602
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:57,700
although an absolutely fascinating one
in the disturbing masterpiece by John

603
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:02,930
Ford called the searchers. I hope some
of you at least know that film. Uh,

604
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:07,460
the John Wayne Character,
uh, is a, uh, kind of,

605
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,050
um,
so lone stranger anticipate,

606
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:16,300
which is of course not infrequent
in the western, um, who, uh,

607
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,650
shows up at the house of some relatives.

608
00:43:18,651 --> 00:43:23,651
And here's that w that a daughter has
been abducted by the native Americans,

609
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:26,120
by the Indians.
Now,

610
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:29,990
the thing about John Wayne is
that he's a vicious in this film,

611
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,150
is that he's a vicious racist.

612
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,630
That he absolutely hates the Indians,

613
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:41,140
but he is not a vicious racist
from the standpoint of ignorance.

614
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:46,130
He is in fact a person who is,
has an himself in a certain sense,

615
00:43:46,131 --> 00:43:50,510
gone native. He knows all the
Indian languages and dialects.

616
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,350
He knows all their customs. He has, uh,

617
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,500
he has throughout a lifetime,

618
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:02,120
made a careful study of the
people he hates. And this is a,

619
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:07,180
and this is a volatile mixture to be
exposed to in a film because we're a much

620
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,370
more comfortable with the idea that
hatred arises out of ignorance. All right?

621
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:17,060
And the, and, and what is
so deeply disturbing about,

622
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:20,330
about John Ford's,
the searchers as that is,

623
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,950
it is a portrait of
absolutely vicious racism. Uh,

624
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,160
which is, which again, you
know, so he'd says, hey,

625
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:32,700
it's not necessarily truth, but we
do have to acknowledge, you know,

626
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,070
a certain local, thick
description we have. We have,

627
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,740
we have to acknowledge that there's a,

628
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:42,720
that there's quite a bit of information
at this person's disposal. Um,

629
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:46,430
and all of that is born out in the,
uh,

630
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,150
characterization of John Wayne in this
film or in Hastings was a lot like that.

631
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:56,580
Warren Hastings knew everything about
people whom he ultimately didn't really

632
00:44:56,581 --> 00:45:01,581
respect and whom he insisted on a
ruling with the Iron Fist of authority.

633
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,410
Uh,

634
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:09,120
and that's the kind of thing that's the
Baba is thinking about when he thinks

635
00:45:09,121 --> 00:45:12,090
about the ambivalence of the colonizer,

636
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,680
the relationship between knowledge and
value as it's already been enunciated

637
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:17,514
inside,

638
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:22,730
but also the fact that there's more
than one mindset for the colonizer.

639
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,850
There's the local knowledge
mindset and there's,

640
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,960
and there is the sort of raising the
absolute unequivocal standard of the

641
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,570
colonizing, uh, uh, uh,
of, of the colonizer, uh,

642
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,140
that these are two different attitudes,

643
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,080
each of which dictate
different strategies,

644
00:45:43,081 --> 00:45:47,910
particularly strategies of education.
So that's ambivalence,

645
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:50,220
uh,
the ambivalence of the colonizer.

646
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,040
Then there's the ambivalence
of the colonized. Um,

647
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,230
and that too has to be,
uh,

648
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:01,440
understood as a complex
relation to cooptation.

649
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:06,300
The anecdote with w with which Baba
begins, I think is fascinating,

650
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,350
uh, and well worth
attending to. You have, um,

651
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:15,270
not a colonizer, but someone
thoroughly co-opted, uh,

652
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:20,130
an evangelical, a converted Christian, uh,

653
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,580
of Indian descent. Um, who is,

654
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:28,670
who represents in a way that the people
he finds sitting under the tree root

655
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:30,721
trees,

656
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:35,520
reading the Bible considered to be
completely authentic because he believes,

657
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:40,500
uh, and is perfectly happy to believe
that the Bible and for that matter and for

658
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:44,760
that matter of Christianity
itself is an English gift.

659
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:50,100
But he's met with the response of
people who resist that, who say,

660
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,950
you know, this is very
interesting stuff. You know,

661
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,830
we wish we could have some
local authority for it.

662
00:46:55,831 --> 00:47:00,270
Our understanding as we got this, this
book, this book directly from God,

663
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,680
that's our understanding and we
have our own attitude toward it.

664
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,980
Sure they will get baptized one of
these days. But in the meantime,

665
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:11,370
we got to go home and take care of
the harvest. So, you know, W we,

666
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:15,930
we'll get around to that.
Don't worry about it. And by
the way, if we get baptized,

667
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,860
we certainly can't take the Eucharist,
uh, because you know, that's,

668
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:24,030
that's eating meat. We don't eat
meat. You know, we are who we are.

669
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,650
And so that,
and,

670
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:30,740
and you can see that these cunningly
in situ insinuated provisos,

671
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,990
uh, to the attitude that, um, that the,

672
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:39,100
the missionary wants to inculcate in
them in a very real way completely

673
00:47:39,101 --> 00:47:43,390
undermines his purpose. They don't
think of it as the English Bible.

674
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,700
They won't accept it as the English Bible.

675
00:47:45,701 --> 00:47:50,701
They will only accept it as an authority
that's mediated by their own values,

676
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,790
which transforms the document.
I mean,

677
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:58,900
you can see it again as this
is 18, 13, as Bob points out,

678
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:02,560
this was precisely at the
moment when we're moving,

679
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:08,250
when the regime of authority is moving
from the Warren Hastings Paradigm to the

680
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,730
Charles Grant Paradigm.

681
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:15,450
And it's no longer possible to think
in terms of adapting the Bible to local

682
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,730
beliefs and circumstances.

683
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,940
And so this is a moment in
which the complexity of the
attitude of the colonized

684
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:29,890
is brought up as the attitude
of the suborned missionary.

685
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:34,660
And there's the more complicated and
interesting attitude of the people he

686
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:38,570
encounters sitting under
these trees. Um, the, uh,

687
00:48:38,571 --> 00:48:41,920
at page 1886,
the right hand column,

688
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:49,050
that's actually not the
passage I wanted to read.

689
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:52,860
A page 1881 on the left hand column.

690
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,580
This is a very difficult passage.

691
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,330
Everything in Baba is
difficult. Um, I want to,

692
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:05,710
I think I want to gloss it by a suggestion
to you that what he's talking about

693
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,480
is that the ambivalence which,
and,

694
00:49:09,481 --> 00:49:13,180
and we might as well say right
out that this ad ambivalence is,

695
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:14,610
he has a term for,

696
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:19,630
and it's hybridity is the
double consciousness of
the cow colonized hovering

697
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:25,360
between submission.
That is to say submission to authority,

698
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:30,100
but with a difference submission
to authority on one's own terms.

699
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,750
And on the other hand,

700
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:35,680
acquiescence acquiescence
in authority as given,

701
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:40,780
which of course is basically the position
of the missionary. And with that said,

702
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:44,080
uh, I'll read the passage in which, uh,

703
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:49,140
Baba describes this hybridity in the
double consciousness of the colonize,

704
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:54,490
the place of difference and otherness
or the space of the adversarial within

705
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,740
such a system of disposal.

706
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,800
As I've proposed is never entirely on
the outside or implacably oppositional,

707
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:07,180
not just in other words,
again as a question of us versus them.

708
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:12,750
It is a pressure and a presence that
acts constantly if unevenly along the

709
00:50:13,481 --> 00:50:15,910
entire boundary of authorization,

710
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:21,210
which is also authority that is on the
surface between what I've called disposal

711
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:26,710
as be stole at.
I take that meaning submission.

712
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,820
You simply,
okay fine,

713
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:33,850
I give in and disposition as inclination,

714
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:38,470
which is, Hey, I kinda like
that. I go along with it. Uh,

715
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:43,510
I given spontaneously now to give in a
simply as a form of recognizing one's

716
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:46,580
beaten,
you know,

717
00:50:46,581 --> 00:50:51,581
as a form of submission is puts one
and the position of what Baba calls sly

718
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,560
civility. And this is the position, uh,

719
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:02,420
that I'd like to go back to for a moment
as being very closely related to what

720
00:51:02,421 --> 00:51:04,190
gates calls signifying.

721
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:09,170
A Baba gives a number of examples
of this slide civility, uh,

722
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,580
in his texts.
But of course,

723
00:51:10,581 --> 00:51:15,581
it's all present in the clever and
wonderfully rich ironies of these figures

724
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:20,570
sitting under the trees
in his opening anecdote.

725
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,900
But let me just give you an example
of how sly civility works as a form of

726
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:31,451
signifying and as a stats
of colonized resistance,

727
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:36,860
a recuperation of the will
perhaps in a postmodern sense,

728
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:41,870
which is nevertheless not rebellious,
not in any way,

729
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:45,770
um,
and visioning and overthrow of authority,

730
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:50,030
but is a means of living in
the framework of authority.

731
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:55,120
Just a quick example and then I'll let
you go to African American people are

732
00:51:55,461 --> 00:52:00,461
having a conversation and the presence
of a white person and they cheerfully

733
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:04,970
and, and, and, and with,
you know, with, with,

734
00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:09,890
with broad smiles on their face referred
to this person in his presence as bill.

735
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:15,770
Now, Bill is a derisive and
derogatory term for white people.

736
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:16,910
Uh,

737
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:21,910
and as the white person standing there
has two choices in response to hearing

738
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:24,740
himself referred to as bill.

739
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,870
He can either take umbrage and say,
Oh, why are you saying that about me?

740
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:33,110
I'm a nice guy. You don't, you,
you know how to say that. Uh,

741
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:38,060
in which case the needling
effect of the term,

742
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,160
um,
has taken hold.

743
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:45,580
Or he can play the fool and pretend
that he doesn't know that he's being

744
00:52:45,651 --> 00:52:49,310
signified on, uh, and pretend that well,

745
00:52:49,311 --> 00:52:52,490
it's perfectly okay to be called bill.
And either way,

746
00:52:52,491 --> 00:52:57,140
you see it's a win win situation.
They, uh, the, the, this, you know,

747
00:52:57,141 --> 00:53:01,190
this is this, this guy bill is
the slave owner, right? You know,

748
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,440
he likes to get along with people.
Uh,

749
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:06,860
so he's sitting around having this
conversation and he hears them calling him

750
00:53:06,861 --> 00:53:10,190
bill. Alright? So because he's, he,

751
00:53:10,191 --> 00:53:14,270
because there's an element of good
nature in his slave owning personality,

752
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:15,104
he's stuck.

753
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,880
He can either complain that
people are treating him unfairly,

754
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:24,680
which of course is neither here
nor there in terms of the power,

755
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,760
in terms of the structure
of power involved.

756
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:32,550
Or he can play the fool and pretend that
he doesn't even notice that he's being

757
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:35,730
made fun of. Uh, and so either way,

758
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,780
this is an example of that sly civility,

759
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:45,110
which signifies on the man and which
makes it clear that while the structure of

760
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:52,500
power can't be overthrown anytime soon,

761
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:57,390
there are nevertheless is
a way of living at least a,

762
00:53:57,391 --> 00:54:02,250
of keeping one sense of humor within
the existing structure of power,

763
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:06,280
uh, while giving the man a hard time. Uh,

764
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,340
that is the attitude,

765
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:13,370
the set of attitudes that
Baba is articulating in his
notion of the hybridity of

766
00:54:15,391 --> 00:54:19,770
the colonized, uh, which
takes the form in performance.

767
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,560
We're going to have a lot more to
say about performance on Tuesday,

768
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:24,300
which takes in the form,

769
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,290
takes the form in performance
of this sly civility.

770
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:32,160
I think it's page 1889 that
he gives us that expression,

771
00:54:32,161 --> 00:54:33,810
which I think you should keep hold of.

772
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:39,000
Which I would compare very closely with
what Henry Louis Gates calls signifying.

773
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:40,800
Okay.
See you on Tuesday.
