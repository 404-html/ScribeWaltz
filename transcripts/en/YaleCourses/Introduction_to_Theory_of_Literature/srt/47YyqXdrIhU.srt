1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,710
Last time,
uh,

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,880
we were giving examples of what might
happen if one takes seriously that

3
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:12,390
extraordinary 11th footnote and websites,

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,480
the intentional fallacy in which he says
the history of words after a bomb was

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,230
composed may well be relevant to the
overall structure of the poem and should

6
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:32,091
not be avoided owing simply
to a scruple about intention.

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,240
That's what essentially that's what
wimps that says in the footnote.

8
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,250
So I went back to the great
creator raising his plastic
arm and suggested that,

9
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:42,540
well,
maybe after all,

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,580
there might be some good way of
complicating the meaning of akin side by

11
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:52,581
suggesting that the modern anachronistic
meaning of plastic would be relevant to

12
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:55,290
the sense of the poem.
This is by the way,

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,640
and adjust just because one can make
this claim and I think make it stick in

14
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:04,500
certain cases, it doesn't mean that
the proposition is any less outrageous.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,460
I'm just doing it.

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,880
Imagine a philologist being confronted
with the idea that the meaning of words

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,650
add a certain historical moment,
uh,

18
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:18,860
isn't the only thing that matters in
understanding the meaning of a poem. Um,

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,310
so I just wanted to give another
example a little closer to home, uh,

20
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,750
of the poem of Yates 1935 poem,
Lapis Lazuli.

21
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,630
I began talking about it.
It's a forum which begins,

22
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,990
I have heard that hysterical women say
they are sick of the Palette and fiddle

23
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:41,550
bow of poets that are always gay.

24
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,800
Now this is a bar that,
you know,

25
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:48,550
the storm clouds of the approaching
war are beginning to gather. Uh,

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,830
a lot of people are saying, enough
of this kind of a, you know,

27
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,810
if feet culture, uh, we need to
think about, um, important things,

28
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,970
uh, particularly about, uh,
politics and the social order. Uh,

29
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,140
by the way, a very powerful
argument in 1935, but in any case,

30
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,230
Yates was on the other
side of the controversy and
insisted after all that there

31
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:17,220
is a continuing role for art as indeed
on the other hand, there may well be.

32
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,660
And he said,
so he's,

33
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:21,660
he's sick of everybody saying they
don't want to talk about painting,

34
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:24,810
they don't want to talk about music and
they don't want to talk about poets who

35
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:29,640
are always gay. All right. So then
the poem continues. It involves,

36
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,890
it involves a stone, a piece
of Lapis Lazily, uh, that you,

37
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,650
that that has a kind of a flaw in it,

38
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:41,410
which is like a watercourse
and where one can imagine, um,

39
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,530
a pilgrim climbing, uh, toward
increased enlightenment.

40
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,720
Uh,
and as the poem goes on,

41
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,350
Yates talks about the way in
which civilizations crumble.

42
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,560
That is to say all things fall apart,

43
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,590
but then it's possible to build
them back up. And he says,

44
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,190
all things fall and are built again.

45
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,560
And those that build them again are gay.
Now,

46
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,650
as I said last time,
needless to say,

47
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,490
Yates was not aware of the anachronistic,

48
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:19,300
meaning that we may be tempted
to bring to bear on the poem.

49
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,890
Yates is thinking of nature is
thinking of, of, of, of a word further,

50
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,320
which probably is best
translated, joyous, uh,

51
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,060
energetically joyous. Uh, and uh,

52
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,120
he is just borrowing that word from
the translation of a book by nature.

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,170
Well and good.

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,560
But if you were a queer theorist or
if you were interested in making a,

55
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:48,670
not a week, but a strong claim for, uh,

56
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,410
the importance of queerness
in our literary tradition,

57
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,750
you would be very tempted to
say this enriches the poem,
not just in other words,

58
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,560
that they are energetically
joyous as creators,

59
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:07,210
but also that in our contemporary
sense of the word, they're gay. Now,

60
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,000
this again,
as in the case of akin side,

61
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,750
may or may not raise the
hackles of the philologists,

62
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,350
but there's a certain sense in
which from a certain point of view,

63
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,600
it's difficult to deny that it
doesn't land a sir, that, that,

64
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:26,500
that it doesn't lend a certain coherence.

65
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,600
Additionally complex coherence
to the nature of the poem.

66
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,200
All right, and then, you know, I
mean, we have Tony the tow truck.

67
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:38,680
You're probably beginning to wish I
would refer to it. So why don't I,

68
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,470
in the second line of tone
of the tow truck, we learn,

69
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,010
I live in a little yellow
garage. Now, of course,

70
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:50,020
the dean notation as of that of the word
yellow as clearance Brooks would say,

71
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,200
is that the garage is
painted a certain color.

72
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,240
The conotation,

73
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,290
which undoubtedly though
the author had no notion of,

74
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,900
wasn't thinking of this
is a book for toddlers.

75
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,440
The connotation is somehow or another,

76
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,870
there's the imputation of cowardice,

77
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,550
possibly also the derogatory
imputation of being Asian.

78
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:16,360
Maybe Tony is Asian. Well,
okay, well, you know, this has,

79
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,170
this has nothing to do with the text
we say. And yet at the same time,

80
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:22,990
suppose it did,
I mean we could interrogate it,

81
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:26,950
we could interrogate the author
psychoanalytically we could say, hey,

82
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,220
wait a minute. You know, okay,
so you say it was painted yellow,

83
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,980
why don't you say it's
painted some other color?

84
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,480
And we could begin to put a certain amount
of pressure on the text and possibly,

85
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,500
as I say, begin to do things with it, um,

86
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,140
which are a kind of five finger exercise
and we'll be doing a lot more of that

87
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:46,660
sort of thing, but which
might work. All right.

88
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,720
These are examples of the extraordinary
implications of [inaudible] 11th

89
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:55,420
footnote. And also I think, um,

90
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,810
perhaps in advance of today's discussion
clarified to some extent the importance

91
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,160
for critics of this kind
of the notion of unity.

92
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,660
In some ways,

93
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,310
everything we have to say today
will concern the idea of unity.

94
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,653
In other words,

95
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:20,110
a connotation is valuable and ought
to be invoked even if it's fill a

96
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,920
illogically incorrect if it
contributes to the unity,

97
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,640
the complex building up of
the unity of literary texts.

98
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,700
If on the other hand it is what got
them or would call a bad prejudice,

99
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:39,701
that is to say sip some
aspect of my subjectivity
that nothing could possibly be

100
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:44,420
done with in thinking
about in interpreting the
text, then you throw it up.

101
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,280
So the criteria is,

102
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,550
is it relevant to the unified form that
we as critics are trying to realize in

103
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:57,980
the text and that criterion,
as I say,

104
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,070
not just for the sorts of
of semi facetious readings
we can do with [inaudible]

105
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,520
11th footnote,

106
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,700
but also for ratings that may at
least have some marginal plausibility.

107
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,150
This sense of unity is what governs
interpretive decisions of this kind.

108
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:23,260
All right now a word or two about the
antecedents of the new criticism and the

109
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:29,000
first place, the 30s and
forties, a in the academic world.

110
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,640
Bare witness to uh,

111
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,060
the rise of a cannon of taste,

112
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,110
largely introduced by the
great modernist writers,

113
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:42,890
particularly by ts Elliot.
You may notice that Brooks for example,

114
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:47,330
has a kind of done obsession.
He gets that from Elliot's essay,

115
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,480
the metaphysical poets,
uh,

116
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,490
which is a review essay of a volume
of [inaudible] Donne's poems edited by

117
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:56,360
somebody named Grierson,

118
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,410
which may done overnight
for a great many readers.

119
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,210
The central poet in the English
tradition. Brooks is still, as I say,

120
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:07,160
very much under the influence of this.
Well,

121
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,780
Elliot in the metaphysical poets says
some rather interesting things that had

122
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:14,960
far reaching consequences for
the new criticism. He says,

123
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,020
poetry in our own time,

124
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,620
such is the complexity
of the world we live in.

125
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,130
Poetry must be difficult.

126
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,610
He says poetry has to reconcile
all sorts of disparate experience.

127
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,990
Reading spinosa the smell of cooking,

128
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,360
the sound of the typewriter.

129
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,690
All of this has to be yoked together
in the imagery of a good poem,

130
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,710
particularly of a metaphysical poem.

131
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:53,140
And this model of complexity is what
matters both for modern literature and for

132
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,210
literary criticism.
Now,

133
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,880
by the same token,

134
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
other modernists like Jane's joys are
also contributing to this idea of the

135
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:10,490
independent unity of the work of art and
Steven Herro portrait of the artist as

136
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:11,754
a young man.

137
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,850
You remember Steven in his disquisition
on form and Aquinas and all the rest of

138
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:19,920
it argues that the work of art,

139
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:25,190
it's something that is cut off from its
creator because its creator withdraws

140
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:31,170
from it. Uh, and and simply
Paris, his fingernails in the,

141
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,110
in the famous expression. Um, it's
very interesting you remember that,

142
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,790
that in the winds at that you
read last time women's at argues,

143
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,880
I think probably thinking
about that passage and Joyce,

144
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,530
that the work of art is cut
off from its author at birth.

145
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,770
This isn't, this is an umbilical
cord he's talking about.

146
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,800
It has no more connection with its author
from birth on and roams the world on

147
00:09:56,761 --> 00:10:00,150
its own. And so ideas like this, as I say,

148
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:05,151
are taken from the aesthetic and Pratt
and practical thinking about the nature

149
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:12,780
of the work of art that one finds
in modernism. In the meantime,

150
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,070
the academic setting

151
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,050
in the 1930s when ransom in particular
is writing his political manifestos,

152
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:26,781
the new criticism and the world's body
and attacking most of what's going on as

153
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:30,030
it's being done by his colleagues.

154
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,500
He has two things in particular
in mind in the first place,

155
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:39,530
old fashion philology the kind of of
thinking about literary texts that would

156
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:44,790
insist that plastic means what it means
in the 18th century and in the set and a

157
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,110
lot of that was being done.

158
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:51,111
This is the golden age of the
consolidation of the literary profession.

159
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,670
Additions are being created.

160
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,510
The great learning journals
are in their early phase.

161
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:02,460
Knowledge is actually still
being accumulated about
the base having to do with

162
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:07,410
the basic facts of the literary tradition
that we didn't know a great deal about

163
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:12,411
certain authors until this period of
flourishing of philology in the very late

164
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:17,040
19th and early 20th
century took hold and it,

165
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:22,060
and pretty much created
for us the archives that we
now use today in a variety

166
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:24,174
of ways.

167
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,650
So although the new critics were
fed up with philological criticism,

168
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:32,940
I don't mean to be condescending toward
it or to suggest that it didn't play a

169
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:37,170
crucially important role in the
evolution of literary studies. Now,

170
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:41,220
the other thing that was going
on, and here, I don't know,

171
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:42,780
depending on one's viewpoint,

172
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:45,570
perhaps some measure of
condescension might be in order,

173
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,700
but these two were spectacular figures.

174
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:51,750
The other thing that was going on was
there was a vogue for what might be called

175
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,390
appreciative teaching.
That is, I mean, the,

176
00:11:55,391 --> 00:12:00,250
the contemporary and colleague of Iaa
Richards at Cambridge was the famous

177
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,060
queue, Sir Arthur quiller
couch, who's left, who's,

178
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:06,540
who's mesmerizing lectures,
um,

179
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,400
had virtually no content at all.

180
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:14,430
They were simply evocations
appreciative evocations of great works.

181
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:16,264
Of Literature.

182
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,470
And I have to say that it yell
exactly contemporary with queue.

183
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,180
We had a similar figure.

184
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:27,690
The person after whom felt skate is
named the Great William Lyon Phelps who

185
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,940
would enter the classroom,

186
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,970
begin rapturously to quote Tennyson would
clasp his hands and say that that was

187
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:40,280
really good stuff. Uh, and
the students were, and, and,

188
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,530
and the students were so appreciative
that they gave hundreds and thousands of

189
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,490
dollars to the university, uh, ever
after. Um, the, in other words,

190
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:52,150
this is valuable teaching,
but, but, but again, you know,

191
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,470
but, but again, the new
critics were fed up with it.

192
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:59,980
This was the atmosphere they found
themselves in and what they wanted.

193
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,130
And this anticipates the
atmosphere that you'll,

194
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,760
you'll see the Russian formalists found
themselves in when we turned them,

195
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,050
turned to them next week,

196
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:13,230
what they wanted with something like rigor
or a scientific basis or some sort of

197
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:18,730
set of principles that could actually be
invoked so that the business of credits,

198
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:23,050
criticism could be,
could become more careful and systematic,

199
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,880
less scattershot, less
effusive, and so on. So this is,

200
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,960
this is in effect the
backdrop, uh, in which, um,

201
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,710
in the American academy but
influenced as we'll now see, uh,

202
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,580
by certain trends in the British Academy,
uh,

203
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,820
arose in the 30s and in the forties.

204
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,483
All right.
Now

205
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,890
the first figure I want to talk a little
bit about in the first figure whom you

206
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:55,600
read it for. Today's assignment
is I a Richards Richards,

207
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,410
ah,
before he became a,

208
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:03,420
before he joined the English department
at Cambridge was actually a psychologist

209
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,200
and trained as a Pavlovian
psychologists so that when you read, uh,

210
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:12,730
in his essay about stimuli and needs,

211
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,460
uh, you see pretty much
where you stand. It is,

212
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:19,780
I mean his sense of the way in which
the mind reacts to the world to its

213
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:22,120
experience, the way in which, uh,

214
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:27,180
it's an uncomplicated reaction
or a resisting reaction or a,

215
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,580
an adjusting reaction all has very
much to do with Pavlovian principles.

216
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:33,820
Uh,

217
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,820
and these governed to some extent
Richard's his understanding of his boat,

218
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,850
even of his literary vocation.
Um,

219
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,280
during the period when he wrote 1924
when he wrote principles of literary

220
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:52,681
criticism for Richards reading
is all about experience.

221
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:58,270
That is to say the way in which the
mind is affected by what it reads.

222
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,950
And so even though, uh, his
subject matter is literature,

223
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,880
he is nevertheless constantly
talking about human psychology.

224
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:12,020
That is to say what need
is answered by literature,

225
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,690
how the psyche responds to literature,

226
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,640
what's good and bad about
psychic responses and so on.

227
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,910
This is th th th this is
the intellectual focus.

228
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,780
In other words of Richard's his work.
Now another thing,

229
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:31,400
another aspect of his having been and
continuing to be a scientist is that

230
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:36,380
Richard's really did believe,
seriously believed in reference.

231
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:41,381
That is to say in the way in which
language really can hook onto the world.

232
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:47,950
Verifiable and falsifiable statement is
for Richard's the essence of scientific

233
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:52,880
practice. And he cares very
much about that, that it's not,

234
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:57,530
I mean he does not, in other words,
share with so many literary critics,

235
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,610
perhaps even with Brooks who follows him
and making the fundamental distinction

236
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:03,830
I'm about to describe it.

237
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:08,540
He does not share with the majority of
literary critics and artists, uh, uh,

238
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,180
kind of distaste for science. I mean, he,

239
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,780
and this by the way is also true of
his student Samson who was a math major

240
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:19,400
before he became an English major.
Both of them, uh, take very seriously,

241
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:19,980
uh,

242
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,980
a the notion that there can
be a scientific basis for
what one does in English

243
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:29,150
or in literary studies.

244
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,600
So another aspect of it for Richards is
because he takes science so seriously,

245
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,420
is that he actually reverses the idea
that we talked about last time in Sydney

246
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:43,190
and cotton and Coleridge
and wild and whimsy,

247
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:47,960
that he actually reverses the idea
that it's art that's autonomous.

248
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,190
If you look on page seven,
66 in the left hand column,

249
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:57,230
you'll find him saying that
science is autonomous to,

250
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:02,300
and what he means by that is that
scientific facts can be described in

251
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:07,301
statements without the need for any
kind of psychological context or any

252
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,470
dependency on the varieties of human need.

253
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,490
It is autonomous in the
sense that it is a pure, um,

254
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,850
uncluttered and [inaudible] influenced
declaration of fact or falsehood.

255
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,480
Then he says to declare science autonomous
is very different from subordinating

256
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:32,720
all our activities to it.
And here's where poetry comes in.

257
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:38,110
It is merely to assert that so far as
anybody of references is undistorted,

258
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,090
it belongs to science.

259
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,980
It is not in the least to assert that
no references may be distorted if

260
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,920
advantage can thereby gained be gained.

261
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:54,290
And just as there are innumerable human
activities which require undistorted

262
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:58,530
references, scientific activities
if they are to be satisfied.

263
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,570
So there are innumerable other human
activities, not less important,

264
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:08,780
which equally require distorted
references or more plainly fictions.

265
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:15,530
Here you see Richard's is
basic distinction between
what he calls scientific

266
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:19,740
statement and what he
calls emotive statement.

267
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,560
The distinction between,
uh,

268
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,480
between that which is truly referential,
that which is in controvert,

269
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:32,160
controvert ugly,
verifiable or falsifiable on the one hand,

270
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,880
and that which is emotive.
Later on,

271
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,440
Richard's changes his vocabulary and
he no longer talks about scientific and

272
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:41,251
emotive language.

273
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:45,510
He talks instead even more dangerously
from the standpoint of anybody who likes

274
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:48,810
poetry.
He talks instead of statement,

275
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,020
meaning science and pseudo statement,
leading poetry. I mean here,

276
00:18:54,021 --> 00:18:56,790
we're really out on a limb if
you're going to defend poetry,

277
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,700
has Richards kept doing
as pseudo statement,

278
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,850
but of course pseudo statement is just
another expression for what he calls here

279
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,660
fiction.
Now,

280
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,720
why on earth once we sort of settle into
this vocabulary and once we get used to

281
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:16,470
this clearly a unquestioningly
scientific perspective,

282
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,180
why on earth do you need pseudo
statement or fiction at all?

283
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,470
We know very well by the way,

284
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:26,460
that they're are scientists to simply
cannot stand to read poetry because it's

285
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:30,900
fault. Right? You know, it's, I mean
it, it just as Richard says, you know,

286
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,120
poetry, there's a, so there's, there's,

287
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,560
there's always something kind of archaic
or atavistic about poetic thinking.

288
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:41,910
It's not just that, it's not trying
to tell the truth as Sydney said,

289
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,030
nothing lives because it
never afirma's not just that,

290
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:46,380
it's not trying to tell the truth.

291
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,300
It is in fact said Richard's go
so far as to say following Plato.

292
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,730
It is in fact lying poetry.

293
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,850
Poetry is constantly getting itself
in trouble and in all sorts of ways.

294
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,270
Um, and the all, I mean on
page seven 68, for example,

295
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:07,200
I know it seven 68, although I can't
find my reference in the lecture,

296
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,240
see if I can see if I can
find it in the book. Um,

297
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,510
okay,
it

298
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,700
is evident and he says at the top,

299
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:21,520
sort of toward the top of the
right hand column seven 68,

300
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:26,470
it is evident that the bulk of poetry
consists of statements which only the very

301
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:29,140
foolish would think of
attempting to verify.

302
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,150
They are not the kinds of things
which can be verified pack of lies,

303
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,570
pack, you know, I mean,
and then we say, you know,

304
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:42,460
it usually follows from this that somebody
liked this points out that whereas we

305
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:46,300
all know that the democratic society
is the best society to live in.

306
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:50,650
Poetry prefers society. It makes
better poetry and what, whereas we all,

307
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,800
and whereas we all know that the
universe is of a certain kind, uh,

308
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,030
we can't even call it Copernican anymore.

309
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Poetry has this odd preference
for Ptolemaic astronomy and in,

310
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,950
in other words,
everything about poetry is atavistic.

311
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:08,710
It's a throwback to some
earlier way of thinking.

312
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:13,110
There's some kind of late
primitivism in poetic thinking. Um,

313
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:17,020
and Richard scenes cheerfully
to embrace this idea.

314
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,690
That's what he means by fiction or suit.
PSEUDOS taper.

315
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,330
So why on earth do we want it?

316
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:27,750
We want it according to Richards because
it answers needs in our psychological

317
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:34,600
makeup that science can't answer.
In other words,

318
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,130
we are, you know, a chaos of desires.

319
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,250
Some of them are involved.

320
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:46,120
The desire for truth that is to say
for what we can learn from science,

321
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,680
but a great many of our desires have
nothing to do with any notion of truth,

322
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:55,770
but rather our needs that require
fanciful or imaginative fulfillment,

323
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,150
fulfillment of other kinds.

324
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:06,330
And the reason this fulfillment
is important and can be
valued is according to

325
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:10,210
Richards that these needs,

326
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,730
unless they are organized,

327
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:17,731
harmonized so that they work together in
what he sometimes calls a synthesis can

328
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:21,190
actually tear us apart.

329
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,940
Literature is what can't reconcile
conflicting or opposing needs.

330
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:34,210
And Richard's cares so much about
this basic idea that in another text,

331
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:37,330
not in the text you've just
read, he says, shockingly,

332
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,830
poetry is capable of saving us. In
other words, poetry is capable of doing.

333
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:46,460
Now what religion used
to do poetry and rubber,

334
00:22:46,461 --> 00:22:49,960
if this is a scientist,
poetry is no more true than religion,

335
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,080
but it can perform the
function of religion and is
therefore capable of saving

336
00:22:57,581 --> 00:22:58,414
us.

337
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,420
And so even despite the seeming derogation
of the very thing that he purports to

338
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:10,750
be celebrating in books like the
principles of literary criticism,

339
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:16,650
Richard's does hold out an extraordinarily
important feeling for the mission of

340
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:23,500
poetry to harmonize conflicting needs.

341
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,130
That's the role of poetry
and that's what it does.

342
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:31,720
Simply by evoking our wishes,

343
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:35,860
our desires,
irrespective of truth in there,

344
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,000
complicated,

345
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:42,090
chaotic form and synthesizing them
organically into something that amounts to

346
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,660
psychological piece,
something that leaves us,

347
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:53,900
it's a little bit like
Aristotle's idea of Catharsis,

348
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,300
which can be understood
in a variety of ways,

349
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,440
but Milton at the end of Samson agonists,
these understands it in one way.

350
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,980
When he says,
now we have as a result of this tragedy,

351
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,180
calm of mind,
all passion spent.

352
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,250
That could be the motto to Richards,
his work, the experience of art,

353
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,020
the experience of poetry,

354
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,470
the reconciliation of conflicting

355
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,410
needs,
results in a kind of catharsis,

356
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,400
calm of mind, all
passion spent. All right.

357
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,240
Now Richard's had a student,
an undergraduate student,

358
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,720
William Thompson, who had, as I say,

359
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:39,080
had been a math major who
decided he'd switched to English.

360
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,070
He went to Richardson and he said,
Hey, he had an idea about ambiguity.

361
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:46,010
He said he thought he thought there was
quite a bit that could be written about

362
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:50,870
it. Um, and so he wondered if Richard's
would mind if, if maybe he worked on that.

363
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:56,030
Richard said, fine, fine. Sounds terrific.
Uh, go do it. So a few months later,

364
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:00,680
Amston brought him the manuscript of one
of the greatest books of criticism in

365
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:05,681
the 20th century and one of the most
amazingly surprising seven types of

366
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:10,340
ambiguity.
The brief excerpt you have in your packet.

367
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:15,380
I trust that you have picked it up by
this time at Tyco, your photocopy packet.

368
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:20,650
The brief excerpt you have from Samson
is taken from seven types of ambiguity.

369
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,360
Um,
I think [inaudible] is the funniest.

370
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,410
A person who has ever written
literary criticism. Uh,

371
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:35,530
I think that his dead pan way of bringing
things down to earth when they get a

372
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:38,510
little too high Falutin, uh, is, you know,

373
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,920
involves the skill of a
genuine stand up comic. Uh,

374
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,820
his timing is perfect. Uh, he
has, in other words, all of the,

375
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,480
all the attributes of a
great comic writer. Uh,

376
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:54,620
I enjoyed reading him so much that when
I was asked to write a book about him,

377
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:57,980
I agreed to do so. Um,
I've always been like that.

378
00:25:57,981 --> 00:26:02,420
I enjoyed that Byron was the only
person I enjoyed reading during the nail

379
00:26:02,421 --> 00:26:05,270
biting and tense period
of studying for my orals.

380
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:09,110
So I wrote my dissertation on
Byron as a result of that. Um,

381
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,800
nothing complicated,
no deep reason for doing these things,

382
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,600
but Amsa and I hope you
enjoy, uh, he's a page Turner.

383
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,430
Uh, and his extraordinary
brilliance as a critic,

384
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:27,350
a is really just part of the
experience of reading him. Uh,

385
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:29,990
I'm particularly interested in the,

386
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:34,991
in the excerpt you have in what
he does with his notion of,

387
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,080
because this is his way of responding to
enthusiastic or appreciative criticism.

388
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,090
One of the tricks of Q
and Billy [inaudible],

389
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,240
Billy Phelps and [inaudible] and all the
other sort of authors and lecturers in

390
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:55,160
this mode was to say that
they read for atmosphere that,

391
00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:00,190
that that was something that one just
felt along ones bloodstream or in the

392
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:02,310
pulses.
One,

393
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:07,311
one encountered great literature and
their purpose as lecturers and as critics

394
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,600
was to evoke the atmosphere of things.
And so absent says, well, you know,

395
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,860
atmosphere, certainly, uh,

396
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:17,670
certainly that exists and we can talk
about it and all sorts of ways. Um,

397
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,000
but after all,
what is the use of atmosphere?

398
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:25,110
What does the use of any aspect of
literature? If as good scientist,

399
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:29,640
we can't analyze it if we can't
somehow or another account for it.

400
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:34,710
If there is atmosphere in the passage
I'm about to quote from Macbeth,

401
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,920
it must be atmosphere of a certain
kind and there for a certain reason.

402
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,590
And what follows it seems to me is one
of the most staggeringly beautiful,

403
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,490
wonderful, amazing rifts, uh,

404
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,930
on a passage of literature
that you can encounter.

405
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:54,990
I'm sorry if I sound a little bit
like Billy Phelps, but I do get,

406
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,610
I do get excited. Um, uh, he quotes,

407
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:04,560
he quotes the passage from Macbeth,
uh, as Amston says, uh, you know,

408
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:07,290
the murderers have just left the room and,
and uh,

409
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,460
Macbeth is sort of twiddling his thumbs
hoping it's getting dark because it's

410
00:28:11,461 --> 00:28:15,210
got to get dark before Banquo
can be killed. So natural
he looks out the window,

411
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:19,470
see just to see how the
time is going. Um, and uh,

412
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,760
and this is what he says, come
ceiling nights, scarf up the tender.

413
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:28,761
I have pitiful day that with thigh bloody
and invisible hand cancel and tear to

414
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:34,521
pieces that great bond that keeps us
Pale amps and doesn't mention this word

415
00:28:35,371 --> 00:28:38,340
Pale, but in juxtaposition
with the crows and Rooks,

416
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:43,050
it strikes me that it itself is an
interesting woman in the passage light

417
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:46,920
thickens and the crow
makes wing to the rookie.

418
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:49,110
Would Anson Italicize that?

419
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:52,650
Because while he has something to
say about every part of the passage,

420
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:55,680
which all good criticism by the way,
should do you quote something.

421
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,970
So he's not thinking about all of it.
Okay. Uh, and, but, but, but, but,

422
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,111
but,
but,

423
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:06,111
but Anson italicized is these particular
lines because it's going to be the true

424
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:08,280
focus of what he'll say later.

425
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:13,430
Good things of day begin to droop and
drowse while nights black agents to their

426
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:17,310
praise,
do rouse Dow marvel step my words,

427
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,340
but hold these lady Macbeth has
come into the room, you know,

428
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,680
so now marvels at my words,

429
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,890
but hold the still things bad begun,

430
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:30,630
make strong themselves by ill.
So pretty. Go with me. All right.

431
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,160
So Amston is fascinated by this
passage and then he gets the,

432
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,450
he gives you in the next few paragraphs,

433
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,870
the amazing variety of grounds
for his fascination. Um,

434
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,700
and he says, look, this is,

435
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,910
this is what people mean when
they talk about atmosphere.

436
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,370
It's not just something
you feel on your pulse.

437
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:52,060
It's something that can be described.
Something that can be analyzed.

438
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,630
And I just want to touch on
the last part of it. He says,

439
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,450
rooks live in a crowd and I
mainly vegetarian absence.

440
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,320
Allison's the person who says that,
uh,

441
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,070
that the ancient mariner shot the
Albatross because the crew was hungry.

442
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,660
He points out that I'm 17,

443
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:12,190
1998 edition of the rime of the ancient
mariner a biscuit worms had gotten into

444
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:13,000
the hardtack.

445
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,650
So naturally he says the particular kinds
of Albatross that the Marriner shot,

446
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,400
I am told makes it very tolerable broth.
This is,

447
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,820
this is the mode of William Hansen.
Uh, and so and so he begins here,

448
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,870
Brooks live in a crowd and
are mainly vegetarian, cro,

449
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,330
maybe either another name for rook,

450
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:39,390
especially when scene alone or it
may mean the solitary carrion crow.

451
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:44,080
This subdued pun, this
ambiguity. Remember,

452
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:46,120
this is a book about ambiguity.

453
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:51,390
This subdued pawn is made to imply here
that Mac Beth looking out of the window

454
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:58,410
is trying to see himself as a murderer
and can only see himself as in the

455
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:00,910
position of the crow,

456
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:05,200
that his day of power now is closing.

457
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:10,210
That he has to distinguish himself from
the other rooks by a difference of name,

458
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:12,520
Rook Crow,
like the kingly title.

459
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:17,670
Only that he is anxious at bottom to be
one with the other rooks not to murder

460
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:19,720
them,

461
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,720
that he can no longer or that he may yet
be United with the rookery and that he

462
00:31:25,691 --> 00:31:30,250
is murdering Banquo in a for Lauren
attempt to obtain peace of mind.

463
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,620
Well,
I just,

464
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,790
I'm not at all sure there's anything
more to be said about that passage,

465
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:40,600
which is debt, which, which,
which I think lays to rest.

466
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,801
And it does.

467
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:46,801
So by insisting on a complex mode
of ambiguity that governs the path,

468
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,550
not atmosphere,
short call it atmosphere if you like,

469
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,600
as long as you're willing to
subject it to verbal analysis,

470
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,750
as long as you're willing to show how
and why the atmosphere is exactly of the

471
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:05,080
nature that it is,
that it arises and other words.

472
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:09,400
And here is um, the relationship
between Rick Richards and Anson,

473
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:14,770
that it arises out of a complex
state of mind that poetry,

474
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:20,350
the poetry of this speaker,
speaker slash murderer,

475
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,670
that poetry is attempting
desperately to reconcile,

476
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:30,090
to harmonize just as he is attempting
desperately to be reconciled and

477
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:34,600
harmonized with the society from
which he has alienated himself.

478
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,110
And of course failing
Macbeth is not Shakespeare.

479
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,180
Shakespeare is poetry.

480
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,130
Attempting to do something which in the
immediate psychological circumstances it

481
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,370
can't do,
but in the process,

482
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,600
evoking an extraordinary complexity of
effort on the part of the mind to be

483
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,370
reconciled through the medium of language.
As I say,

484
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:04,550
this is the sense in which
amps and follows Richards,

485
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,920
but at the same time there's
something rather different between,

486
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,210
first of all,

487
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:16,160
Anson Anson doesn't really kind of settle
into a sense that it's all about the

488
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,780
reader that has to say it's,
it's,

489
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:21,020
it's all about the reader's
experience of the literary.

490
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,230
Richard's is actually an Avatar of
figures like either like a Hans Robert

491
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:27,881
Galson,
Stanley fish who,

492
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:31,910
and we'll be discussing later in the
syllabus who are interested in reader

493
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,710
response.
That is to say,

494
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:38,711
and the way in which we can talk about
the structure of reader experience.

495
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,550
Amazon is sort of interested in
that and just as he's the adjusted,

496
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:48,260
he's fascinated by the texture of,
of, of, of textual evidence itself.

497
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,750
And he is also very interested,

498
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:55,751
much more so than Richards and certainly
more so than the new critics from whom

499
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:58,940
he sharply diverges in advance.
In this respect.

500
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,660
He's also much more interested
in authorial intention.

501
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,520
That is to say for him,

502
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:10,210
literary criticism is always an
appeal to authorial attention.

503
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,443
Mind you,

504
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,480
he ascribes to authorial attention the
most amazingly outrageous things that

505
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:20,840
other critics threw up their
hands in despair about.

506
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:25,990
But nevertheless it is for him always
still an appeal to authorial attention at

507
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:27,884
bottom.

508
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,920
Anson doesn't really settle into the
rigorous consideration of the author or of

509
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:37,070
the text or of the reader as,

510
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,340
as it were a separate functions for Anson.

511
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,440
There's a kind of a fluid and easy
movement back and forth between what for

512
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:51,410
hermeneutics are three very different
phenomena, author, text, reader,

513
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,680
um, for Ramson it's, it's,

514
00:34:53,681 --> 00:34:58,681
it's a kind of synthetic may launch
that appeal that that's ultimately and

515
00:34:59,691 --> 00:35:00,920
appealed to the author.

516
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,690
That certainly involves both the
working on the text itself and also

517
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:10,310
understanding its effect on,
on the reader. So all of this,

518
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:14,240
uh, distances, Anson from
Richard's to a certain extent.

519
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:18,110
But the most important difference I
think between Anson and the other figures

520
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:19,820
were discussing a difference,

521
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:24,650
which makes it even a little bit complex
to say that he's a precursor of the new

522
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:29,651
criticism is that Anson very rarely
concerns himself with the whole of a text.

523
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:39,370
He isn't really interested in the of the
poem is simply interested in saying as

524
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:44,940
much as he can about
certain locally facts.

525
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:49,110
Certainly with the implication
possibly that this has a bearing on our

526
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:52,320
understanding of let's
say the whole of Macbeth,

527
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:57,030
but he doesn't set about
doing a systematic reading
of the whole of Macbeth.

528
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,570
He always zooms in on something,
thinks about it for a while,

529
00:36:00,571 --> 00:36:02,640
and then goes away and
thinks about something else.

530
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Leaving us to decide whether it has a
genuine bearing on the entirety or on the

531
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:12,450
literary wholeness or unity of Macbeth.

532
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,680
Anson is interested in the
complexity of local effects.

533
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,500
And another thing to say
about Emerson's perspective,

534
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:21,150
which makes him differ sharply,

535
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,300
I think from Richards and
from the later new critics,

536
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:29,690
is that Anson is perfectly willing to
accommodate the idea that maybe just as in

537
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:33,360
the case of the psychology of Mac Beth,

538
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:38,361
the character that may be poetry doesn't
reconcile conflicting needs maybe after

539
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:46,161
all poetry is x is an expression of
the irreducible conflict of our needs.

540
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,000
The s the last chapter of
seven types of ambiguity.

541
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:56,001
His seventh ambiguity is actually as
amps and said about some fundamental

542
00:36:57,331 --> 00:36:59,400
division in the writer's mind.

543
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,790
There you see he divergence
from his teacher Richards.

544
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:08,270
He's fascinated by the way in which
literature doesn't unify opposites or

545
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:13,920
reconcile needs but leaves
things as it found them,

546
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:17,340
but exposed in all of their complexity.

547
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,530
Polderman more than once invoked Amston
as a precursor of deconstruction,

548
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,040
not of the new criticism
and for this reason,

549
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:29,910
for the reason that he's not concerned
with unity and that he's not concerned

550
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:33,090
with the idea of the
reconciliation of opposites.

551
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,280
Empson I think can rightly be
understood as a freakin precursor of

552
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:42,720
deconstruction because deconstruction
follows the new criticism of course,

553
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:47,721
and being a mode of close reading and
there has never been a better close reader

554
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,493
then Anson,

555
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:54,650
but it needs to be set before turning
away from Anson who's influenced was

556
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:57,630
widespread despite this divergent.

557
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,840
It needs to be said that his purposes
for close reading are actually very

558
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:07,740
different from the purposes of
the new criticism. New critics,

559
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,500
the American new critics,
particularly Brooks,

560
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:15,150
who's preoccupation with unity
is something he freely confesses.

561
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,280
Uh, and something that, uh, well we've
got 10 minutes, so I'm not going to,

562
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,150
I shouldn't,

563
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:26,150
I shouldn't rush ahead prematurely up
something that you can see to be at the

564
00:38:26,191 --> 00:38:28,470
heart of what Brooks is doing.

565
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,160
Now here he works Brooks in the well
rod earn and modern poetry in the,

566
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,560
and the other books for what she's well
known uses a variety of different words

567
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:46,081
to describe the way in which the
complexity of literature is placed in the

568
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:50,290
service of unification.
In the essay you're reading here,

569
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:54,640
he uses the word irony. He admits that
maybe he stretches the word irony,

570
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:59,320
but he tries to argue that the variety
of effects that he focuses on in his

571
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:04,300
essay, uh, have to do with irony.
And another great essay, the first,

572
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:07,810
the first chapter of the well rod earn,
he talks about paradox.

573
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:12,811
Obviously these are related ideas and
elsewhere he takes up other ways of

574
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:18,810
evoking the way in which sort of complex
feelings and thoughts are brought

575
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:23,260
together. Um, ensigns word ambiguity, uh,

576
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:27,940
continues to play an important role in
the work of the new criticism. And, uh,

577
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,230
and it is,
uh,

578
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:34,430
at least it puts itself forward as a
candidate to be an alternative term that

579
00:39:35,021 --> 00:39:40,021
one might use if one got tired
of saying irony or paradox.

580
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,130
There are a variety of words.

581
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:45,670
In other words and other words
given by the poet critic Allen Tate,

582
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,150
one of the founding figures of
the new criticism is tension.

583
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:54,080
That is to say the way in which,
uh, the literary text resolves, uh,

584
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,890
oppositions, uh, um, uh,

585
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:02,010
as a tension that it's a holding
in suspension of conflict,

586
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,230
experienced as tension.

587
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:10,470
So there are these varieties of ways for
describing what's going on in a text.

588
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,830
It's interesting, I think that if one
thinks of donated the tow truck, um,

589
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:19,330
one can think of the, at the, uh,
when you go home and study it,

590
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:23,890
you'll see what I mean. Uh, there's a
complex pattern of imagery as it were,

591
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,110
between pulling and pushing.

592
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,360
There's a tremendous amount of pulling
and pushing that goes on in Tony.

593
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,740
The tow truck will revert to,

594
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:36,430
especially to the notion of pushing
in other contexts later in the course.

595
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,980
But for the moment you can see,
uh,

596
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,840
the way in which there is a tension
between that which pulls and that which

597
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:48,760
pushes, which is one of the
motive forces of the story. Uh,

598
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,240
and that I think is an
example also if there is,

599
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:57,241
if it is ironic that Tony is now stuck
and instead of pulling needs to be

600
00:40:57,701 --> 00:41:02,560
pushed, if it is in some Brooks in
sense, ironic that that is the case.

601
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,280
Uh,

602
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,280
we can understand that as irony
or as tension or ambiguity.

603
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,790
So in any case, uh, that, you know,

604
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:16,060
there's one way and there's one way in
which Tony is probably not a good proof

605
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:20,140
text for the new criticism. You
remember that in my credo, the little,

606
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:25,350
the little sort of excerpt that you get
at the beginning of the book section in

607
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:30,280
your anthology, Brooke says, um,
poetry should be about moral things,

608
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:34,610
but it shouldn't point a moral
that and obviously, you know,

609
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,150
uh, tone of the tow
truck points immoral. Um,

610
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:43,160
and so would be subject to a kind
of devaluation on those grounds.

611
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:47,870
Uh, but, but the new criticism, even
though there are ways of reading,

612
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:52,700
Tony, as I've been suggesting
new critically right now,

613
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,690
the ideal of unity for Brooks,

614
00:41:56,691 --> 00:42:01,691
for the new critics in general is that
it be complex that it warp the statements

615
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,500
of science that it bring to bear a
tension between the denotation and the

616
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:15,320
connotation of words that were yellow in
the second line of Tony, the tow truck,

617
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:19,040
it's denotation is that
it is a certain color,

618
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,460
the color that Tony's garages painted.

619
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:27,850
The connotation I have suggested is
of the variety of kinds that one might

620
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,160
gingerly approach.
Uh,

621
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,900
in thinking about complicating
the texture of the story,

622
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,940
uh, in any case, uh,

623
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:42,950
the tension between Dana rotation and
connotation is part of the way in which

624
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:46,940
irony works.
So the question again is,

625
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:50,750
and the question it seems to me raised
in advanced by Amston is why should these

626
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,330
sorts of tension, these,
these movements of,

627
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:58,440
of complex reconciliation result in unity.
Uh,

628
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:02,360
it's very interesting. Brooks is reading
if she dwelt among on common ways.

629
00:43:02,361 --> 00:43:07,361
The Wonderful Lucy poem by Wordsworth
emphasizes the irony of the poem

630
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,660
Brookfield's that he's on very
thin ice talking about Wordsworth,

631
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,410
Ian Irony at all, but at
the same time, you know,

632
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:20,150
does bring it out rather beautifully
talking about the irony of the poem, uh,

633
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:25,151
basically as the way in which you can't
really say that Lucy can be a flower and

634
00:43:26,181 --> 00:43:31,160
a star simultaneously. She's a flower,
she's perishable, she's half hidden,

635
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:35,540
uh, she's ultimately dead
and in the ground. Uh,

636
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,190
whereas a star,
uh,

637
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,660
would seem to be something that
she just can't be mapped onto.

638
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:44,360
If she is this half hidden thing,
but at the same times work says,

639
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:47,180
well after all she is
a star to the speaker.

640
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:52,330
He's just saying she's a star to me.
She has a flower half hidden, uh,

641
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,590
unnoticed to everyone else.

642
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:59,330
And the relationship between the depth
of the speakers feeling and the obscurity

643
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:04,130
of Lucy in the world is the irony
that the speaker wants to lay hold of.

644
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,270
And that reconciles,
uh,

645
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,890
what seem like disparate
facts in the poem.

646
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:16,030
Well now I just want to point out that
close reading can always be pushed

647
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,590
farther. That's the difficulty
about close reading. You know,

648
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:25,250
it's all very well to say, look at
me, I'm reconciling harmony's, I'm,

649
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:28,070
I'm, you know, I'm creating patterns. I'm,

650
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,530
I'm showing the purpose of image
clusters and all the rest of it.

651
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:37,200
But if you keep doing it,
once you have yoked together,

652
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:42,150
becomes on yoked again, it falls apart.
Or at least it threatens to do so.

653
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:47,390
A contemporary of Brooks is named FW
Bateson wrote an essay on this same poems

654
00:44:48,731 --> 00:44:53,490
she dwelt among on tried and ways in
which he points out this is the palms on

655
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,280
page eight oh two in which he points out

656
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:03,890
that the poem is full of
oxymorons contradictions in
terms untrodden ways away

657
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:11,130
as a path. But how can they be a
path if it's not trodden? What?

658
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:15,810
What is the meaning of an
untrodden way or in an or?

659
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:20,850
There are none to praise her,
but very few to love. Why?

660
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,620
Why call attention?

661
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,660
Not so much to the difference between
few lover and non praiser as the notion

662
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:32,160
that non praiser this is palpably false
because here's the poet praising her,

663
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,030
right? So what does he mean?
None? Why is he calling attention?

664
00:45:36,031 --> 00:45:37,740
In other words to this,
this,

665
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:42,770
this logical disparity she lived
unknown and few could know.

666
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,820
How can she be unknown if you know
anything about her. In other words,

667
00:45:47,821 --> 00:45:52,230
the palm is full of,
not of of complexities,

668
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:57,210
but who says they're being
reconciled. They're just
sitting there. Oxymoronic Lee,

669
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:01,640
you know, not reconciling
themselves at all. So Bates,

670
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:06,330
his argument is that Wordsworth
is calling attention to a,

671
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:11,450
to a conflict of emotion or
feeling that can't be reconciled.

672
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:17,250
Hence the path those of the ending.
Oh, the difference to me and so on.

673
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:22,170
And this, as I say, uh, is a
different use of close reading.

674
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,190
It's close reading,

675
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:27,540
which is not in the service
of unity or of unification,

676
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:32,690
but recognizes that the very arts whereby
we see a thing as a unified whole can

677
00:46:34,431 --> 00:46:39,330
just as easily be put to the purpose
of blasting it apart again and,

678
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,660
uh, and, and of calling
our attention to that,

679
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:47,690
which can't be reconciled just as the
speaker can't be reconciled to the death

680
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:49,944
of Lucy.

681
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:55,200
Now the new critics can,
I think,

682
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:57,540
be criticized for that reason.

683
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:00,370
And the aftermath of the,

684
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:05,420
the historical close reading aftermath
of the new criticism does precisely that.

685
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,003
The,
if,

686
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:13,040
if one sees deconstruction as a response
to the new criticism and it's not just

687
00:47:13,381 --> 00:47:14,310
that as we'll see,

688
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:18,750
it's a great many other things to that
response consists essentially in saying,

689
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:23,070
look, you can't just arbitrarily tie a
ribbon around something and say, Aha,

690
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,130
it's a unity, right? The ribbon comes off,

691
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:31,120
things fly apart as the poet. Uh, and uh,

692
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,390
it's not a unity after all.
Uh,

693
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,410
there is another aspect of the way
in which the new criticism has been

694
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:42,220
criticized for the last 40 or 50 years,
which needs to be touched on.

695
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:45,400
The notion of autonomy,

696
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:50,550
the notion of the freedom of the poem
from any kind of dependence in the world

697
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,830
is something that is very
easy to undermine. Critically.

698
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:02,200
Think of Brooks's analysis of Randall,
Gerald's eighth air force.

699
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:07,290
It concludes on the last page of the
essay by saying this is a bomb about human

700
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:11,380
nature,
about human nature under stress.

701
00:48:11,381 --> 00:48:14,620
Whether or not human
nature is or is not good.

702
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,280
And arguments of this kind arguments of
the kind set forth by the poem can make

703
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:24,820
better citizens of us.
In other words,

704
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:28,240
the experience of reading poetry is
not just an aesthetic experience.

705
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:32,470
It's not just a question of private
reconciliation, of, of conflicting needs.

706
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:35,470
It's a social experience on this view.

707
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:40,300
And the social experience is
intrinsically a conservative one.

708
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:41,410
In other words,

709
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:45,940
it insists on the need
to balance opinions,

710
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:51,120
to balance viewpoints to balance needs
precisely in a way which is of course,

711
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:52,680
uh,

712
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,680
in implicitly a kind of
social and political centrism.

713
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:01,690
In other words,
how can poetry on this view,

714
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,320
how can literature be
progressive for that matter?

715
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,140
How can it be reactionary?
How, in other words,

716
00:49:08,141 --> 00:49:13,141
can it be put to political purposes
if there's this underlying,

717
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:18,840
this implicit centrism in
this notion of reconciliation,

718
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:21,580
harmonization balance.

719
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:27,330
And that is has been a frequent source
of the criticism of the new criticism,

720
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:31,930
uh, in its aftermath over
the last 40 or 50 years.

721
00:49:31,931 --> 00:49:34,150
There's also the question of religion.

722
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,770
There's a kind of implicit Episcopalian
perspective that you see in Brooks is

723
00:49:38,771 --> 00:49:43,000
essay, what he's talking about, the
Shakespeare poem, uh, in which, um,

724
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,090
in which under the aspect of eternity,

725
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:50,750
inevitably things here on
earth seem ironic. And,

726
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:55,780
and there is always, there's, there's that
play of thought, uh, uh, throughout, uh,

727
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:58,630
the thinking of the new criticism as well.
Naturally,

728
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:01,090
one will think of things in ironic terms.

729
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:06,130
If one sees them from the perspective
of the divine or of the eternal moment.
