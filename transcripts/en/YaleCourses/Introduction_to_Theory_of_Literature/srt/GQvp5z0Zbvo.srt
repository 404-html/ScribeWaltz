1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:01,621
Well,

2
00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:06,621
I'd like to begin by pointing out that
the first name of Frederic Jameson is

3
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:11,790
spelled f. R. E. D. R. I. C. Uh,

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,830
there isn't, I point that out is that, uh,

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,000
most scholars don't seem to be
able to grasp that simple fact, uh,

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,150
and that references to him,
which are rife in the critical literature.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,500
Uh, perhaps one third of the
time spell his first name wrong.

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,320
So I thought it would be important for
you to be among the cornea shanti. Uh,

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,560
and to know that it is spelled
in the way that I just mentioned.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,720
It's a strange thing. Um, when I
started teaching, I taught many, many,

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,800
many sections of English one 29,
uh,

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,490
and of course in the second semester,
the first text that we read was the Iliad.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,930
Now ill, it is spelled I l. I a. D.

14
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,110
Why it is that of the student population
I taught over all those years,

15
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:04,680
hundreds and hundreds of students,
fully. A third of them spelled it I, l.

16
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,560
L. I. A. D I really couldn't say,

17
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,730
but there are words that simply seem
to be in susceptible of being spelled

18
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:13,110
correctly.
And one,

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,630
and one of those words is the first
name of Frederic Jameson. So, um,

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,620
stand advised. Uh, okay. Now, um,

21
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,650
last time I talked about four possible
options of an aesthetic nature,

22
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,530
uh, for a Marxist approach to
literature and passed them in review,

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,630
a imagined realism,

24
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:41,631
both realism according to the tastes and
theoretical preferences of angles and

25
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:47,760
Luke couch also tendentious realism,
uh,

26
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,330
as it pervaded, uh, the Soviet world,

27
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:56,331
especially after 1934 a then also part
of the participatory aesthetic of figures

28
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:00,570
like Vaulter Benyamin,

29
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,190
the high modernist aesthetic of the whole,
uh,

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,270
embraced particularly by
Adorno. Those are the two, uh,

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,440
aesthetic modes that we passed in
review last time. Uh, and finally,

32
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:17,760
the idea that realism
being somehow out worn,

33
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,481
uh,

34
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:23,010
having a developed hardening of the
arteries as a kind of a bourgeois

35
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:25,020
perspective on things,
uh,

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,310
needs somehow or another to be
replaced as theoretically, uh,

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,660
in the Marxists do things
by something else. Uh,

38
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:38,610
and perhaps the most eloquent proponent
of replacing it with something,

39
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,930
uh,
is Jameson,

40
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,940
who earlier in the introductory
chapter of the political unconscious,

41
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,270
uh, much of which you've
been assigned for today. Uh,

42
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:53,010
writes a section which he
calls magical narratives, uh,

43
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:55,810
and which, uh, uh, promotes, um,

44
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:01,000
very much in keeping with the thinking
of Northrop Frye about the role of

45
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:03,280
romance in society,

46
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:07,990
particularly the religious
role of romance in society, uh,

47
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,890
proposes that and
aesthetic of the romance,

48
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:16,840
which entails a folklore, the
folk tale, the fairy tale,

49
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,470
uh,

50
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,470
various forms of folk expression as
magical resolution of conflicts that can't

51
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,460
otherwise be resolved,
uh,

52
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,510
is the more appropriate
aesthetic to take up.

53
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,750
And the long passage that
I sent to you last night,

54
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,340
which I'd like quickly
to go over, um, is, uh,

55
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,240
meant to further the promotion of,

56
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,730
of this aesthetic and also,
uh,

57
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,790
to pose for us a critique of what the
consequences would be of lingering with a

58
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:56,200
realist aesthetic.
And so Jameson says,

59
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,210
second passage on your sheet,

60
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,810
let Scott Balzac and Dreiser serve as the,

61
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:06,370
and remember that Balzac is the favorite
author of angles and Scott is the

62
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,770
favorite author of at
least in 1927 of Lucaj, uh,

63
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,680
and drives her is a figure from
the so-called naturalist movement,

64
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,680
the American novelist, uh, who, uh,

65
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:22,290
is a very appropriate addition to the
list. And so it's in that context that,

66
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,720
uh, that Jameson is dropping
these particular names.

67
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,960
Let Scott Balzac and Dreiser serve as
the non chronological markers of the

68
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:34,120
emergence of realism in its modern form.

69
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,480
These first great realism's
are characterized by a
fundamental and exhilarating

70
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:44,821
heterogeneity in their raw materials and
by a corresponding versatility in their

71
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:48,070
narrative apparatus at such moments,

72
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,310
a generic confinement to the existence.
In other words,

73
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,060
the only thing you have to do if you're
a realist is talk about things the way

74
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,820
they really are. Uh, at such moments,

75
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,940
a generic confinement to the existent
has a paradoxically liberating effect on

76
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:07,810
the registers of the text and releases
a set of heterogeneous historical

77
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:11,840
perspectives. The past for
Scott, the future for Balzac.

78
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,010
And the process of commodification for
Dreiser normally felt to be inconsistent

79
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,980
with a focus on the historical present.
In other words,

80
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Scott's treatment of history
is dialectical against
the foil of the present.

81
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:31,160
There is a envisioned, a kind
of romanticized feudal, um,

82
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,530
uh, evocation of a feudal
past. Uh, and so it is in turn.

83
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:38,930
I don't want to linger long over
this with the other writers, uh,

84
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,630
normally felt to be inconsistent with
a focus on historical presence. Indeed,

85
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,750
this multiple temporality tends to be
sealed off and really contained again in

86
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:54,100
high realism and naturalism. In other
words, it starts getting too easy.

87
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,480
And the formulas of representing and
evoking the real began to become,

88
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:02,930
as I said, sclerotic, very
begin. They begin to harden.

89
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,480
They'd begin to confine us in ways,
uh,

90
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,720
that had hitherto been liberating where
a perfected narrative apparatus in

91
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:16,160
particular, the threefold imperatives
of authorial depersonalization.

92
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,020
That is to say the voice in steel and
direct labor ally to write, uh, uh,

93
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,920
indirect discourse, uh,
authorial depersonalization,

94
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:30,070
unity of point of view and restriction
to scenic representation begin to confer

95
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,900
on the realistic option,

96
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,610
the appearance of an US fixating
self-imposed pennants. And other words.

97
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,850
This is all I can say,
and this is the only way I can say it.

98
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,680
There are no other possibilities,
uh,

99
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,790
of literary expression because
I now feel confined to this,

100
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,130
uh,
to this reification of the reel.

101
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,760
This insistence that, uh, the real, um,

102
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,440
the evocation of the reel is
my only literary option. Uh,

103
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,550
and so it's no longer liberating.
Uh,

104
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,780
it is in the context of this gradual
reification in late capitalism that the

105
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:13,481
romance once again comes to be felt as
the place of narrative heterogeneity and

106
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:19,530
freedom from the reality
principle. And that is, uh,

107
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,310
in a way of jab at Freud,
uh,

108
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,000
but at the same time and
acknowledgement that Freud, uh,

109
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:31,030
participates in a sort of growing
despair over the necessity of confining

110
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:35,510
oneself to the real, um, the,

111
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,440
and freedom from the reality
principle to which a now oppressive,

112
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,560
realistic representation is the hostage.
Okay.

113
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,580
So that's the aesthetic
of Frederic Jameson.

114
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,180
And before we begin and analysis,
that is to say,

115
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:55,181
before we begin to consider his three
horizons or concentric circles of

116
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:58,370
interpretation from other points of view,

117
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,520
I thought it would be interesting to find
this romance aesthetic in those three

118
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:07,580
levels. We're talking of
course about the political,

119
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,170
the social, the historical,
the political, uh,

120
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,380
the kind of chronicle,
like as he puts it,

121
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,970
a record of successive,
uh, happen happenings,

122
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,120
ineffective context as a constructed
it as a plot by some individual voice,

123
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,460
the social as the conflict
or emergence into,

124
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,470
uh,

125
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:40,470
our awareness of its being a conflict
of what Jameson calls ideology teams.

126
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:46,510
That is to say ways of thinking about
the world as expressed by disparate and

127
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:52,490
conflicting classes.
And then finally the historical,

128
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,440
which Jameson calls necessity. At the
end of the essay he says it's what hurts.

129
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,110
Ah,

130
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,110
but which in terms of literary
analysis as we'll see has to do with

131
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:08,601
understanding the overlap of the
succession of modes of production as they

132
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,970
unfold in historical time.

133
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,360
And we'll have more to say
about modes of production,

134
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:21,060
but our basic three horizons then,
uh,

135
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,560
which are in which I'm now going
to look for the romance aesthetic.

136
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,030
Our basic three horizons then are
what Jameson calls the political,

137
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:32,490
the social and the historical.
It's,

138
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,170
it's important that he does sometimes
call them concentric circles because you

139
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:41,640
have to understand that as you
advance through the three stages,

140
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,340
you're not leaving anything behind.

141
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,180
The historical is contained within
the social and the social is contained

142
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:51,360
within,
I'm sorry,

143
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:56,280
the political is contained within the
social and the social is contained within

144
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,400
the historical and all of that is what
we is not to be left behind but is rather

145
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:05,910
to be rethought.

146
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,620
Reconsidered Jameson sometimes
use the word rewritten,

147
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,660
a thinking of the text that want,
that is the object of one study. Uh,

148
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,770
as one advances through these
three stages. So that's why,

149
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,030
that's why he thinks it appropriate
to call them concentric circles. Well,

150
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:27,390
in any case,
so what is the political,

151
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,850
the essential political,
uh,

152
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,360
moment of the creative act?
Well,

153
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:38,361
it's what Jameson borrowing from
Kenneth Burke calls the symbolic act.

154
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,070
As an individual writer,

155
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,790
I undertake to resolve
symbolically a contradiction.

156
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,760
And Marxism is always about contradiction.

157
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:55,140
That is to say the way in which the way
in which the perspective of any class,

158
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,310
uh,

159
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,510
exists in country in a
contradictory relation,

160
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,430
both with its own needs and
desires and with other classes.

161
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,151
In any case,

162
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:11,151
then the symbolic act at the political
level is designed to resolve a

163
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:16,590
contradiction that can't
be resolved by other means.

164
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,390
In other words, it's a
fantasy. It is the fairy tale.

165
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,790
It is the princess and the pauper.

166
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,940
It is the arbitrary happy ending tacked
onto a situation for which in reality

167
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:34,350
there would be no happy ending.
In other words,

168
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,820
it is a romance perspective about a world,

169
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,650
the re the realistic
approach to which, um, uh,

170
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,460
would somehow or another leave
us feeling much more confined.

171
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,560
Slumdog millionaire, uh,
is an interesting example.

172
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,610
Uh, it's an old tourists
film made by Danny Boyle. Uh,

173
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,680
an interesting example of an individual
act which magically resolves a

174
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:08,010
contradiction through the whole Bollywood
apparatus that it brings to bear on

175
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:12,910
it. And the contradictions of course,
are rife between his Hindu and Muslim.

176
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,440
The contradictions entailed and
globalization, the contradictions of cast.

177
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,620
All of these contradictions not to
be resolved on a realistic plane,

178
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,880
nevertheless, can be resolved
by an individual symbolic act.

179
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:31,390
You hit the lotto, you know, you win, uh,

180
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,190
against all odds.

181
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,020
A prize that makes you a millionaire
who wants to be a millionaire?

182
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,280
Have we all want to be millionaires,
but only one of us,

183
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,760
the miraculously, magically, uh,

184
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,790
through a series of completely implausible
happen happenstances is able to do

185
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:52,780
so.
Now notice this.

186
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,240
It's not that it doesn't happen.
People do hit the lotto.

187
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,850
People do when the $64 thousand
thousand dollar question of whatever.

188
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,910
It's not that, it's not that
it's absolute never, never land.

189
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,960
But the point is,
and,

190
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,960
and I think this is really ultimately
the point of that extravagant dance and

191
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,900
the railroad station. At the
end of the film, the point,

192
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:22,050
the point is that even
were to happen in reality,

193
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,460
it wouldn't resolve contradictions.

194
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,410
That is to say your life would not
have the kind of scripted perfection.

195
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,220
You get the girl,
everything is going to be perfect.

196
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,990
The whole world falls in line
dancing behind you. You know,

197
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,640
this just this, this just
doesn't happen. In other words,

198
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,090
it's sort of tragic to hit the lotto.

199
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:51,270
As many stories of that kind have made
clear to us and that it seems to me is

200
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:57,181
finally how the film is somewhat self
conscious about its nature as a symbolic

201
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:00,460
act in any way.

202
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,550
That's the romance element of the
political level of interpretation as

203
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,880
understood by Jameson.
Now the second level

204
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:16,410
brings to the surface the element of
subversion that has to be entailed in this

205
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:24,091
same fairy tale resolution of a conflict
that can't otherwise be resolved.

206
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,800
There are all sorts of other
aspects at the second level,

207
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:34,720
but remember I'm discovering the romance
aesthetic here in all three levels

208
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,820
before turning to other matters
having to do them. So let's say,

209
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,090
I mean at the second
level, on page 12, 97, uh,

210
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,310
the right hand column,
um, you have, um, uh,

211
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,160
aunts blocks understanding
of the fairytale.

212
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,550
This is at the second level by about
two thirds of the way down. Thus,

213
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:56,181
for instance,

214
00:14:56,181 --> 00:15:00,890
blocks reading of the fairytale with
its magical wish fulfillments and it's

215
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:05,891
utopian fantasies of plenty and the pay
to you restores the dialogical and the

216
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:08,960
Big Rock Candy Mountain,

217
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,960
basically as the paid Corecon restores
the dialogical and antagonistic content

218
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:20,081
of this form by exhibiting it
as a systematic deconstruction
and undermining of

219
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:25,310
the hedge demonic aristocratic
form of the epic. In other words,

220
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,150
it's not just a symbolic act,
the fairy tale.

221
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,290
It is a thumbing of the
nose at hedge emoney.

222
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,700
It is in other words
and act of antagonism,

223
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:43,180
which of course recognizes
the impossibility of
resolution or reconciliation

224
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,730
precisely in its register of antagonism.

225
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:51,440
So that at the second level,

226
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:56,441
the social level in which the
ideological voices of various glasses and

227
00:15:56,961 --> 00:16:00,260
perspective are openly in conflict.

228
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,500
You don't get resolution once you
get is subversion and reaction.

229
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,790
You get,
in other words,

230
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,970
a tension of voices that is not meant to
resolve anything but as rather meant to

231
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:19,070
lay bare the conflicts that are entailed.

232
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,340
And still, however, in doing this,

233
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,660
you get the kind of the,
the, the kind of of, uh,

234
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:30,230
carnivalesque uprising from below,

235
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,500
which a Jameson associates with
romance that letting off of steam,

236
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,780
that, uh, uh,

237
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,100
entertaining the possibility
of utopia that you get,

238
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,570
for example, in the early modern
period on that day, which is called,

239
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,420
uh,

240
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,210
in which someone is called
the Lord of Misrule.

241
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:57,830
And the entire social order
for one day is inverted, uh,

242
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,890
and the low are elevated to
a positions of authority.

243
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:08,000
Uh, and for one day, uh, you get
the keys to the castle and effect.

244
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:13,210
This is a day in which
conflict is expressed and not
resolved because everybody

245
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:18,620
knows that tomorrow it's going
to be the same old, same old, uh,

246
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,480
and back to business as usual.
And so, but the romance element,

247
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,450
the idea that the idea that the,

248
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:31,451
that folk expression is simultaneously
the expression of a wish,

249
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:39,170
a wish, similar to the wish that's
expressed at the first political level,

250
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,610
but, but, but, but the expression
of a wish, which is collective,

251
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:48,611
that is to say in behalf of a class and
a perspective and which is also with

252
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,280
great consciousness,

253
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,690
not aware that can in any
way expect to be fulfilled,

254
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,780
but rather one that has used subversively
with respect to the dominant ideology.

255
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:08,280
Uh, that it, it, it, it, it,
it expresses its abrasiveness.

256
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:13,430
A tort third level
involves the way in which,

257
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,000
uh, there is at any given
time, the historical level,

258
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,360
a dominant mode of production.

259
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,520
Emotive production is a system is
a system of thought or production,

260
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,450
uh,
generated by a,

261
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:34,900
an overarching social or
economic arrangement. Uh,

262
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,660
Jameson lists them in his text.
Uh, and we'll come back to them.

263
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,990
Uh, and we'll read that listing
and we'll think about those terms.

264
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,200
The Jameson gives an excellent example
of the way in which in the latter part of

265
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:50,910
the 18th century,

266
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:55,911
the enlightenment began to be
the dominant form of expression.

267
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,210
All of an emergent Merkin toll
successfully capitalist bourgeoisie.

268
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,710
That is to say the values
that drove, uh, uh,

269
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,770
the development of industrialization and
capital were those values emerging from

270
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:18,900
feudal, uh, and aristocratic ideals,

271
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,100
less realistic,
less engaged with actuality,

272
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:26,940
and the way in which you can actually
get things done in the world. Uh,

273
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
the enlightenment is understood as an
expression of an emerging new mode of

274
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:38,550
production. Capitalism,
Asic succeeds feudalism,

275
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,540
but Jameson points out and
here's where romance comes in.

276
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,850
And then after that we'll
move on to our next point.

277
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,450
But Jameson points out at the same time
you get enlightenment at the same time

278
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:55,470
that that does seem to become
the dominant form of expression.

279
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,980
You also get two modes of
resistance or contest station.

280
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,200
On the one hand,
you have romanticism,

281
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:09,201
which can be understood in this context
as a kind of atavistic throwback to

282
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,670
aristocratic and futile idealism,
codes of conduct,

283
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:19,090
beliefs, uh, uh, visions of Utopia, uh,

284
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,910
within romanticism.
All of them sort of trying to re code,

285
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,730
uh, in an age of enlightenment, um,

286
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:31,530
various sorts of idealism that
had come to seem outmoded.

287
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,560
So that's a kind of of, uh, as it were,

288
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:39,590
reactionary mode of production overlapping
with or expressing itself through,

289
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,940
uh,
the dominant one.

290
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,120
And then at the same time you get folk
resistance to the mechanization of the

291
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:54,361
enlightenment with political economy
and with the rise of social engineering,

292
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,060
uh, and with the various forms of, of,

293
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,710
of social organization associated
with utilitarian. With utilitarianism,

294
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,410
you get, uh, you get folk resistance,

295
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:10,411
you get popular resistance in the
forms of protest frame breaking,

296
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,820
a disruption of labor activity,
uh,

297
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,430
protest against industrialization,

298
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,580
all of which also because it insists
on earlier forms of agricultural and

299
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:27,610
industrial sort of cottage industry.

300
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,850
And it's on all of
which is also atavistic.

301
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:36,060
Also a throwback to the way in which
labor is performed or conducted,

302
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:41,110
a under feudalism. And so that to, uh,

303
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:46,170
in the form of folk
expression of longing for,

304
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:50,470
in this case a utopian past,
more agrarian,

305
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,270
more individualized,
as, as a mode of labor,

306
00:21:55,271 --> 00:22:00,130
more cottage or added in all
of this, you get, um, uh,

307
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,010
an overlapping mode of production.

308
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:06,040
So the tension among modes of production,

309
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,360
which is the focus of analysis
at the historical level,

310
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:15,361
the third historical level can also be
understood in terms of the romance of

311
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,090
Utopian Nostalgia.
All right,

312
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,200
so that then just to show
how Jameson's aesthetic,

313
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,500
his sense of the importance of romance
can be seen to pervade the way in which

314
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:33,610
he understands analysis at
all three of these levels.

315
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,300
So that's his aesthetic question then,

316
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:42,301
is what is the interpretive payoff of
undertaking literary analysis at these

317
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,350
three levels? That is
to say, why should we,

318
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:52,060
why should we take the trouble to do it?
What's so interesting about it? Well,

319
00:22:52,061 --> 00:22:55,750
from Jameson's point of view,
this of course is the title of his book.

320
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:00,000
Each of these three modes of analysis,
uh,

321
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,940
is designed to disclose,
to uncover,

322
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,360
to lay bare and element of
the political unconscious.

323
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,930
As for deconstruction.
As for Freud,

324
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,730
this sense of a political
unconscious exposes,

325
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,760
reveals something that is antithetical
to ordinary consciousness.

326
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:28,150
That is to say, uh, undermines the,

327
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:33,270
our conventional understanding of things
shows us that beneath our conventional

328
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:35,230
understanding of things,

329
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,310
there are laws and causes
and dynamics at work, uh,

330
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,170
that we need to understand.
Uh, in this case, however,

331
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,470
the unconscious and question is
not a linguistic unconscious.

332
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,320
It is not a psychological unconscious.

333
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:56,120
It is a political unconscious in so far.
In other words,

334
00:23:56,121 --> 00:24:00,470
as we are political animals,
the acts that we perform,

335
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,200
the dialogues that we engage in,

336
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,710
the modes of production
that we participate in,

337
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,880
all of them have political ramifications.
That is to say,

338
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,040
we w we,

339
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:17,041
we do what we do as opposed to doing other
things for political reasons of which

340
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:20,630
we may not be fully aware.

341
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Hence the emphasis in analysis of this
kind on the political unconscious.

342
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,780
So again,
the three levels,

343
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,590
going back to the idea
of the symbolic act,

344
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,770
what political unconscious in other words,

345
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,630
is revealed by a, by a symbolic act? Well,

346
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,610
Jameson gives a wonderful example
taken from structuralism and he,

347
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:50,930
and you can see that he leans very
heavily on structuralism for his

348
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:52,640
understanding,
uh,

349
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:57,320
of the way in which of the way in which
something is going on in a narrative

350
00:24:57,321 --> 00:25:02,210
form of which it is not immediately
apparent that anybody can be aware.

351
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:06,200
Take for example,
[inaudible] face painting.

352
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,720
Why Levy Strauss asks both
in the savage mind and again,

353
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:12,710
in Trieste stroke peak,

354
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,720
why the excessive complexity
of these paintings,

355
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,900
why the curious tension in the marks on
the faces between the vertical and the

356
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:30,050
horizontal? Why is, you
know, why, in other words,

357
00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:34,520
do you get a kind of, have a feeling
of tension, aesthetic beauty,

358
00:25:34,521 --> 00:25:36,030
but also of, of, of,

359
00:25:36,031 --> 00:25:40,260
of tension and complication
in this cross hatching,

360
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,280
in the sense of the relation between the
vertical and the horizontal Jameson's

361
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:49,940
argument, which he brings out
more clearly than Levy Strauss.

362
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:51,890
But Levy Strauss says the same thing.

363
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,930
A contrasting the Caddo video in this
respect that with neighboring tribes like

364
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:57,764
the Bharara,

365
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,410
the explanation is that the
category are a hierarchical society,

366
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,280
uh,

367
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:09,280
in which there are open and obvious forms
of inequality that one must perforce

368
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:14,270
be aware of as a member of the tribe,

369
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,700
but that neighboring tribes,

370
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:20,150
and this is something that probably
the tribe itself can observe,

371
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:25,540
work out a way of seeming to resolve
the contradictions and to inherent in

372
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:29,450
hierarchy by the exchange of loyalty,

373
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:32,630
moieties of or which is to say, of, of,

374
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,010
of kinship gifts and wedding
gifts and so on. Uh, that, uh,

375
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,040
that Levy Strauss talks about and this
exchange of mortise seems to impose on

376
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:47,760
these social orders in real life,
in real terms,

377
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:53,110
a way of making society more
equal than it might otherwise be.

378
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:59,130
Yes, it's still hierarchical, but at
the same time, wealth is distributed.

379
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Each person has his own form of
asserting dignity and Zoe on the cat Aveo

380
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:09,090
doesn't have this Levy
Strauss's and Jameson's boy
is that the [inaudible] never

381
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:14,091
really worked that out so that they're
stuck with a simple form of hierarchical

382
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:18,090
organization face painting.

383
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,120
Then according to Levy Strauss followed
by Janssen is their way of symbolically

384
00:27:24,451 --> 00:27:29,430
resolving the problem by
introducing the horizontal,

385
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,890
by introducing,
in other words,

386
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:36,891
the ways in which other tribes have
successfully offset hierarchy by ways of

387
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:45,290
distributing wealth more equally deep
wealth and prestige more equally and that

388
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,720
the symbolic act which other tribes were
able to accomplish in real life in real

389
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:54,720
terms,
the Caddo Aveo Express,

390
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,950
I accomplish individually each individual
woman painting her face as a symbolic

391
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,920
act,

392
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,920
a symbolic act expressing the political
unconscious because this is not an act

393
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:11,280
we suppose of which any
individual is aware.

394
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,980
I mean you can the unawareness,

395
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:18,981
the lack of consciousness of what's
going on and a story is much more readily

396
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:24,021
available to us in the
Oedipus myth because that's
the part of Levy Strauss is a

397
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:27,390
structural study of myth.
We happy it happened to have read.

398
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:29,950
The next part is category or basement,

399
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,960
but the structure and the Structural
Study of Myth Levy Strauss begins by

400
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:38,670
talking about the Oedipus might as well.
The whole point of that is cheap.

401
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,760
There's a terrible contradiction born
from two or born from one plainly,

402
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,440
no individual version of the story,

403
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:50,270
certainly not Sophocles
version is sang to itself. Oh,

404
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,780
this is a terrible contradiction.

405
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:55,800
I don't know whether I'm born for two
people or born from one person. That's,

406
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:00,480
that is the unconscious. In other words
of the story which is brought out,

407
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:05,160
brought to the surface by a
structuralist analysis of the meth.

408
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,580
Jameson doesn't talk about it because
it's not in any obvious and immediate way

409
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:15,900
a political problem or a problem
susceptible of Marxist analysis.

410
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,250
It is perhaps ultimately everything
is, but, uh, not immediately.

411
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:24,910
And so he turns instead to a discussion
of the cat countervail myth, um,

412
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,310
which has as it's unconscious and issue,
that's obviously a political one,

413
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,760
but it is nevertheless the case that a
structural analysis of a symbolic act is

414
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:43,100
designed to and will inevitably reveal
an element of unconscious thought,

415
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,520
political or otherwise.

416
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,840
And that then is the way in which the
political unconscious as Jameson describes

417
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:57,560
it, is brought out at the first
political level of understanding, uh,

418
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:01,450
the individual symbolic act,
not the second level,

419
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:05,620
the social in which the
text as Jameson says,

420
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,700
rewrites itself,
not as an individual act,

421
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,350
but as very much in the
spirit of buck teen, um,

422
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,480
a Hetero Glossop expression of voices of
points of view writing themselves as it

423
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:24,430
were through the text there,

424
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:29,200
the political unconscious in
question, um, is something that,

425
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,790
uh, it has to be understood in terms
of ideology means in other words,

426
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:38,791
people reflexively xpress perhaps
unbeknownst to themselves,

427
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,240
views and opinions which are intelligible,

428
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:46,210
not arising out of their individuality,

429
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,050
not because they are who they
are as they themselves might say,

430
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,200
but rather because of their
economic class and prestige status.

431
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,630
In other words,
because of their place in the world,

432
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,410
it follows that they
will hold certain views,

433
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:06,940
they will be the mouthpieces, in
other words, for certain ideology,

434
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:11,680
genes and those ideologies.
Uh, Jameson understands, uh,

435
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,940
to be at least in part
unconscious one doesn't know.

436
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:20,620
And other words that the opinions
one so fervently expresses.

437
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:25,860
And so devoutly believes in our opinions
conditioned by the social circumstances

438
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,680
in which one finds oneself.

439
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,640
So that literature then becomes
a kind of drama of ideology,

440
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:39,220
means a representation of
unresolved conflict, uh,

441
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,200
sort of manifest in the variety of class,

442
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:48,280
uh, or status voices, uh, brought to bear.

443
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,130
And you can see this is
the point at which, uh,

444
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:56,190
Jameson's work is closest to Bach teens
and most and most clearly reflects some

445
00:31:57,161 --> 00:32:01,600
of the preoccupations of Bactine as,
as we've encountered them already.

446
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,760
Jameson gives a very good example of
the way in which this conflict works

447
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:11,761
because it's a at par part of the
mystery of these clashes as that they are

448
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:14,590
always present as is,

449
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:18,610
that they always present themselves
with a sh within a shared code.

450
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:22,690
This already begins to look forward to
the idea of the mode of production. Uh,

451
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,970
at the bottom of page 12, 96, Jameson
who was talking about the grit,

452
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:33,020
the violent religious controversies
of the 17th century in England,

453
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,570
uh, between cavalier and
roundhead, between, uh,

454
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,810
all the controversies
surrounding, uh, the, uh,

455
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:46,520
interregnum of Commonweal, uh, the
restoration of Charles the second, uh,

456
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:51,100
and the tremendous ferment religion,
largely religious ferment, uh,

457
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,350
taking place during those
periods during that period.

458
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,450
But this ferment for any Marxist and
Christopher Hill is the leading historian

459
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,420
writing about this period who has made,

460
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:06,680
made it most clearly a
intelligible in these terms. Uh,

461
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:08,330
for any Marxist.
These,

462
00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:13,331
this conflict has an underlying political
unconscious that is its ultimate

463
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:18,890
motives are and assertion
of rights, uh, and, uh,

464
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,290
an expression of class views.

465
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,070
This is the way James and
puts it bottom of page 1296.

466
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:29,630
The normal form of the dialogical
is essentially an antagonistic one.

467
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:34,631
He's referees at alluding here to Bactine
for whom frequently the dialogical is

468
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:38,660
simply a kind of a happy
cacophony of voices,

469
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,550
a carnivalesque, uh,
expression of chaos from below,

470
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:48,620
all of which is a kind of yeast like
ferment. Um, and somehow or another,

471
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:52,440
and the long run, uh, energizing, uh,

472
00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:54,710
and socially progressive,
uh,

473
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:59,660
but Jameson points up that dial
that the dialogue them is, is,

474
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:04,400
is very often a expressive of
conflict as well and antagonistic one.

475
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,640
And that the dialogue of class struggle
is one in which two opposing discourses

476
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,090
fight it out within the
general unity of a shared code.

477
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,190
Thus,
for instance,

478
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,210
the shared master code
of religion becomes,

479
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:22,430
and the 1640s in England,

480
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:27,380
the place in which the
dominant formulations of a
hedge demonic theology are

481
00:34:27,381 --> 00:34:30,920
reappropriated and polemically modified.
In other words,

482
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:33,110
the Church of England stands for as,

483
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:35,900
and this is the word that
was used as stablish meant

484
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,930
roundhead points of view.

485
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:44,030
Various forms of puritanism and other
forms of religious rebellion are anti

486
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,050
establishment.

487
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:50,410
And yet they are all coded within the
sort of discourse of the Christian

488
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:52,250
religion.

489
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,540
That is to say they have to fight
it out on a common battlefield.

490
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,540
And that's the way it is
with conflict of this kind.

491
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,470
Maybe a contemporary example,
uh,

492
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,130
would be not so much in the
sphere of religion as well today.

493
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:11,540
One could could speak
again, uh, of religion. But,

494
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:16,130
uh, in the sixties and seventies, it
was maybe more a question of ethics.

495
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:20,630
Think for example of the sexual
revolution, the ECOM, you know, again,

496
00:35:20,631 --> 00:35:22,610
there's a common ground,
you know,

497
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,660
a sense of the central reality
of sexual conduct to human life.

498
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,430
But there are, but, but what
you get in the, not so much,

499
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:36,020
perhaps conflict of classes is
conflict of generations. In this case,

500
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,140
what you get in conflict of
generations is an inversion of values.

501
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,590
Not a new set of values.
Exactly.

502
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:47,070
But a simple trans
valuation of what exists.

503
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:51,540
Everything that one faction
considers bad, uh, another faction,

504
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:55,260
trans values, and considered as good.
The various, the, the, the, the,

505
00:35:55,261 --> 00:36:00,261
the very thing against which one is worn
is the thing that one rushes to embrace

506
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:05,820
and so on. So once again, you
get a clash and unresolved clash,

507
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
but a class that arises
from and participates in
the semiotic structure of a

508
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:16,680
common code,
right?

509
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:21,960
And that's the way in which social
antagonism expresses itself,

510
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,570
uh, at the second level. Uh,

511
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:29,250
and it usually involves because there
isn't, there are underlying interests,

512
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:34,080
uh, elements of the political unconscious
brings to the surface elements of the

513
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:38,700
political unconscious.
Finally, at the third level,

514
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,740
what comes out,

515
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:45,860
what is made manifest is the tension or
clash among modes of production as they

516
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,120
jostle each other.
Historically,

517
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,720
it's understood that the danger as
Jameson puts it of thinking in terms of a

518
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:05,541
succession of modes of production is that
each one of those modes of production

519
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,880
might see like a synchronic moment. In
other words, if you're in capitalism,

520
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,520
you might get lulled into thinking that
no other motive production is available.

521
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,410
If you're in patriarchy,

522
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,240
you might get lulled into thinking that
no other mode of production is available.

523
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,560
And yet as Jameson points
out, the tension between, uh,

524
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:33,180
between corporate hierarchy
and patriarchal hierarchy,

525
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:37,290
the tension, in other words, which,
uh, very often drives a wedge,

526
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,380
has driven a wedge in polemic between
Marxist and feminist points of view,

527
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:43,440
uh,

528
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,440
is a reflection of the coexistence of
modes of production from completely

529
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:53,920
different areas. One contemporary
one completely, uh, uh,

530
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:59,140
it's at least insofar as it was the
dominant a thing of the past and yet

531
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,860
presenting, uh, and still, uh,

532
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:07,910
overlapping with a mode of
production that is contemporary.

533
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,580
So all of that, uh, is, is sort of, is,

534
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,980
is simply a matter of historical fact.

535
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:19,110
But in literary analysis and
literary analysis, um, you begin,

536
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:24,000
you begin to think of it in more
formal terms and you see, uh,

537
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,190
for example,
uh,

538
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,150
the very choice of verse form,
and I'm,

539
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,770
I'm taking as an example,
uh, uh, Shelly's famous poem,

540
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,250
the Ode to the West Wind.

541
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,640
You see the very choice of verse form
as an instance of what Jameson calls the

542
00:38:42,491 --> 00:38:47,491
ideology of form and can under can be
understood in terms of the conflict of

543
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,130
mode of production.

544
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,760
The verse form of Shelley's Ode to
the West Wind is simultaneously,

545
00:38:57,521 --> 00:39:02,521
it has five stroll fees and each stroke
fee is exactly the same informed it is

546
00:39:03,181 --> 00:39:05,770
simultaneously a sonnet.

547
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,040
And the first 12 lines of which
concluding in a couple of, uh,

548
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,590
a succession of Teradata [inaudible].

549
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,920
Now these two forms brought together
synthesize as a single stroller fiqh forum

550
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,060
in Shelly are coated and
entirely different ways.

551
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,480
Each aspect of them has an ideology.

552
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:34,020
Terrizi rema is coated prophecy because
it is in the tradition of Dante.

553
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:41,130
It's the verse form in which the divine
comedy is written and it is add a mode

554
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:46,750
that is expressive of hope that
resolves all contradiction,

555
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,950
uh, in the divine, in the
revelation of the divine,

556
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,400
in the parodies up so that the tariffs,

557
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:59,050
the Rhema expresses for
Shelly the hope of the poem,

558
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,820
which is that the west
wind will be through him.

559
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:07,840
The prompt,
the trumpet of a political prophecy.

560
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:12,580
If winter's here can spring be far behind,
uh,

561
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,030
revolution is in the offing.
Everything's going to be great,

562
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,160
but at the same time,

563
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:22,990
the palm is shot through with
a kind of pessimism, a sort of,

564
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,890
if you will,

565
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,920
realism and awareness that this notion
of prophecy is rather farfetched.

566
00:40:29,951 --> 00:40:32,650
Why should the wind do his bidding?

567
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:36,280
The wind is just when
it's not inspiration. Uh,

568
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,930
therefore the, the various stands
up, which is written in Tasa.

569
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,490
Rema is written at the same
time as a sonnet 14 lines.

570
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,760
And the first stanza in particular
is coated not just as a Sonnet,

571
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,080
but also as an illusion,

572
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:57,340
specifically to one sonnet and
particular Shakespeare's 73rd,

573
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:02,110
which begins that time of year
in me, thou mayest be hold, uh,

574
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:06,780
uh, in which I'm getting old. My bare
root might my, I don't have any hair left.

575
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:11,290
I'd mind sort of, I, I'm just a bare
ruined choir where late sweet bird sang.

576
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,870
In other words,
I'm in a parlous state.

577
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:17,050
I'm getting old and there's
nothing to be done about it. Uh,

578
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,790
at the end of the poem,
uh,

579
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,800
the embers of my fire are about to be,
uh,

580
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,910
are about to be snuffed out.
There is just no hope for it. Uh,

581
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:31,090
that's the way it is. You
get old. In other words,

582
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:33,800
winters here and spring in coming,

583
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,310
there is no prophetic possibility.

584
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:42,380
There is only the reality of
the trajectory of a lifespan.

585
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:47,180
If there's rise, there's also
fall. If there's development,

586
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:52,090
there's also decline and decay.
And these, uh, as the, as,

587
00:41:52,091 --> 00:41:56,060
as the sonnet form codes,
it are simple facts of life,

588
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,240
that poetic idealism that
Romanticism cannot override.

589
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:06,850
So what you get in Shell is verse
form is a tension between ideas,

590
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,930
the eye, the eye, the prophetic
idea, which you can associate with a,

591
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,820
with a feudal and Theo
centric world in wets.

592
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:24,910
The contradictions of reality really
can be resolved theologically on the one

593
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:29,380
hand and a kind of protocol,

594
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:34,381
realist tradition and which we just have
to come to terms with the way things

595
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:36,860
are coded through,

596
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,280
which is after all a Prodo enlightenment.
I mean,

597
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:43,790
and Shaw and Shakespeare is often
sort of thought thought of as a pro

598
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:48,680
enlightenment figure. Uh, and
that is coded through the Sonnet.

599
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,280
So formally
both the tarts,

600
00:42:53,281 --> 00:42:58,281
the rema and the sonnet participate in
what Jameson calls the ideology of form.

601
00:42:59,031 --> 00:43:01,700
And they raise,
they reflect modes of production,

602
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,580
feudal and enlightenment respectively.

603
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:10,240
And they respect and they
reflect attitudes that one
can associate with those

604
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:16,050
modes of production. So that's an
example of the way in which the Po,

605
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:20,120
the sort of the political perhaps
wanted better call it cuase.

606
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,510
I conscious because Shelly was
an incredibly self conscious,

607
00:43:23,511 --> 00:43:28,511
but the way in which the political
quasar conscious expresses itself at the

608
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:33,500
third or historical level of analysis.

609
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,880
Um, now, um, so in formal
terms, and I've already, and,

610
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,920
and I've already sort of gotten into this
and I'll go through it rather quickly

611
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:46,310
because there isn't much time
left. Um, informal terms.

612
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:51,680
We can think of the, uh,
the essential critical,

613
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,300
uh,

614
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:57,300
task at the first or historical
level as one of theme at Ization.

615
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,800
That is to say what theme is the plot
structure of an individual symbolic act

616
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:08,420
trying to express what are we,
you know,

617
00:44:08,421 --> 00:44:13,421
what is the contradiction that's
being resolved in this symbolic act?

618
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:17,270
At the second level,
the formal principal that we,

619
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,300
that we do bring to bear is the idea,

620
00:44:20,301 --> 00:44:24,800
the Bach Tinian idea of Heteroglossia,
the clash of voices,

621
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:28,430
the way in which the voice
is no longer individual,

622
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,970
but rather social, uh, the
representative a social point of view.

623
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,890
And it expresses itself
through, um, uh, the, the, the,

624
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:42,420
the individual authors writing.
And at the third level,

625
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,460
you get what Jason calls a repertoire
of devices. And I've already, uh,

626
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,140
reflected a little bit on that.

627
00:44:49,141 --> 00:44:53,900
Let me just add another example also taken
from Romanticism and keeping with, uh,

628
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:59,060
Jameson's is exemplification of the
overlap of modes of production as being

629
00:44:59,221 --> 00:45:03,750
particularly interesting in the age
of enlightenment. In Romanticism,

630
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,500
there's a long,
there's a long tradition leading up to it,

631
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,260
of the formal pindaric Ode.
Uh,

632
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,940
Wordsworth is still making use of that
tradition in writing his own intimations

633
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:17,280
of immortality.
But in the meantime,

634
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:21,810
he and Coleridge have
developed a new kind of owed,

635
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,680
if you will,

636
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,330
which is called the conversation
Palm Coleridge's frosted midnight.

637
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:30,840
This lime tree Bauer,
my prison Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey,

638
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:34,440
notable examples of the conversation poem.

639
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:39,770
Now the difference is very
clearly intelligible in
terms of a conflict of modes

640
00:45:40,981 --> 00:45:41,814
of production.

641
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:46,910
The formal owed a derived
ultimately from Pindar celebrating,

642
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,060
uh,

643
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:53,060
Olympic victories of
aristocratic patrons in Greece,

644
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,720
a horse races, foot races,
wrestling matches. Uh, that's,

645
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:01,830
that's the original purpose to
which the formal owed was put, uh,

646
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,410
plainly,
uh,

647
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:07,800
is coded once again a feudal aristocratic,

648
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:12,910
whereas the conversation poem
belongs very much as the title,

649
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,690
as the word suggests in the public sphere.

650
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,000
It's the atmosphere of the coffee house.

651
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:21,900
It's the atmosphere in which
people sit down and talk together,

652
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:25,140
exchange views,
address each other.

653
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:30,350
It is a poem always have address to some
individual person that turns to that

654
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:33,720
person at a certain point. Um, uh,

655
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,700
evokes the nature of that person
sometimes solicits that person's opinions.

656
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:43,380
In other words,
it's upon that performs Diallo Ism.

657
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:47,610
It's upon that performs, uh, the sense of,

658
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:52,730
of the given take of a much more open
democratic culture in the public sphere.

659
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,370
And so you can see that they're very
transitioned from the formal owed to the

660
00:46:59,371 --> 00:47:00,210
conversation.

661
00:47:00,211 --> 00:47:05,211
Palm is itself intelligible
as a transition among,

662
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,400
uh,

663
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,400
or what Jameson calls a
cultural revolution brought
about by a seismic shift in

664
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:19,200
modes of production. All right, so
these exemplify in various ways,

665
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:24,150
in various ways what can be done with
these three levels. Jameson himself, uh,

666
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,160
reminds us of the dangers.

667
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,370
If we think of a narrative
as a symbolic act,

668
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:35,540
we're a much too prone either to
forget that it's based in reality by

669
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,560
emphasizing the structuralist nature of
what's going on or to forget that that

670
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:45,850
form is involved at all,
uh,

671
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,870
by emphasizing the social
contradiction that's being resolved.

672
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:51,670
And as Jameson says,

673
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:56,800
these two dangerous at the first level
or the danger of structuralism and the

674
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:58,570
danger of vulgar materialism.

675
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:03,690
The point in analyzing the symbolic act
is to sustain a balance or a synthesis

676
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,040
between formal, uh, and uh, social, uh,

677
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:13,480
elements within the text. Um,
the, at the, at the second level,

678
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:18,630
the problem is that if we start thinking
in terms of unreconcilable class

679
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:20,494
conflict,

680
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:26,160
our analysis can become static as though
class perspectives didn't shift as

681
00:48:26,921 --> 00:48:28,020
though,
uh,

682
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:32,800
one perspective might succeed
another as the hedge demonic.

683
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:33,491
In other words,

684
00:48:33,491 --> 00:48:38,470
as though change didn't take place as
though there was always the same old,

685
00:48:38,471 --> 00:48:40,600
same old in class conflict,

686
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,570
the boss is always going to
speak demeaningly or the worker,

687
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:47,350
the worker is always going to laugh
at the boss behind his back. Uh,

688
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,500
this is the way it is.
This is the way it will always be.

689
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,580
There are static relations.
In other words, uh,

690
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,590
among the classes that history
can't resolve. And finally, uh,

691
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:02,140
at the third level, there's the danger
of thinking in terms of impasse, uh,

692
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,210
late capitalism for example,

693
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,180
as an impasse that simply
can't be surmounted.

694
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:11,920
Think of Adorno they give a darn off and
his incredible gloom about the culture

695
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:16,660
industry, there isn't much hope in a
door. No. Is there, and by the same token,

696
00:49:16,661 --> 00:49:19,330
you could argue that poor old Jameson,
you know,

697
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:23,140
talking about history as necessity,
history is what hurts, you know,

698
00:49:23,141 --> 00:49:27,370
history is just what has happened.
You know, by the same token,

699
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:32,470
you could argue that Jameson to is perhaps
a little bit subject to this sense of

700
00:49:32,471 --> 00:49:33,250
impasse,

701
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:38,250
which is why I quote for you as
these people themselves often do,

702
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:39,250
you know,

703
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:44,250
the ringing a warning of mark of marks
in the 11th thesis on Foreign Bach,

704
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,900
the philosophers have only interpreted
the world in various ways. The point,

705
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:54,790
however, is to change it. That is
ultimately the focus of Marxist analysis.

706
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,770
Tony in the remaining minute.

707
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,760
Now a reified realist approach to Tony.

708
00:50:00,761 --> 00:50:04,720
The kind that Jameson criticizes in
his sheet would point out that nothing

709
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:06,400
happens to Nido and speedy.

710
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:11,670
They are manifest villains and had at
the same time nothing can happen to them.

711
00:50:12,281 --> 00:50:16,090
They are simply, they simply have
their place in the social order.

712
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,870
One of them is a fastidious aristocrat
who doesn't want to get dirty.

713
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,670
The other is,
you know,

714
00:50:21,671 --> 00:50:26,560
completely committed to productivity
and the time clock and the work ethic,

715
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:30,860
but a speedy, ah, there they
are. Nothing to be done.

716
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:34,070
They're not nice to Tony,
but nothing happens to them.

717
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:37,370
There is no recrimination
but that at the first level,

718
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,220
if we understand this as a symbolic act,

719
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,840
the resolution of what would otherwise
be a hopeless conflict is through

720
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:48,590
friendship.
The friendship of bumpy and Tony.

721
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:52,100
They have to the fact that it's
perfectly okay if I'm just a working guy.

722
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:56,570
I've got my buddies, we go out, we drink
beer, we have a good time. Life is great.

723
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,300
You know, that is, you
know, it doesn't matter.

724
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,630
In other words that there's a class
structure that there's a social system.

725
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:07,220
You know, I'm happy.
Tony says, I like my job.

726
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:12,370
That in itself of course is a resolution
is a symbolic act and a resolution in

727
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:17,780
advance of the conflicts that the
story might otherwise manifest.

728
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:22,940
The second level you get the discourse
of ideology. Jeans, I can't help you.

729
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:26,270
He says, Nieto of the car.
I don't want to get dirty.

730
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:30,320
I can't help you said speed you the car.
I am too busy.

731
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,630
I can help you says bumpy,

732
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:38,090
but notice that this is all within an
individual single code in that that that's

733
00:51:38,091 --> 00:51:38,500
what the,

734
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:43,500
the the complete parallel parallelism of
these three utterances shows us within

735
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:49,540
a single code these ideology which
can't really been re be resolved,

736
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:55,460
get themselves expressed. All right.
Now finally, modes of production.

737
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:56,443
Plainly,

738
00:51:56,450 --> 00:52:01,450
the very existence of a Nido and speedy
in the same story suggest that there is

739
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:06,350
a certain tension between the
feudal and the bourgeois at work,

740
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:11,000
but it's not attention that in any
way necessarily works itself out.

741
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,530
The important thing to notice here,

742
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:16,370
it seems to me is the conflict
between pulling and pushing.

743
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:20,840
I mean it's very interesting. I've
said this before, that a tow truck,

744
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,200
something that polls and,
and, and you know, once again,

745
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:28,310
you know this Tony is a mode
of production, right? I mean
he's a tow truck, right?

746
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:30,680
That something,
something that pulls,

747
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,400
has to be pushed bumpy,
you know,

748
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,650
is like the little engine that could,

749
00:52:36,651 --> 00:52:40,100
is a sort of a throwback to an earlier,
uh,

750
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:44,630
less energized,
less powerful mode of production.

751
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,740
He has to push, think of the
way walls get put up, you know,

752
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,800
a prefabricated wall before the invention
of the crane and the pulley has to be

753
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:56,180
pushed up by a bunch of people.

754
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:01,300
Pushing is the essential labor mode
before the kind of technology arises that

755
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:06,800
makes it possible to pull something.
After that you have a crane,

756
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:07,940
you run the hook down,

757
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:12,530
you just pull the wall up into place
before then you've got maybe one person

758
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:15,350
standing on a rafter with
a rope kind of pulling.

759
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,870
But everybody else is down
on the ground pushing.

760
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:22,160
And so the relationship between pushing
and pulling in the story is a crucially

761
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:22,994
important one,

762
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:28,060
which suggests the overlap of older
and newer modes of production,

763
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:28,950
uh,

764
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:33,950
all of which can be resolved at Jameson's
third or historical level of analysis.

765
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,310
Okay.

766
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:40,310
So much then for Jameson and for Tony
will be coming back to Tony again next

767
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:43,740
time. In the context of talking
about the new historicism.
