1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,190
This lecture I think starts with
a series of preliminaries. Uh,

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,250
but so the,

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,260
in the technical term for preliminaries
of this kind in literary study prolapses

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,930
that is to say the form of anticipation,

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,760
which in a certain sense covers
what will be talked about later.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,110
Uh, they are, uh, prolapses
of this kind. Uh, I,

7
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:30,111
at first I wanted to say that in
entering upon the phase of this course,

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,410
which concerns a series of particular
identities as perspectives,

9
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:41,760
as points of departure for thinking
about the literary text ad of course,

10
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:45,600
for thinking about identity itself.
Um,

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,550
we come upon a,
a,

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,740
a form of,
of critical endeavor,

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,300
which is in practical
terms, incredibly rich, uh,

14
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:58,930
and productive.
Uh,

15
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,950
it is simply amazing how as Jonathan
Color wants to put a reading as a woman or

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,460
reading as an African
American or reading as, uh,

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,870
any of the other, uh, uh, sort of, uh,

18
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,630
focuses of identity that we're
going to be talking about.

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,660
It's simply amazing how
this kind of reading,

20
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:26,661
if it's done alertly transforms
everything that is to say it has a,

21
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:31,950
an incredible practical payoff.
Um, you know, last time,

22
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,280
uh, in the context of
the new historicism, uh,

23
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,340
Steven Greenleaf Greenblatt's brilliant
anecdote begins with Queen Elizabeth

24
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,480
Sang, I am Richard the second.
No, you not that whoa. Well,

25
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:49,960
I mean, Stephen Greenblatt isn't
concerned and investigating, uh,

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,840
a pronouncement of that
sort from the standpoint of
feminist criticism or indeed,

27
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:59,850
uh, from the standpoint of something
we'll be taking up later on gender theory,

28
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:05,040
uh, but still it's rather
than amazing thing for Queen
Elizabeth to say, isn't it?

29
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,420
Uh,
it suggests really that cut that it's,

30
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:13,980
that it's after all remarkable,
let she, a woman, uh,

31
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:17,910
would find herself in a
position not so much, uh,

32
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,940
needing to endure the kind of suffering
and peril that her own sex has

33
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:27,040
traditionally endured, but, uh,

34
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,060
rather and potentially enduring the
suffering and peril that one would

35
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:37,311
experience in the masculine
gender position made perhaps
even more interesting

36
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:42,540
and complicated by the fact that Elizabeth
knows perfectly well that despite the

37
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,960
rarity of her being Richard the second,
uh,

38
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,300
it's nevertheless not a unique position.

39
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,360
She has some subjected Mary Queen
of Scots to precisely that position.

40
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,470
She has deposed a and B
headitor ultimately, uh,

41
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,250
in just the way that she
fears the Earl of Essex.

42
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,510
We'll depose and behead her.
So the way in which, uh,

43
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,420
this remark, uh, I am Richard the
second no, you're not that, uh,

44
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,110
so easily commandeered and made use
of from the standpoint of the new

45
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,360
historicism can,
uh,

46
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,160
come to life in a completely different
way when we think about it, uh,

47
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,270
as a question of a gendered experience,
um,

48
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,030
is I think in itself a fascinating one.

49
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,030
Now I'm at the end of the last lecture,

50
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:39,010
just as by way of further
preliminary, um, I told a little fib,

51
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,630
I said that there were no
women in Tony the tow truck.

52
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,070
And of course in your prose texts,

53
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:49,840
the one that you've been clutching to
your bosom feverish Lee for the entire

54
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:54,550
semester. Uh, in your prose
text, there are no women.

55
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,560
There are just guys talking.
However, if to the prose text,

56
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:03,480
and I've told you about these,
you add the illustrations, uh,

57
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,550
and this is one of them. Roughly
speaking, I did it from memory. Um, uh,

58
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,390
if you add the illustrations,

59
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,830
you have to realize that it's not just
the cars you see the little smiles on the

60
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:15,910
faces of the cars.

61
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,980
It's not just the cars that are happy
about what's going on when bumpy finally

62
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:23,290
comes along and pushes Tony.
Uh,

63
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,990
but it's the houses in the background,

64
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,290
the houses in the background which
have been expressing disapproval,

65
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,800
uh, at the reactions of Nieto
and speedy to the predicament.

66
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:40,360
They're big frowns on the faces of
those houses in that illustration.

67
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,540
And now express beaming approval when
the morally correct thing is done now in

68
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:51,340
the Victorian period.
And in a certain sense,

69
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:55,180
I think Tony did the tow truck in this
regard hearkens back to the Victorian

70
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:59,080
period.
There was a poet named Coventry Pat Moore,

71
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,270
who actually are rather good poet
who became notorious however,

72
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,420
and the feminist tradition for having
written along poem in which he describes

73
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:15,130
woman as the angel in the house.
You probably,

74
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:17,290
you're probably familiar
with that expression,

75
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,300
but the idea is an idea which is
also I think embodied, uh, in the,

76
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:27,301
in a monumental book of some 25 years
ago by an Douglas called the feminization

77
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:29,530
of American culture.
Uh,

78
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,650
the idea is that moral and aesthetic and
cultural values are somehow or not or

79
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:43,300
another in the hands of women,
uh,

80
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:48,301
in the drawing room at the tea table
dictating to the agencies of society,

81
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,030
all of which are strictly
male prerogatives. Uh,

82
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,600
what a proper ethical sense
of things ought to be.

83
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,561
In other words,

84
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:05,240
the role of the angel in the house is
not just to wash the dishes and take care

85
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,520
of the kids,
although that's a big part of it.

86
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,640
The role of the angel in the house is
also to adjudicate the moral aspect of

87
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,790
life at the domestic level.

88
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,940
And that's exactly what these houses
obviously inhabited by angels.

89
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:26,340
How else could they be
smiling and frowning? Ah,

90
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,330
that's what these houses are doing.

91
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,540
And so it is the case after all that
there are women in Tony the tow truck.

92
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,280
All right. Now, as I say,

93
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,330
this moment is not exactly a
crossroads in our syllabus.

94
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:48,611
It's not like moving from language to
psyche to the social because obviously

95
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:52,520
we're still very much in the social,
in fact,

96
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,550
it's not even as though we haven't
hitherto and countered the notion of

97
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,760
perspective. Uh, obviously
we have in all sorts of ways,

98
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,380
but particularly in the work
of Bactine or Jameson, uh,

99
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:11,381
were introduced to the way in which
class conflict that is to say being of a

100
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:12,830
certain class.

101
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,830
Therefore having an identity gets
itself expressed in literary form.

102
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Dialogic Lee gets itself expressed
even as the expression of either as the

103
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:29,430
expression of conflict, uh,
between or among classes, uh,

104
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,460
or as a more cacophonous.
And yet at the same time,

105
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,550
very frequently harmonious a chorus
of voices of the sort that in,

106
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,240
uh, notions of Carnival,
Carnival Association, uh,

107
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,080
and other such notions one finds
in [inaudible]. In other words,

108
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,740
the way in which the language of a text,

109
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:56,741
the language of a narrative or of a poem
or have a clay gets itself expressed is

110
00:07:57,681 --> 00:08:00,680
already ha, eh. As, as
we've encountered it,

111
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,830
a question of perspective that it say
it needs to be read with notions of

112
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:11,470
identity in this case,
notions of class identity, uh,

113
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,560
in mind if it's to be understood.
Well,

114
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,970
what's interesting though,

115
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:21,590
what's also interesting though about
turning to questions of identity is that

116
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:24,750
perhaps more sharply now than hitherto,

117
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,090
although I have been at pains to point
out certain moments in the syllabus in

118
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,810
which one really does arrive
at a crossroads and you've
got to take, you can't,

119
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:36,830
you simply can't take both
paths. Uh, nevertheless, uh,

120
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,010
within the context of thinking about
identity in these ways as literary theory,

121
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,450
we begin to feel, uh, uh,

122
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,410
an increased competitiveness
among perspectives. I'm
going to be pointing out,

123
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:56,190
pointed this out from time to time in
the sequence of lectures that we now

124
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,190
undertake. But from the very
beginning, there's a, a,

125
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,370
a sense of competition between
actually a competition,

126
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:10,260
which is in some ways unresolved
to this day. Uh, for example,

127
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,770
between the feminist and
the Marxist perspective.

128
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:18,771
That is to say what is the underlying
determination of identity and

129
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:26,580
consciousness?
Is it class or gender?

130
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,750
Just for example, and this is
not a new topic, this is not,

131
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:34,500
this isn't a topic that we
stumble on today. Um, uh,

132
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:38,430
as a result of some belated
sophistication we have achieved,

133
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,580
listen to Virginia Woolf on page 600 of
a room of one's own where she says top

134
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:48,360
of the left hand column for genius.

135
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,360
Like Shakespeare's is not born
among laboring undereducated
survival people that

136
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:56,550
was not born in England among
the Saxons and the Britons.

137
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,760
It is not born today
among the working classes.

138
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:04,740
How then could it have been born among
women whose work began according to

139
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:08,280
professor Trevelyan almost before
they were out of the nursery,

140
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,030
who were forced to it by
their parents and held to it.

141
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:17,150
But all the power of law and custom
yet genius of a sword must have existed

142
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:23,070
among women as it must have
existed among the working classes.

143
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,950
Now in a way,
wolf is pulling her punches here.

144
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:30,951
She's not saying class has
priority over gender Norris.

145
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,810
She saying gender has priority over class.

146
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:38,410
If we're to understand the history
of the oppression of women, uh,

147
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,460
or the history of the limits on
the forms of women's expression,

148
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,280
uh,

149
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,280
she's pulling her punches and yet at the
same time I think we can see a point of

150
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:52,200
view and wolf's [inaudible]
room of one's own,

151
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:55,620
which is after all rather surprising.
Think of the title.

152
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,830
Think of the later title
of attract in some ways,

153
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:03,831
similar about sort of possible possible
scope for contemporary activity for

154
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:07,230
women. Three guineas. Uh,

155
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,100
these titles are grounded
in material circumstances.

156
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,850
Wolf stands before her audience,

157
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,260
her Oxbridge audience of women and says,

158
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,530
all she really has to say
is just this one thing.

159
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,510
If you're going to expect to get anything
done in the way of writing or in the

160
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:32,511
way of any other activity that's
genuinely independent of patriarchal

161
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:33,414
limitation.

162
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,580
You've really got to have 500 pounds
a year and a room of your own.

163
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:42,360
That's all she really says.
She has to say. In fact,

164
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,930
as you read through the six
chapters of a room of one's own,

165
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,930
you find that as if,
uh,

166
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:53,931
on an elastic band after the extraordinary
range of impressive impressionistic

167
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:57,040
thinking that each chapter manifests,

168
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:02,130
she is pulled back to this one particular
as she sees it necessary factual,

169
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:08,230
precondition material, precondition.
You want to get anything done.

170
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,370
You're not Jane Austin.
You're not a gene.

171
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,190
You're not a genius sitting on
your parlor, whisking your, your,

172
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:18,610
your novel in progress under
a piece of blotting paper.

173
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,050
Every time a servant comes into the
room, you know, you're not like that.

174
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:28,230
You really do need today the independence
of having 500 pounds and a room of

175
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:31,480
your own.
In other words,

176
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:36,310
I think one could show that even
in a row of one's own, which is,

177
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,230
which is if not the greatest,
certainly the most eloquent, uh,

178
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,320
so feminist treatise on the conditions
of women's writing ever written one could

179
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:49,570
show that even in that,
uh,

180
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:54,571
there is a certain priority given to the
perspective of class as opposed to the

181
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:59,020
perspective of gender. Uh, gender, uh,

182
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,080
will continue to be conditioned by the
effects of money and power if in fact

183
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:09,160
something isn't done.

184
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,690
Let's face it to redistribute
money and power on this too.

185
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,280
And this is a perspective which by the
way is even clearer in three guineas. Uh,

186
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:23,020
and uh, and at we're at
suggesting that, um, despite, uh,

187
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,750
its main agenda,
which is a feminist one,

188
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,430
that underlying that there is a
sense of the priority of class,

189
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:35,431
these sorts of tensions continue to
haunt not just feminist criticism,

190
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:39,370
but other forms of criticism having
to do with other forms of identity.

191
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,870
Really to this day, uh, conferences, uh,

192
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:48,871
featuring this variety of perspectives
very typically are develop into debates

193
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:55,231
on precisely this issue and the
one ops persons of conferences.

194
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:56,620
Of this kind are,

195
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,450
is the one who somehow it ones who somehow
get in the last word a and say you're

196
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:05,650
all naive. Uh, you suppose
that this is the basic issue,

197
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,280
but there's an underlying issue,
which is the basic issue. Uh,

198
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:13,690
and that's the one that I'm going to
demonstrate must absolutely prevail.

199
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,230
It's not necessarily always,
uh, the Marxist card,

200
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,680
which has played in this context,
although it frequently is, uh,

201
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,980
it could be some other card,
but it's always a card played.

202
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,550
It's always the last word at the
conference, which makes everybody go away.

203
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:30,730
I said, oh, I, I thought this
was about women. Oh dear.

204
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,240
It must be about something
else. And we will, uh, and,

205
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:38,590
and we will have to come back
to that because, uh, in a way,

206
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,940
the material we covered today and the
way that we're enabled to discuss it by

207
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:47,830
its own nature, uh, uh,
is something that, uh,

208
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,850
calls for another lecture and a
lecture that we will actually provide.

209
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:57,960
Um, there's a very real sense as I hope
to show by the end of the lecture, uh,

210
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,210
in which,
uh,

211
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:04,090
traditional I call this classical feminist
criticism in which traditional art,

212
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:08,540
classical feminist criticism needs to be
supplemented perhaps in the [inaudible]

213
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,140
sense needs to be supplemented
by something more,

214
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,410
which is gender theory.
Um, and I'll try to,

215
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,970
as I say at the end of the lecture,
I'll try to explain what that might,

216
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,110
what that might entail and then
come back to it when we discuss, uh,

217
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,610
uh, Judith Butler and Michelle
Fuoco, uh, a few lectures from now.

218
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:29,931
All right,

219
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:34,931
so run one zone is an absolutely
amazing tour de force.

220
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,210
Uh,
it's actually one of my favorite books.

221
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:42,890
I read it like a novel and in
many ways it is a novel. Um,

222
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,431
uh,

223
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:48,431
and I think immediately that might give
us pause because if Charlotte Bronte is

224
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:53,711
to be called to task for tendential
snus that is to say for writing from the

225
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,970
standpoint of complaint
of perceived oppression.

226
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,010
And if Charlotte Bronte's tendentious
dangerousness gets in the way of the full

227
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:08,790
expression of what she has to say, which
is to say the unfolding of a novel. Uh,

228
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,290
and if as Virginia Woolf,
I think actually rightly remarks,

229
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,970
at least from an aesthetic point of view,

230
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:18,500
we wonder why on earth grace
pools suddenly appears after,

231
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,090
after,
you know,

232
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,980
the sort of Jane's diatribe about wishing
that she could travel and wishing that

233
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:28,550
her horizons had been
broadened. Somehow j, uh,

234
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:32,810
Virginia will says Grace Pool, uh, is
out of place and that there's been,

235
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,710
there's been a rift, uh,
in the narrative fabric.

236
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,400
If this criticism of Charlotte Bronte is
fair and we'll be coming back to it in

237
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:46,910
other contexts, then of course it
could be turned against the narrative,

238
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:51,911
the choice of narrative style of
narrative approach in a room of one's own

239
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,140
itself. Uh, this I suppose,

240
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:59,030
good only strike you forcefully if you
read the whole of room of one's own all

241
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:03,140
six chapters, which I urge you to
do. Um, because it's so much fun.

242
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,930
If you read the whole of a room of
one's own, you'd say, well, Gee,

243
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:09,380
this is sort of a novel
to the Speaker says, Oh,

244
00:17:09,381 --> 00:17:13,430
call me anybody you like not
unlike Melville speakers saying,

245
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,650
call me Ishmael.
You can call me Mary beaten.

246
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:19,800
You can call me Mary seat and call me
Mary Carmichael doesn't really matter. Um,

247
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,220
but I've had certain certain adventures,

248
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,750
at least that person speaking
has had certain adventures.
What's your fictitious,

249
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:31,160
um, or at least I reserve the right to
sub to have you suppose that they're

250
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:33,140
fictitious. Uh, in other words,

251
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,200
this is a narrative that moves quite by
design in the world of fiction and other

252
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:42,440
words, Virginia Woolf was saying
it really isn't true. As, as,

253
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:47,150
as she tells us in the first chapter that
she marry beaten after sitting at the

254
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:48,170
river thinking,

255
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:52,050
wondering what on earth she's going to
tell these young ladies about women and

256
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:57,000
fiction as she's been thinking about
that. Finally, she gets a little idea.

257
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,930
It's like pulling a bit of a fish out of
the river and the fish starts swimming

258
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:01,770
around in her head.

259
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:05,460
She becomes quite excited and
she walks away across the grass.

260
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,730
At that point up arises a beetle,

261
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,400
a formidable person,
you know,

262
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:16,401
wearing oxone and gowns and pointing
at the gravel path where she as an

263
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:22,071
authorized woman should be walking as the
grass is the province only for the men

264
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,300
enrolled in the university. Uh, and so,

265
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,120
and then she has repeated
encounters of that kind.

266
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:35,121
She goes to the library on thinking Lee
only to be told by an elderly race like

267
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:41,190
gentlemen, that since she's a woman, she
needs a letter of introduction to get in.

268
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,870
Um, and, and so it's her
day, her fictitious day,

269
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,640
thinking about what on earth she say
to these young women about women and

270
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:54,030
fiction, uh, begins
somewhat unpleasantly, um,

271
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,510
as a presented fiction and other words,

272
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,220
a room of one's own is in a sense,
a novel. It continues, um, uh,

273
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,800
with a very pleasant lunch that she has.

274
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:08,940
She's been invited to the campus
as a distinguished writer.

275
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,140
It's okay to be a novelist, um, uh,

276
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,260
to be a woman who's a novelist
as long as you, uh, as, as, as,

277
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:20,010
as long as you don't rock
the boat too much. Um,

278
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,260
and in that respect,
in that regard,

279
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:26,670
she can have been invited to such a
lunch has is very pleasant lunch because

280
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:31,020
it's provided by men, uh, in an
atmosphere which is designed for men.

281
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:36,230
Then she goes to visit a friend who is
teaching at this fictitious college.

282
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,400
Uh, she has dinner with a friend in
that college, has dining hall, uh,

283
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,680
and the dinner is extremely unfair,
earlier inferior and plain. Uh,

284
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,850
and then they go to her rooms,
uh,

285
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:51,720
and they start talking about
the conditions in which
this college was built.

286
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,790
Bunch of women in the 19th century had
all they could do to raise 30,000 pounds,

287
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,940
no frills. Thank you very much.
None of them had any money.

288
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:04,710
There were no major donor donations. And
so the grass never gets cut. The brick,

289
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,530
the brick is playing an unadorned.
Um,

290
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,780
and that's the way life is in this
particular women's College. Uh,

291
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,250
then, uh, she, uh, the
next day she goes to,

292
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,950
she goes to the library because she
decides she's really got to find out

293
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:24,800
something about what people
think of women. Um, and so,
you know what, you know,

294
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,210
what is a woman? I don't
know exactly. So I'd better,

295
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:28,800
I'd better look it up in the library.

296
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:33,000
And she finds out that hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of men have written

297
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:36,960
books about women, uh, you
know, the inferiority of women.

298
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,870
They moral sensitivity of women,

299
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,290
the lack of physical strength
of women on and on and on.

300
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:48,291
And she lists them as items in the
library catalog actually are there in the

301
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:52,610
library catalog. All
of them, of course, uh,

302
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,560
getting themselves expressed in these
hundreds and hundreds of books about women

303
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:01,270
by men. Well, this is very
frustrating, but as you can
imagine, it's a cause. It's a,

304
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:04,330
it's an occasion for wonderful satire.
Uh,

305
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,080
what has to say 10 inches a satire,

306
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:12,220
because obviously it's male bashing.
And my point is,

307
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:16,540
my point is that she wouldn't
let Charlotte Bronte get
away with that. You know,

308
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,360
Charlotte Bronte has,
sorry,

309
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,090
Charlotte Bronte has to suspend her anger.

310
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,080
Virginia Wolf wants to say if she's going
to get the whole of what's on her mind

311
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,070
expressed. Well, Virginia Wolfe
who is of course not sort of,

312
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:37,750
doesn't sound very angry. Um, but you
could well be mistaken about that.

313
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,130
Uh, she's venting her
anger in comic effects. Uh,

314
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,120
Virginia Woolf allows herself
because that really is the case. Uh,

315
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,700
a measure of anger. Uh, so, so it is in
that chapter, then she goes home, uh,

316
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,670
and the rest of the rest of the room
of one's own takes place in one's home.

317
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,290
She's in her study pulling books
off the shelf of her library.

318
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,220
Uh, and this is more or less
chronological. It starts with the,

319
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,260
with a time when she looks, uh, where, uh,

320
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,500
on the shelf where the
women writers ought to be.

321
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:11,830
And there aren't any women
writers. Uh, and then later, yes,

322
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:16,780
there are women writers. Uh, there are
quite a few novelists. Uh, and then later,

323
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,790
uh, in the trying to, in century women,

324
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,800
writers get a little bit more
scope for their activity. Um,

325
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,060
and as she passes all of this and review,
uh,

326
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:30,061
we continue to get her reflections on
the state of literary possibility for

327
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:33,250
women in literary history.
So that is,

328
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:37,990
that's the structure of a room
of one's own, uh, overall. And,

329
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,600
uh,
it is within this structure,

330
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:43,600
which is an impressionistic and narrative.

331
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,760
Undoubtedly novelistic structure. I
mean, there, there are precedents for it.

332
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:53,110
Oscar Wilde's portrait of Mr wh is,
is one in particular,

333
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:57,640
but which is w, but which is, um, in a,

334
00:22:57,641 --> 00:23:01,570
in a way what it's talking about.
It is a novella.

335
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,530
Uh, and in the context
of the Novella, as I say,

336
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,650
there's a certain tension
or contradiction, uh,

337
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:13,570
in an author who is allowing
herself tendentious opinions,

338
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:18,580
uh, while denying the right
to have such opinions, uh,

339
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,180
on the part of one of her predecessors.
As you can imagine,

340
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,920
what she says about Charlotte Bronte
has been, has been controversial,

341
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,890
uh,
in subsequent feminist criticism.

342
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:33,820
There are a number of ways in which
feminist critics feel that, uh,

343
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,910
Virginia Woolf is misguided
or needs to be supplemented.

344
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:42,550
Uh, and this is one of them by
and large feminist good ex, uh,

345
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,640
feel that Charlotte Bronte or other
writer has the right to be 10 dentures.

346
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,750
Uh, we'll have more to say about, uh,

347
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,130
Virginia Woolf's criterion
of Androgyny, uh, uh,

348
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,150
which is not thinking
like either sex in park.

349
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,810
We'll come back to
that. Um, but, but, but,

350
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,730
but most feminist criticism has felt,
uh,

351
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,620
for a variety of reasons that, um, uh,

352
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:14,320
androgyny isn't necessarily
the ideal, uh, uh,

353
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,310
toward which women's pros
a ought to be aspiring, uh,

354
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,910
and Take Virginia Woolf to task
therefore for having taken this view of

355
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:27,050
Charlotte Bronte. Now, yes,

356
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:32,770
feminist criticism has taken a room of
one's own to task and a variety of ways,

357
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,020
but at the same time,
and I think this is freely enhancing,

358
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:39,800
we acknowledged a by a feminist criticism.

359
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:44,360
It is amazing when you read the whole
text and even when you read the excerpts

360
00:24:44,361 --> 00:24:46,310
that you have in your anthology,

361
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,520
it is amazing how completely Virginia
Woolf's arguments anticipate,

362
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,780
uh, the subsequent course of the
history of feminist criticism.

363
00:24:56,781 --> 00:25:00,390
I just want to point out a few
of the ways in which it does, um,

364
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,090
as show older points out.

365
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:06,140
The first phase of modern
feminist criticism, uh,

366
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:11,141
was the kind of the kind of work that
primarily pays attention to men's

367
00:25:11,391 --> 00:25:16,010
treatment of women in fiction.
Uh, uh, Mary elements,

368
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,370
uh, Mary almonds book of, of, uh,

369
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,720
of of 1968 called thinking about women,
Kate Millet's,

370
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,820
a sexual politics,
uh,

371
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:30,170
in 1970 are both books which,
um,

372
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:35,270
which are focused primarily on
sexist male novelists, uh, who,

373
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,870
uh, whose demeaning treatment
of women, uh, as something that,

374
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,590
that the feminist perspective
perspective needed to bring out.

375
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,150
This criticism is superseded in,
uh,

376
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:52,180
Elaine Showalter's account by what she
calls and prefers a gyno criticism or the

377
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:55,220
gyno critics.
Uh,

378
00:25:55,221 --> 00:26:00,221
and Gyno criticism is not so much
concerned with men's treatment of women in

379
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:05,261
fiction as with the place of women
as writers in literary history and as

380
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:09,050
characters,
uh,

381
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,080
regardless whether their characters in
men's or women's books in their own right

382
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,410
in, uh, the history of
fiction. In other words.

383
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,370
In other words, Gyno criticism turns, uh,

384
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,540
turns the topic of feminist
criticism around 19,

385
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,660
late sixties, and seventies,
and early seventies,

386
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:34,750
from the history of oppression by men
to the history of the a or the women's

387
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,850
tradition. Now, this, this sense of the,

388
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,440
of the unfolding of things,

389
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,130
it seems to me is already fully present.
And Wolf,

390
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,220
she too wants to talk about
the possibilities for women
writers about the need,

391
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,750
uh, for women writers to feel that
they're not alone and above all.

392
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,820
At the same time. However, uh,

393
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,380
she frames this emphasis
on the woman's perspective.

394
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:09,060
She frames it with the
sort of, uh, of, of,

395
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:13,110
of trenchant, uh,
frequently satirical, uh,

396
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,800
observations about men's
treatment of women, uh,

397
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,060
man's way of demeaning women and
keeping them in their place. Um,

398
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:24,120
as for example, uh, all the men,

399
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,260
most of them professors who
wrote books about women, uh,

400
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:30,930
as she discovered, uh,
in the British library.

401
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:35,520
All of this is very much in the
tradition of that first phase of feminist

402
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:40,170
criticism that show Walter
identifies, uh, with, uh, Elman,

403
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,230
uh,
and millet and others of that generation.

404
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:48,270
So the capacious snus of
Wolf's approach, um, is, uh,

405
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,980
in one sentence can be understood as
precisely her ability to bridge, uh,

406
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,300
both sorts of modern tradition,
uh,

407
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,240
no longer chronic chronological,
uh,

408
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,070
as show altered presents
them as being correctly,

409
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,960
but rather as a kind of simultaneity,
simultaneity, uh, in which,

410
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,830
um, in, in, in which
the emphasis on, on, on,

411
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:15,831
on men's marginalization of women and
the emphasis on women's consciousness and

412
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:20,160
traditions, uh, can be, uh, uh,

413
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,790
set forth at the same time.
Now,

414
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,920
also in Virginia Woolf, there's
ha there's, there's what, um, uh,

415
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,960
since the publication of the fascinating
book by Sandra Gilbert and Susan goober

416
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:37,230
called the madwoman in the
attic. This is also, uh,

417
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,920
an allusion to Jane Eyre.
You remember Bertha,

418
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,630
the madwoman in the attic of Jane Eyre,
um,

419
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,360
since the publication of a, of
the madwoman in the attic. Um,

420
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:54,120
feminist criticism has,
has talked about the mad woman thesis,

421
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:59,100
the idea, in other words, uh,
that because they could not, um,

422
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,670
um,

423
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:04,670
openly express themselves creatively as
writers or as artists of other kinds,

424
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:05,790
uh,

425
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:10,790
women were forced to channel
their creativity into
subversive divis and perhaps

426
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:16,560
psychologically self destructive, as in,
for example, Charlotte Perkins Gilman,

427
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,560
uh, the, uh, the yellow
wallpaper, uh, perhaps, um,

428
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:25,650
self destructive forms. And, uh,
you find wolf already on page,

429
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,290
on page 600, uh, Eh,

430
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:34,430
just actually below the passage about
class and gender that I read before you

431
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:40,530
find her touching on this
madwoman theme long before, uh,

432
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,300
Gilbert and Gavar, she
says, when, however,

433
00:29:43,301 --> 00:29:48,301
one reads of a witch being duct or of
a woman possessed by devils of a wise

434
00:29:48,701 --> 00:29:50,440
woman selling herbs,

435
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,180
and then of course she ads and even have
a very remarkable man who had a mother

436
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,890
there.
In other words,

437
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:02,040
a one strongly suspect that there's
a person who's creativity has been

438
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:07,150
oppressed, uh, and, uh,
unfortunately channeled,

439
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:11,920
uh, in, uh, unsocial or
anti social directions. Um,

440
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,340
and this, uh, as I say is, uh, is, is,

441
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,740
is a tradition that sustained,
uh,

442
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:22,030
it still exists in show alter
when she says on page 13,

443
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,960
83, I mean, it's not just Gilbert
and goober. Uh, in other words,

444
00:30:25,961 --> 00:30:30,160
when show Walter says on page 1383,
um,

445
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,403
she does,

446
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,230
I can't say that I think she does.
Uh,

447
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,300
uh, yes, yes, yes, yes. I, I,

448
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,360
what I wanted to say about
show Walter, um, is that, uh,

449
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:50,290
in her gyno critical perspective,
that is to say her,

450
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:55,260
her insistence on, are
registering chronicling, uh,

451
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,780
becoming familiar as scholars with,
uh,

452
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,830
the history of women as well as
the history of women's writing. Uh,

453
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,890
the recognition of such forms
of repression as witchcraft,

454
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,360
as madness,
as urbalism as whatever it might be,

455
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,110
a need to be, need to be
taken into account. Um,

456
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:21,340
also very much on the mind of
wolf already as it still is,

457
00:31:21,341 --> 00:31:23,000
particularly for Showalter,

458
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,580
because this is show up to
his understanding of the
task of Gyno criticism is

459
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:30,430
the notion that one needs a tradition.

460
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,760
That one of the great difficulties and
shortcomings facing the woman's writer is

461
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:39,520
that a yes,
there are a few greats,

462
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,650
the same ones always named Austin.
The Bronto has George Elliot.

463
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,040
There are a few grades,

464
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,160
but there is not a sense of an ongoing
tradition of a developing tradition

465
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,600
within which one could write.

466
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:57,790
So that a wolf on paid six
oh six right hand column

467
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,850
talks about, um, the
man's sentence. You know,

468
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,020
the difficulty of coming to
terms with, uh, with, uh,

469
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,990
not having,
not just a room of one's own,

470
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:14,240
but a language of one's own,
uh,

471
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,180
toward the top of the right hand column.

472
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:21,220
Perhaps the first thing she would find
setting pen to paper was that there was

473
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:24,430
no common sentence ready for her.

474
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:27,130
Use all of the literary models,

475
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:31,970
all the models of novelistic pros,
uh, most of them in any case, uh,

476
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:36,550
are developed, are, are, are,
are, are engendered male, um,

477
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:40,190
because, uh, the
atmosphere of writing, uh,

478
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:44,890
and this is a point that we'll be getting
too soon. The very fact of writing, uh,

479
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:50,050
is something that we have to understand
as having a male stamp on it.

480
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,900
Uh, further down the right hand
column, that is a man sentence.

481
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:57,770
She's just quoted a long sentence
that is a man sentence behind it.

482
00:32:57,771 --> 00:33:00,440
One can see Johnson Gibbon and the rest,

483
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,770
it was a sentence that was
unsuited for a woman's use.

484
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:08,890
Charlotte Bronte with all her splendid
gift for Bros stumbled and fell with that

485
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:13,880
clumsy weapon in her hands.
George Eliot committed atrocities with it.

486
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:15,080
That beggar description,

487
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:20,180
Jane Austin looked at it and laughed
at it and devised a perfectly natural

488
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:24,680
shapely sentence, proper for her own
use and never departed from it. Thus,

489
00:33:24,681 --> 00:33:27,710
with less genius for writing
than Charlotte Bronte.

490
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:32,480
She got infinitely more said Jane Austin.
And by the way,

491
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:34,970
this is disputable because,
um,

492
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:40,060
certainly it's possible to understand
Jane Austen's pro style as emerging from

493
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:44,330
the work of Samuel Johnson and
Samuel Richardson in particular. Uh,

494
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,060
so it is disputable,
but at the same time,

495
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:52,090
wolf point is that that w that Austin
was able to shake herself free from this

496
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:58,280
terrible problem of wanting
to say something, but finding,

497
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:02,600
uh,
that one doesn't have one's own language,

498
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,830
a language suitable to a
appropriated by and for.

499
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:11,660
And as one's identity for saying it.
So I want to write as a woman,

500
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,380
as a woman, I want to say the
things that a woman wants to say,

501
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,210
but all I've got to say it, which is
a man sentence, that's a wolf's point.

502
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:25,070
Um, and of course it has,
uh, it has, uh, many, uh,

503
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:28,810
and long ramifications.
It is, uh, I'm, I'm,

504
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,250
I'm holding at bay,
um,

505
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:36,340
the criticism of a great deal of this
that has to be leveled at it by feminist

506
00:34:37,221 --> 00:34:41,420
criticism and genders,
gender theory roughly since 1980.

507
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,470
But in the meantime,
uh,

508
00:34:43,471 --> 00:34:48,440
the ramifications are interesting and
they are reinforced by the theoretically

509
00:34:48,441 --> 00:34:53,441
very sophisticated wing of feminist
criticism that we call French feminism.

510
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:58,940
Some of you may know the work of,
uh, of, of loose [inaudible]. He got,

511
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:00,760
Hey, a lens, see sue,

512
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,940
a writers of this kind of insist that
there is such a thing as women's language

513
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:12,170
women, right? Not just, you know,
with their heads in their phalluses,

514
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,630
but with their whole bodies.
Uh,

515
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:19,640
women don't write a carefully
constructed periodic sentences, women,

516
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:23,360
right?
Ongoing paratactic impressionistic,

517
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:28,490
a digressive, uh, ad hoc sentences, uh,

518
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:32,300
that this is a sentences without ego,
uh,

519
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:37,560
being without structure, more or less
corresponding to being without ego.

520
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,190
We'll come back to this in a minute
and show Walter, but in the meantime,

521
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,200
fresh feminism was willing to settle on.

522
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:48,360
And four and I,

523
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:53,361
Dhea of women's writing and implicitly
behind this idea and idea of what a woman

524
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:57,660
is,
that it's very easy to,

525
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:02,310
to identify as somehow or
another, um, essentially rising.

526
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,350
Why can't a woman, right, a rigorous
periodic sentence after all,

527
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:11,790
that's the kind of sentence that Jane
Austin did in fact. Right? Uh, why can't,

528
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,560
why can't, um, uh, integrate in a, in,

529
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:20,130
in a whole variety of ways that one that
one might think of, why can't a woman,

530
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,900
uh, if she is to be free to
be whatever she wants to be,

531
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,390
write a sentence, which isn't
necessarily of this, uh,

532
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,380
gendered feminine sort.
Um,

533
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,470
why does women's writing,
in other words have to be women's writing?

534
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:40,710
It seems to me that this,
that, that it is free.

535
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:43,950
It is French feminism and the critique,

536
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,980
the possible critique of French feminism
that Virginia Woolf is anticipating in

537
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:54,621
advance when she embarks on this perilous
idea of Androgyny of the kind of mind

538
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,480
that needs to be both male and female.
Uh,

539
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,500
and that needs to write in a way that
Virginia Woolf says is actually very sexy,

540
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,630
uh, precisely in the moment when
one is not thinking about one's sex.

541
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,670
Uh, the moment, in other words,

542
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:17,040
when there is no longer a question of
the man sentence and the woman's hands,

543
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:22,160
I think it has to be said that although
one could emphasize in a room of one's

544
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:28,341
own this sort of advanced criticism of
French feminism and also have the idea

545
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:34,130
that there is essentially something that
we call woman and I'm not through with

546
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:35,184
that topic.

547
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:39,750
I think it has to be said that although
we could read a room of one's own in

548
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:42,030
this way,
at the same time,

549
00:37:42,031 --> 00:37:47,031
we have to recognize an ambivalence on
Virginia Woolf's part on this subject.

550
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:52,910
There is a difference between
her insistence that Jane
Austin wrote like a woman

551
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,230
that is,

552
00:37:55,230 --> 00:38:00,230
that she shrugged off the tyranny of
the man sentence and wrote her own

553
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:02,610
sentence, uh, her own kind of sentence,

554
00:38:02,611 --> 00:38:07,320
a woman sentence regardless whether
or not that is actually in literary

555
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:09,160
historical terms. True. Uh,

556
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,510
the idea on the one hand that it's
important to write like a woman. Uh,

557
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,850
and the idea on the other hand that
it's important to write androgynously we

558
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:18,270
have to,

559
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:23,270
we have to concede I think
to the impressionistic
form of these lectures that

560
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:26,070
she's giving.
Uh,

561
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:31,100
we have to concede that she waivers
on this point that there is that,

562
00:38:31,271 --> 00:38:33,120
that somehow or another,
well,

563
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:38,121
it's very difficult to pin in wolf the
question whether there is essentially

564
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:41,140
something to be called women's writing.

565
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,200
Just as the question behind that,

566
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:49,290
whether there's essentially something to
be called woman or the question on the

567
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:50,374
contrary,

568
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:55,410
whether the ideal of all writing is to
shed as full as it can precisely it's

569
00:38:58,841 --> 00:39:03,670
gendered aspects. Uh, there
is, there is perhaps a kind of,

570
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:04,360
uh,

571
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:09,360
creative or rich inconsistency on
this point that it should be said.

572
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:14,400
One also fines and needs to take
into account in reading a womb,

573
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,670
a room of one's own.
All right.

574
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:23,380
Now getting a little
closer to the, uh, to, uh,

575
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:28,170
to this whole question of beyond,
uh, the Gyno critical because, uh,

576
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:32,620
show Walter for example, and talking
about the history of the novel, uh,

577
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:36,350
talks about those three
phases. First, the fee,

578
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,720
the feminine,

579
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,980
that the phase in which women try very
much to write as though they were a man

580
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:46,570
by deferring completely to male values,
uh,

581
00:39:46,571 --> 00:39:50,110
in all the ways that they
can, uh, perhaps, um,

582
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:54,340
introducing a kind of, uh, uh, again, um,

583
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:58,980
Angel in the house, uh, cultural, um, uh,

584
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:03,990
a benevolence and benignity into
perspectives of men that can be sometimes

585
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:08,890
rather militaristic and harsh. Uh,
but nevertheless hiding behind,

586
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:13,840
uh, frequently male names, curve bell
act and bell, George Elliot and so on.

587
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,250
Um, and, uh, not really,
uh, not really, uh,

588
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,730
entering into questions of, um, uh,

589
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:26,230
of the place of women and
society. A show, Walter then says,

590
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:31,231
this is a phase supplanted by a feminist
moment in the history of the novel in

591
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:36,220
which novels as the late work
of Mrs Gaskell, for example,

592
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,380
and other such novels become 10 dentures.
Uh,

593
00:40:39,381 --> 00:40:44,170
and the place and role of women becomes
the dominant theme of novels of this

594
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:46,900
kind. Uh, it's a plant. And by the way,

595
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:51,220
this takes a wolf's critique
critique of Charlotte Bronte,

596
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:54,970
a little bit out of chronology because
presumably Charlotte Bronte belongs to

597
00:40:54,971 --> 00:40:59,340
what show Walter is calling the female
phase and the history of the novel. Um,

598
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,690
but, uh, and,

599
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:05,691
and so it's interesting that wolf finds
a kind of Tropo feminism damaging to the

600
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:10,390
texture of Jane Eyre already
in Charlotte Bronte's novel.

601
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:14,890
And then finally, uh, what, what
Elaine Showalter likes best,

602
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,600
the supplanting of the feminist novel
because a Elaine show Walter to is nervous

603
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:22,220
about the 10 benches of fiction,
uh,

604
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:27,010
does the planning of that by what
she calls the female novel. Um,

605
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:32,070
which is the novel that simply takes for
granted the authenticity and legitimacy

606
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:37,550
of woman's part of you writes from
that part of you. But as in Virginia,

607
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:42,520
Woolf having shed or shaken
off the elements of, uh,

608
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:47,910
anger or adversary consciousness
that, uh, earlier, uh,

609
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:50,930
novels had typically manifested.
Uh,

610
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,020
and this is very much very
similar in the history.

611
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:59,050
This history of the novel is very similar
to what show Walter is doing with her

612
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:04,010
sense of the history of recent feminist
criticism that's in two phases.

613
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:07,070
First, the feminist as she calls it, uh,

614
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:12,100
when the treatment of men of women
by men in fiction is the main focus.

615
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,270
And then the Gyno critical,

616
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:18,650
which is the appropriation for
women of a literary tradition,

617
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,370
show Walters at pains to
point out that the most,

618
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,390
much of the most important work
of recent feminist scholarship,

619
00:42:26,391 --> 00:42:31,391
the feminist scholarship of the 1970s
is end simply the unearthing of an

620
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:35,840
expanding of a cannon of women's writing.
Uh,

621
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,350
not exclusively novelistic
because there had been a time, uh,

622
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,510
when,
um,

623
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:46,580
the novel was sort of half conceited
to women as a possible outlet for their

624
00:42:46,581 --> 00:42:50,950
writing. But this concession
was accompanied by the, um,

625
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:55,990
by the sovereign assertion that they
couldn't write poetry and plays. Uh,

626
00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:01,090
and so an expansion of the cannon such
that all forms of writing are available

627
00:43:01,641 --> 00:43:06,470
and made visible and recognized as
actually existing in a tradition,

628
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:06,980
uh,

629
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:11,840
so that we can trace women's writing
as show Walter puts it from decade to

630
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:15,710
decade and not from great
book, two great book. Uh,

631
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,790
so that there really is a tradition
comparable to the male tradition that one

632
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:20,780
can think about,

633
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:25,870
think within a and draw on
as a creative writer oneself.

634
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:27,080
Uh,

635
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:32,080
so both show alters history of the novel
and her history of modern feminist or

636
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:36,900
modern women's criticism.
One had better say, uh,

637
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:42,340
and at the point when it is still a
question of the woman's perspective,

638
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:51,320
but this raises a question and I mean,
and, and it's, and it's, it's, uh, I've,

639
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:54,410
I've been touching on it in a
variety in a variety of ways,

640
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:56,570
but it really raises the question

641
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,430
that has to hunt,
thinking of this kind,

642
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:04,690
and we're going to be encountering
it again and again and again. Uh,

643
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,760
as we move through other forms of identity
perspective in criticism and theory,

644
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,760
the raises the question whether if I say
that a woman or women's writing is of a

645
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:21,410
certain sort,
that is,

646
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:26,411
that is if I identify a woman in a way
that I take somehow to be recognizable,

647
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,790
let's say identify a woman as intuitive,

648
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,860
imaginative, impressionistic, sensitive,

649
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:43,290
illogical,
opposed to reason,

650
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:49,670
our refuser of that periodic sort of
subject predicate sentence that we

651
00:44:51,151 --> 00:44:52,770
associate with men's writing.

652
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:59,060
I can appropriate that for women like
the French feminists and I can identify

653
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:03,690
women in so doing as such people.

654
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:09,230
But isn't that simply inverting what men
in Virginia Woolf's discover isn't in

655
00:45:09,631 --> 00:45:12,570
the British Museum in the second
chapter of a room of one's own?

656
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:17,750
Isn't that just inverting all the
negative values that men have attached to

657
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:19,260
women all along?

658
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:24,860
Isn't it ultimately to accept
men's opinions of women
men's ways of saying that

659
00:45:27,121 --> 00:45:31,560
because they are avatars of
reasons, science, logic, uh,

660
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:33,390
and all the rest of it,
isn't it?

661
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:38,420
Isn't it a way of saying that the head
is higher than the heart and accepting,

662
00:45:38,641 --> 00:45:39,474
in other words,

663
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:44,520
the lower or inferior status
of this Oregon to this Oregon,

664
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:49,700
even though one supposes oneself to
have trans valued them and insisted in

665
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:55,500
promoting women's consciousness that
the heart is higher than the head.

666
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,500
What hasn't done anything?

667
00:45:58,501 --> 00:46:03,270
In other words to the essential
identities that have governed patriarchal

668
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:04,470
thought from the beginning.

669
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:10,040
It is precisely this characterization
of women that has enabled and,

670
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:15,540
and gendered patriarchy. And so,
and this is where the problem,

671
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:20,400
this is where the theoretical
problem arises and it calls forth,

672
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:23,790
it calls for it seems to me, uh, uh,

673
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
a sense that somehow or another one
has to put the possibility and there's

674
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:32,730
really no other way to say it.

675
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:35,820
And this is something that Judith
Butler frequently says and, and,

676
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,330
and people who work in
the mode of Judith Butler,

677
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,820
one has to put the suggestion,

678
00:46:41,821 --> 00:46:46,821
but perhaps the best thing one can say
as a feminist is there's no such thing as

679
00:46:47,941 --> 00:46:52,080
a woman. There is no
woman. Now, of course,

680
00:46:52,081 --> 00:46:54,900
this is perilous and this is what,
and this is,

681
00:46:54,901 --> 00:46:59,901
and this is what drives such at such
an unfortunate wedge in the midst of

682
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,850
feminist thought in real life,
in real material existence.

683
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:10,140
There are certainly are women, they
are oppressed by laws. They are,

684
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:14,280
they are oppressed by men,
uh, and their, and, and their,

685
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:19,310
their rights and their very lives need
to be protected with perpetual vigilance.

686
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,720
The idea,
in other words,

687
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:26,580
the theoretical idea that there's no
such thing as a woman is not an idea that

688
00:47:26,581 --> 00:47:30,970
can be sustained in life.
And yet at the same time,

689
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:37,110
the implications of what the language
of identity politics is always calling

690
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,760
essential ism.

691
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,320
The implications of saying
woman is one particular thing,

692
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,890
and it might be better if we said
woman was one particular thing,

693
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:52,420
but it was something other than what men
have been saying she was all along. But,

694
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:57,160
but making the problem worth saying that
woman is one particular thing, which is,

695
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,780
uh, just what men have always said, she
was only, it's a good thing, right? That,

696
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:06,430
that, that, that positions of this
kind taken up in this way. Uh,

697
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:10,720
despite the fact that there are absolutely
necessary for practical feminism,

698
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,680
for real world feminism are nevertheless,
uh,

699
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:19,710
detrimental to a more sensitive
theoretical understanding of gender.

700
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:25,900
Um, and of the possibilities of
gender. It's all very well to be,

701
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,730
um, to be, you know, intuitive
and emotional and, and,

702
00:48:29,731 --> 00:48:31,660
and impressionistic.
Uh,

703
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:35,440
but one last to say two things about
that and the first place a guy gets to be

704
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:38,890
that if he wants to write,
and in the second place,

705
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,700
why does a woman have to be that?
Right? And it's perfectly clear,

706
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:47,970
it's perfectly clear in both cases that
there are exceptions which go vastly

707
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:50,440
beyond the exception that proves the rule.

708
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:54,030
It's perfectly clear that in both cases,
uh,

709
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:59,100
there are sensibilities across
gender that completely mix up,

710
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,540
uh, and, and, and discredit
these categories. Uh,

711
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:09,460
and so for all of those reasons, uh,
there's a problem. Uh, just very quickly,

712
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:12,430
just I wanted to point
out that, that, I mean,

713
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,190
looking at show Walters
essay that this is a bind,

714
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:20,220
that criticism around 1980
really hasn't gotten past.

715
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:22,240
I'm not going to take,
it's time's up.

716
00:49:22,241 --> 00:49:26,980
I'm not going to take time to quote
passages, but notice, uh, her animus.

717
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,530
And here in a way we go
back to the beginning,

718
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:33,280
her animus against Marxism and
structuralism on the grounds.

719
00:49:33,281 --> 00:49:37,300
And of course we've said this ourselves
on the grounds that both of them present

720
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:41,860
themselves as sciences. Aha. There
are gendered male, you know, uh,

721
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,900
Marxism and structuralism aren't anything
we want to have to do with because

722
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:50,170
this is just, uh, Virginia
Woolf's beetle, uh,

723
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,830
raising its ugly head again and
imposing its will through it.

724
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:57,250
Superior rationality, uh, on women. Uh,

725
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:02,080
so we don't want any of that. What we
want instead is a form of criticism.

726
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:08,100
And this is what she says at the end of
the essay on pages 1385 and 1386 what we

727
00:50:08,981 --> 00:50:13,981
want instead is a form of criticism
that evades scientific city,

728
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:19,530
a form of criticism that engages with
the reality of texts and of the textual

729
00:50:19,871 --> 00:50:21,880
tradition,
but doesn't trouble.

730
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:26,881
It's pretty little head doesn't trouble
it's head with theoretical matters.

731
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:31,820
In other words,
this socio writes itself from the logical,

732
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,610
from the old,
from overarching structure,

733
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:39,670
from scientific city show altar leaves
herself in this position and a sir and,

734
00:50:40,221 --> 00:50:44,840
and, and she leaves feminist
criticism in this position as, um,

735
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:46,670
how might one put it,
um,

736
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:51,850
a colonized enterprise that can do
anything at likes as long as it's not

737
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:57,170
reasonable. Uh, and if that's
an and, and if that's the case,

738
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:02,740
then of course it imposes an essential
Ising limit on the possibilities of

739
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:05,120
feminist criticism just as of course,

740
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:08,280
the characterization of men's criticism,
uh,

741
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,220
in the way that it's characterized.

742
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:14,300
Needless to say also
imposes limits on that, uh,

743
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,990
fair and legitimate limits or
perhaps exaggerated limits, uh,

744
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,380
is open to question that's not
nearly as important to point as the,

745
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:25,990
the reminder, uh, that, um,

746
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:30,620
there's a kind of marginalization of the
possibilities for a feminist criticism,

747
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:31,280
uh,

748
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,280
involved in saying that it
has to be something other
than the sort of thing that

749
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:41,180
Marxist instructure was paradigms
make available. Uh, okay.

750
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,770
Now I think that,
uh,

751
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:47,771
Henry Louis Gates will have a very
influenced by buck teen will have a very

752
00:51:47,991 --> 00:51:52,991
interesting way of coming to terms with
this question of what's available for a

753
00:51:54,981 --> 00:51:57,950
marginalized minority criticism,
uh,

754
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:02,980
once it avoids or has succeeded in
avoiding the terms of the mainstream

755
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:07,610
criticism. Uh, and I want you
to read gates his essay, uh,

756
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:12,140
with that particularly in mind,
then we'll come back with the question of,

757
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,960
as it were,
the future of feminist criticism,

758
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:18,330
feminist criticism in a way since 1980,
uh,

759
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:23,060
when we turn to the work of
the gender theorists, uh, in
particular, Judith Butler.
