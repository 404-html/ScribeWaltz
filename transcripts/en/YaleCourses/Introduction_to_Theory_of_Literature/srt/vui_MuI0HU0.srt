1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,020
So I'll,
I'll tell you a little bit about,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,660
I'll tell you a little bit about Harold
blooms career later in the lecture.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,760
Uh, those of you who know how to
read a poem, the books on religion,

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,050
Shakespeare and the
invention of the human, um,

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,330
may and PR and perhaps only know those
books may feel a little surprised at

6
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:26,720
finding him on a literary theory syllabus.
Uh,

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,320
but the great outpouring of work
beginning with the anxiety of influence,

8
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:35,940
the map and bus reading,
poetry and repression, great
many other books in the 70s,

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:36,990
uh,

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,990
put bloom in the very midst of the
theoretical controversies then swirling.

11
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:47,010
He was associated with the
so-called Yale school. In fact,

12
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:52,011
he was willing to put his name as editor
and also contributor on a volume that

13
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:55,260
was called deconstruction and criticism.

14
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,960
I think though that even in
reading what you have before your,

15
00:00:58,961 --> 00:01:03,660
you can see how relatively little
bloom has to do with deconstruction.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,750
Uh,
and certainly in his more recent career,

17
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,000
he's distanced himself from a well
from theory. I mean, he, he's,

18
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,790
uh, he hasn't really changed
his views of anything,

19
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:19,260
although he doesn't any longer read
poems through the machinery of the six

20
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:20,700
revisionary ratios.

21
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,150
Perhaps I should stop there and say the
six revisionary ratios won't be on the

22
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:29,820
test. Now, you know, I mean,

23
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,870
I think that nothing could be more
exciting than to understand clean oven

24
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,950
Tessera, you know, sort
of Kinosis us cases,

25
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,820
demonization, appa,
Fraydi's Whoa. You know,

26
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:45,060
to wander in the realms of these,
uh,

27
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:49,770
of these ideas and actually to use them
as a machinery for practical criticism,

28
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:54,150
to take a poem and to see what you can
actually do with these ideas really is,

29
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:58,500
and I'm serious, uh, an exciting
process. And you may sit,

30
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:03,501
you may very much resent not having
these six ratios on the exam.

31
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:03,991
Uh,

32
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:08,160
and you may wish to hear more about them
and you'll hear something about a few

33
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,360
of them in passing today. But, uh, uh,

34
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,290
if you do wish to hear more about them,

35
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:18,000
perhaps perhaps your
sections will provide,

36
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,920
provide some guidance. Um, in
any case, in any case, uh, the,

37
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,110
the contributions of bloom,
uh,

38
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,930
to theory in my opinion, and I hope
to bring this out in the long run,

39
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,530
have primarily to do with the fact
that I think he can legitimately and

40
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:41,440
authentically be called an
important literary historiography.

41
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,550
That is to say together with,
uh,

42
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,940
people like Dan Yanoff and Jakobson,
uh,

43
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,770
in earlier in the chorus,

44
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:54,771
Hans Brobeck yellows later in the course
bloom does seriously deserve to be

45
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:58,980
considered a literary historian.
That is to say a,

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,440
with a theory about literary
history on a par with those,

47
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,300
with those other figures. Uh, uh, it's,

48
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,410
this hasn't always often been remarked.
As a matter of fact, the general,

49
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,970
the general critical attitude toward bloom
is that he's hopelessly a historicist

50
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:19,000
cares.
Nothing about history,

51
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:23,760
cares nothing about the way in which the
real world impinges on literature. Um,

52
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,750
and in a certain measure as, as we'll
also see there's some truth in this,

53
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:33,550
but he has a powerful argument about
the relationship among texts as they

54
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:37,930
succeed each other in history. Uh,
it's an argument which I think,

55
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,980
which I think really we ignore at
our peril. It's an important one, a,

56
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:44,200
and it is a psychoanalytic one,
which is,

57
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,940
which is one of the things that places
him at this point in the course,

58
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,970
you'll notice that as we turn,
you know,

59
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,590
you remember the sort of try partition
of the subject matter of our course,

60
00:03:56,591 --> 00:04:01,240
which it's all headed up in the syllabus
and all clearly to be understood.

61
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,210
You know,
first we have logo genesis,

62
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,750
the production of literature by language.

63
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,370
Then we have psycho genesis,
the production of literature
by the human psyche.

64
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,390
Then we have socio genesis,
the production of literature by social,

65
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:20,890
economic and political and historical
factors. Okay, fine. Well and good.

66
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,030
But you may have noticed how much trouble
we've had getting into psycho genesis.

67
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,880
We keep saying we've
arrived at psycho genesis,

68
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,410
but we actually continue to be working
obviously with linguistic models.

69
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:37,230
Here's Lacan telling us, you know,
the, uh, the unconscious is a,

70
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,500
resembles a language,

71
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:43,120
is structured like a language books
telling us that it's the verbal, uh,

72
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:44,410
structure,
uh,

73
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,150
arising out of the relationship between
metaphor and Matana me that constitutes

74
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:52,930
the narrative text. And we keep
sitting around twiddling your thumbs,

75
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:54,200
waiting for somebody to say,

76
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:57,610
let's now think about the psycho
genesis of the text. Well,

77
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:02,290
bloom brings us closer,
uh, uh, big and he himself,

78
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,180
you know, when he speaks of the
poet in the poet, uh, is uh, is, is,

79
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,330
is concerned to describe
what he calls an agon,

80
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,360
a psychological agon or struggle between
the belated poet and the precursor,

81
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,650
uh, taking place, uh, at
that level in the psyche.

82
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,850
But even bloom of course is talking
about the relation of texts to text.

83
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:29,760
He is talking about relations
which are arguably verbal, um,

84
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,750
verbal influenced by the way. Uh,
he always professes contempt for,

85
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,070
he calls it moldy fig philology.
Uh,

86
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,940
but I think that as you study the
examples of literary influence in Bloom's

87
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:46,530
text, anxiety of influence, map
of minutes reading and so on, uh,

88
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,670
you will see that there is a
kind of dependence on verbal, uh,

89
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,570
Echo,
verbal continuity that his theory,

90
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,150
the strong version of,
of his theory struggles against.

91
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:04,130
But I think nevertheless does,
does link itself to, and, um,

92
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,160
and I want to move into a general
exploration of the topic of influence by

93
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:14,531
talking in fact about how unstable
the relationship between an idea of

94
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:15,831
influence,

95
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:20,831
which is let's say psychological or a
world based and an idea of influence,

96
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,670
which is word based, uh, can be,

97
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,820
it's not as simple and straightforward
a distinction as one might imagine.

98
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,550
Um, so we're, we,

99
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:38,510
we linger in these linguistic models and
there's a long tradition in which the,

100
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,080
uh, confusion between the
psychic and the linguistic, uh,

101
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,390
is manifest. And it has to do
with the traditional subject,

102
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,720
the very traditional subject of imitation.

103
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:56,290
Plato and Aristotle agree that
art poetry is an imitation.

104
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,310
It's, it is both of them
say an imitation of nature.

105
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:05,210
Plato thinks it's done badly.
Aristotle thinks it's done well,

106
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,300
but they both agree that poetry
is an imitation of nature.

107
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,780
Uh, and then, uh, as time passes,

108
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:18,560
this idea of mummy says, uh, imitation,

109
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,580
the imitation of nature gradually becomes
transformed so that by the time you

110
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:27,940
get to the silver age of
a Roman literature, uh,

111
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,760
a high water mark of elegance
in the Latin language,

112
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,470
by the time you get there,

113
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,590
you have rhetorical theorists
like quintile in and Cicero
and others talking not

114
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:42,860
about [inaudible], but
about in Latin. Of course,

115
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:48,010
any Tatio same idea seemingly that
they're still talking about imitation.

116
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:53,120
But the strange thing that's happened
is now they're not talking about the

117
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:54,530
invitation of nature anymore.

118
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:58,910
They're talking about the imitation
of literary models. In other words,

119
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,310
the imitation of language.
Uh,

120
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,610
the way in which we can establish cannons
by thinking about the relationship of

121
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,980
particular poets and other writers with
a tradition of literary expression,

122
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,900
uh, from which they
emerge. So this then he,

123
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:21,530
me Tacho becomes a language
based theory of influence,

124
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,210
uh,

125
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,210
or Ising seemingly spontaneously out
of a nature based theory of influence.

126
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,580
Now take a look at the first
passage on your sheet, uh,

127
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,100
from Alexander Pope's essay on criticism.
He's talking about Virgil here.

128
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,560
Homer, the argument is, has to
have imitated nature. After all,

129
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:46,370
there were no literary models to imitate.
So of homer imitated anything.

130
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:49,940
It must've been nature. Well,
fine, homer imitated nature.

131
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,110
But then along comes Virgil in
this same period of, by the way,

132
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,260
when a rhetorical theories,

133
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,310
we're redefining imitation
as the invitation of verbal
models along comes verb

134
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,420
Virgil. Then he says, I'm going
to write my own national epic. Uh,

135
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,970
and you know what,
I'll just sit down and write it.

136
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,230
But then he starts looking at homer.

137
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,900
This is all what the pope is thinking as
he prepares to write the cup that's on

138
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:19,920
here. She, uh, he said that he then,
you know, he's, he starts to write,

139
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,540
but then he rereads homer.

140
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,700
And at first he feels terrible because
he realized that homer has said it all.

141
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,730
You know, there's two poems,
the Iliad and the Odyssey,

142
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,460
there's nothing left to say.
Homer has covered.

143
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:37,140
The entire homer has covered the
entire waterfront. And you know, so,

144
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:41,430
so what verbal is co Virgil is sort
of stock. What is he going to do?

145
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,300
Well,

146
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,300
what he can do if he can't imitate a
nature anymore because homer has done that

147
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,140
is he can imitate homer.

148
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:54,650
And the result is he comes to a sort of
realization that pope epitomizes in this

149
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:56,874
couplet.

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,440
But when to examine every part he came,

151
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,800
that is to say every part
of Homer's compositions,

152
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:09,450
every part of his own composition as
he undertook to write his own epic,

153
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,390
when to examine every part he came,

154
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,860
nature and homer were,
he found the same.

155
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,580
And so here you have emerging the idea
that to imitate nature and to imitate

156
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:27,750
art, to imitate the things of
the world, people of the world,

157
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,460
and to imitate language is part
and parcel of the same process.

158
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,410
To do one you necessarily
and perforce do the other.

159
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,350
And that's what I mean
by saying that we still,

160
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:44,790
we're still struggling to get away
from the logo genetic model to the

161
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,280
psychogenetic model.
We are still,

162
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,110
even in the most traditional expressions
of how influence works like pokes.

163
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,530
We are still concerned, uh, to, uh,

164
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,510
to distinguish and find it very difficult
to distinguish between nature and art.

165
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,000
Uh, when Samuel Johnson, uh,

166
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:08,001
50 years after pope is still saying
nothing can please many or please long,

167
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,600
but just representations
of general nature.

168
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,870
He is in this idea of representations
and in the idea of general nature

169
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,750
teetering between a sense that it's things
in the world that are imitates and it

170
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:30,021
is existing literary models that are
imitates and from which art takes its cue.

171
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:37,130
All right, so this, there's a kind
of collapse then of it in the,

172
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:40,740
in the idea of imitation,
there's a kind of a collapse,

173
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:44,660
a surprising collapse perhaps when
you think about it between, uh,

174
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,730
the notion of the imitation of nature
and the notion of the imitation of art.

175
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,040
Now when we,

176
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,260
we turn then to the two texts
that you read for today,

177
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:59,130
both of which are theories of influence,
uh,

178
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,810
you can see that ts Elliot to,
uh,

179
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,850
is a little bit unclear
as to the relationship of
these two sorts of imitation

180
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,350
for Elliot. The individual
talent that inserts itself into,

181
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:19,351
that engages with tradition has to
cope with what Eliot calls the mind of

182
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:25,840
Europe.
Page five 39 lefthand column.

183
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,940
I'll read a fairly extensive
passage because this is one of the,

184
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,020
one of the most accessible
summaries of what Elliot has to say.

185
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,050
The poet must be quite aware of the
obvious fact that art never improves,

186
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:45,220
but the, but that the material of art,
am I in the place I want to be in? Yes,

187
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:48,340
but that the material of
art is never quite the same.

188
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,260
He must be aware that the mind of Europe,
the mind of his own country,

189
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:58,240
a mind which he learns in time to be
much more important than his own private

190
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:00,220
mind.
And let me just stop there and say,

191
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:05,340
this seems as much unlike bloom as it
can possibly be because bloomed the

192
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:10,030
romantic, you know, there's all
about one's own private mind,

193
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,680
the struggle of the individual
mind to define itself over against,

194
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,050
uh,
all of those mines,

195
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:22,070
jostling for attention that preceded to
overcome them to the point where they

196
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:27,070
are in effect he faced.
And the belated, uh, ego,

197
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,460
uh,

198
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,290
can finally establish itself
as prior to all preceding egos.

199
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:32,681
I mean,

200
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:37,090
this sort of struggle scenes and I say
seems because I'm going to be lingering

201
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:41,290
over this for a while,
seems to be absent from Elliot.

202
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,450
Elliot seems to be all about selfie face
meant about the recognition that the

203
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,720
mind of Europe is more
important than one's own mind.

204
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,870
That if one is to contribute anything
as an individual talent to tradition,

205
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,420
that contribution has to be
a matter of the most, uh,

206
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:03,340
acutely sensitive,
uh,

207
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:07,780
awareness of everything.
Not that one is struggling to be,

208
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,070
but that one is not.
Uh,

209
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,560
it seems in other words like a very
different perspective to continue the

210
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:17,080
passage, uh, is a mind.

211
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,790
The mind of Europe is a mind which changes
and that this change is a development

212
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,950
which abandons nothing on route,

213
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,100
which does not superannuation
either Shakespeare or homer
or the rock drawing of

214
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:31,210
the Magdalena Ian draftsman.

215
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:36,130
This is a development refined that
this development refinement perhaps

216
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,480
complication certainly is not from
the point of view of the artist.

217
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,270
Any improvement.
In other words,

218
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,360
the relationship between tradition and
the individual talent is a relationship

219
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,600
of entering into a vast
matrix of literary,

220
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,520
philosophical,
uh,

221
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:03,610
and other sorts of expression that
changes and yet never really transforms

222
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:10,271
itself and certainly can't be understood
as a grand march or progress toward

223
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,080
some great goal because nothing is ever
lost and nothing radically innovative

224
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:22,900
can ever really be introduced.
I hope you're thinking in, in,

225
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,660
in reflecting on a passage of this kind
about a good deal that we've passed

226
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:30,050
through already got hammered
sense of tradition, uh,

227
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,260
as something which depends absolutely
on the awareness of continuity,

228
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,250
on the willingness to meet
the past half way, uh,

229
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,780
to enter into a merger of horizons,
uh,

230
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,690
in which the past and the present can
speak in an authentic way to each other.

231
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,040
Uh, and that, um, in
other ways this, uh, this,

232
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,840
this idea or possibly also the
Russian formalist idea, uh,

233
00:15:56,841 --> 00:16:01,580
and it's Darwinian sense that the
dominant and the recessive elements of any

234
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:06,560
literary texts are always present
at any time. It's just that, uh,

235
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,620
they tend perpetually in a
kind of oscillation to be
changing places with each

236
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:12,381
other.

237
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:17,381
So the whole gamut of literary
possibility of expressive possibility is

238
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,870
according to theories of,

239
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:26,020
of history of this kind is always already
there and one's own entry into this

240
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,940
vast sea of expressive possibility is
always a subtle thing that certainly can't

241
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,500
in any way be seen to showcase or to
manifest any sort of original genius,

242
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,800
uh, as the romantic tradition might
want to insist on it. All right,

243
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:49,790
so this,
I this,

244
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:54,550
this is basically the perspective
of Elliot and one. Um,

245
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,160
and, and, and one from which,
uh, certainly, you know, uh,

246
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,370
bloom would obviously
seem to be diverging.

247
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:06,020
Now I want to say, I want
to argue that actually, uh,

248
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:11,050
there's a tremendous amount of continuity
between Elliot and bloom and that

249
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:16,550
blooms a tradition in the balloons.
Sorry, anxiety of influence.

250
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,370
I've never discussed this
with health, by the way. I,

251
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,180
those of you who may be taking
his seminars, I, you know,

252
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:27,310
I leave it up to you whether you want
to take this up with him. You know, I,

253
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:31,580
you know, I, as I say, I leave that
up to you. Um, but I think, um,

254
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,370
I think a strong argument can be
made and I have made it in print.

255
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:39,040
So Harold has seen it,
uh, that, uh, that, uh,

256
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,000
bloom misreads is a strong
ms reader of ts Elliot,

257
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,730
which is to say such as the
logic of strong misreading the,

258
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,140
that said everything bloom
has to say already. And I do,

259
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,060
despite this extraordinary appearance
of total difference in perspective,

260
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,830
the traditional versus the
romantic, uh, and so on. Um,

261
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,700
and I don't want to go into detail in
this argument for fear of being considered

262
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:09,060
obsessive, but I, I'd, I'd, I'd like to,

263
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:13,350
I'd like to make a few points about it
in passing because I think it's such a

264
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:17,250
perfect exemplification of how
the anxiety of influence works.

265
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:21,720
Bloom has always denied the influence
of traditional tradition and the

266
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:25,740
individual talent. He said, I mean,
he acknowledged his influences,

267
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,810
but there Amerson Nicha the great
romantic poets and so on. Uh,

268
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,040
but, and, and he's, as I say them and
were denied the, the influence of Elliot.

269
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,730
And yet as one reads, Elliot, I'm going
to spend some time with Elliot. Now.

270
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,560
It seems to me that at least in
skeletal form, in suggestion,

271
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,490
bloom is all there already,
which is after all,

272
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,260
all bloom ever says about the relationship
between a precursor and a belated

273
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,030
writer. So it can't beat surprising
Kenneth all right now, um,

274
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,290
now first of all, a bloom of course, uh,

275
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,330
it's very important to bloom,
uh,

276
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,360
to show the way in which the new
reconstitutes the old that is to say the

277
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,280
appropriation of the precursor text,

278
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,170
which is not unknown optional text,
although it,

279
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:22,020
and that's one of the things that's
sort of counter about, about blooms, uh,

280
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:26,530
writing in this period. He insists that
there is a particular precursor text.

281
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,240
I mean, you know, the precursor texts
for Tintern Abbey has listed us,

282
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,470
don't tell me about other precursor
tax. It's less of this. And he shows,

283
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,500
he shows how this is the case.
So the,

284
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,530
but the relationship between the belated
text and the precursor text is such

285
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:48,171
that we can never read the
precursor taxed the same way again.

286
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,460
The,
the,

287
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:55,461
the strong misreading of the precursor
text is so powerful and other words that

288
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,850
it becomes our strong misreading.
We just can't think about,

289
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:04,740
listen this in the same way on this view,
after we've read Tintern Abbey,

290
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,480
and I mean if, and if this seems
counterintuitive, um, just, I mean,

291
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:13,890
just think they think about certain
examples that might come to mind. Um,

292
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,870
the most obvious example
is the famous as is,

293
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:22,770
is the famous text by bore has called
Prm and our author of Don Quixote,

294
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:26,030
I imagine a number of, you
know, that text, but, uh,

295
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,190
what it consists in basically is,
uh,

296
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:34,190
it's a kind of an anecdote
about a freshmen writing. I,

297
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:39,000
as I recall in the end of the
19th century, uh, in Spanish,

298
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,920
uh, a text and this text
is, as it turns out,

299
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,250
verbatim word for word Cervantes,

300
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:53,020
Don Quixote, all it's not
Cervantes. Don Quixote is pyramid.

301
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:56,950
Ours don't Don Quixote and think how
different it is. This is a Frenchman,

302
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,730
the end of the 19th century, a
Frenchmen writing in Spanish. Ooh,

303
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,090
that's pretty impressive.
Much more impressive than Cervantes,

304
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:07,000
merely writing and his own
language, you know? And,

305
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,000
and it's a completely different
historical perspective,

306
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,890
whereas Cervantes thinks he's being a
little bit ironic about his own historical

307
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:17,230
moment. You know, the death
of chivalry and all that.

308
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Think about how ironic you can be about
that historical moment writing several

309
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,530
centuries later with everything that
you know now. I mean it's, I mean,

310
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,560
what a tour de force to be able to
write don Quixote at the end of the 19th

311
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:36,640
century in another language, a toll, a
whole new ballgame. How can you read?

312
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,930
How can you ever read so Avantis
Don Quixote in the same way?

313
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:45,880
It seems naive right now. That's now
that's not the point of the store.

314
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,310
The front of the story is actually to
be little pyramid are, but this is, but,

315
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,060
but you can see this as a,
as a theory of strong mystery pyramid pay.

316
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,030
I'm on our thinks he's doing
something new. All right.

317
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,630
Fact is he's not doing
anything new at all.

318
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,340
His belief that he's doing something
new is precisely his misreading of the

319
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:10,270
precursor taxed. And yet, and by the way,

320
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:12,760
you don't have to have
read the precursor text.

321
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,300
You don't have to have read
the precursor to it's precise.

322
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,330
It's precisely his misreading
of the precursor tech.

323
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,480
But that miss reading after all
is something in it's very power,

324
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,470
which, uh, as it were,

325
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,500
infiltrates our own understanding of the
precursor text making it impossible for

326
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,040
us to read it the same way again.

327
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:37,210
Think of Joyce's Ulysses and we all
know that you listened his life.

328
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,170
Virgil's Aeneid is based on
the odyssey that it as it were,

329
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:42,910
recycles the Odyssey.

330
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,660
But it seems to be looking at the Odyssey
through the wrong end of a telescope.

331
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:49,060
I mean, it's just, I mean
it's dragging all the,

332
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:54,090
all the sort of heroic dimension of the
poem down into a kind of nitty gritty

333
00:22:54,911 --> 00:22:59,840
account of everyday life
in recent society. And,

334
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:03,910
and, and in other words, it's
it implicitly, precisely.

335
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:07,660
And following the artists,
he debunks the heroic myth of the Odyssey.

336
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,910
How can we read, in other words,
the Odyssey in the same way, again,

337
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,400
after we've read, you'll listen. He's now,

338
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:17,380
it has to be said in bloom would say this.

339
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,940
Ulysses is not a strong misreading
of the odyssey because it's perfectly

340
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:23,200
conscious of what it's doing.

341
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:27,790
It knows exactly what it's doing with
respect to the text of the Odyssey.

342
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:31,810
So it's a, so it's a, it's
a deliberate misreading, uh,

343
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,990
which has other virtues is
not quite the same thing,

344
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:39,820
but what it does have in common with
blooms theory and what it has in common

345
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
also with Elliot idea about
the relationship between
the individual talent and

346
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:50,570
tradition is that it
reconstitutes tradition.

347
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,190
It makes us see,
it doesn't just provide something novel.

348
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:00,170
It makes us see tradition
itself, uh, in a different way.

349
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,990
Page five, 38, the right hand column,

350
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:08,980
about halfway down the existing monuments
says Elliot Forum an ideal order among

351
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:10,250
themselves,

352
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,900
which is modified by the
introduction of the new,

353
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,870
the really new work of art among them.

354
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,350
The existing order is
complete before the new year.

355
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:26,410
New Work arrives for order to persist
after the supervision of novelty.

356
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,810
The whole existing order must be,

357
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,120
if ever so slightly altered.

358
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,710
We can't quite see it the same way again.
So it's,

359
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:42,070
it's a dynamic mutual relationship between
tradition and the individual talent,

360
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,690
the strong precursor and they'd
be laded poet in each case,

361
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,640
which is mutually transforming and the,
and the basis,

362
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:57,641
the principle of transformation as the
belated poets strong misreading of the

363
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:00,344
precursor,

364
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,270
which simultaneously
asserts the egotistic,

365
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:10,250
the egoistic priority of the belated poet.
I'm doing something new,

366
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:14,030
I'm going where no one has ever
gone before and I'm doing so,

367
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:18,620
so powerfully that it's a question
whether there actually was anybody before,

368
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,340
uh,

369
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:24,340
on the one hand and the strong precursor
who turns out as one reflects more and

370
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:29,390
more and more about the relationship to
have said everything the belated poet

371
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:30,650
says already,
right.

372
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,920
So simultaneously a what blooms
theory of literary history,

373
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:42,671
his literary historiography places a
premium on innovation and on conservatism

374
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:48,880
or tradition simultaneously unlike God,

375
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,790
them are leaning toward the
conservative or traditional,

376
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,350
either Lee or the Russian formalists
leaning toward the innovative,

377
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:03,160
the blooming and idea simultaneously
countenances the idea of tradition as

378
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:09,041
something absolutely continuous and
also of tradition as something which is

379
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:13,670
constantly being remade
or at least rethought.

380
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:19,070
And that I have to tell you is
very similar to TSL, its position.

381
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,530
So now again,

382
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,800
you know the famous aphorism
of Elliot on page five 39,

383
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,340
uh, the lefthand column at
the bottom, someone said,

384
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,470
the dead writers are remote from us
because we know so much than they did

385
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:41,840
precisely. And they are that which
we know rather good. I think, uh,

386
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,240
the famous aphorism of Tsl,

387
00:26:44,241 --> 00:26:49,241
it can also be understood as something
that bloom in his own way might very well

388
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,150
say.
The past is what we know,

389
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,690
but we're not aware of knowing it.
In other words,

390
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,140
I write the past when I
write my belated poem,

391
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,790
but I don't think I'm doing it.

392
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,780
I think instead that
I'm doing something new,

393
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,650
I am in the first revisionary ratio clean.
Amen.

394
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,150
I am swerving from the past.
I swerve out and down.

395
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,740
I find my own space,
like a Lucretia Adam.

396
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,290
I mean if it weren't for swerving
and Lucretia says, you know,

397
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:25,140
all the items would fall in the same
place, that wouldn't be good. So,

398
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,910
so they all swerve so they can all fall
in their own place. Well that's the,

399
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,980
that that is the belated poets sense
of what he's doing in relation to the

400
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:39,810
precursor. He's swerving out and
down from the precursor port, uh,

401
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,020
from the precursor put.
Uh, but of course he's not,

402
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,270
and we'll come back to this. He's not,
he's actually falling in the same place,

403
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,520
but the strength of that swerve,

404
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:55,550
the rhetorical gesture of the swerve is
so powerful that we do feel transported.

405
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,300
Once again.
We feel both at once.

406
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:05,420
The innovation and the
necessary conservative
conservatism or preservational

407
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:11,310
aspect of the new poets composition.

408
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,150
All right. So, um,

409
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,240
I think as I say that this
too is very much that, that,

410
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:21,840
that Elliot's aphorism too,
very much anticipates blooms view,

411
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,860
uh,
of the agonistic struggle among poets.

412
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,390
And then finally, you know, La is
famous emphasis and this of course,

413
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:33,440
nothing could seem to be
less bloomin'. And this, uh,

414
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:38,620
Elliot's famous emphasis on the poets
impersonality on the wish to escape

415
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:44,130
personality a lot. Of course he
says right hand column, page five,

416
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:47,250
41 and of section two.
But of course,

417
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,360
only those who have
personality. Any emotions? No.

418
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:56,220
What it means to water escape from these
things. Uh, you know, in other words,

419
00:28:56,221 --> 00:29:00,370
to enter a world of art and
effect, to abandoned, uh,

420
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,940
the sense that what's important
is, uh, my personal, uh,

421
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:10,140
psychological agony to,
uh, to, to enter, uh,

422
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:15,170
by contrast the mind of
Europe to recognize the
complete insignificance of any

423
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:19,380
individual mine, certainly my own, uh,

424
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,490
and to immerse oneself as a poet,
as an artist,

425
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:27,780
as a creator, if one can
still retain this term, uh,

426
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,800
in that which is,
uh,

427
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,260
infinitely more vast than one is oneself.
Well,

428
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:38,730
that doesn't sound very bloomin',
but look on page 1160,

429
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:39,900
the right hand column,

430
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,380
add blooms a third revisionary race,
yo

431
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,520
a [inaudible] or maybe it's
Kenosis. Huh? We'll see in a minute.

432
00:29:50,521 --> 00:29:52,620
Soon as I can find the page 1160,

433
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,550
that's cases and it's the
fifth revisionary ratio. Uh,

434
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,230
he's talking about,
he's talking about what the later poet,

435
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,660
the belated poet does,
uh,

436
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,160
in order to find a defined
space for himself. What,

437
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:17,160
what can I do in order to make
myself different from other people?

438
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:21,300
While you would think the answer would
be make yourself bigger than anybody.

439
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:21,631
I mean,

440
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:25,410
Wallace Stevens has a
wonderful poem called rabbit
as King of the ghosts and the

441
00:30:25,411 --> 00:30:26,800
rabbit swells up.
Uh,

442
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,770
so to become so big that it just
kind of overwhelms everything.

443
00:30:31,771 --> 00:30:35,990
And I always think of this as blooms,
belated poet, but if you have, but, but,

444
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,310
but if you have,
um,

445
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,460
a ski races as one of the
authentic revisionary ratios,

446
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,710
something very different is
happening to this same and, uh,

447
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,010
about halfway through the
definition definition five, um, he,

448
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,050
and by the way, the, uh,

449
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,980
the masculine pronoun is something that
Harold has never apologized for. Uh,

450
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:02,010
what he means is that a poet, um, is
gendered masculine, but that of course,

451
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:04,020
any woman can be a poet.
Uh,

452
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,870
we'll come back to distinctions
of that sort of later.

453
00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:10,710
He does think of Emily Dickinson,
for example, as a strong poet. Uh,

454
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:14,400
but it's obviously that's a controversial
aspect of Bloom's work, but he,

455
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:18,720
but he uses the, he is as the
masculine prologue unapologetically.

456
00:31:18,721 --> 00:31:23,400
And of course his theory is very much
caught up in the idea of oedipal conflict,

457
00:31:23,401 --> 00:31:27,960
which as Freud is always being
criticized for is unless you,

458
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,590
uh,

459
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:33,340
unless you projected into the realm of
the symbolic as Lacan and feminists luck.

460
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:38,250
Candians Du do is undoubtedly a
masculinist idea. You know, the,

461
00:31:38,251 --> 00:31:43,020
if the essential generational conflict of
human beings is between father and son,

462
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:48,080
well, you know, obviously, uh, problems
can be seen to arise from that. Um,

463
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,080
and uh, in Bloom's rhetoric in
his vocabulary, this, this, the,

464
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,840
the masculinist,
uh,

465
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,160
oedipal conflict is still
central in any case, uh,

466
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,250
returning to this point about the
effacement of the self in the very act of

467
00:32:06,151 --> 00:32:11,130
trying to find a place for, for oneself
as an innovator and he faced which,

468
00:32:11,131 --> 00:32:11,880
however,

469
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,880
once again seems to me to catapult bloom
back into the position of Elliot that

470
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:21,390
he is trying to misread strongly.

471
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:26,660
He says he yields the poet yields up
part of his own human and imaginative

472
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,980
endowment. In other words, he
curtails himself. He shrinks himself.

473
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,150
He makes himself less than he
might have been. Of course,

474
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,940
in order to be more than he has been,

475
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,900
he yields up part of his
own human and imaginative,

476
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:45,350
a dominant so as to separate
himself from others,

477
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,460
including the precursor.
So in,

478
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,820
in [inaudible] and also in Kinosis.
By the way,

479
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:57,821
there is a self shrinking or self
effacement on the part of these particular

480
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:03,260
moves of strong misreading
with respect to the precursor.

481
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,400
It's not another,

482
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:09,200
it's just a question of the rabbit as
king of the ghost is not a question of a

483
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:11,040
massive ego,
uh,

484
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:14,330
swelling to the point
where it fills all space.

485
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:18,230
It is more complicated than that.
And in being more complicated,

486
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:22,130
it is frankly more
Elliot. Like, all right,

487
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:25,140
so turning then more directly to a bloom,

488
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,950
his career begins his car.

489
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,040
It has always involved a sense of struggle
in their relationship among poets.

490
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,850
In his earliest work, uh, uh,

491
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,880
Shelley's mythmaking Blake's apocalypse
visionary company and his earliest work,

492
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,670
uh,

493
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:48,670
the idea of struggle was embodied
plainly as what he called Protestantism.

494
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,761
In other words,

495
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:54,410
he saw the tradition he was talking
about arising in relation to the

496
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:57,890
reformation. Uh, that
time when, as I said,

497
00:33:57,891 --> 00:34:01,400
in my thumbnail history of
Hermeneutics, uh, everybody,

498
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:06,350
everybody suddenly realized he had his
own Bible, his own relationship with God.

499
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:11,150
And other words that time
when human, uh, individuality,

500
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,510
uh, emerges also of course
called by many others.

501
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,810
The emergence of the
bourgeoisie in that moment,

502
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:23,140
the idea of Protestantism purely in the
sense as a character in DRL says that I

503
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:27,850
protest, uh, emerges
so that each poet, uh,

504
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:32,890
takes in some sense and adversary
stance toward previous literary models.

505
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:38,570
This is present in Bloom's work from
the beginning of his career. The, uh,

506
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,110
the,

507
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,700
the word Protestant gradually
gives way to the word revisionary.

508
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,890
And then, uh, that's the word that he
uses primarily in the visionary company,

509
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:50,140
for example.
Uh,

510
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:55,180
and then finally becomes the notion of
misreading the protest of the belated

511
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:58,880
figure is the protest,

512
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:02,420
which takes the form of transfiguring,

513
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,850
the precursor taxed,
uh,

514
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:08,660
in such a way that one can
find oneself to be original.

515
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,520
It is an oedipal struggle.

516
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:14,120
Now th th th this idea
of oedipal struggle,

517
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,000
which is largely unconscious,
is not new to bloom.

518
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:21,890
Just quickly to review the next
three passages on your sheet lawn,

519
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:26,270
Gina's the, uh, the author
who's actual identity,

520
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:31,190
we cannot quite determine,
uh, but who's on the sublime,

521
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:35,900
uh, an extraordinarily interesting
texts is available to us to read. Um,

522
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,430
I've got two passages from him.
The first is,

523
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,090
as if instinctively this is
in the moment of the sublime,

524
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,360
as if instinctively our soul is
uplifted by the true sublime fine.

525
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,560
That's what you would
expect anybody to say.

526
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,820
It takes a proud flight and it's
filled with joy and vaunting.

527
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:58,850
And this is where the surprise comes as
though it had itself produced what it

528
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:04,250
has heard. And other words, there
is a kind of, they're there,

529
00:36:04,251 --> 00:36:08,760
there's a kind of possession
by the other that takes place,

530
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:14,150
which is simultaneously
experienced psychologically
as possession of the other,

531
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:20,010
right. You know, it is speaking through
me. It's making me very excited.

532
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,540
Like a little kid,
you know,

533
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,440
the watching TV and somebody hits a home
run and the little kid goes like this

534
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:28,290
and thinks he thought he hit the
home run. I mean, he's, he's,

535
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,260
he's completely into the
fantasy of being that hero.

536
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,280
It's the same thing with the,
uh, with the response, uh,

537
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:41,300
to something that we haven't said so
such that in a certain moment we think we

538
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:45,930
have said it. It's a, it's,
it's a mutual possession.

539
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,960
It possesses us causing the psychological
reaction that we think of ourselves as

540
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,570
possessing it. And that, uh, uh,

541
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:58,080
it seems to me that there's real insight
in what launch ionist is saying and

542
00:36:58,081 --> 00:37:03,081
that it has and that it has an
important influence on Bloom's position.

543
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,680
Another passage from launch
dryness and a boat. And by the way,

544
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:10,320
I think what longe Anna says
here is absolutely true.

545
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,960
Plato is constantly abusing homer,

546
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:17,990
and yet nothing can be easier than to
show the ways in which the great Homeric

547
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,020
actions, uh, and even tropes, uh, uh, uh,

548
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:27,100
help shape platonic
thought. Uh, it's, it's,

549
00:37:27,101 --> 00:37:31,580
it's a fascinating topic and
Laryngitis, it seems to me, again, uh,

550
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:36,330
is exactly right about it. There would
not have been so fine a bloom, sorry.

551
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,950
So find a bloom of perfection on
Plato's philosophical doctrines,

552
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:46,100
unless he had with all his heart and
mind struggled with homer for primacy.

553
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:51,750
He even thinks in bloom in terms of that,
of wanting to be first,

554
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,140
even though in some part of your
mind, you know, your second,

555
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,380
he even struggles for primacy showing
perhaps too much love of contention and

556
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:05,640
breaking a lance with him as it were,
but deriving some profit from the contest.

557
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,860
Nonetheless,
for as he says,

558
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:11,130
this strife is good for mortal mortals.

559
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:16,080
Quickly and more commonplace
example taking from, uh, uh, bird,

560
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:21,210
a famous acid, his called
what is a classic, which is
all about influence. There's,

561
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:26,070
you know, the, the, the tradition of
essays, uh, called what is a classic,

562
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,130
Eliot wrote a great one in 1944,
uh,

563
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,840
is very much a contribution to the
history of the theory of influence. Uh,

564
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,610
so sad bird rights,
uh,

565
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,240
Gerta spoke the truth when he remarked
that Byron great by the flow and source

566
00:38:40,241 --> 00:38:44,740
of poetry feared that Shakespeare was
more powerful than him side. It's true.

567
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,510
Byron was always abusing Shakespeare,

568
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:51,160
fear that Shakespeare was more powerful
than himself and the creation and

569
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:53,350
realization of his characters.

570
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:56,650
He would have liked to
deny it the elevation,

571
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:59,770
so free from this as Gerda
talking the elevation,

572
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,500
so free from egoism irritated him.

573
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,570
He felt when near it that he could
never display himself at ease.

574
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,860
He never denied pope
because he did not fear him.

575
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,430
He knew that pope was an,
you know how short pope was.

576
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,520
He knew that pope was only
a low wall by his side.

577
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,130
So in other words,
he chose as his literary model,

578
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:27,310
somebody he knew he was better
than not true by the way,

579
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:30,010
but he thought he was
better than Alexander Pope.

580
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:33,580
And he perpetually denied a very,

581
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:35,950
very powerful influence on his writing.

582
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,300
Quarrelling constantly with Shakespeare
and Shakespeare and bar, dollar tree and,

583
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:44,440
and, uh, excessive love of hamlet
and all the rest of it. Um,

584
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:49,620
he's constantly sort of denying the any
influence or power over himself on the

585
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:56,761
part of Shakespeare he chooses and
other words for his precursor a week

586
00:39:57,011 --> 00:40:00,610
precursor instead of a strong precursor.

587
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,960
And all of this is a continuous theme,
uh,

588
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,520
in the psychodynamic of, uh,
of, of Bloom's theory as,

589
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,720
as he elaborates it.

590
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:15,970
So what complicates bloons argument
apart apart from the vocabulary and the,

591
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:20,290
and the philosophical range of the
thought is what I began with this,

592
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:24,730
the traditional idea of uh,
influence as a,

593
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,500
as an art nature problem, trying
to figure out in fact whether, uh,

594
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,370
the,
uh,

595
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:35,370
whether the crisis of influence is the
sense of one's orientation to nature,

596
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,080
one's ability to imitate nature,

597
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:43,081
have nature available to one or whether
it's word or I added the sense of ones,

598
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,780
which it seems to be, uh, more in bloom,

599
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,990
the sense of one's
relationship with texts.

600
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,600
But notice on page 1157,

601
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,000
that blown really doesn't want
to say it's just about texts.

602
00:40:58,001 --> 00:40:59,800
He doesn't really want to say that it,

603
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:04,980
that it has exclusively to do with the
strong precursor understood as it were,

604
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:06,310
as an author.

605
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,840
There is in some sense a
text of nature as well.

606
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:15,340
So that bloom says a bottom
of 1157 right hand column,

607
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,740
uh,
uh,

608
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:21,750
Freud's disciple auto rock shows a
greater awareness of the artists fight

609
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:27,300
against art end of the relation of this
struggle to the artist antithetical

610
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:31,300
battle against nature.
In other words,

611
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,070
nature is death.

612
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:39,370
Nature is that into which should he not
sustain himself in the triumph of his

613
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:47,190
assertion of priority.
Nature is that into,

614
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,450
it's the author will fall back into,

615
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:55,550
into in the form of death. Weight'll they
try to transcribe that sentence. Okay.

616
00:41:55,551 --> 00:42:00,180
Well but, but, but you, you
got, you got what I mean? Um,

617
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,680
so, uh, and,

618
00:42:01,681 --> 00:42:06,681
and this is an interesting problem and
bloom and bloom wants to insist that part

619
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:11,750
of the struggle of the belated
poet is a struggle for mortality.

620
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:17,110
Part of what it means to come first and
to know nothing ever having been there

621
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:22,991
before you is also to suppose
that you're going to be last,

622
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,910
that you're going to be immortal,

623
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:30,080
that you really do not
belong in an unfolding,

624
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,070
inexorable sequence of the
sort that we call history.

625
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,810
But that you are rather
something, a force, a genius,

626
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,700
a power that transcends history.
And this entails as much

627
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,780
the lie against time as bloom calls it,

628
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,320
holding off death as
it does, insisting, uh,

629
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:56,840
on their having been no beginning,
no priority,

630
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:59,570
no genesis in what you do.

631
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:04,460
You were there first or to
illustrate this very quickly,

632
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,630
let's look at passages
five and six on your sheet.

633
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,940
Wordsworth, uh, the
strong miss reader, uh,

634
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:17,150
and belated poet with respect to Milton,
uh,

635
00:43:17,151 --> 00:43:22,151
the particularly important strong miss
reader a and belated put with respect to

636
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:24,410
Milton and blooms view Wilton,

637
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:29,411
right Wordsworth rights in a kind
of programmatic or promissory poem,

638
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:34,530
uh, written actually in
1800, not, not published, uh,

639
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:36,770
until 1814 as part of his,

640
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:40,670
as part of the preface to a poem
of his called the excursion. Uh,

641
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,330
he wrote a prospectus, uh, to the recluse.

642
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:48,740
That's what at one time they incur the
excursion was supposed to be part of.

643
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,020
And he says, I'm not interested
in writing. Paradise lost.

644
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:58,670
Paradise lost for me as a thing of the
past. It's just, it's just archaic.

645
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:03,320
Who would care about the things
Milton cares about all strength,

646
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,490
all terror,

647
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:09,550
single or in bands that ever was
put forth in Personal Form Jehovah.

648
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:14,390
Where this thunder and the choir of
shouting angels and the imperial Thrones,

649
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:18,860
I passed them on alarm,
paradise lost. You know,

650
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,980
so that's just playing with toy
soldiers. You know what I mean? That's,

651
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,570
that's that,
that,

652
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,920
that's nothing compared with
what I myself am going to do.

653
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,360
Not Chaos,

654
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:34,480
not the darkest pit of Lowest
Aramis nor ought of blinder vacancy.

655
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:39,890
Scooped out by help of dreams can breed
such fear and awe and has fall upon us.

656
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,640
Often when we look into our minds,

657
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,620
into the mind of man,

658
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:51,330
my haunt and the main region of my song,

659
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:54,690
I'm not talking about God.
I'm not talking about heaven.

660
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:59,070
I'm not talking about hell.
I'm not talking about war heaven.

661
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:03,900
I'm not talking about anything
mythological or archaically, heroic.

662
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:08,520
I'm talking about this.
I'm talking about the mind of man.

663
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:12,750
I'm talking primarily about my mind,
but my mind is your mind.

664
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,950
Mind is universal and
in talking about mind,

665
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,650
I'm not falling back
into the pit of nature.

666
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,440
I'm keeping my focus not on the
sky gods that on the transcendent,

667
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,150
you know,

668
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:31,680
so starry junk as well as Stephen
called it of my precursors,

669
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,650
all those people with their
outworn superstitions.

670
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,340
I am not interested in any of that, but
I'm not interested in any of this either.

671
00:45:38,341 --> 00:45:42,360
I'm not interested in nature and I'm not
interested in that in which I would be

672
00:45:42,361 --> 00:45:45,030
buried if I reduced myself to that.

673
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,890
I'm interested in consciousness,
the psyche. In other words, uh,

674
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,070
my focus is Wordsworth says,

675
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,430
altogether psychological.
All right,

676
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:02,790
no interest in paradise
lost. You know, that's just
archaic. Well, look at passage.

677
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:05,520
Five,
three statements by Satan,

678
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,510
which bloom and cysts are.
Say,

679
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:12,390
it's not so much Milton because at
bloom follows Blake and Shelly in this.

680
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,570
It's not so much Milton who's the
strong precursor of Wordsworth.

681
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,680
It's actually Satan.

682
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:22,850
It's Milton's Satan who says the mind is
its own place and in itself can make a

683
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:28,830
heaven of hell, a hell of
heaven. Okay. Gee whiz. I guess.

684
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:32,900
I guess Satan is writing the
perspectives to the recluse, isn't it?

685
00:46:32,901 --> 00:46:36,900
Because that's what Wordsworth and saying
in the first practice to the recluse.

686
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:41,670
I know no time says Satan
when I was not as now.

687
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,820
That's what the belated
poet all with says.

688
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,900
I came first elsewhere in the poem.
Satan tells his troops,

689
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:53,910
you know what you God keeps
saying he created you. Do
you remember being created?

690
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:58,350
I don't remember being created.
I've always been there.
Right. You know, and that's,

691
00:46:58,351 --> 00:47:00,750
and, and, and that is in
effect what he says again,

692
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:05,730
what he repeats in this passage.
Finally myself and hell.

693
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,870
Well that's of course rather
an uncomfortable thing to say,

694
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:13,500
but at the same time it's the rabbit
as king of the ghost, isn't it? It is.

695
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,380
You know, whatever you can throw at
me, I'm it already, right? That is, uh,

696
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:21,450
and because the sole region ma,

697
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,480
the main heart and soul region of
my song is the mind is my own mind.

698
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:28,770
Alright?

699
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:33,490
So Satan has already said in paradise
lost everything Wordsworth can possibly

700
00:47:33,491 --> 00:47:35,620
say and the perspectives to the recluse.

701
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:40,830
He has strongly misread paradise lost
such that he thinks he's doing something

702
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:47,251
completely new while revealing precisely
that the strong precursor poet has

703
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:54,130
always already written what
the successor poet can,

704
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:56,590
right. The tension, the dynamic,

705
00:47:56,591 --> 00:48:01,591
in other words between conservation
and innovation is intact in all such

706
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:05,670
moments.
In all of the moments that involve,

707
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:10,030
that involve the anxiety of influence.
I'm sorry,

708
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:14,470
I have so little time for this. Give
me a minute or two because we have to,

709
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,810
we have to honor Tony.
Uh,

710
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:21,010
and it's rather obvious
that for Lacan Tony,

711
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:25,960
the tow truck is a text in which Tony
Saddles for the orb. J Patea, right.

712
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:29,710
Little bumpy,
the car and imperfect being,

713
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,250
but a helpful one and a friend.
That's what I call a friend.

714
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:38,160
Whereas the objects of desire
neato speeding. Oh, you know,

715
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:39,850
uh,
those are cars.

716
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:44,970
The objects of the objects of desire are
improper object choices on the face of

717
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:48,130
it. That's what an American eat
ego psychologist would said,

718
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:53,080
but they are in a more Boone well esque
way of putting it obscure objects of

719
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:55,780
desire as they motor on down the road,

720
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,710
which are simply unavailable to Tony,
uh,

721
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,600
as object relations at all.

722
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:05,020
And so the Nido and
speedy are the big other,

723
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:09,470
right and bumpy is the
object t all right. Now, uh,

724
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:13,360
it's perfectly obvious that
for Harold Bloom, Tony,

725
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:18,130
the tow truck is a strong misreading
of the little engine that could, it's,

726
00:49:18,131 --> 00:49:20,410
it's perfectly clear because,
you know,

727
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:24,240
but bumpy af is bumpy.

728
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:27,190
W is the hero of the
little engine that could,

729
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:31,820
the misreading involves
making Tony the hero, uh, uh,

730
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:35,500
who, who needs the help
of bumpy and other words,

731
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,050
bumpy in the folkloric sense of the story
becomes the helper, not the hero. Uh,

732
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:41,260
but, but, but,

733
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:45,160
but we can see after all that
the essential narrative model,

734
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,280
the model of, of the small, uh,

735
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:54,030
turning out through
perseverance and energy, uh, to,

736
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,640
uh, necessarily reinforce
the strength of the strong.

737
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,680
And it is about the strong and the weak,

738
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:04,570
both little engine that could and Tony
the tow truck or about the strong and the

739
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:07,270
weak, uh, that the strong, uh,

740
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:12,390
must in some sense or
another be supplemented or
supplanted by the week if the

741
00:50:13,721 --> 00:50:16,000
strong is fully to self realized.

742
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:20,530
We can't ever read Tony the tow truck,
the character Tony,

743
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:25,300
quite the same way again
after the appearance of bumpy.

744
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,600
And yet bumpy is nothing other than the
hero of the little engine that could,

745
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:33,030
uh, who, who, uh,

746
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:38,160
a subject position that has been
appropriated by Tony in this text.

747
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:43,070
And so the relationship is
again, an agonistic one, uh,

748
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:48,130
involving the transposition of heroism
from one character focus to another while

749
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:54,050
at the same time as anybody can recognize
who read both stories to their kids.

750
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:56,060
Uh, well, at the same time,

751
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:01,120
simply rewriting the story in a way that
the little engine that could completely

752
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:05,540
anticipates all right.
Uh, so much then for that,

753
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:10,010
we'll be returning to more
Lacanian pastures on Tuesday, uh,

754
00:51:10,011 --> 00:51:11,240
when we,
uh,

755
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,260
when we study their lives
and got Tommy and slower Gj.
