1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,980
So today we turned to,
uh,

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,190
a mode of doing literary criticism,

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,550
which was extraordinarily widespread in
beginning in the late seventies and into

4
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:19,920
the 80s, uh, called the
new historicism. It was,

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,840
uh, it definable in ways that I'll,
that I'll turn to in a minute.

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,840
And, uh, as I say,

7
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:31,770
prevalent to a remarkable
degree everywhere. Uh,

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,360
it began probably at the University
of California at Berkeley, uh,

9
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:39,270
under the auspices and
part of Steven Greene Blat,

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,720
who's a brief essay you've read for today,

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,440
Greenblatt and others,
uh, founded a journal,

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,460
still one of the most important and
influential journals in the field of

13
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:54,660
literary study called Representation's.
Um,

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,130
always has been,

15
00:00:56,131 --> 00:01:00,750
still is an Oregon for new
historicist thought. Uh,

16
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:03,390
it's the movement which began,
uh,

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,110
primarily preoccupied with
the early modern period,

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,130
so called renaissance. The new
historicism, uh, is in effect,

19
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:15,340
responsible for the replacement of the
term renaissance with the term, uh,

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,230
early modern, uh, and, uh, it's influence,

21
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:22,940
however quickly did extend
to other fields. Um,

22
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,400
some fields perhaps more than
others. It would be, I think,

23
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:30,720
probably worth a lecture that I'm not
going to give to explain why certain

24
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:32,730
fields somehow or another,

25
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,260
seem to lend themselves more readily to
new historicist approaches than others.

26
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,310
I think it's fair to say that in
addition to the early modern period,

27
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,290
the three fields that have been most
influenced by the newest eracism CISM or

28
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:50,300
the 18th Century British Romanticism,
uh,

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,110
and Americanists Studies,
uh, from the, uh,

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,580
late colonial through the
Republican period, uh,

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,590
the age, the emergence of print culture,
the emergence of the public sphere, uh,

32
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,500
as a medium of influence.

33
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,480
And the distribution of knowledge,
uh,

34
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,720
in the United States has
been a very fruitful,

35
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:18,180
he studied from new historicist points of
view. So those are the fields that are,

36
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:22,290
that are most directly influenced,
uh, by this approach. Uh,

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,070
when you read it went, when we
discussed the German McGann's essay,

38
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,810
you'll see how, uh, it influences,
uh, romantic studies. Uh,

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,130
now the newest Doris CISM, um, is, was,

40
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,160
and this probably accounts for its
remarkable popularity and influence,

41
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,090
uh, in the period roughly from the late
seventies through the early nineties,

42
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,360
the newest Doris and was a
response to an increasing sense of

43
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,130
ethical failure and the isolation of the,

44
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,560
as it was allegedly practiced in
certain forms of literary study,

45
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,520
beginning with the new criticism
through the period of deconstruction,

46
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,330
uh,

47
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,770
the recondite a discourse
of Lacan and others.

48
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:16,180
In psycho analysis,

49
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,020
there was a feeling
widespread among scholars,

50
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:24,210
especially younger scholars
that somehow or another, uh,

51
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,240
especially in response
to pressing concerns,

52
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,360
a sort of post Vietnam concerns
with globalization concerns with the

53
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:38,500
distribution of power, uh, uh, and um, uh,

54
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:43,360
and global capital. Uh, all
of these concerns, um, uh,

55
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:48,670
inspired what one can only call a
guilt complex in a academic literary

56
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:53,920
scholarship and led to
a return to history. Uh,

57
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,900
it was felt that,
um,

58
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,630
that a kind of ethical tipping
point had been arrived at, uh,

59
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,440
and that the, uh, modes of analysis
that had been flourishing, um,

60
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,560
needed to be superseded by modes of
analysis in which a history and the

61
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:15,880
political implications of what one
was doing, uh, became prominent.

62
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,260
And Central. Uh, I have to say that, uh,

63
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,240
in debates of this kind,

64
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:27,070
there's always a considerable amount
of hot air perhaps on both sides.

65
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:27,790
Uh,

66
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,790
in many ways it's not the case that the
so-called isolated approaches really

67
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:38,530
were isolated. A deconstruction
in its second generation, uh,

68
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,240
wrote perpetually about history,
uh, and undertook to Orient,

69
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,040
uh, the techniques of deconstruction
to an understanding of history. Uh,

70
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,900
just to give one example and the
new historicism on the other hand,

71
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,250
um,
events,

72
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,310
a preoccupation with issues of
form and textual integrity that,

73
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,250
uh,
certainly followed from the disciplines,

74
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:08,110
the approaches that preceded them.
And also to a large degree.

75
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:13,111
And this is of course true of a good
many other approaches that we're about to

76
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:16,930
investigate approaches based
in questions of identity.

77
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,110
Also to a large degree appropriated
the language of the generation of the

78
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:25,630
deconstructionists.
And to a certain extent,

79
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:30,631
certain underlying was died is having
to do with the binder of binary

80
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:35,650
relationship between self and
other binary relationships among,

81
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,380
uh, uh, social entities, uh,

82
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,360
as opposed to linguistic entities,
but still, as I say, inheriting, uh,

83
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:48,450
the essentially inheriting the structure
of thought of preceding approaches.

84
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,730
So as I say,
it was in an atmosphere,

85
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:56,731
in a polemical atmosphere
and at a moment of uh,

86
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,390
widespread self doubt in,
uh,

87
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,490
the academic literary profession that
the new historicism came into its own a

88
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:09,140
response,
as I say,

89
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,350
to the isolation of the text by certain
techniques and approaches to it.

90
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,840
Now,
very quickly,

91
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,370
the method of new historical analysis,
uh,

92
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,340
fell into a pattern,
a very engaging one,

93
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:30,341
one that's wonderfully exemplified by
the brief introduction of Greenblatt that

94
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:33,200
is, uh, that, that,

95
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:38,201
that I've asked you to read a pattern
of beginning with an anecdote,

96
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,160
uh, often, uh, rather far afield,

97
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,340
at least apparently rather far afield
from the literary issues that are

98
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:50,030
eventually turned to, uh, in
the argument of a given essay.

99
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,810
A Dusty Miller was walking down the road,
uh,

100
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:58,610
thinking about nothing in particular
when he encountered a bailiff, you know,

101
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,770
uh, and then certain legal issues
arise. Uh, and uh, somehow or another,

102
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:07,730
the next thing you know, we're
talking about king lear. Uh, this, uh,

103
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,880
rather marvelous,
um,

104
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,990
oblique way into a literary topics was um,

105
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,420
going to,
uh,

106
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,230
the brilliance in handling it
of Greenblatt in particular
and Louie Mantrose and

107
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:25,400
some of his colleagues.
This, uh, this technique, um,

108
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,260
became a kind of a hallmark
of the new historicism in
the long run. Of course. Uh,

109
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,820
it was easy enough,
uh,

110
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,350
to parody it and it has been
subjected to parody, uh,

111
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,970
and in a certain sense has,
uh,

112
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,760
been modified and chastened by
the prevalence of parity. Uh,

113
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,850
but nevertheless, um, I think, um,
shows you something about the way new,

114
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,130
newer historicist thinking works.
It is the newest or us isn't,

115
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,180
is interested following food co and
Fuko is the primary interest on the new

116
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:02,270
historicism. I won't say as much, uh,

117
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,300
about this today as I might feel obliged
to say if I weren't soon be going to

118
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:12,650
return to Fukiko. And the
context of Gender Studies, uh,

119
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:15,560
when we take up Fuko and
Judith Butler together.

120
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,610
But I will say briefly
that food co's writing,

121
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:24,080
especially his later writing,
is about the pervasiveness,

122
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,320
the circulation through social
orders of what he calls power.

123
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,040
Now, power is not just, or
in many cases in Foodco,

124
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,560
not even primarily the
power of vested authorities,

125
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,670
the power of violence,
uh,

126
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,740
the power of tyranny from above power in
Fuko though it can be those things and

127
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:52,310
frequently is,
is much more pervasively.

128
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:57,311
And also insidiously the way in which
knowledge circulates in a culture.

129
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,620
That is to say the way in which
what we think, what we think,

130
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:07,800
that it is appropriate to think,
uh,

131
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,860
acceptable thinking is distributed by
largely unseen forces in a social network

132
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,700
or social system. Power. In other words,

133
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:24,900
in food co is in a certain sense,
knowledge, or to put it another way,

134
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:30,110
it is the explanation of how certain
forms of knowledge come to exist.

135
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,830
Knowledge, by the way, not necessarily
have something that's true.

136
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,960
Certain forms of knowledge come
to exist in certain places.

137
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,260
So all of this is central to the work
of Fuko and is carried over by the new

138
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:51,450
historicist. Hence the interest
for them of the anecdote.

139
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:54,960
Start as far a field as you can imagine,

140
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,800
ugly start from what you will
finally be talking about,

141
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:02,340
which is probably some
textual or thematic issue in,

142
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,840
in Shakespeare or in the Elizabethan
mask or whatever the case may be.

143
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:12,020
Start as far afield as you possibly can
from that precisely in order to show the

144
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:18,681
pervasiveness of a
certain kind of thinking,

145
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,350
the pervasiveness of a certain social
constraint or limitation on freedom.

146
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,870
If you can show how pervasive it is,

147
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,700
you reinforce and justify
the food called in idea.

148
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,200
That power is, as I've said, uh, uh,

149
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:44,270
and insidious and ubiquitous
mode of circulating knowledge.

150
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,420
So all of this is implicit,

151
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:53,421
sometimes explicit in new historicist
approaches to what they do,

152
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:59,190
what they do.
So as I said,

153
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:03,570
Fuko is the crucial antecedent.
Uh,

154
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,950
and of course,

155
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:10,070
when it's a question of who co
literature as we want to conceive of it,

156
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:17,421
perhaps generically or as a particular
kind of utterance as opposed to other

157
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,344
kinds,

158
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:24,410
does tend to collapse back into the
broader or more a general notion of

159
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,430
discourse. Uh, because it's discourse,

160
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:34,431
it's by means of discourse that
power circulates knowledge.

161
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,080
Uh, once again, you know,

162
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,140
despite the fact that historicism
wants to return us to the real world,

163
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,310
it nevertheless acknowledges that
that return is language bound.

164
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:52,110
It is by means of language
that the real world, uh, uh,

165
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,250
shapes itself.

166
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:58,590
That's why for the new historicist and
we will buy this means I'll turn it in a

167
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:04,351
moment to the marvelous anecdote with
which Greenblatt begins the brief essay

168
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,040
that I've asked you to read.
That's why the new historicist lays such,

169
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,700
such intense emphasis on the idea that
the relationship between discourse call

170
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:18,430
it literature if you like,
you might as well. Uh,

171
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,960
the relationship between history
and discourse is reciprocal.

172
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,990
Yes.
History conditions,

173
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,840
what literature can say in a given epoch.

174
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:34,580
History is an important
way of understanding. Uh,

175
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,190
the valence see of certain
kinds of utterance at certain
kinds. In other words,

176
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:44,191
history is as it's traditionally
thought to be by the old historicism,

177
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:45,760
and I'll get to that in a minute.

178
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,720
History has a background
to discourse or literature,

179
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:52,150
but by the same token,

180
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,660
there is an agency that has to say a
capacity to circulate power in discourse.

181
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,860
In turn,
call it literature.

182
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,850
I am Richard the second.
No you not,

183
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:14,851
that says Queen Elizabeth when at the
time of the threatened Essex uprising,

184
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,380
she gets wind of the fact that Richard
the second is being performed as she

185
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:28,150
believes in the public streets and
in private houses. In other words,

186
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:29,830
wherever there is sedition,

187
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,040
wherever there are people who want to
overthrow her and replace her with the

188
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:39,460
Earl of Essex,
the pretender to the throne,

189
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,540
Richard the second is
being performed well. Now,

190
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:48,100
this is terrifying to Queen Elizabeth
because she knows she's a supporter of the

191
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:50,560
theater.
She knows that Richard,

192
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:54,850
the second is about a
king who has many virtues,

193
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,030
but a certain weakness,
political weakness,

194
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:02,190
and also weakness of temperament, guide
of weakness that makes him, you know,

195
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,670
sit upon the ground and tell sad tales
about the death of kings. You know,

196
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:11,790
that kind of weakness who is then user
served by Bolingbroke who became Henry

197
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:17,940
the fourth. Ah, introducing
a whole new, uh,

198
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,450
dynasty. Uh, and, and, and,
and, and, and, and focus of,

199
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,430
of the royal family in England.

200
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,980
Queen this Queen Elizabeth says they're
staging this plot because they're trying

201
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:36,241
to compare me with Richard the second
and preparation for deposing me and who

202
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:42,760
knows what else they might do to me.
So everything you know,

203
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,780
is this, this is a matter
of great concern. In other
words, literature. I mean,

204
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,970
Fredric Jameson says,
history hurts,

205
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,220
literature hurts to literature,

206
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:57,221
and other words has a discursive agency
that affects history every bit as much

207
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,470
as history affects literature,
literature out there,

208
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,820
theater, especially if, if it escapes
the confines of the playhouse.

209
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:09,920
Because as Greenblatt argues,

210
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,820
the playhouse has a
certain mediatory effect,

211
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:18,200
which diffuses the
possibilities of sedition. Uh,

212
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,890
w one views,
uh,

213
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,260
literary representation in the
playhouse with a certain objectivity,

214
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:25,700
perhaps that is,

215
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,910
that is absent altogether when interested
parties take up the same text and

216
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,670
stage it precisely for the purpose
of fomenting rebellion. Um,

217
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,730
and so, uh, literature,
especially when Kate went,

218
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:45,230
when escaped from its
conventional confines, uh,

219
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:46,370
becomes a very,

220
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:51,371
very dangerous or positive influence
depending on your point of view on the

221
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:53,780
course of history.

222
00:15:53,781 --> 00:15:58,781
So the relationship between history
and discourse is reciprocal.

223
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,700
Now in this,
uh,

224
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:06,701
Greenblatt wants to argue very v w with
a tremendous amount of stress and I

225
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:09,830
think effectiveness in this,
uh,

226
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:14,831
the new historicism differs from the
old historicism page 1443 and the right

227
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:20,540
hand column,
John Dover Wilson,

228
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,640
a traditional Shakespeare scholar,

229
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:27,641
and a very important one
is the spokesperson in
Greenblatt's scenario for the

230
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:29,630
old historicism.

231
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,780
And so the view I'm about to quote
is that of Don John Dover Wilson,

232
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,390
a kind of consensus about the relationship
between literature and history.

233
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,210
Modern historical scholarship,

234
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:49,211
meaning old historicism has assured
Elizabeth that she had this as the right

235
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:50,931
hand column,

236
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:55,730
but two thirds of the way down has
assured Elizabeth that she had nothing to

237
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:59,870
worry about. Richard. The
second is not at all subversive,

238
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:04,871
but rather a him to tutor ordered the
play far from encouraging thoughts of

239
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:06,164
rebellion,

240
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,230
regards the deposition of the legitimate
king as a sac religious act that drags

241
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:16,961
the country down into an abyss of
chaos that Shakespeare and his audience

242
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:22,121
regarded Bolingbroke as a usurper declares
John Dover Wilson is incontestable

243
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,320
but in 1601 neither Queen
Elizabeth nor the Earl of Essex.

244
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,310
We're so sure green black wins.
I mean, it's a wonderful example.

245
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:38,060
It's the genius of Greene Blat to
choose examples that are so telling.

246
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,240
And so in controvertible we know Queen
Elizabeth was scared on this occasion.

247
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,290
Um,
and it's at,

248
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:49,060
which makes it quite simply the case
that John Dover Wilson was wrong.

249
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,190
Suppose that retroed the second
was no threat to her. It's not the,

250
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:56,450
it's not a all the point that the,

251
00:17:56,451 --> 00:18:00,370
a broad ideological view of Richard.

252
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:04,420
The second was any different from what
Wilson said. It was perfectly true.

253
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,930
Bolingbroke was considered a usurper.

254
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,930
It was considered tragic that
Richard the second was deposed.

255
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,990
But that doesn't mean that the text
can't be taken over commandeered and made

256
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:17,554
subversive.

257
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Wilson doesn't acknowledge this because
his view of the relationship between

258
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:26,710
history and literature is all in
the history influences literature,

259
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,490
not that the influence can be reciprocal.
You see,

260
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:35,491
that's how it is that the new historicism
wants to define itself over and

261
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:37,990
against the old historicism.

262
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,080
If there is a political or
ideological consensus about,

263
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,220
uh,
legitimacy of monarchy,

264
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,870
divine right of kings,

265
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,100
legitimacy of success and under the
sanction of the Church of England and all

266
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:56,950
the rest of it,
all of which is anachronistic.

267
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,870
When you were thinking
about these history plays,

268
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:03,400
if there is this broad consensus,
that's it.

269
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:08,200
That's what the play means
according to the old historicism.

270
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,160
Even though play Ley,

271
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,440
you can take the plot of the play
and completely invert those values,

272
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,480
which is what the Essex faction
does and staging it, ah,

273
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,400
in those places where Queen Elizabeth
success suspects that it's being staged.

274
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,420
Okay.

275
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:30,420
Now another way in which the old
historicism and the new historicism differ

276
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,380
correctly. I think according to Greene
Blat is that in the old historicism?

277
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:36,820
There is no question.

278
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:42,010
I'm looking at page 1444 of the right
hand column about a third of the way down

279
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,520
and the oldest Doris says,

280
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,740
there's no question of the the real,

281
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,550
the role of the historians
own subjectivity.

282
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,550
It is not thought says Greenblatt
to be the product of the historians

283
00:19:57,551 --> 00:20:02,551
interpretation history is just what is
will on views it objectively and that's

284
00:20:02,861 --> 00:20:03,694
that.

285
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Now notice here that we're back with
God Umer remember that this was God

286
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:14,440
hammers, accusation of
historicism. It's belief,

287
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:17,230
the belief of historicism,

288
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:19,960
what Greenblatt calls the old historicism,

289
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,070
that we can bracket out
our own historical horizon,

290
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,520
that we can eliminate all of our own
historical prejudices in order to

291
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:35,560
understand the past
objectively in and for itself.

292
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,870
This is not the case.
Said God. Remember God,

293
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:44,871
Omer said that interpretation
must necessarily involve
the merger of horizons,

294
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:50,290
the horizon of the other
and my own horizon.

295
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,790
As an interpreter,

296
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:56,080
I cannot bracket out my own subjectivity.

297
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,540
Okay.
If that's the case,

298
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,720
then God them or anticipates Greenblatt
and saying that the naive putty of the

299
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:09,751
old historicism is it's supposition that
it has no vested interest in what it's

300
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:14,560
talking about.
That is to say it's a position that he,

301
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:19,390
that it wants history to a cord
in one way or another with its own

302
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:24,370
preconceptions but isn't aware
of it. The anecdote, again,

303
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,700
a wonderfully placed in the polemical
argument that after all John Dover Wilson

304
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:35,881
delivered himself of these opinions about
Richard the second before a group of

305
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:41,401
scholars in Germany in 1939 is after all
rather interesting Hitler is about to

306
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:47,560
be the Bolingbroke of Germany.
John Dover Wilson Watson,

307
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:51,790
his audience to say, Hey, wait a minute.
You know, stick with vested authority.

308
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,150
You know, you have a weak
democracy, but it is a democracy.

309
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:58,630
Don't let it get away from
you. You know, uh, and,

310
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,930
and so he is speaking, um, you know,

311
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,960
the horse already having escaped from
the barn in this reassuring way about

312
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:12,121
German politics as a means of sort of
reinforcing his own view of the politics

313
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,820
of Elizabethan England.

314
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,990
But this greenglass opposes it.

315
00:22:18,991 --> 00:22:23,991
Something about which he has very little
self consciousness that is to say he

316
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:24,710
just,
he,

317
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,080
he his own interest as of course
it should be on this occasion,

318
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,610
is in the preservation
of vested authority, uh,

319
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,730
and his own interests then folds back
into his understanding of Elizabethan

320
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:45,721
ideology in such a way that it can
conform to that interest he has.

321
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,780
In other words, in short, as we say today,

322
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,190
a hidden agenda and is
very little aware of it,

323
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,330
unlike the new historicist
who following God.

324
00:22:58,331 --> 00:23:03,331
Hammer in this respect is fully cognizant
of the subjective investment that,

325
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,610
uh, leads to a choice of
interest in materials,

326
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:14,790
a way of thinking about those materials
and a means of bringing them to life for

327
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:19,210
us today and into focus.
In other words,

328
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:24,211
it's okay for a Greenblatt as it was for
God gossamer much to the horror of Ed

329
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:30,990
Hirsch to find the significance of a
text as opposed to the meaning of a text.

330
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:36,540
The significance of the text is that it
has a certain kinds of power invested in

331
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:43,300
it. Those kinds of power are
still of interest to us today,

332
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,390
still have relevance to what's
going on in our own world.

333
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,990
All of this is taken up openly,
uh,

334
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:55,610
as a matter of self consciousness
by the new historicist, uh,

335
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:00,170
in ways that according to
Greenblatt and his colleagues, uh,

336
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,830
uh, we're not available,
uh, consciously, uh,

337
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:08,510
in the older historicism
now the world as the news,

338
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,750
as the new historicism sees it.
And after I've said this,

339
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:16,751
I'll turn to McGahn the world as the
new historicism sees it is essentially a

340
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,760
dynamic interplay of power,

341
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,000
networks of power and subversion.

342
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,320
That is to say modes of
challenging those networks. Uh,

343
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,180
even within,
uh,

344
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,890
the authoritative texts that
generate positions of power,

345
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,570
the Elizabethan mask for
example, uh, which stages,

346
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,380
uh,

347
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,380
the relation of court to Cordier
to a visitor to hang her on,

348
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,550
uh, in wonderfully orchestrated ways, um,

349
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:58,870
is a means because it's kind
of poly vocal is a means of,

350
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,290
of containing within its structure,

351
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,680
elements of subversion according to the
argument that's made about these things.

352
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:14,210
The same with court ritual itself.
The same with the, uh, the,

353
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:19,310
uh, happenstance that takes place
once a year in early modern England,

354
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:23,150
uh, in which the Lord of Misrule, uh, is,

355
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,870
is d is so denominated,
uh,

356
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,590
and ordinary authority is
turned on its ear for one day,

357
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,170
Queen for a day, uh, as it were,

358
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:38,030
is something that is available
to any citizen once a year. Um,

359
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:43,150
and these are all ways of diffusing what
they in fact bring into visibility and

360
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,750
consciousness,
namely the existence,

361
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:52,780
perhaps the inevitable existence of
subversion with respect to structures and

362
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:56,960
circulatory systems of power.

363
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:02,290
And it's this relationship between power
and subversion that the newest Doris is

364
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:07,601
and especially in taking up issues of the
early modern period tends to focus and

365
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:12,800
to specialize in.
Now,

366
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,230
Jerome McGann is,

367
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:21,370
it's not wholly clear that Jerome again
has ever really thought of himself as a

368
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:25,790
new historicist.
He has been so designated by others,

369
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,590
but I think there is one rather
important difference in emphasis,

370
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:35,591
at least between what he's doing and what
a green bond and his colleagues do in

371
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:38,060
the early modern period.
Um,

372
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,320
mum again doesn't really so much
stress the reciprocity of history and

373
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:49,080
discourse. He is interested
in the presence of history,

374
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:54,260
the presence of immediate social and also
personal circumstances in the history

375
00:26:57,361 --> 00:27:01,290
of a text.
His primary concern is with,

376
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,040
at least in this essay is
with textual scholarship.

377
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,190
He himself is the,
uh,

378
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,290
editor of the new standard works of Byron.

379
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,330
He has also done a standard
works of Swinburne, uh,

380
00:27:14,331 --> 00:27:15,960
and he has been,
uh,

381
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,200
a vocal and colorful spokesperson of
a certain point of view within the

382
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:24,960
recondite debates of textual scholarship,

383
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:29,961
whether textual scholarship ought to be
or to produce a text that's an amalgam

384
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,740
of a variety of available
manuscripts and credit tax,

385
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:39,390
whether the texts that produces ought
to be the last and best thoughts of the

386
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:44,370
author. That's the position that again,
seems to be taking, uh, in this essay.

387
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,090
Whether the text on the
contrary ought to be, you know,

388
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:51,180
the first burst of
inspiration of the author. Uh,

389
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,960
all the people who prefer the earliest
versions of Wordsworth prelude for

390
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:59,100
example, uh, would favor that
point of who, um, in other words,

391
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,200
McGahn is making a contribution here
at least to the debates surrounding,

392
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,780
uh, editing, uh,

393
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:10,500
and the production of
authoritative scholarly texts.

394
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,250
It's in that context,
uh,

395
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,350
that the remarks he's making
about Keats have to be understood.

396
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,860
I think the primary influence on McGahn
is not so much Fuko then with this sense

397
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:28,371
of the sort of circulation of power
back and forth between history and

398
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:34,850
literature and literary discourse as
Bactine whom he quotes a on pages 18 and

399
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:41,550
19, or who's influenced he
sites I should say, rather, uh,

400
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:46,590
in a way that I think does pervade,
uh, what you encounter in reading.

401
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:50,280
Uh, what he then goes on
to say bottom of page 18,

402
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,820
what follows it says McGahn is a summary,

403
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
an extrapolation of certain key ideas
set forth by the so called buck teen

404
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,430
school of criticism,
a small group of Marxists,

405
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:07,230
good x from the Soviet Union who made an
early attack upon formalist approaches

406
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:09,660
to poetry just as he began.

407
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:14,750
And as the new historicist are themselves
in their turn doing the Bach teens

408
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:15,570
schools,

409
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:20,250
socio historical method approaches
all language utterances,

410
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:25,251
including poems as phenomena marked
with their concrete origins and history.

411
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:31,010
That is to say phenomena voiced by the
material circumstances that produced them

412
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,390
phenomenon.
In other words,

413
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:41,570
in which the voice of the sort of
romantic solitary is not really,

414
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,640
uh,
that voice at all.

415
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,700
But it's rather the poly Glassell
infusion of a variety of perspectives,

416
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:55,770
including ideological
perspectives shaping, uh,

417
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,940
that particular utterance.
And also in the,

418
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,660
in the case of the textual scholar,
uh,

419
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:06,750
shaping which have a variety
of manuscripts will be
chosen for publication and

420
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:14,641
for central attention in the tradition
of the reception of a given text.

421
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,260
So all of this, uh, uh, McGahn, uh,

422
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:22,300
takes to be derived from buck teen,
uh,

423
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,230
rather than from Foodco.

424
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,450
So I do think that's a significant
difference between our two authors.

425
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,710
Now I'm against most,
uh,

426
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:36,060
important contribution to the return to
history of the seventies and eighties is

427
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:41,950
a book,
a short book called the romantic ideology.

428
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,950
And this book, well, what it
is, is an attack on romanticism.

429
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:51,990
At least it's an attack on certain widely
understood and received ideas about

430
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:55,630
romanticism, ideas with which,
by the way, I don't agree,

431
00:30:55,631 --> 00:30:57,970
but this course isn't about me.
Uh,

432
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,080
the romantic ideology is
an amalgam of two titles,

433
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:07,950
one of them as the important early
critique of Romanticism by the German poet

434
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:13,330
and sometime romantic Heinrich
hyena called d romanticist Shula,

435
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,300
the romantic school,
uh,

436
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,730
in which the subjectivity,

437
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,470
even solipsism isolation
from social concern, uh,

438
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,500
and from, uh, and, and,

439
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,520
and from unfolding historical processes
of the romantic poets is emphasized and

440
00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:35,950
criticized. And in addition
to that, that's the word.

441
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:40,090
That's where the word romantic comes from
in the title of the Romantic ideology.

442
00:31:40,091 --> 00:31:45,091
And the other title that it amalgamates
is Marxists book the German ideology,

443
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,870
which is about many things,

444
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:51,871
but as in particular about room
lumpenproletariat intellectuals who think,

445
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:56,890
ah, with Hagle still following Hagle
despite the believing themselves to be

446
00:31:56,891 --> 00:32:01,891
progressive who think with Hagle that
thought produces material circumstances

447
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,990
rather than the other way around.
In other words,

448
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:09,670
people in short who are idealists
and therefore under this indictment,

449
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,110
also romantic. And so
again, it's title as I say,

450
00:32:14,111 --> 00:32:19,111
cleverly amalgamates these two other
titles and sets the agenda for this short

451
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:21,280
book,

452
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,280
which is an attack not just on romanticism
but what but on what he believes to

453
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:32,080
be our continued tendency
still to be in romanticism,

454
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,490
still to be romantic.

455
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:38,730
And there his particular object of
attack is the so called Yale School,

456
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,980
um,

457
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,780
who are still under attack in the
Essa that you've read for today.

458
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,410
Uh,

459
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:50,410
Paul Demonn and Geoffrey Hartman's a
well known essay on Keats's to autumn or

460
00:32:50,691 --> 00:32:54,800
singled out for a particular,
uh, scorn and does praise. Um,

461
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:59,810
and so, and, and, and all sort
of on the grounds that, um,

462
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,460
yes, it's all very well to
read romanticism to conduct,
come to understand it,

463
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,930
even to be fascinated by it. But we
can't be romantic. In other words,

464
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:13,130
our reading of Romanticism,
if we are to be social animals,

465
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:16,120
politically engaged, invested, uh,

466
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,430
in the world as a social community,
uh,

467
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,520
our reading of Romanticism
must necessarily be an
auntie romantic critique.

468
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:28,940
This is a, as I say, still
essentially the position taken up,

469
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,350
taken up by [inaudible]. I
mean, I'm sorry by him again.

470
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,210
All right.
So I've,

471
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:40,280
I've explained the ways in which he
defers from Greenblatt and leaning more

472
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:45,320
toward Bach teen than toward
Fuko. Um, I've explained that, uh,

473
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,060
McGahn is engaged primarily and talking
about issues of textual scholarship in

474
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:55,061
this particular essay that he defends
Keats's last deliberate choices that he

475
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:59,720
believes the so called
indicator text of 18,

476
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:02,480
20 of Lavelle.
Don saw marriage song.

477
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:05,610
Mercy is Keats's last deliberate choice,
uh,

478
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:10,000
as opposed to the 1848
text, uh, published, uh,

479
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,920
by a monk to mills, uh,
in the addition of Keats,

480
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:17,690
his poems that he brought
out at that time. Now

481
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,250
I think that in that,
in the time I,

482
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,630
I want to sort of linger over McGann,

483
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,420
I do want to say a few things
about what he says about Keats.

484
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,270
I want to, I want to, to,

485
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:37,330
to emphasize that his
general pronouncements about
the historicity of texts,

486
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:43,661
about the permeation of texts by the
circumstances of their production,

487
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:50,090
uh, their conditioning by
ideological factors, uh,

488
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:51,650
is unimpeachable.
Uh,

489
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:56,651
it seems to me that this is a necessary
approach at least to have in mind,

490
00:34:56,721 --> 00:35:01,490
if not perhaps necessarily to
emphasize in one's own work of literary

491
00:35:01,491 --> 00:35:06,380
scholarship. Uh, the idea that
a text just falls from a tree,

492
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,350
um, if anybody ever had
that idea, by the way,

493
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,690
is plainly not a tenable
one. Um, and the, uh,

494
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:17,930
and the opposite idea that
the tax that it texts is a,

495
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,960
is emerges from a complex matrix of
social and historical circumstances is,

496
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,300
uh, is certainly a good one.
So if one's to criticize,

497
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:32,930
but again, it's not a question of
criticizing his basic pronouncements.

498
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:36,620
It seems to me, um, nothing. I think
it'd be said really against them.

499
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,170
The trouble is that in the case of McGann,
who's a,

500
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,610
who's a terrific prominent
romantic scholar, uh,

501
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:49,560
with whom one I suppose hesitates to
disagree. And in the case of McGann,

502
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,910
everything he says about the texts
that he isolates for attention.

503
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,830
And this essay is simply consistently
wrong. I mean, it is, I mean,

504
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,381
it,
it,

505
00:35:59,381 --> 00:36:04,381
it's almost as if pi compulsion that he
says things that are wrong about these

506
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:05,880
texts.
And I just,

507
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:10,500
and the reason I asked you in my email
last night to take a look at them if you

508
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,890
got a chance is so that,
um,

509
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:18,060
so that these few remarks that I
make now might have some substance.

510
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:23,040
Uh, take for example, La
Beldam. So I'm artsy, uh,

511
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,470
in the first place.
Who says,

512
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:33,500
we only read the 1848 text us scholarly
edition and his main object of attack is

513
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:37,800
Jacksonville injures
scholarly edition of Kate's.

514
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,160
A scholarly edition gives you
basically a variorum apparatus.

515
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,010
Yeah. Maybe it gives you a
particular text in bold print,

516
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,470
but it gives you the variant text in
smaller print and the in a footnote it,

517
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,700
you know, it, it doesn't
withhold the variant texts
from him. He says, it says, no,

518
00:36:56,701 --> 00:37:01,680
look, there's this to, you know, take
your choice. Really the, the, the,

519
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:06,150
the atmosphere of a variorum scholarly
edition is an atmosphere of take your

520
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:09,390
choice,
not a kind of tyrannical,

521
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:14,540
a imposition on the public of a
particular version of the text.

522
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,570
Everybody knows the 1820 indicator texts.

523
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:23,571
What can nail the wretched white is at
least as familiar to me as a romanticist,

524
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,980
as what can l the United arms,
the way in which the 1848 tax begins.

525
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:29,881
And frankly,

526
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:34,590
how many raw mat people
who aren't romanticist know
anything about either text.

527
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,270
I mean, what are we talking
about here for the wrong?

528
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,530
The romanticist know what going on.

529
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,140
They're not in any way hornswoggled by
this historical conspiracy against the

530
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:51,150
1820 indicator taxed. And people who
aren't romances don't care. That's what,

531
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,760
that's what it comes down to.
But I mean,

532
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:58,170
if it's not enough simply to say that,
you know, turning to the question,

533
00:37:58,171 --> 00:38:02,910
which text is better? Well, it's
hard to say which text is better.

534
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:07,911
Mcgann's argument is that the 1820 is
better because it's a poem about a guy and

535
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:11,820
a girl who sort of meat and
the next thing you know,

536
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:16,560
they're having sex and that doesn't
turn out so well. In other words,

537
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:20,910
it's about the real world. These
things happen. Uh, it's not a romance,

538
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,900
whereas the,
what can LD wretched night,

539
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:29,430
the 1848 version and all
of its, uh, other variants,

540
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:33,870
the kisses for and so on.
Uh, the 1848 version, um,

541
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:38,320
is, uh, kind of unselfconscious
in McGann's view,

542
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,840
romance, subscribing to certain
medieval ideas about women, uh,

543
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,920
simultaneously putting them on a
pedestal that pedestal and, and,

544
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:50,340
and fearing at the same time,
uh,

545
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:53,920
that they're invested with a
kind of black magic which, which,

546
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:58,950
which destroys the souls and s and
dissipates the SAP of deserving young

547
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:03,010
gentlemen. Um, all of this, you know,

548
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,040
is ideologically programmed according
to him again in the 1848 version.

549
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,520
Why? Because Charles Brown
behave despicably toward women.

550
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:16,240
He didn't like fanny Brawne. Uh,
and because Monkton millions,

551
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:21,241
the actual editor of the 1848 edition
loved pornography and was a big collector

552
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:23,920
of erotica.
Uh,

553
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:28,480
so that's why the 1848 text with it's,

554
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,230
uh,
w w w w with,

555
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:35,250
it's a fear of and denigration of
women in contrast to the 1820 texts is

556
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:40,870
superior. Well, two things. First of all,

557
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:46,500
who's to say the 1848 texts
wasn't Keats's last thoughts.

558
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,220
In other words,
yes,

559
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:52,570
he was already ill when the indicator
taxed was published in 1820.

560
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:57,660
It is pretty close to the
end of his ability to think
clearly about his own work

561
00:39:58,211 --> 00:40:01,000
and to worry very much about the
forms in which it was published.

562
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,040
But at the same time,

563
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,360
we don't know when Brown
received his version of the text.

564
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:09,340
We can't suppose as Mcgann,

565
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:13,360
more than half applies that Brown
just sort of sat down and rewrote it.

566
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,170
And then nobody,
nobody has ever really said that.

567
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,610
And if he didn't rewrite it, then Keith's
must've given it to him in that form.

568
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:25,240
Who's to say that wasn't
his last and best thoughts.

569
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:28,240
Who's to say Kate's didn't
really want to write a poem?

570
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:33,290
This kind of after all the title taken
from Amy and evil ballad by eyelash

571
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:37,120
shock,
Jay [inaudible] mercy,

572
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,810
it bears out the, the, the, the,

573
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,390
the what can l the United arms version.

574
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,190
It's about a Morgan La fe type. It's
about, I mean, for better or worse,

575
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:53,191
whatever we think of that ideologically
it is about if the title is right,

576
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,090
uh, the kind of woman who is, who is, uh,

577
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:03,260
evoked in the 1848 version as opposed to
the kind of woman who is evoked in the

578
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:07,810
1820 versions. So the 1848 is simply
more consistent with the title.

579
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,280
That's one point to be made,

580
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:14,560
but the additional point to be made
is that taking advantage of the new

581
00:41:14,561 --> 00:41:18,280
historicist acknowledgement
that one's own subjectivity,

582
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:22,450
one's own historical
horizon is properly in play.

583
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,680
In thinking about these things again,
uh,

584
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,840
is then able to infuse Keats's texts and
therefore Keats his intentions with a

585
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:35,090
pleasing political correctness.

586
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,190
That is to say Keith's cat possibly
have thought in that demeaning way about

587
00:41:40,191 --> 00:41:42,710
women by the way, everything,
I mean I like kids,

588
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,800
but everything in his letters suggest
that he did a key Keats Keats can't

589
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,580
possibly have thought in that
demeaning way about women.

590
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,570
Therefore,

591
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,580
the 1820 text is the text that
he intended and preferred.

592
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,370
Okay.
That of course,

593
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,400
makes Keats more consistent with our
own standards and our own view of the

594
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:11,720
relations between the sexes. But does
it make Keats, does it? In other words,

595
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,280
make sense?
Uh,

596
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:18,310
visa vi the Kate's whom we know and
despite his weaknesses and shortcomings

597
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,240
love, uh, and so there is a great
deal, in other words, to be sad,

598
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,343
uh,

599
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:29,380
over against McGann's assertions
about this textual issue.

600
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,890
Not necessarily in defense of the 1848,

601
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:38,150
but agnostically with respect
to the two of them saying, yeah,

602
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:41,900
we better have both of them were
better put them side by side,

603
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:45,620
we'd better read them together.
But if by some theology,

604
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,180
the 1820,

605
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,020
where somehow subsequently
preferred to the 1848,

606
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:54,220
that would be every bit as much,
uh,

607
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,520
of an historical misfortune
as the preference insofar
as it has actually existed

608
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,740
of the 1848 for the 1820 [inaudible].
Uh,

609
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,510
and so I think that's the
perspective one wants to take. Now,

610
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,700
I was going to talk about, um, to autumn,
I'll only say about his reading of,

611
00:43:13,701 --> 00:43:18,230
to autumn that McGann who, who doesn't
seem to like the poem very much. I mean,

612
00:43:18,231 --> 00:43:22,010
he likes La Belden Song mercy. So
it makes it politically correct. Uh,

613
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,180
he doesn't like to autumn because he
thinks that autumn was published in

614
00:43:26,181 --> 00:43:30,930
collusion with Keats's conservative
friends and the poems of 1820, uh,

615
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,150
which burglarized everything he had to
say of a progressive political nature.

616
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,190
And he thinks that to autumn
is a big sellout. In other
words, that eight, yes, 18,

617
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:42,680
19 happened to be a year of good harvest.

618
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:46,670
And so Kate's turns that year of good
harvest into something permanent,

619
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:51,070
into a kind of cloud cuckoo land,
uh, in which, you know, the,

620
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,460
the fruit falls into your basket and the
fish jump into your net and everything

621
00:43:55,461 --> 00:43:58,880
is just perfect. Well, do you
think the poem is really like that?

622
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:03,710
You've read the third stanza which began
totally ignores apart from where the

623
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,380
songs is spring. I, where
are they in there was he, he,

624
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:10,310
he gives you the opening but it doesn't
give you any sense of the rest of the

625
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:11,330
stands it for,

626
00:44:11,331 --> 00:44:15,590
because for him to autumn is all
about the first stanza for him.

627
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,920
Kate seems to identify with the bees
who think warm days will never cease for

628
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:26,690
summer has or Brynn, their
clammy cells. Keats is like a B.

629
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:31,040
He's all into the sensuous. Well again,
just in terms of historical evidence,

630
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,160
this is outmoded by at least 18,
but by at least 18 months.

631
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:39,810
If we consult Keats's letters.
He was like that early in his career.

632
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,730
But he has had severe misgivings,
uh, about a PR point of view,

633
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,130
which is, uh, which is represented.

634
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:51,210
And what he said in an earlier letter
o for a life of sensations rather than

635
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:55,500
thoughts that's no longer Keats's
position when writing to autumn.

636
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:00,270
Kate's his position when riding off to
autumn is the position of a guy who has a

637
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:03,240
sore throat justices,
tubercular brother did,

638
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:08,360
who is increasingly afraid that he's going
to die soon and is trying to confront

639
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,570
mortality in writing.
What is in fact a,

640
00:45:12,571 --> 00:45:14,640
and I say in fact advisedly,

641
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,990
the most perfect lyric ever
written in the English language,

642
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:24,090
which is Ma and which is most certainly
not a celebration of, you know,

643
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,170
uh,

644
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:29,400
sort of wandering around like an aimless
be thinking that the autumn is perfect,

645
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:34,170
but that autumn is always perfect. Uh,
and that warm days will never cease. Uh,

646
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:38,400
and that everything is just lovely. And
the garden that is not that kind of poem.

647
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:38,851
Uh,

648
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:43,851
and it's really a travesty of it to
suppose that it is simply on the grounds

649
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:49,070
that it was published in the poems
1820 a as a kind of sell out to the

650
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:53,820
establishment, uh, under the advice
of Keats's conservative friends.

651
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,830
All right so much then, um, for
McGann's remarks on Keets, which has a,

652
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,840
which I want to say again,
you know,

653
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,900
in no way in Pune or undermine the
general validity of the claims that he's

654
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:11,520
making about, uh, taking historical
circumstances into account precisely.

655
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,850
We need to take them into account
and we need to get them right.

656
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:19,980
That's the challenge of course,
of working with historical circumstances.

657
00:46:19,981 --> 00:46:24,260
You have to get it right. Uh,
and so, uh, with that said, uh,

658
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,410
let me turn quickly to a review of Tony,
uh,

659
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,340
from Bactine to the new
historicism. I'm a, uh,

660
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,290
glide over,
uh,

661
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,910
Tony according to Jameson because we
did that at the end of the last lecture.

662
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:41,120
So let me go back to Bactine.
Uh,

663
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,090
you can see the way in which in the
structure of Tony The tow truck, uh,

664
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,780
the first part of the poem is absolutely
saturated with the first person

665
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:53,460
singular. I do this, I do that.
I liked my job, I am stuck.

666
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,270
I then as you read along through the text,

667
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:00,870
you'll see that the I disappears
or if it's still appears,

668
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,110
it's in the middle of a line rather
than at the beginning of the line.

669
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:09,240
In other words, that the eye, the
subjectivity, the first person singular,

670
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:14,241
the sense of having a unique voice is
gradually subsumed by the sociality of the

671
00:47:17,821 --> 00:47:19,620
story as it unfolds.

672
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:24,830
I am no longer I defined
as a romantic individual.

673
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,100
I am,
I rather defined as a friend.

674
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,390
That is to say as a person
who has relation with
otherness is what constitutes

675
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:38,050
his identity.
And in that mutuality of friendship,

676
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,840
the first person singular disappears.

677
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,830
What is spoken in tone of the tow
truck, in other words, in the long run,

678
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,490
is not the voice of
individual subjectivity,

679
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,450
but the voice of social togetherness,
uh,

680
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,890
the voice of otherness
according to your house.

681
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:57,843
Uh,

682
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,560
the important thing about Tony the tow
truck is that it is not the same story as

683
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:07,360
the little engine that could and other
words in each generation of reception.

684
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:07,990
Uh,

685
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:12,990
the aesthetic standards that prevail
at a given time are reconsidered,

686
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,590
uh, and rethought, reshuffled
a new historical horizon,

687
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:20,260
a new aesthetic horizon emerges,
uh,

688
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:23,230
and texts are constituted
in a different way,

689
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,380
much also as the Russian
formalists have said,

690
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:31,000
only with the sense in the house of the
historical imperative little engine that

691
00:48:31,001 --> 00:48:33,590
could, is all about the, uh,

692
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:38,700
inversion of power between the little guy
and the big guy so that the little guy

693
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:42,670
helps the big guy. Uh, and
that is unequivocal, uh,

694
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,140
showing as in Isaiah in
the Bible that the, uh, uh,

695
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:51,870
the valleys have been raised and the
mountains have been made low. Uh,

696
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:56,470
that's not the way Tony, the tow truck
works. The little guy himself needs help.

697
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:01,330
He needs the help of another little guy.
There is a reciprocity,

698
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,600
not dialectically between little and big,

699
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:09,460
but a mutual reinforcement
of little by little. Uh,

700
00:49:09,461 --> 00:49:11,620
and that is the,
uh,

701
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:16,800
change in aesthetic horizon that one can
witness between the little engine that

702
00:49:16,991 --> 00:49:20,370
could and Tony,
the tow truck and van,

703
00:49:20,371 --> 00:49:25,000
you mean the important thing as I think
we've said is the idea that the narrator

704
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:26,410
is the apparatus.

705
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:31,600
The humanization of the natural world of,
I'm sorry,

706
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:36,601
the humanization of a mechanized world
through our identification with it is

707
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:41,770
what takes place in Tony the tow truck.
In other words, all these cars and trucks,

708
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:45,220
all these smiling and frowning houses,
uh,

709
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:49,600
of course have as their common
denominator there non humanity,

710
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:54,970
but the anthropomorphization of the
cars and trucks and have the houses

711
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:59,950
constitutes then as the human,
they are precisely the human.

712
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,870
We see things.
In other words,

713
00:50:01,871 --> 00:50:06,871
from the point of view of the apparatus
we see just as the film goer sees things

714
00:50:07,391 --> 00:50:08,890
from the point of view of the camera.

715
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:13,450
So we see Tony the tow truck from the
point of view of the tow truck, right?

716
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,150
And so it's all liquid and,

717
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:20,180
and what happens just as the camera
eye point of view leaves the,

718
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:24,430
that which is seen as Benyamin
puts it equipment free.

719
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,890
So oddly enough,

720
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,440
if we see things from the
standpoint of equipment,

721
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:34,730
what we look at is the moral of the story.
In other words,

722
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:38,660
the humanity of the story.
What we see, in other words,

723
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:43,661
surrounded by all of this equipment is
precisely the equipment free human aspect

724
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,310
of reality.

725
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:50,990
So to honor the tow truck works in a
way that is consistent with Benu means

726
00:50:50,991 --> 00:50:54,680
theory of mechanical
reproduction for Adorno. However,

727
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:59,330
the acquiescence of this
very figure, the, the,

728
00:50:59,331 --> 00:51:04,250
the apparatus of mechanical reproduction
of towing again and again and again,

729
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:09,460
the acquiescence of there's very figure
in the inequity of class relations

730
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:14,330
rejected as always by Nieto and speedy.

731
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:19,630
The acquiescence to this figure proves
that the apparatus which Benyamin is

732
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:24,881
there a tax to be independent of the
machinations of the culture industry,

733
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:30,550
that the apparatus in turn can be
suborned and commandeered by the culture

734
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:35,810
industry for its own purposes.
All right,

735
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:40,390
I will skip over Jameson,
the old historicism, which,

736
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:45,020
which read simply reconfirms [inaudible]
the old historicist reading of Tony

737
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:50,140
simply reconfirms a status quo in
which virtue as clear vice is clear,

738
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:57,050
uh, and both are uncontested,
uh, and nothing changes.

739
00:51:57,051 --> 00:52:01,110
In other words, a status
quo, uh, which reflects, uh,

740
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,390
a stagnant, existent,
unchanging social dynamic,

741
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,600
the newest sources from a
lot of ways of doing this.

742
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,890
But let me just conclude by suggesting
that if literature influences history,

743
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:13,611
Donny,

744
00:52:13,611 --> 00:52:18,611
the tow truck might well explain why
today we're promoting fuel efficient cars.

745
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:20,090
Uh,

746
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:25,090
why the attack on the gas
guzzler and the SUV or minivan?

747
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:28,880
I am too busy. Uh, why
the attack, what, what,

748
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,710
why the attack on these vehicles
is so prevalent in the story. Uh,

749
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,800
and why, uh, if we read today's headlines,

750
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:41,090
we need to get rid of the
Humvee if GM is to prosper, uh,

751
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:45,860
and we need to downsize and
streamline the available models.

752
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:46,910
The little guy,

753
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:51,620
Tony and bumpy reaffirm the need,
uh,

754
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:55,340
for a fuel efficient,
smaller vehicles. Uh,

755
00:52:55,341 --> 00:52:57,710
and don't you can plainly see that Tony,

756
00:52:57,711 --> 00:53:02,120
the tow truck is therefore a
discourse that produces history.

757
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,440
All of this,
uh,

758
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:08,210
according to the prescription of Tony
is actually happening. All right.

759
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:09,730
Thank you very much.
Um,

760
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,800
one thing that needs to be said about
Tony the tow truck is it has no women in

761
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:20,010
it. Ah, and that is the issue that
we'll be taking up on Thursday. Right.
