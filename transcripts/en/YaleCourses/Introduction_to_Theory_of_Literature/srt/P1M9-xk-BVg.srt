1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,773
Today

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,033
today we're,

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,840
we're still focused on
individual consciousness,

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,330
uh, why you might ask, well,

5
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:20,331
as the site or model for symbolic
patterning of one sort or another,

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,290
uh,
uh,

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,790
we can speak of the psycho
genesis of the text or film,

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,190
uh, perhaps in the case,
certainly have Jijak, uh,

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,580
to some extent also have Dilas. Uh, and,

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,640
and therefore we can still
understand today's readings online,

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:41,950
uh,

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,950
Thursday's readings as belonging to the
psychological emphasis in our syllabus.

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,140
This is actually our farewell to
the psychological emphasis. And,

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,760
uh, it is, uh,

15
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,790
so arranged because there are intimations
in today's authors that there are

16
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:10,410
political stakes.
That is to say in one way or another,

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,590
we're to understand their argument about
the way in which the psyche functions

18
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,130
as a, as having political
implications. Uh, [inaudible],

19
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,920
uh, is fascinating. It seems to me and
his brilliant reading of the crying game,

20
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,750
uh, at the very end of your essay
in the moment when he says, look,

21
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:35,370
this isn't just a kind of
abdication from responsibility for,

22
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,140
um, uh, the IRS republican
revolution. Uh, the,

23
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:45,230
the soldier has not merely walked away
from his role in revolutionary activity.

24
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,600
He has discovered in his private
life that is to say in the, in,

25
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,120
in, in the erotic dimension
of his consciousness,

26
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,450
the need for revolution from within,

27
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,750
he has disrupted his per necessarily
disrupted his own thinking,

28
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,170
uh,

29
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,170
in ways equally radical too and closely
parallel to the disruption of thinking

30
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,480
that's required to understand,
uh,

31
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,210
one's relationship with the emerging,
uh,

32
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,130
stat republican status of Ireland.
And so says [inaudible] Jack,

33
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,280
there are political implications
for the upheaval in consciousness.

34
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,080
That is, uh, it,

35
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,110
it ultimately tragic and counter
with the big other and tails.

36
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,060
Uh, I should say in passing
also about Jijak that, um,

37
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,270
as your editor I think goes into this a
little bit in the italicized preface up,

38
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,320
that there are temptations,

39
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:57,321
political temptations entailed
in this fascination with,

40
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,160
uh,
and,

41
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,310
or even perhaps transcendent object
of desire for the individual,

42
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:10,690
but also for the social psyche.
In religious terms,

43
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,870
there is a perhaps surprising
or counterintuitive
friendliness toward religion

44
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,630
in Jack's work on the grounds that
faith or the struggle for faith,

45
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,590
uh,

46
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,590
after all does constitute and effort
to enter into some kind of meaningful

47
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,260
relationship with that which one
desires yet at the same time can't have.

48
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,620
And by the same token,
and this is where, uh,

49
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:43,621
this is where in certain moments he
confesses to a kind of instability in his

50
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:46,990
political thinking,

51
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:51,260
even though he is by and large on the left
and partly needs to be understood, uh,

52
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,860
as a disciple of Mark's.
Nevertheless,

53
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,980
he recognizes that in politics there's
a kind of excitement but also perhaps

54
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:05,290
potential danger in fascination
with a big idea. Uh,

55
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,850
it could be of course, some form
of progressive colleague activity.

56
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,601
It could,

57
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:14,950
on the other hand be the kind of big
idea that countenance is the rise of

58
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:19,120
fascism. Uh, Jijak
acknowledges this, that the,

59
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,230
that public identification with a kind of,

60
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,390
uh,

61
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,390
of almost or completely
inaccessible otherness,

62
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,520
either as a political idea or as
a charismatic political leader.

63
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,430
Um, can after all, uh, open up a, uh,

64
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,620
a vertigo of dangerous possibilities.

65
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:48,610
I use the word vertical advisedly
because I'm going to be coming back to

66
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:52,390
Hitchcock to, I'm going to be
coming back to Hitchcock's vertigo,

67
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,960
vertigo in just a minute.
Um, but in the meantime,

68
00:04:55,961 --> 00:05:00,961
they're also obviously political stakes
in Dulles to those of course presents to

69
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:06,220
us in the for in this first chapter
of his book a thousand plateau.

70
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,150
Uh, he presents to us a
kind of thought experiment,

71
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,300
both as something
recommended to the reader,

72
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,990
see if you can think in this new,
so radically,

73
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,970
radically innovative way,

74
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,740
but also providing a model for
thinking of this kind in the style and

75
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:27,640
organization and composition
of the chapter itself.

76
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,050
So as a thought experiment,
uh, once again, uh,

77
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,080
Delores has to do in thought with what
you might call a revolution from within.

78
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,810
But the implications once again in
politics as indeed also for Jijak,

79
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,130
uh,
are somewhat ambiguous.

80
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,270
That is to say the
rhizomatic mode of thinking.

81
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,360
And we'll come back to the rhizomatic,
uh,

82
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,120
mode of thinking as we go along,
um,

83
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,070
with which radically de Centering,
uh,

84
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,430
and which lends itself to
identification with, as it were,

85
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,490
the mass movement of Kali
activity can plainly be,

86
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,530
uh, uh, uh, progressively democratic.

87
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:17,531
That is to say democratic beyond even
what are social and cultural cultural

88
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:21,320
hierarchies accommodate.
But at the same time,

89
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,240
or I should say it can once again
be fascistic because, because,

90
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,840
uh, the, because the organization
of fascistic culture,

91
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:34,841
while nevertheless a kind of top down
arrangement where the fruit her involves

92
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,520
is nevertheless as,
uh,

93
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,990
the mass is mobilized nevertheless
in this mobilization, uh,

94
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,040
rhizomatic

95
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,710
delos is careful to point out that
in the, that, that there, that,

96
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:53,711
that rhizomes and rhizomatic thinking is
as he says repeatedly for the best and

97
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:57,530
worst,
rats are rhizomes.

98
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,950
Crab grass is a rhizome.
In other words,

99
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,610
everything which organizes
itself in this fashion, uh,

100
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,650
is rhizomatic. Much of it as
a I'll be coming back to, uh,

101
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,720
try to explain with a little more care
is for the good into those as view.

102
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:17,540
By the way, I say de Luz,
and the same way I said,

103
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,450
Wimsatt got tare is an important
colleague. And ally, uh,

104
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,850
they wrote many books together,
including one that I'll mention later.

105
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,680
They also wrote things separately,

106
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,780
but Dullas simply because his
oeuvre is more ample. And,

107
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,220
and people feel somehow or another that
he's more central to this work. Um, is a,

108
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,410
is a Synecdoche d for
Dilas and [inaudible].

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,580
And so I'll be saying to those, but
I don't mean to slight. Got Dowry.

110
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,820
Uh, in any case, uh, so, so, uh, we'll be,

111
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,820
we'll be examining, uh, the,

112
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,430
the delivery and rhizome a little bit
more closely, but in the meantime, um,

113
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:01,450
as to its political implications and
we are moving closer to the political,

114
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,500
uh, as we, as we began to think
about figures of this kind, uh,

115
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,180
is really on the admission of
both of them, somewhat ambiguous.

116
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,260
In other words, they're introducing new
possibilities of thought and as, and,

117
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,540
and they're very different
from each other as we'll see.

118
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,990
They're introducing new
possibilities of thought, uh,

119
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:26,180
but there Canada enough to admit that
they don't quite know where these

120
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:28,660
possibilities are going.
That you know, what, what,

121
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:33,690
what the implications or consequences of
successfully entering the thought world

122
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:40,100
of either one of them might
be. All right. So, um, yes, uh,

123
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,510
they,

124
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,890
they certainly have very different ideas
that I wouldn't blame you for saying

125
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:49,070
why on earth are we reading
these two texts together? Uh,

126
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,810
the overlap isn't altogether clear. I'm
going to suggest what it is in a minute.

127
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,890
But in the,
uh,

128
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,640
they are certainly on about
very different things.

129
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,080
Diller's uh, concerned
with the, with as I say,

130
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,480
introducing a kind of thought experiment
which has to do with the de-centering

131
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,230
of thought. Getting away from the
tree or rars model of thought.

132
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,400
We'll have more to say about that.
And uh, [inaudible] on the other hand,

133
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,900
following lock cause distinction between,
uh,

134
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,950
the object, uh, ready to
hand that you can have a,

135
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:28,440
if you want and the object of desire,

136
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:33,441
which such is the chain of signification
is perpetually something that exceeds

137
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,940
a, are out distances. Our grasp,
uh, in developing this idea,

138
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,451
uh,

139
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:44,451
and thinking about what the object desire
in all of its manifold forms might be,

140
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,470
develops this curious idea, which is
at the center of his thinking, uh,

141
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:51,670
of the blot that,
that the,

142
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:56,671
the element in narrative form the element
and the way in which our storytelling

143
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:01,920
capacities are organized,
which really can't be narrative,

144
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,330
which were narrated,
which really can't lend itself to meaning.

145
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,500
Meaning of course,

146
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:12,280
concrete specific meaning being
that which can be tied down, uh,

147
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,890
to, uh, to an accessible
object. And so, uh, so the,

148
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,920
the central idea that Jijak is attempting
to develop in his essay is this has to

149
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:29,031
do with this notion of the relationship
between the big other and the blood as

150
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:34,050
we'll see. So these, these, these strike
one is being extremely different ideas.

151
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,410
And as I say, I wouldn't
blame you for wondering, uh,

152
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,570
just what overlap there can
be. Well, at the same time,

153
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,860
I would think that as you
read these two, uh, rather,

154
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,930
the somewhat a bouncy and frantic pros
of both of these have both of these

155
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:54,120
texts.

156
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,120
You did say that they had a kind of
mood or stance or orientation toward the

157
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:05,760
critical and theoretical
project in common.

158
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,950
They seem in other words,
uh,

159
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,840
to be of the same moment and then
even though their ideas seemed to,

160
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,140
to be so very different,

161
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:16,170
that is the basic idea is they're
trying to get across seem to be so very

162
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:16,710
different.

163
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,090
You could perhaps imagine these two
texts as being written if it was just a

164
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:25,020
question of considering their
style by the same person. Uh,

165
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,910
I actually, I think that's not quite true,
but at the same time, the, the, the, the,

166
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:33,840
the kind of high energy too caffeinated,

167
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,970
a feeling that you get from
the pros of both, uh, is,

168
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:43,950
is, is something that might
give you pause, uh, and ask
and make you wonder, well,

169
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:47,640
just what,
what moment does this belong to?

170
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,810
The answer is important and
in a way obvious. I'm sure.

171
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,200
I'm sure all of you are ready to
tell me what moment it belongs to.

172
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,120
It belongs to post modernism.
This, these, these are,

173
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:06,040
these are two exemplars of what
is by far the most slippery.

174
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,340
Um, if one likes it, one
wants to say versatile,

175
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,560
if one doesn't like it,
one wants to say murky concept,

176
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,560
uh, to which we've been exposed in
the last 20 or 30 years. And, and,

177
00:12:18,561 --> 00:12:20,100
and I think that,
um,

178
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,180
I think that in a way we can bring them
both into focus as a pair a little bit.

179
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,480
If we pause somewhat simply
over the concept postmodernism,

180
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,181
I mean,

181
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:34,480
maybe that's one of the things you wanted
to learn and taking a course like this.

182
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:39,510
So, so, uh, I'm just providing
a service, um, you know, so,

183
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,230
so, so postmodernism, what
is, what is postmodernism?

184
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:50,320
I think we know what it is in
artistic expression. Uh, we've,

185
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,490
uh, we've encountered enough
examples of it. Uh, we are,

186
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,230
we have perhaps even taken courses in
which in the context of artistic form and

187
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:03,670
expression, it has come up
postmodernism in artistic expression,

188
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:07,630
particularly in the visual arts. But
I think this is, this is true of us.

189
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,800
Have of certain movements in both
narrative and poetry as well.

190
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,900
Postmodernism is an eclectic
orientation to the past.

191
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,900
In a certain sense,
it's a return to the past.

192
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:24,901
It's an opening up of textual possibility
to traditions and historical moments

193
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,580
of expression,

194
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,880
which modernism had tended to suppose
obsolete and to have set aside.

195
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,490
So that in artistic expression,
as I say,

196
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,580
postmodernism is an eclectic return to
possibilities thrown up by the history of

197
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:49,080
art and literature. So that,
I mean in architecture, um,

198
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:54,210
many examples are quite extraordinary
and many unfortunately are also hideous.

199
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,641
You know,

200
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:59,290
that there was a certain point 15 or
20 years ago when every strip mall,

201
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:03,970
every shopping mall was redecorated
or what's the word I want,

202
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:08,160
renovated every shopping mall was
random. And how did they renovate it? Uh,

203
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,270
they'd been flat, you know, they'd
been sort of means Vander roa,

204
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:16,340
sort of sixties modern before then it
just sat there flat and so the renovators

205
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:20,620
came along and put little gables on,
on the,

206
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,180
on the shopping mall so that each,

207
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:27,210
each little shopped in the mall now has
a gable and this is postmodern and the

208
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:30,070
most awful things were
done with suburban houses.

209
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:35,080
Also it also in the name of
a, of, of a kind of blind,

210
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:39,730
completely, completely tasteless
return to the neoclassical and,

211
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,370
and certain other aspects of tradition.

212
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:47,460
So the postmodern in what you might call
suburban culture has been pretty awful.

213
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:48,600
Uh,

214
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,420
but at the same time it has entailed
a great deal of interesting work in

215
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:55,310
painting. All of a sudden, you know,

216
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,030
the New York scene isn't just one
school and that's the sign of it.

217
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,580
It's not just a certain
kind of abstraction.

218
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,610
It's not just a wholesale,

219
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,660
a return agreed on by everyone to realism.

220
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,590
It's a mixture of everything.
Uh, so that, so that every,

221
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:17,591
it's not just the artists are always
just completely obsessed with their place

222
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:18,920
in art history.

223
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:24,070
It's not just a groups of artists together
wanting to identify a certain place

224
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:25,820
for themselves in art history.

225
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,470
It's every artist and a kind of a
narcotic independence from the thinking of

226
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:35,270
other artists, uh, coming to terms
with our history in his or her own way.

227
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,700
Uh,
so that the scene,

228
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:43,190
the art scenes of New York and Berlin and
Los Angeles and saw on the scene isn't

229
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:47,120
something that you can identify as
having a certain character anymore.

230
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,050
It's postmodern precisely
in that it's gone global.

231
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,200
It has a million influences and sources
and there's very little agreement among

232
00:15:56,841 --> 00:16:01,841
artists about how to amalgamate and put
these sources together so that in terms

233
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,100
of artistic expression,

234
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,720
the way in which the postmodern
moment after modernism,

235
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:12,910
in other words, the postmodern
moment presents itself and I,

236
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:15,740
and I put it deliberately
as a medical symptom,

237
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:19,850
the way that the way the
postmodern moment presents, uh, in,

238
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,740
in artistic expression.
Now, philosophically,

239
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,560
philosophically, postmodernism
can be understood about as doubt,

240
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,580
not just about the grounds of
knowledge or you know, the, the,

241
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,740
the widespread sorts of dot,
which,

242
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:40,460
which we've been talking about more
or less continuously in this course.

243
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,910
It can be understood as
doubt in particular about
the relationship between or

244
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:49,010
among parts and wholes.
In other words,

245
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:54,011
can I be sure that my leg is part of
my body when plainly it is at the same

246
00:16:57,471 --> 00:17:01,160
time, all whole with
respect to my foot. How,

247
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,270
how is it that I know,
uh, in any stable way?

248
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,590
What a part or a whole list to take
a more interesting example, uh, this,

249
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:14,330
this is in Vichtenstein
Phillip Philosophical
Investigations. There is the flag,

250
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:17,900
the French flag, which is
called the tri color. All right,

251
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,730
now the tri color is made up of
three strips of color, white, blue,

252
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:26,750
and red. I'm sorry if I've
gotten the order wrong. In fact,

253
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:31,580
I'm almost positive that I have, uh, um,
but there are those three strips of color,

254
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,340
uh, existing in relation
to each other. And plainly,

255
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,760
those three strips of color are
parts of the flag and they, and,

256
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,050
and they have a certain symbolic value.

257
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,930
That is to say each color
represents something, uh,

258
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,660
and editors and enters into the symbolic
understanding of what the flag is.

259
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,350
But at the same time, red, white,
and blue. Oh, sorry. Yes. Red,

260
00:17:55,351 --> 00:18:00,351
white and blue aren't confined
to this piece of cloth.

261
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,390
The little strips of white,
red and blue are obviously parts,

262
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,330
uh, of whiteness. They can't be,

263
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,360
they can't be understood as parts
simply in and of themselves or parts

264
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:17,730
specifically of one thing.
There are parts of other things as well,

265
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,950
but what's more,
you know,

266
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:24,960
if you look at the tri color without
knowing what you're looking at, uh,

267
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,520
how can you say that it's the part
of a whole, you say, well, you know,

268
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,850
they're just, they're
just parts, uh, they are,

269
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:35,100
or their holes unto themselves,

270
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:40,080
which somebody happens to have laid
a side by side. By the same token,

271
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,980
if you look at the part of the tri color,

272
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:48,240
which was white and you say white,
well,

273
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:53,241
obviously with respect to the
vast universalizing concept,

274
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:54,084
white,

275
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,740
a little flag is simply a kind of met
a Nimic relationship with that sense of

276
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,570
white,
but to,

277
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,370
but to concretize this idea of the
problematic relationship between part and

278
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:11,130
whole and a different way,
how can we be,

279
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,990
why are we so confident
about what we see as, as,

280
00:19:15,991 --> 00:19:16,980
as most of you know,

281
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:21,981
I'm sure philosophical thinking tends
to be tyrannized by metaphors of vision.

282
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,100
We assume that we understand reality
because I'm not altogether as consciously,

283
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:34,560
metaphorically speaking about
this as perhaps we might be. Um,

284
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,420
we say that we can see it,
but how do you see it?

285
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,450
You see it because of the Lenzing
or focusing capacities of the eye,

286
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,930
which exercise a certain tyranny
over the nature of what you see.

287
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:53,400
If you look too closely at something,
all you can see is dots.

288
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,420
If you close your, if you look at
something and close your eyes, uh,

289
00:19:57,421 --> 00:20:02,400
that too becomes a kind of vast
retinal mark Tobey painting.

290
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,990
And, and, and, you know, it has a
relation to what, to what to what you see,

291
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,170
but is at the same time
something very different.

292
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,230
So if you get too far away from objects,

293
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,320
they dissolve what you thought was an
object dissolves into a much vaster,

294
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,950
greater space,

295
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,760
which has seems to have
another objective nature.

296
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,830
The space that you, if you're in
a jet and you're looking down a,

297
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:33,210
what you're seeing certainly looks
like it has form and structure,

298
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,470
but the form and structure is not at all
what you're seeing if you're standing

299
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,910
on the ground. Uh, looking at
exactly the same, shall we say,

300
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,090
a square footage a insofar as you can,

301
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,830
you're simply seeing different things.

302
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:53,310
And if you recognize what might be
called the tyranny of focus in the way in

303
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:55,990
which we orient ourselves to the world,

304
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,200
you can see that this perpetual dissolve
and refocus constituting objects

305
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:07,330
perpetually in new ways. And this happens
to, you know, and the history of science.

306
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:07,870
Uh,

307
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:12,870
the relationship between
subatomic particles sometimes
turns itself inside out.

308
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,980
And the particle that you thought was the
fundamental unit, uh, turns out in fact,

309
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,670
to have, uh, to, to, to, to have, uh,

310
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:26,380
within it a fundamental unit
of which it is apart and there.

311
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,840
And I mean, all of this was, uh, I'm just,

312
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,410
I'm just referring to what happened
during the golden age of the linear

313
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:34,750
accelerator, when, when, uh,

314
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,310
when all sorts of remarkable sort
of inversions of what's taken to be

315
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:42,820
fundamental, um, seemed, uh, to be, uh,

316
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,110
made available by the experimental data.
So that in all of these ways,

317
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,040
uh, ranging from scientific to, uh,

318
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,160
to sim to the most subjectively visual
ways of understanding the world,

319
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,860
there are possibilities of doubt
that can be raised about part whole

320
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:07,180
relationship. What is a whole,
how do we define a unity?

321
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,360
Should we be preoccupied with the
nature of reality as a set of unity's

322
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,950
obviously delivers is
extremely upset about this,

323
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:22,350
but he doesn't want anything to do with
unity. Uh, he doesn't, he, he, he, he,

324
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,021
his whole,

325
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:28,021
the whole function of his thought
experiment is the decentering of things.

326
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,530
So that's that one can no longer talk
about units or holes or isolated entities.

327
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,830
It's the being together and
merging together and flying apart,

328
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,260
uh,
and reuniting and nieces,

329
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:49,290
movement of entities if they can even
be called entities that diverse is

330
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,360
concerned with.
Now,

331
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:57,361
another aspect of the postmodern
is what the postmodern philosopher,

332
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,940
uh,
uh,

333
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:04,010
John Francois [inaudible] in particular
has called the inhuman or the process of

334
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:08,920
the dehumanization of the human.
Now this isn't this,

335
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:12,820
this is a weird term to choose because
it's not an all addy humanistic.

336
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:16,690
It's really a new way of thinking
about the human dilemmas.

337
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,460
You'll notice talks not just
here in, in, in this episode,

338
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:24,370
by repeatedly throughout his work,
uh,

339
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:28,960
which is why he has a little to say
about it here. That's explanatory.

340
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,820
He talks about Oregon's without bodies
that might've brought you up short.

341
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,750
Uh,
but what it suggests is that we are,

342
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:42,290
as delivers would put it
machinic rather than organic. Uh,

343
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:47,370
if the problem with centered flaw is
that it thinks of everything as Arba real

344
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,600
as a tree.

345
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:56,650
That problem has to do with the fact
that a tree is understood in its symbolic

346
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,480
extensions to have Oregon's,

347
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,500
the roots are muscles and circulation.

348
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,290
The blossoms are genital in nature.

349
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:11,470
The crown or canopy of leaves is the
mind of the tree reaching up to the sky,

350
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,990
the mentality of the tree.
And by the same token,

351
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,440
if we think of our own
bodies as Arba Real,

352
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:25,040
we think of certain parts of
those bodies as cognitive,

353
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,050
other parts of those bodies, as
having agency, as doing things.

354
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,850
And if that's the case, then
we think of a centered, uh,

355
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,771
uh,
and,

356
00:24:35,771 --> 00:24:40,771
and ultimately genital or
genetic understanding of the
body as being productive.

357
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,660
Dullas wants to understand the body
as being interactive, as being,

358
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,260
uh, polymorphous perverse. So
among other things, he wants to,

359
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:56,261
he wants to understand it
as being everywhere and
nowhere and unsaturated body

360
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,470
among other bodies.
And in order for this to happen,

361
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:05,620
it's interface with other things has
to be without agency and also without,

362
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:11,510
uh, with, with, with,
without co cognitive, uh,

363
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,140
intention, uh, on the
model of I think therefore,

364
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:18,670
I am the world comes into
being because I think, uh,

365
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,340
without any of this in
play, in other words, we,

366
00:25:22,341 --> 00:25:27,341
the d the dehumanization of the postmodern
has to do not at all with denying the

367
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,190
importance of the human,

368
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:36,370
but with this radical way of rethinking
the human among other bodies and things.

369
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,230
Plainly,

370
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:44,230
this emphasis involves a kind
of dissolving into otherness,

371
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,110
a continuity between subject and object,
uh,

372
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,790
in which the difference ultimately
between what is inside me,

373
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,820
what is authentic or in
integral to my being me,

374
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:58,820
uh,

375
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,820
and what's outside me become completely
permeable and interchangeable.

376
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,020
The late 19th century,

377
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,510
a author and philosopher, aesthetic
philosopher, Walter pater,

378
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,990
in the conclusion to a famous book
of his called the Renaissance,

379
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,780
had a wonderful way of putting this.
He said,

380
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,220
we're too used to thinking that we're in
here and everything else is out there.

381
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:26,570
And that somehow or
another, our perspective on
everything out is a kind of,

382
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,430
of of,
uh,

383
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,460
saving isolation are enabling
our power of objectivity,

384
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,070
but then paid her says,
how can this be?

385
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,610
Because we're made up of the
same things that's out there.

386
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,190
We to our molecular and other words,

387
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,730
what does in us rusts
iron and ripens corn.

388
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,910
There is a continuousness between the
inside feeling we have about ourselves and

389
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:56,550
the x Doria,

390
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:01,610
the exteriority with we're with which
we are constantly coming in contact.

391
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,470
Uh,
so this is a,

392
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:07,900
I mean the Dolos and Guattari
of course have their own, um,

393
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,040
excited junk be away of
putting these things,

394
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:16,190
but it's not really a new idea that we
exaggerate the isolation of consciousness

395
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,820
from its surroundings.
There is a,

396
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:26,030
there is a permeability of inside and
outside that this kind of rise ohmic or d

397
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:32,980
centered thinking, uh,
is Matt to focus on?

398
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,443
No,

399
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,340
you could say that Wa
Dullas is interested in it.

400
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:44,750
If you go back to our coordinates
that we kept, you know, when we're,

401
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:46,500
when we're talking about the formulas,

402
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,150
so sewer through
structuralism deconstruction.

403
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,570
If you go back to those coordinates, you
can say that what does is interested in,

404
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,200
ah,

405
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,200
like so many others we've read is a
rendering virtual or possibly even

406
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,690
eliminating of the vertical axis.

407
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:07,691
In other words of that center
or head or crown of the tree,

408
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:13,510
which constitutes everything that
unfolds on the horizontal access,

409
00:28:13,941 --> 00:28:17,840
be it language, be it the unconscious,
structured like a language, be it,

410
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,750
whatever it might be. You
could say that, uh, the, that,

411
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:27,751
that the project of villas to as the
undoing or rendering virtual virtual of

412
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:33,740
this vertical access. Well,
in a way I think that's true,

413
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,770
but then what is the horizontal axis that,
that,

414
00:28:36,771 --> 00:28:40,280
that is where the relation of dilemmas to,

415
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,350
let's say deconstruction becomes a
little problematic and where are we can

416
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:48,020
actually see a difference.
I got to compare him in,

417
00:28:48,021 --> 00:28:49,840
there's one respect with luck call,

418
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:53,780
but I want to hasten to point
out as I will in a minute. Uh,

419
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,650
a divergence from Lacan as well.
You remember that?

420
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,990
And Lock Cause Agency of the letter
essay, he says, you know, he,

421
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
he doesn't just talk about the access
of combination as a series of concentric

422
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:11,000
circles, each one of which is made up
of little concentric circles. He's, uh,

423
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,680
he doesn't just talk about that.

424
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,060
He also talks about the way
in which the combinatory, uh,

425
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:22,090
powers of the imaginary in language or
desire and language take place is like a

426
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:28,180
musical staff,
uh,

427
00:29:28,181 --> 00:29:32,760
the w and so that the organization of
signs in their Kata guity with each other

428
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,570
can be either melodic or harmonic.
Uh, but in any case, the,

429
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:42,571
you can't just think of the axis of
combination as a complete linearity.

430
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,860
It has, it has a dimensionality
of different kinds,

431
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,930
well for,
for,

432
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,100
and that's why Deleuze and
Guattari introduced the
concept of Plateau toward the

433
00:29:55,631 --> 00:29:56,890
end of your excerpt.

434
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:01,280
The book in which your excerpt appears
is called a thousand plateaus. Uh,

435
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,040
and ultimately the concept of Plateau
is even more important to them than the

436
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:10,180
concept of rhizome. The what, when
they introduced the concept of Plateau,

437
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,310
they're doing exactly the same thing.

438
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,440
They're saying we jump from
sign cluster to sign cluster.

439
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:21,910
And not all zine clusters
are linear and uniform.

440
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:25,180
This is where there is perhaps a
difference from deconstruction.

441
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:30,660
Deleuze and Guattari are interested in
multiplicity of coding as they put it.

442
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:35,250
They're interested in the,
in the way in which, um,

443
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,690
when I think I'm not just thinking in
language, I'm not just thinking, uh,

444
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,470
pictorially. I'm not just
thinking musically, uh,

445
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:47,020
but I am leaping around
among codes so that, uh,

446
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:51,180
the actual thought process
is eclectic in this way. Um,

447
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:56,430
now you could say that this is something
actually anticipated also by Lacan.

448
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:02,670
You remember also in the agency essay
that Lacan reminds us a true inheritor of

449
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:05,890
Freud,
which he takes himself to be.

450
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,940
Lecar reminds us that at the beginning
of the interpretation of dreams,

451
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,630
Freud said that the decoding,

452
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:19,140
the dreamwork as like figuring
out the puzzle of a reverse,

453
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,900
a reverse being, one of those, uh, uh,

454
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:27,790
trick sentences which are made up not
exclusively of words but have the odd

455
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:31,450
syllable.
But then of pictures I heart New York,

456
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,380
I heart New York is a rebus,
uh,

457
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,340
and that and that the dream work functions
constantly in Freud's view as a river.

458
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:45,350
So you could say that luck on already
introduces a four Dullas the possibility

459
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:51,811
of thinking of a multiple coding that
needs to be decoding a on a variety of

460
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,200
decoded on a variety of plateaus
if it's going to make any sense.

461
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,670
Um,
now

462
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:07,430
d delays his relationship with all the
figures we've been reading is rather

463
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:10,340
problematic. Really. Um,

464
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:14,470
the book preceding a thousand
plateaus was called Auntie Oedipus.

465
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:19,450
And it is a continuous
systematic attack on, for,

466
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,920
on the eye. He always calls
Freud the general, uh, and the I,

467
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,620
the idea that, um, that, that,

468
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:31,650
that Freud feels that the whole of our
psychic lives is completely saturated

469
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:32,670
and,
and,

470
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:37,630
and dominated by the Oedipus
complex and does, you know,

471
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:41,190
with his idea of decent thinking
of rise of the rhizome ah,

472
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:45,200
so that's out to show in a
variety of ways how limiting, uh,

473
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:50,030
and how unfortunate for the legacy
of psychoanalysis, this kind of,

474
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:53,510
of, of, of, of focus
on a particular issue.

475
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,770
It turns out to be this is,
this is delivers his critique of Freud,

476
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,760
not mine. And it's, and, and
you would think that does,

477
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:06,080
then we'd be a lot closer to Lacan just
for the reasons that I've just described.

478
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,290
But you know what call too,
there's a,

479
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:14,150
at the very bottom of page, uh,
what page is it at the very bottom,

480
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,040
bottom of, um, uh, in
your text, uh, oh three,

481
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:23,780
four left on the right hand column,
very bottom of the page.

482
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,620
He says,

483
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:29,620
it is no accident that psycho psycho
analysis linked it's destiny with

484
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,360
linguistics. Now it's, it's impossible
to say, I think quite by design,

485
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:40,361
it's impossible to say whether Diller's
is referring to Freud or Lacan and

486
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:44,240
saying that because it's locked
car who claims that Freud said it.

487
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:44,871
In other words,

488
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:49,010
that the interpretation of dreams is
the text in which we discover that the

489
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:53,510
unconscious is structured like a
language. Um, but at the same time, uh,

490
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,530
uh,

491
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,680
posterity has taken a lot cause
focus on linguistics to be a massive,

492
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,750
perhaps inappropriate
revision of Freud, uh, and uh,

493
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:08,080
to be a very different matter. So, uh,

494
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:13,180
it's interesting that delivers quite
ambiguously scenes to suppose for us that

495
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,170
Freud and Lacan are part
and parcel of each other.

496
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:23,171
And the reason he can do that is that
he is interested in a form of thinking

497
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:29,230
about language, which no
linguistics has successfully, uh,

498
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:32,690
accommodated as far as he's concerned.
In other words,

499
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,940
he keeps talking about
Chomsky. Uh, you know, uh,

500
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:40,190
John's can seems to be in a way
the villain of your essay. Uh, but,

501
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,330
but I think in a way that's just the
way of evading talking about so serve

502
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:48,060
because you wouldn't want to get in
trouble with all those structuralists uh,

503
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,060
because so sort of to,
uh,

504
00:34:50,061 --> 00:34:55,061
the problem was so sir too is that
there is a certain tyranny or Arbor ask

505
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,510
tendency and so Syria and thinking,
uh,

506
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,620
to be focused on the binary,

507
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:05,650
that is the relationship between the
signified and signifier as fixed,

508
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:11,390
as inflexible as lacking in what
dairied I would call free play, uh,

509
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:15,710
and therefore to,
or kind of a kind of of tyranny.

510
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,520
So very quickly on the rhizome,

511
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,730
how do we know a rhizome when we see it?

512
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,650
I think probably in the long run,
whatever frustrations,

513
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,450
uh, uh, the don't delivers
his essay puts in your path.

514
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,390
I think probably in the long run you're,

515
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,990
you're pretty clear on what
a rhizome is, but if, but,

516
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:41,490
but if there's any lingering doubt,
just think about the flu. Um,

517
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,800
there, there is, uh,

518
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,010
what Dolores calls rhizomatic flu.

519
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,980
That's something we get from other people.

520
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,400
The circulation of disease as we all
come down with it around midterm period.

521
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,010
The circulation of disease is rhizomatic.

522
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,620
It's a perfect example of Ah,

523
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,280
to use another tool to use another
instance from, from dilemmas,

524
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,810
the relationship between the wasp
and the orchid, the wasp like the,

525
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,150
like the, the virus, um,

526
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,600
sort of flits about
from blossom to blossom,

527
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,320
descends and then constitutes the flu.

528
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:24,830
And by contrast there is
hereditary disease that is
that which is lurking in us,

529
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,450
uh, because we're programmed for
it. We're hardwired for, for it. Uh,

530
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,610
it is, it is genetically
in our nature and this, uh,

531
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:39,420
the Dilas associates with Arbarella,
with the arb arrest, it is,

532
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,300
uh, it comes from an origin. It is,

533
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:47,330
it is something that is a cause within
us or a cause standing behind us as

534
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,830
opposed to something coming
out of left field, uh,

535
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:57,890
in an arbitrary and unpredictable
fashion and descending on us brats.

536
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:00,720
Also not unlike 10 yon offs,

537
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:04,290
distinction between
modification and evolution.

538
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,690
The arborist evolves.

539
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:12,300
The rhizomatic is modification
that you know, the, the, the,

540
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,980
the give and take of
tensions among entities.

541
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,120
The rats tumbling over each other,
the maze of the borough,

542
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,720
they spreading of crab grass.
All of this,

543
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:28,590
all of this has a kind of randomness,

544
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,280
unpredictability of the power of linkage
at all conceivable points without any,

545
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:40,110
without any predictability.
Uh, all of this, uh,

546
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:45,290
is entailed in the rhizomatic
now as to what's being attacked.

547
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:49,560
And again, the value system surrounding
these things are not absolute.

548
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Dulles is not going so far
as to say arborist, bad.

549
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:58,500
Rhizomatic good. He's coming pretty close
to it, but he acknowledges the perils,

550
00:37:58,501 --> 00:38:01,980
as I say, of the rhizomatic.
But in the meantime,

551
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,630
just one point in passing because I'm
running out of time to talk about Jijak.

552
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,930
Just one point in passing
about the arborist.

553
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:13,800
They're actually in the first pages
of your essay. Two forms of it.

554
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:18,320
One is what he calls the
route book and other,

555
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:23,460
the traditional classical
book which presents to you
a theme I am going to write

556
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:29,360
about. So and so. And I'm going
to do so systematically, uh,

557
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,020
one thing at a time in a series of
chapters. That's the route book,

558
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,020
but then there's what he calls
the fascicle book, the, uh,

559
00:38:39,021 --> 00:38:43,330
a book which consists of
complicated offshoots of roots.

560
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,850
But nevertheless,
and tailing a tap root.

561
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:50,710
And this is what he associates with
modernism precisely in your text.

562
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,460
He says the fantastical book
is like Joyce's Ulysses.

563
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,280
Everything including the
kitchen sink is in it.

564
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,370
It looks as though it
were totally rhizomatic,

565
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,000
but it is of course controlled by unified,

566
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:08,320
by brought into coherence by a single,

567
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,190
uh,

568
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:14,190
focusing authorial consciousness
so that it is not truly rhizomatic.

569
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,020
It's a fast sickle book here.

570
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,780
Thousand Plateaus is going
to be a rhizomatic book.

571
00:39:20,781 --> 00:39:25,570
So you have not just two kinds of
books, uh, in this idea, but three,

572
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,680
all right then very quickly
about Jijak

573
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,650
I think it can help us
understand a [inaudible].

574
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,300
I hope you agree and having read it,

575
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:41,650
but I think in a way it also takes
us back or allows us to revisit,

576
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,420
uh, Peter Brooks. Uh, the, the, uh,

577
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:49,790
the best example it seems to
me of the way in which, uh,

578
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,840
the tension of desire in
narrative works for z Jack is,

579
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,480
is, although these are
splendid examples and I think,

580
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,850
and I think largely self explanatory.

581
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,970
I think the best example is
actually an another book by,

582
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:07,750
she's Jack called everything
you wanted to know about Lakai,

583
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,280
but were afraid to ask Hitchcock.
And, and, and, and in that book,

584
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,001
uh,

585
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:18,001
of course you get a lot of attention
paid to vertigo and just think about

586
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:23,080
Vertigo as an instance of the kind of
plot Jijak is talking about. You know,

587
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,640
there's that, I forgotten her name, but
there's, there's that really nice woman.

588
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,350
You remember the painter,
you know,

589
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:33,430
and Jimmy Stewart just pays
absolutely no attention to her.

590
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:38,140
She's right there. She's available.
She's in love with him. Oh, you know,

591
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,850
he doesn't even see her except
as a confidant. Uh, you know, oh,

592
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:46,920
yes, you, ah, I'm so glad
you're here. Uh, but, uh,

593
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,680
but he is on the other hand,
obsessed with,

594
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,980
with a woman who,

595
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,190
whose identity he can't even be sure of.
It's not,

596
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,880
it's not just that she's inaccessible
for some reason that she's,

597
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,030
that she's a distant object of desire.

598
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:09,180
Her identity and the question whether
or not she's being placated by somebody

599
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:14,590
else remains completely unclear,
unclear for many spectators,

600
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:18,130
even as they watched the ending
of the film, completely unclear.

601
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:21,100
And that is an obscure,
not just a distant,

602
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,620
but an obscure object of desire.

603
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:28,770
And of course the premise of her and
accessibility is what drives the plot.

604
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,590
Now I think that the interest that
it's interesting to think about the

605
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:38,591
relationship between the element of
detour and delay as eugenic implies it and

606
00:41:41,191 --> 00:41:43,250
understanding narrative,
uh,

607
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,730
the relationship between that and
what Peter Brooks is talking about.

608
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,740
Peter Brooks is, uh, is,

609
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:53,741
is talking about the way in which middles
in plots protract themselves through,

610
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,460
uh,
episodes,

611
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:00,580
all of which manifest some sort of
imbalance or need for a need for further a

612
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:07,010
repetition in a new key.
And much of this hat,

613
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:10,790
because the characteristic plot of the
kind of fiction books is mainly thinking

614
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:11,960
about as the marriage plot.

615
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,720
Much of this has to do with
inappropriate object choice, which, uh,

616
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,880
indeed can also in many cases,
Allah,

617
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,600
what I began by mentioning and Jujitsu,
uh,

618
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:26,240
political inappropriate political
object choice. Think, for example,

619
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:31,220
about the plot of James's Princess
Casamassima in that regard, uh, uh,

620
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:36,250
poor hyacinth Robinson strikes out on
both counts in rather completely parallel

621
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:40,970
ways. He, he's, he ends up on
the wrong side of politics.

622
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,890
He ends up on the wrong side of love.
Uh, and in a way the princess castle,

623
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:51,430
Princess Castle mass is an exploration
of these two sides of the issue.

624
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,850
But so in any case, uh, for Brooks,

625
00:42:56,590 --> 00:43:01,590
the resolution of the plot is a way
in which closure can be achieved.

626
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:05,980
That is the,

627
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,870
it is a final moment of
equilibrium as one might say,

628
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:16,050
or quiet or reduction of excitation such
that the Floridian death wish can be

629
00:43:19,901 --> 00:43:24,760
realized as we know, uh, in the way we
want it to be realized as opposed to,

630
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:29,520
uh, are being afflicted by
something from the outside. So,

631
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:33,550
so in Brooks,
who's closest ties are to structuralism,

632
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:37,780
there is a sense there isn't
achieved sense of closure,

633
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,920
which is an important aspect
of what's admirable in fiction.

634
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,640
Jijak is more postmodern,
Geez. Axes following Laca,

635
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,720
he sees the object of desire as um,
uh,

636
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:53,900
a sim tonic as being,
uh,

637
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,980
ultimately and always inaccessible.

638
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:01,360
Or if it becomes accessible,
uh, as for example,

639
00:44:01,361 --> 00:44:06,361
on page 1193 and the right hand column
or one might say almost accessible,

640
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:12,750
this gives rise to as many problems as
it seems to eliminate bottom right hand

641
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:18,220
column.
Page 1193 [inaudible] says,

642
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:21,070
perhaps in courtly love itself,

643
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:26,490
the long awaited moment of highest
fulfillment when the lady Renders Grenada

644
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:31,860
Mercy to her servant is
not the lady's surrender,

645
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:36,890
not her consent to the sexual act nor
some mysterious right of initiation,

646
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,730
but simply a sign of love
on the part of the lady,

647
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:44,760
the miracle that the object answered,

648
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,800
stretching its hand out to this
applicant. The object. In other words,

649
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:54,801
it has become subject in this moment of
exchange or a mutuality of recognition

650
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,450
or becoming human on the
part of the lady who,

651
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:06,500
uh, who of course Jijak Jack has been
associated with the dominate tricks, ah,

652
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,310
in a sadistic relationship.
Um,

653
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,220
in this moment of becoming human,
of offering love,

654
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,610
the object becomes more accessible.

655
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,620
That is to say there is now the
possibility of some form of neutrality,

656
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,600
but in becoming more accessible,

657
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:30,830
the energy of desire is
threatened with dissolution.

658
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:32,461
In other words,

659
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:37,461
closure in Jijak is a threat
to the energy of desire.

660
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:43,220
Desire is something which inheres in
our very language according to Zach and

661
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:50,010
which, uh, and, and, and which
were it to be understood as,

662
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:54,970
as, as, as, as brought to
closure. The Lady, you know, the,

663
00:45:54,971 --> 00:45:59,010
the, the, I mean, Jeez, that gives
lots of examples of the lady, you know,

664
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:03,720
after all this sort of seeming
and accessibility says,
sure, why not, you know,

665
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:07,650
of course, uh, and, and you
know, and the person is,

666
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,400
and the person is completely
upset and then refuses,

667
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:16,140
refuses the act because
there's nothing more to desire.

668
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,180
All of a sudden,
all of a sudden,

669
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:23,181
the whole structure of that energy
that drives language that drives

670
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,930
consciousness, comes tumbling to the
ground and desire has become need.

671
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,740
It's become sort of merely a matter of,
uh,

672
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,460
of gratification through
what's ready to hand, uh,

673
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,360
and no longer a question
of sustaining a dream.

674
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,930
And this and this.
Generally speaking,

675
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:48,080
is what Dziedzic wants to focus on in
talking about these plots that the object

676
00:46:49,051 --> 00:46:53,520
of desire must be not just
distance but also obscure.

677
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:56,340
I'm going to make two more points.
First of all,

678
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:01,610
as you can no doubt tell this is a
perfect replica of Hans Holbein owns the

679
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:05,100
ambassadors. Uh, I mean, I, I'd be,

680
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:09,120
I'd be amazed if anyone in
the room hadn't recognized it,

681
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,590
but there it is. There it
is. Um, there's two guys,

682
00:47:13,591 --> 00:47:15,000
there's a table between them.

683
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:20,210
They are negotiating probably over
one of Henry the eighth marriages.

684
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:25,950
And this I think is not insignificant.
They are there, you know,

685
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:31,130
in the service of Henry the eighth
negotiating one of those extremely

686
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:36,550
complicated marriage as possibly
even the one that led to the, uh,

687
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:39,370
the, uh, application, uh, uh,

688
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:44,290
of the Anglican Church from the Roman
Catholic Church. Who knows, who knows?

689
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:49,470
But the lore about the painting is that
it has to do with the negotiation of an

690
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:54,320
object of desire and that object
is absent. In other words,

691
00:47:54,321 --> 00:47:59,050
there's something really only implied
by the painting in the foreground of the

692
00:47:59,051 --> 00:48:03,220
painting, notorious to art
historians. There's this thing.

693
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:08,330
Now this is pretty much
what's in the painting. I go,

694
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:11,800
this is not a replica of
the two guys standing there,

695
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:15,880
but this is pretty much what you see
when you look at the foreground of the

696
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:19,300
painting.
If you look sort of from the side,

697
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:24,040
it turns into something very much
like a skull. And generally speaking,

698
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:28,270
there's a kind of consensus among
scholars that it may be a, uh,

699
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:33,360
a weirdly distorted shadow or
representation of its color.

700
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:37,100
What's a skull is doing in
the foreground of course, uh,

701
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:41,800
causes us to wonder as well. Obviously
you can have some ideas on the subject,

702
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,870
but it's still not exactly
realist painting we're
talking about if he sticks a

703
00:48:46,871 --> 00:48:48,370
skull and the forager,

704
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:52,630
well it also has a certain resemblance
to other things we could mention. Uh,

705
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:53,321
but the rate,

706
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:57,130
but the main point about it is that
we don't really know what it is.

707
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:00,070
It is. And other words, uh,

708
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,730
something we've already become familiar
with and thinking about luck call.

709
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:09,040
It is that signifier,
that ultimate signifier,

710
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:14,820
which is the obscure object of desire
called sometimes by Lacan the Phallus.

711
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,760
And it seems simply to be there
before us in this painting. Now,

712
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:26,910
both in the book in Hitch on Hitchcock
where he finds something like this in

713
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:32,371
just about every film Hitchcock ever
made and also in whole binds painting,

714
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:38,170
Dziedzic calls this the blot.
It's, it's, it's, you know,

715
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,750
we have nothing else to call it.
It's a blog.

716
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,950
What's it doing there in fiction
we would call it irrelevant detail.

717
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:47,750
We can think of.
We can find a way of,

718
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:52,180
of placing formally,
absolutely everything in fiction,

719
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:55,510
the weather, what the flowers on
the table, whatever it might be.

720
00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:00,160
We can place formally, but there
may be something in fee in fiction,

721
00:50:00,161 --> 00:50:04,090
which is simply unaccountable.
We cannot account for it.

722
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:08,590
And that's the block that's
the block for Gj. All right.

723
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,910
Now finally undesired and language.

724
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,040
There's a partner's EGX essay,

725
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:19,090
which you may have thought of as a
digression and he's suddenly talking about

726
00:50:19,091 --> 00:50:21,910
jail.
Austin's ordinary language philosophy.

727
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,170
He suddenly talking about the linguist,
uh,

728
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:28,610
do crows idea of
predication in both cases.

729
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:33,950
What's important about in,
in the one case,

730
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:37,760
the element of performance and any other,
in any utterance.

731
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:42,940
And in the other case they dominance
of an entire sentence by predication.

732
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:48,880
What's important in both of those elements
is that they take over and aspect of

733
00:50:49,461 --> 00:50:53,870
language of which they were only supposed
to be a part. In other words, in Austin,

734
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:57,830
there are both performatives and
constant it, but in the long run,

735
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,190
the argument of how to do things with
words suggest that there are only

736
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:03,890
performatives. I mean, I
thought this was a constant,

737
00:51:03,891 --> 00:51:06,110
if I thought this was just
straight forward language,

738
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,990
but I can now see an element
of performance in it. And
that's the way that's,

739
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:15,050
that there's a gradual changing of his
own mind in Austin's book, uh, which,

740
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:15,620
um,

741
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:19,910
to which judge executive sensitive by the
same token do crow talks about the way

742
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:24,911
in which the predicate element of a
subject predicate relation has a kind of

743
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:28,870
energy of agency that simply,
uh,

744
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,140
takes over the grammatical subject,
uh,

745
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:38,200
and constitutes a kind of performance in
the sentence performance in both cases,

746
00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:43,610
meaning desire.
When I promise to do something,

747
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:47,900
I also desire to fulfill the
promise when, uh, when I,

748
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:52,700
when I predicate something,
I'm also evoking a desire that,

749
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:57,350
that something be the case possibly
through my own instrumentality.

750
00:51:57,351 --> 00:51:58,310
This is the argument.

751
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:03,460
That's what Dziedzic means by desire and
language and by the in escape ability

752
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:09,160
of desire in language and the way in which
it permeates everything we can say to

753
00:52:09,351 --> 00:52:10,070
each other.

754
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:15,070
And most particularly the way in which
it permeates the plot or as they say in

755
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:21,191
film studies Daya Jesus of the kinds of
filmic examples that Dziedzic gives us.

756
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,110
Uh, I'd better stop there. Uh, I,

757
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:30,410
I hope that this somewhat
rapid fire survey of some
key ideas in these texts are

758
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:32,900
helpful. And I think in
the long run, perhaps,

759
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:37,901
I hope mainly that you see these two
energetic authors as exemplars of what we

760
00:52:39,831 --> 00:52:44,831
call postmodernism and see the relevance
of the concept of the postmodern to the

761
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,540
study of literary theory.
