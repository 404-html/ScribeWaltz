1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,610
Okay.
Uh,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,230
moving then as quickly as possible
into our subject matter for today.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,603
Uh,

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,090
we began a series of lectures on various
aspects of 20th century formalism,

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,510
a big word,
uh,

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,570
at the end of our run through the
varieties of 20th century formalism.

7
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:32,301
I hope it doesn't seem quite as
big and that it's many meanings,

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,653
uh,

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,400
but finite number of meanings
have been made clear to you. Uh,

10
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:43,080
in the meantime, uh, this
aspect of our subject, uh,

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,160
is that is to say what we're taking
up this week is as much really,

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,070
you remember in the first lecture I
said there's a difference between the

13
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:53,510
history of criticism and
theory of literature. Uh,

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,760
one difference being history of criticism
has a great deal to do with literary

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,840
evaluation.
That is to say,

16
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:05,841
why do we care about literature and how
can we find means of saying that it's

17
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:08,130
good or not good?
Um,

18
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,540
this is an aspect of thought concerning
literature that tends to fall out of

19
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:17,430
literary theory, but not out of the
materials that we're reading this week.

20
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,290
You can see that when whims sat and
Beardsley talk about the success of the

21
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,470
poem, they understand the
whole critical enterprise,

22
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:29,670
including its theoretical underpinnings.
The question, what is a poem?

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,950
The question,
how should we best read it?

24
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:37,190
That the whole enterprise is still
geared toward a literary evaluation.

25
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,230
And that's,

26
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,510
and that makes this subject matter that
we'll be discussing this week. As I say,

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,550
as much a part of the history of
criticism as it is of literary theory,

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,620
we're going to be reading it with
a theory spin. Uh, that is to say,

29
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:56,850
we're going to focus on the question,
what a poem is, and the question,

30
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,730
what criteria should we invoke
in order to read it, uh,

31
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,510
for the best and correctly.
Uh,

32
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,190
but there are other ways of approaching
this material. Uh, in any case,

33
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,200
a website Beardsley,
uh,

34
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:13,740
is act was actually a philosopher
who taught at temple university,

35
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:17,850
a good friend of his, a in the
book in which this, uh, the essay,

36
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:21,930
the intentional fallacy appeared
a book called the verbal icon, uh,

37
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,070
women's that collaborated with
Monro Beardsley on three essays. Uh,

38
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,690
and this is one of them.
Uh,

39
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:30,810
so we try to remember to say
William Sat and Beardsley,

40
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,100
even though it is what it is
when sat who taught at Yale,

41
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,030
that in itself needn't be significance,
except that the new critics,

42
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:41,670
the school of critics do,
which he belonged,

43
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,680
have always been identified with
Yale and indeed consolidate it.

44
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:50,730
A kind of teaching method and
attitude toward literature,

45
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,820
which constituted the first wave,
uh,

46
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,230
first of two waves of
involvement in literary theory,

47
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:58,960
uh,

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,430
which amount to the Yale English and
comparative Literature Department's claims

49
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:07,420
to fame. Uh, the new
critics, um, many of the,

50
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,410
many of those figures who belonged
to the new critics did much of their

51
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:15,940
important work before they arrived at
Yale. Uh, others never were at Yale.

52
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,440
And yet at the same time, it's a
movement closely associated with this,

53
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,680
with this institution.
When I arrived at Yale,

54
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,150
a website was still teaching clearance.
Brooks was still teaching. Uh,

55
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:32,220
and so I feel a kind of per
personal continuity, uh,

56
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,830
with these figures, uh, and understand as,

57
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,850
as we all will more fully
later on the way in which, uh,

58
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,090
the style and emphasis on style of close
reading that evolved within the new

59
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,630
criticism,
um,

60
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,540
meaningfully and importantly left its
mark on much subsequent criticism and

61
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,410
theory that hasn't,
uh,

62
00:03:56,411 --> 00:04:01,120
in fact always acknowledged the new
criticism perhaps to the extent that it

63
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,880
might have.
Um,

64
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,270
what I'll say because much of this should
be reserved for next time when I talk

65
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:07,741
about cleaning,

66
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:12,220
it's Brooks and returned to the whole
subject to the new criticism and the way

67
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:13,840
in which it's viewed historically.

68
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,170
So much of it can be reverted
for reserve for next time.

69
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:21,670
But what I do want to say now is this,
if it weren't for the new critics,

70
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,800
none of you probably would have been
able to sit patiently through any of your

71
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:29,020
middle or high school English classes.

72
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,790
When Clarence Brooks and Robert
Penn Warren published a book called

73
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,820
understanding poetry first published
1939 and then subsequently reissued again

74
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:42,790
and again and again as
it swept the country.

75
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,480
Suddenly school teachers had a way of
keeping kids in the classroom for 50

76
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:51,304
minutes,

77
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,580
close reading the idea that you could
take a text and do things with it,

78
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,480
that the, that the interpretation of a
taxed wasn't just a matter of saying,

79
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,140
Oh yes,
it's about this and isn't it beautiful?

80
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,170
Reciting the text, emoting over
it and theorizing about it. Uh,

81
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,740
and then looking around
for something else to say.

82
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,140
It was no longer a question of doing that.

83
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:19,141
It was a question of constructing
and elaborate formal edifice to which

84
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,860
everybody can, could contribute.
Students got excited about it.

85
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:28,150
They saw certain patterns or certain
ways of elaborating patterns that the

86
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:30,790
teachers were talking about.
And Lo and behold,

87
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:35,740
the 50 minutes was over and everybody
had had a pretty good time. Uh,

88
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,670
this, this had never happened
in an English class before.

89
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,060
Seriously, your English majors
because of the new criticism, I admit,

90
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:48,730
especially if you went to
private school, this, this, this,

91
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:53,380
this way of teaching did not perhaps quite
so much, uh, for a variety of reasons,

92
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,340
uh, permeate published public
school literature teaching. Uh,

93
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,490
but it was simply as a result
of understanding poetry. Uh,

94
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,650
the way to go. It took time. If
you had more than 50 minutes,

95
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,170
you could actually make ample use of it.

96
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,340
A Tsl at who is in many ways
associated with the new criticism.

97
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:17,720
Some of one of its intellectual forbears
nevertheless took a somewhat dim view

98
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:21,830
of it and called it lemon
squeezer criticism, you know, but,

99
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,260
but what this meant is,
you know, it takes time.

100
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:27,540
You gotta squeeze absolutely
everything out of it. Uh,

101
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,910
and so it was ideal from the
standpoint of teaching. And it was,

102
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:36,911
it seems to me also wonderfully
galvanizing intellectually
because p because it

103
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:39,410
really did make people think,

104
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:44,150
look how intricate what I thought
was simple turns out to be,

105
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,700
uh, the new criticism, uh,

106
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,940
incontestably and without rival created
an atmosphere in which it was okay to

107
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:57,020
notice that things were a little more
difficult than they'd been supposed to be.

108
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,030
And this in itself,
uh,

109
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,110
was extraordinarily
useful and constructive,

110
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,320
not just for scope, subsequent
literary theory, I think,

111
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:11,321
but for the way in which English teaching
actually can help people think better.

112
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,700
Uh, all of this, the new criticism
had a great deal to do with,

113
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,510
um,

114
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,830
and when I talk next time about the way
in which it's been vilified for the last

115
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:26,090
40 or 50 years, naturally
I will have this, uh, in,

116
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,920
in the back of my mind. So
in any case, in any case,

117
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,370
where did this preoccupation with form?

118
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,970
Because we're beginning to think about
the way in which theory can preoccupy but

119
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:42,590
not necessarily,
but can preoccupied itself with form.

120
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,240
Where does it come from? Well,
needless to say, I'm about to say,

121
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:49,310
it goes back to the beginning.
You know,

122
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:52,940
when Plato Writes His
Republic and devotes book 10,

123
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:56,340
as I'm sure most of you
know, to an argument, uh,

124
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,050
in effect banishing the poets
from the ideal republic.

125
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,200
Part of the argument is
that poets are terrible.

126
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:08,201
Annotators they imitate reality
as badly as they possibly can.

127
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,381
Uh,
not,

128
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:14,381
it's not there three times removed
from the ideal forms of objects.

129
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:19,260
In reality, there are hopeless
mass. They get everything wrong. Uh,

130
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:24,050
they think that a stick reflect refracted
in the water is therefore a crooked

131
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:24,530
stick.

132
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:29,530
They're subject to every conceivable
kind of illusion not to be trusted,

133
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,430
and Socrates calls them liars.
Okay. Now, when Aristotle,

134
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,380
when Aristotle writes his poetics, he
does so and, and this is true, and,

135
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:42,950
and, and, and rewards
and rewards scrutiny.

136
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:45,080
If one thinks carefully about the poetics,

137
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,230
he does so very consciously in refutation
of Plato's arguments in the republic

138
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,950
and one perhaps the
keystone of this reputation.

139
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,590
Refutation is simply this.
Plato says,

140
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:01,920
poets imitate be at badly.
Aristotle says,

141
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:05,820
this is a category mistake because
poets don't imitate reality.

142
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,040
Poets don't imitate,
says Aristotle things as they are.

143
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,500
They imitate things as they should be.
And other words,

144
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,190
the business of poets is to organize,

145
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:21,810
to bring form,

146
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:26,811
to bear on the messiness
of reality and in so doing,

147
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,800
to construct not exactly not an alternate
reality in the sense that it has

148
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:34,080
nothing to do with the real world.

149
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,770
That is to say it doesn't mention the
real world or at somehow or another

150
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:42,570
advance, you know, human beings made
out of chocolate or something like that,

151
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,840
but ideally rises the element's existing
in the real world such that it's object

152
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,790
is something other than reality as such.

153
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,130
And this is really the origin of
formalism. Aristotle is considered,

154
00:09:59,270 --> 00:09:59,820
uh,

155
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,820
the ancestor of the varying
sorts of thought about form.

156
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,490
And it's this move that's moved
that he makes in the poetics, uh,

157
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,760
that in genders,
this possibility.

158
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:17,130
Now turning to your sheet in the early,
early modern period,

159
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,240
the poet and courtier,
Sir Philip Sidney wrote an elegant,

160
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:25,260
really wonderfully written defense of
poetry and want addition called the

161
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:27,150
apology for Posey.

162
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,540
And in this edition he develops a while
actually a fervent admirer of Plato.

163
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:38,010
He nevertheless develops this
idea of Aristotle with, uh,

164
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,570
with a remarkable, uh,
rhetorical ingenuity.

165
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,111
Uh,

166
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:48,111
and I think very impressively lays out
the case that Aristotle first makes a

167
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,860
first passage on your sheet said,

168
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:56,610
and he's talking about the various
kinds of discourse, divinity, hymnody,

169
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,580
science, philosophy, history.

170
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,110
And I was all the ways in which you
can contribute to a human betterment,

171
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:08,640
human welfare. And he says all
but one of them. There is, is,

172
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:13,641
is a serving science that is to say it
is subservient to the natural world.

173
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,010
It's, its importance is that
it refers to that world.

174
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:22,590
The first sentence of your hand,
of your passage,

175
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:27,591
there is no art but one delivered to
mankind that hath not the works of nature

176
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,430
for his principle
object. This, by the way,

177
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,820
although it's not exactly a
work of nature, this by the way,

178
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,880
is why even that which is incontestably
better than secular poetry hymnity and

179
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,770
also divine knowledge theology.

180
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,370
That's why even these fields,
which are the supreme fields,

181
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,010
are also serving sciences.

182
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,610
They are subservient to an
idea that they have to express,

183
00:11:57,611 --> 00:12:02,020
which is the idea of God and God is real.
Nobody.

184
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,610
I mean we're, we're just
sort of, if there's,

185
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,230
there's no sense that we're making
God up in this kind of discourse.

186
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:13,010
Sydney's a devout, uh, uh, uh,
a devoutly religious person, uh,

187
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,980
and there is no scent.

188
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,920
There's no semblance of
doubt in his attitude. Uh,

189
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:23,921
and yet he is saying something very
special about the poet who is somewhere in

190
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:30,121
between divinity and the other sorts
of discourse with which poetry is

191
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:36,280
traditionally in rivalry,
science, philosophy and history.

192
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,130
And he says,
this is what's unique about poetry.

193
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,280
Only the poet disdaining to be
tied to any such subjection,

194
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,570
subjection,
in other words,

195
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:51,571
to things as they are to standing to be
tied to any such subjection lifted up

196
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:57,400
with the vigor of his own invention.
Duff grow any fact,

197
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,600
another nature,

198
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,750
he nothing affirms and
therefore never live.

199
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,950
In other words,
Plato is wrong.

200
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,100
The poet is not a liar because he's not
talking about anything that's verifiable

201
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,670
or falsifiable.

202
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,790
He is simply talking about the parameters
of the world he has brought into

203
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:23,740
being. Sydney thinks of it as a co,
as a kind of magic. Uh, he invokes,

204
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:28,390
for example, the science of the
pseudoscience of alchemy. The, the poet,

205
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:32,710
he says range is freely within
the Zodiac of his own wit.

206
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,450
He also invokes the pseudo science.
I'm sorry, I meant to say astrology.

207
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,050
Uh,

208
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:43,050
he also invokes the pseudoscience of
alchemy when he says that the poet in

209
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:48,801
habits of brazen world and have this
brazen brass of this brazen world,

210
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,650
he makes a golden world.
In other words,

211
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:58,570
poetry is transformational in
representing not things as they are,

212
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,950
but things as they should be.
It transforms reality.

213
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,061
All right,

214
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:09,061
so this is an argument which an outline
a once again justifies the idea of

215
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:15,541
literature as formed as that which
brings form to bear on the chaos and

216
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:22,000
messiness of the real.
Now I hit,

217
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,410
I don't mean to say things
just stood as Sydney said.

218
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:29,770
They were until you get to con,
a great deal happens.

219
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,260
But an aspect of cons,

220
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,350
famous Copernican revolution and the
history of philosophy is his ideas about

221
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,500
aesthetics and the beautiful and about
the special faculty that he believes,

222
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:44,890
uh,

223
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,890
has to do with and mediates our
aesthetic understanding of things.

224
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:55,170
A faculty which he calls the judgment
so that in the critique of judgment 1790

225
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,510
he outlines a philosophy of the
beautiful and have the means whereby the

226
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:07,820
judgment makes judgments of the beautiful.
He does a great deal else in it,

227
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,040
but I'm isolating this strand,

228
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,660
which is what's relevant to what
we're talking about in many ways.

229
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:19,700
Con Without knowing anything about Sydney,
nevertheless follows from Sydney,

230
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:23,980
particularly in this, as you'll see, I'm
going to look sort of with some carrot,

231
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,450
these passages so all will become clear,

232
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,740
but particularly in this Sydney and,

233
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,990
and I didn't exactly quote the
passage in which Sydney does this,

234
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:35,120
but I urged you to believe that he does.

235
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Sydney actually racks poetry somewhere
between divinity and the other sciences.

236
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:45,980
In other words, poetry is not the supreme
thing that that that a person can do.

237
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,480
Sydney believed this so much in fact
that when he knew himself to be dying,

238
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:53,060
having been mortally wounded in a battle,

239
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,840
he ordered that all of his own poems
be burned. I mean, he had, you know,

240
00:15:56,841 --> 00:15:58,730
from the standpoint of a devout person,

241
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:02,060
he had no doubt that poetry
was inferior to divinity.

242
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,780
Now in a way,
that's what [inaudible] saying too,

243
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,670
and the passages you'll read,

244
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:12,790
you'll see that it's that the point is
not that art and the judgment of the

245
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:19,070
beautiful is the supreme thing
that humanity can be engaged with.

246
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:24,490
The point is only that it has a special
characteristic that nothing else has.

247
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,440
That's the point that this whole
tradition is trying to make.

248
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,830
So this is the way can't puts
attorney first to the second passage.

249
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,560
The pleasant and the good.

250
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,490
Both have a reference to
the faculty of Desire,

251
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:46,180
the pleasant as the way in which our
Appleton see our sensuous faculty,

252
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,710
which comp calls. The understanding
by the way, understands things.

253
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,530
Things are either pleasant or unpleasant.

254
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:00,130
The good on the contrary is the way in
which our cognitive and moral faculty,

255
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:03,560
which comp calls the reason,
understands things.

256
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,670
Things are either to be approved
of or not to be approved of.

257
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,660
But in each case,
as con argues,

258
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,040
they have a reference to the
faculty of Desire. I want,

259
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,310
I don't want, I approve, I disapprove,

260
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,990
and they bring with them the former.
That is to say the pleasant,

261
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:29,470
a satisfaction pathologically
conditioned the ladder,

262
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,190
a pure, practical,
purposeful satisfaction,

263
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,140
which is determined not merely by
the representation of the object.

264
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:44,060
That is to say by the, by the fact that
the representative object exists for me.

265
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,810
Right? Not Merely by the
representation of the object,

266
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:53,010
but also by the represented connection
of the subject with the existence of the

267
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:57,180
object. In other words, by the way
in which I want it or don't want it,

268
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,200
approve of it or don't approve it,
my subjectivity, in other words,

269
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,250
determines my attitude toward it.
Whereas Khan,

270
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,280
what God is saying is that my attitude
of that which simply stands before us as

271
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,770
what is neither pleasant nor good
but is rather something else,

272
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,820
isn't,
doesn't exist for me.

273
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,630
It exists in and for itself.

274
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,680
The next passage taste is the faculty
of judging of an object or a method of

275
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:37,101
representing it by an entirely
disinterested satisfaction
or dissatisfaction.

276
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,150
In other words, yeah, I still
like it or don't like it,

277
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,780
but my liking has nothing to do
either with desire or with approval.

278
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,320
Moral political as the case may be.

279
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,620
I just like it or I just don't like
it according to principles that can be

280
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:02,970
understood as arising from the faculty
of Judgment and not from the Faculty of

281
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,650
the understanding which is a petitive
and the faculty of reason which is moral.

282
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,650
So with that said, ah, the PA
perhaps just to add to that,

283
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:15,590
the fourth passage,
uh,

284
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,030
beauty is the form of the
purposive nus of an object.

285
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,330
So far as it is perceived in it without
any representation of a purpose.

286
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,890
Whoa. You'll say, well let's

287
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,660
hunt makes a distinction between
the purposive and the purpose full.

288
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:42,000
What is the distinction? The purpose
full as the purpose of the object.

289
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,210
In practical terms,
what can it do?

290
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,440
What can it do for me?
How does it go to work and the world?

291
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,640
What is its function among other objects?

292
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,380
What bearing does it have
on in particular my life.

293
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,490
But the purposiveness of the object is
the way in which it is sufficient unto

294
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:10,590
itself.
It has its own purpose,

295
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:15,591
which is not a purpose that has any
bearing necessarily on anything else.

296
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:20,040
It has in other words
and internal coherence.

297
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:25,190
It has a dynamism of parts
that is strictly with
reference to its own existence.

298
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,790
It is a form,
it is a form and that form,

299
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:37,740
because we can see it has structure
because we can see it has organization and

300
00:20:37,741 --> 00:20:40,860
complexity is purposive.

301
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,990
That is to say it has it,

302
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:46,980
it manifests its self sufficiency.

303
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,020
So that's cons. Famous distinction
between the purpose of which is the,

304
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,490
uh, organization of an aesthetic
object and the purpose full,

305
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:02,270
which is the organization of
any object insofar as it's, it,

306
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,460
it goes to work in the world or for us.

307
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,860
And aesthetic object can be purposeful.
That is to say,

308
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:16,420
we can view it as purposeful.
Uh, I see a naked body, uh,

309
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,950
which the art historians call a nude.
Uh,

310
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:24,010
I don't accept that it's merely a
nude I wanted or I disapprove of it.

311
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,950
Um, and Lo and behold,
it's no longer aesthetic.

312
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,020
I'll come back to that in a moment,

313
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:34,140
but I hope you can see that that is a
distinction between the purpose of and the

314
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,580
purposeful. Now, um,

315
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,650
just in order to reprise these
important distinctions, uh,

316
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,250
uh,

317
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,200
I want to turn to a passage from in
Samuel Coleridge who is at least on this

318
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:50,350
occasion a disciple of Khan and his,

319
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,500
I think usefully paraphrasing
the arguments of con that
we've just been engaged

320
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:58,750
in fifth passage on your sheet.

321
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,500
The beautiful says Coleridge is that wants
distinguished both from the agreeable

322
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:10,170
which has beneath it and notice the
sort of stationing of the beautiful as

323
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:12,160
Sydney stations.
It between let's,

324
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:16,090
let's beneath it and what's
above it from the agreeable,

325
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:18,100
which has beneath it and from the good,

326
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:23,101
which is above it for both
these necessarily have an
interest attached to them

327
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:29,550
both act on the will and excite a desire
for the actual existence of the image

328
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:36,580
or idea contemplated while
the sense of beauty rest,

329
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:40,480
gratified in the mirror,
contemplation or intuition.

330
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:45,660
Regardless whether it be a
fictitious Apollo or a real,

331
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,340
and Tim says,
in other words,

332
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,400
they judgment of beauty does not depend
on the existence of the object for its

333
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,070
satisfaction.
Now,

334
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:05,910
Oscar Wilde ever the wag and a person
who put more good literary theory in ways

335
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:09,490
that didn't seem like
literary theory at all. Uh,

336
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,440
perhaps in the entire history of thinking
about the subject says in the famous

337
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:16,720
series of Aphorisms, aphorisms, which,

338
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:21,130
which constitute his preface
to the picture of Dorian Gray.

339
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,220
He concludes this series of Aphorisms
by winking at us and saying all art is

340
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:28,570
quite useless.

341
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:34,530
I hope that after reading these passages
and enduring the explication of them

342
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:36,100
that you've just heard,

343
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:41,460
you can immediately see what wild means
by saying all art is quite useless.

344
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,680
He's appropriating a term of opprobrium,
you know,

345
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:52,730
and the utilitarian tradition.
Oh my goodness, that's
something would be useless,

346
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,420
right?

347
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:58,420
He's appropriating a term of a
program and pointing out that it is an

348
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:03,350
extraordinarily unique thing about art,

349
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,760
that it's useless.

350
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:09,810
And other words that it appeals to know
merely a pedal [inaudible] or other form

351
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:13,580
of subjective interest.

352
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,830
We don't have to have an interest in
it and the sense of owning part of a

353
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:19,664
company,

354
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,730
we don't have to have an interest
in it in order to appreciate it.

355
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,660
In other words,
we can be objective about it.

356
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,480
We can distance ourselves from our,

357
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:37,510
from our subjective wants and needs and
likes and dislikes and we can coexist

358
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:44,651
with it and I happy and constructive way
that is good for both of us because if

359
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:54,551
we recognize that there are things in
the world which have intrinsic value and

360
00:24:57,261 --> 00:25:02,261
importance and what we call beauty and
yet are not the things that we covered or

361
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,240
wish to banish,

362
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:11,230
we recognize in ourselves the capacity
for it disinterestedness we recognize in

363
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:18,851
ourselves a virtue which is considered
to be the cornerstone of many systems of

364
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:25,061
moral understanding to realize that
we're not interested in everything and

365
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:30,851
merely for that reason take a view of
things but that there are things that we

366
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:37,271
don't have to have that kind of interest
in and can nevertheless recognize as

367
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,400
self sufficient and valuable is important.

368
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,190
The suggestion is wild suggestion,

369
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:51,191
but I think also constantly Justin before
him is important for our recognition

370
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:53,090
of our own value.

371
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,080
And by the same token all this
harping on the autonomy of art.

372
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,650
That is to say the self
sufficiency of the art,

373
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,040
the way in which it's not
dependent on anything.

374
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:12,190
As soon as Sydney says the way in which
it's not a serving science existing

375
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:18,130
merely to represent things
other than itself. All right.

376
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:23,770
The way in which this is possible for
art is also as our own capacity to be

377
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:30,551
disinterested is a way of
acknowledging that freedom exists,

378
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,220
that I am free,
that things are free,

379
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,690
things are free from my
instrumental interest in them.

380
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,910
So that in general,

381
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,480
what's implicit in this view of art and
this view of human judgment and what

382
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:55,860
makes it so important and the history
of thought is that once again,

383
00:26:55,861 --> 00:27:00,030
and this is not the first time we've
brought this up and in these lectures and

384
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:02,670
won't be the last,
is that once again,

385
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:08,300
it's a way of recognizing that in addition
to all the other things that we are,

386
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,810
some of them wonderful.
In addition to all of that,

387
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,580
we are also free.

388
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,390
There is in us at least an element that
is free in dependent serving nothing

389
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,990
autonomous.

390
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,980
And this idea of our freedom and by
implication of the freedom of other things

391
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:43,370
from our instrumental entrusts is what
sustains the formalist tradition and

392
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:51,651
against various kinds of criticism
and objection that will be taking up,

393
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,100
uh,
in turn as the case arises,

394
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,300
sustains and keeps bringing back into
the history of thought on these subjects.

395
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,080
The notion that form simply
for its own sake as this,

396
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:13,880
as,

397
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,880
as the notorious aesthetist movement at
the end of the 19th century put it is

398
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,110
valuable. All right. Now,

399
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,330
John Crowe ransom,
who was never at Yale,

400
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,130
but nevertheless, uh, um,

401
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:35,300
one of the founders or first members of
a self identified school of figures who

402
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:39,120
called themselves the new critics,
um,

403
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,360
published a book called the new criticism.
And that's where,

404
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,830
and that's where the term
the new critics comes from.

405
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:51,060
You may have noticed in your whims
that essay that there's a footnote to

406
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:55,860
somebody named Joel Spingarn who wrote
an essay called the new criticism in 1924

407
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,040
not to worry, that has nothing
to do with the new criticism.

408
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:03,870
That just means criticism, which is
race and different matter altogether.

409
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,320
By the same token, uh,
there is a, there the,

410
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:12,030
the work of Roland backed at his,
some of his contemporaries,

411
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,080
Palais whom I mentioned, John
Stocker Verbinski and others, ah,

412
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,640
was called in the French Press, La
Nouvelle Critique. And that too,

413
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:23,160
you know, then is, uh, a,

414
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,670
an instance of the new
criticism being used as a term.

415
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,480
But that too has nothing to do with
our subject. Uh, the new critics,

416
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,920
the American new critics, as they
are sometimes identified. Uh,

417
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,840
we're a school and I,

418
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:40,440
and I use that advisedly because
they're self identified as a group.

419
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:45,620
We're a school of people who evolved
this idea of the independent status,

420
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,140
uh, um, ransom calls it, uh,

421
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,670
a discreet ontological object,

422
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,000
the independent status of the work of art,
uh,

423
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:03,060
and the means whereby it can be
appreciated as independent in all of its,

424
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,800
of all of, in all of its
complexity. Uh, and the first foray,

425
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,980
our first foray into the thinking of
this school will be our rating of whimsy

426
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:19,780
and beards leaves, uh, the intentional
fallacy, which I'll get to in a minute,

427
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:24,700
but simply as a reprise, uh, take a
look at the two passages from ransom,

428
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:28,900
which complete what's on your
sheet, uh, and which, um, uh,

429
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:30,370
I think you can see,

430
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,720
create a link between the sort of
thinking you've encountered in reading.

431
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:39,550
The intentional fallacy and the tradition
that I've been trying to describe

432
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:45,390
passage seven ought to be
completely transparent to
you now because it is simply

433
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:50,791
a paraphrase of the passages I've
given you from con and Coleridge.

434
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,020
The experience says ransom,

435
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:58,021
the experience called beauty is beyond
the powerful ethical will precisely as it

436
00:30:59,411 --> 00:31:01,390
is beyond the animal passion.

437
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:06,870
And indeed these last two are
competitive and coordinate.

438
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,511
In other words,

439
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:12,511
what they have in common with each other
ethical will and animal passion is that

440
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:17,230
they're both grounded in interest. Right?
That's, I mean, that's the point of,

441
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,220
you know, sir, kind of Clarks
were the nude, you know, I mean,

442
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,250
we have for the naked human being as
viewed both by the appetites and by moral

443
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:35,590
reason as a common term
from the standpoint,

444
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,060
both of what con calls the understanding
and from what Kant calls the reason the,

445
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:44,320
the, the expression naked body
is just fine. But if we've got,

446
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,350
but if we do believe
there's another category,

447
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:53,140
the aesthetic viewed by an independent
faculty called the judgment,

448
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:57,040
we need another word when we're
looking. I mean, you know, I mean,

449
00:31:57,041 --> 00:32:01,030
modern painters like Philip Pearlstein
and Lucien Freud would strongly disagree,

450
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:05,650
but in a way, that's the point. When we're
looking at a painting of a naked body,

451
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,700
we not say, oh, that's a naked body.
We say that's a nude. And that,

452
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:14,620
and that distinction, that
distinction is what, uh, as it were,

453
00:32:14,621 --> 00:32:17,740
bears out the implicit way,

454
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:22,770
the semi conscious way in which all of
us acknowledged there to be a category

455
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,190
that we call the aesthetic judgment.
On the other hand,

456
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,870
a lot of people think it's, it's
all hokum. Uh, and in fact, in fact,

457
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,460
the predominant view in the 20th century
has been that there's no such thing as

458
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,760
disinterestedness, uh,
that we're looking at. Uh,

459
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:45,290
we formed, we have an interest
in, uh, and form views of,

460
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:49,790
and that, um, and that
this content moment of, of,

461
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,710
of dispassionate or disinterested
contemplation is what, uh,

462
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,990
the early 20th century critic I a
Richards called a phantom aesthetic state.

463
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,810
Uh, and so the predominant view is
of this kind, but you know, I mean,

464
00:33:03,811 --> 00:33:05,690
just to do it justice in passing,

465
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:10,460
there is a certain sense is they're
not in which we suddenly find ourselves

466
00:33:10,461 --> 00:33:15,140
without meaning to. And
without being simply victims
of sort of cultural tyranny,

467
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:19,430
we suddenly find ourselves standing in
front of something clasping our hands

468
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:24,431
tilting our head and feeling somehow or
another different from the way we feel

469
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,120
when we typically look at
things. And that too, you know,

470
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:33,440
is an intuitive way of saying
yes, something like this. However,

471
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,380
rigorously we can define it or defend it.

472
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,650
Something like this does seem to go on
in our minds at certain kinds of moments

473
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:43,610
of experience.
You know,

474
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:48,770
we just feel differently looking
at a certain work of art.

475
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,480
Then we feel, uh, or a
certain landscape, let's say.

476
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:58,580
Then we feel looking at other sorts
of things. Maybe we don't know why.

477
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:02,960
Maybe we doubt that the differences is
absolute in the way that caught wants to

478
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:04,970
insist it is.
But nevertheless,

479
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:09,830
we have intendancy feelings of this kind
and we should acknowledge them because

480
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:14,620
again, uh, at least in terms of
it's of, of, of a, of a, of a,

481
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:18,910
a weak understanding of these positions,
it,

482
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,920
it does tend to justify them,
at least,

483
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,930
at least it explains to us why people
can't have had such thoughts. Okay.

484
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:27,783
When set

485
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:35,650
website right off, I keep saying women
side, again, its whims that and leave,

486
00:34:35,651 --> 00:34:38,320
but I already explained,
you know how that is, um,

487
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,560
whims that right off the bat attacks what
he calls the romantic understanding of

488
00:34:44,771 --> 00:34:47,770
literature.
Now what does he mean by romantic?

489
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:53,130
It's the attitude which supposes
that a poem and that's whims.

490
00:34:53,131 --> 00:34:54,880
That's privileged privileged word,

491
00:34:54,881 --> 00:34:59,881
which I'll try to explain that a poem
is an expression that is to say is the

492
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:07,711
expression of some passion or profound
genius working its way into a form,

493
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,780
but that the important thing
is the expression this much,

494
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:19,361
by the way,

495
00:35:19,361 --> 00:35:22,510
when's that hasn't common with God I'm
or because you know God I'm or doesn't

496
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:27,070
talk much about authors either.
And Garber is interested in what he calls,

497
00:35:27,071 --> 00:35:30,430
meaning the subject matter dissolve,
right?

498
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,760
He's not interested in in your sort
of expression of that meaning or my

499
00:35:35,981 --> 00:35:37,510
expression of that. Meaning he's, he's,

500
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:42,180
he's interested in the way in which a
reader can come to terms with a meaning.

501
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,970
And that much as I say,

502
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:48,500
despite the profoundly different
nature of their projects, uh,

503
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:53,570
winds that and got him or have in common
so upon is not an expression but an

504
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:59,010
independent object with
a self contained meaning.

505
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,200
And if this meaning is not self
evident to the attentive reader,

506
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,730
then we don't judge the poem a success.

507
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,070
This is where evaluation comes in.

508
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,370
The success or failure of a DePaul of,

509
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:18,660
of a poem depends on the
realization of meaning.

510
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,440
It doesn't depend on are
going to the archive.

511
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,890
Finding out what the author
said in his letters about it,

512
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,700
finding out what he told his friends,
what he told the newspapers.

513
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,770
It doesn't involve any of that.

514
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,010
If the meaning is not clear in the poem,

515
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,720
we judge the poem a failure.
We don't refer.

516
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,390
We have no reason to refer.

517
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:46,590
If we respect the autonomy
of the poem as such,

518
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,000
we don't refer,

519
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:52,260
we don't appeal to an authorial intention.

520
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,070
Hence on page eight 11 lefthand column.

521
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,900
But third of the way down the design
or intention of the author is neither

522
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:08,391
available nor desirable as a standard
for judging the success of a work of

523
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,970
literary art.
So that and and,

524
00:37:13,971 --> 00:37:18,270
and it follows from this that um,
even a short poem,

525
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:23,310
even a short lyric poem and here you
could see whims that following food co.

526
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:26,790
I mean he's obviously not following
anticipating Fuko and again they have

527
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:30,000
nothing to do with each other,
but there is this overlap.

528
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,650
Even a short poem doesn't
really have an author.

529
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,200
It has a speaker,

530
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:43,580
a figure speaking in the poem that
needs to be understood dramatically.

531
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,950
That is to say as though the poem,

532
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:51,951
we're one of Browning's or ts
Elliot's dramatic monologues.

533
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,010
In other words,

534
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:58,010
so so that the speaker of any poem on
websites of you is this beaker and doubt

535
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,000
with a certain character,
a certain viewpoint,

536
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:08,180
a certain argument to be put forward
and that in order and that our concern

537
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:14,331
about the speaker has to be a concern
within the poem of the way in which this

538
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:17,730
character is elaborated and not,
uh,

539
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:22,850
reinforced somehow by biographical
reference to that which is not the speaker

540
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,300
but the author standing back
there somewhere behind the poem.

541
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:34,140
Now,
why focus on the poem?

542
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,310
Notice we never hear about literature.
We never had,

543
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,120
we never even hear about poetry.

544
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:46,020
The object of attention for an
analysis of this kind is the poem.

545
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,160
While the poem is as John
as John Dunn puts it,

546
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,780
a little world made cunningly.
It's a microcosm.

547
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:59,350
It is a distillation or quintessence.

548
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,260
It is a model,
in other words,

549
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:07,180
for the way in which literature
can be understood as world making.

550
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,380
Not a representation again
of things as they are,

551
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,810
but of things as they should be.

552
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,900
Whereas things whereas they should be is
not whereby things as they should be is

553
00:39:19,121 --> 00:39:23,410
not necessarily an ideal,
but rather that which is formal,

554
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,440
that which is organized that which
has a coherence and make sense self

555
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:31,630
sufficiently and within its self.

556
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,330
That's why poem the poem,

557
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:39,420
the lyric poem is privileged among the
forms of literary discourse in the new

558
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:44,860
criticism.
All literature is by implication a poem,

559
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,760
but the poem is the privileged site of
analysis whereby this broader statement

560
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:58,300
can be made to seem reasonable.
Hence the emphasis on,

561
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,440
on the poem, um, the,

562
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:04,340
the absence of the romantic word poetry,
uh,

563
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,700
is therefore not in significant poetry,

564
00:40:06,701 --> 00:40:08,980
is that which just sort
of spills out of me.

565
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,090
It's by spontaneous overflow
of powerful feelings.

566
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,730
Nevermind that,
uh,

567
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:19,390
the new criticism and isn't interested
in spontaneous overflows of powerful

568
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:23,200
feelings. Whims sat has his little
joke about drinking a pint of beer,

569
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:25,150
taking a walk, you know, I mean,

570
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,380
that's sort of the new criticism just
isn't interested in those sorts of

571
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:33,910
spontaneous overflow. Uh,
sorry, I, I won't go there.

572
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,880
Um, but in any case, uh,

573
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,640
he goes, he goes on, he
goes on to say, all right,

574
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:46,900
if we're focused on the work of
art in and of itself, on the poem,

575
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:51,370
we obviously in thinking
about what it means,

576
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:55,810
need to come to terms with
three kinds of evidence.

577
00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:00,460
That is to say some things have a bearing
on what it means and some things don't.

578
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,730
What does have a bearing is language.

579
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:06,490
That is to say words in the public domain,

580
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:11,610
which all of us share and which we can
study in order to come to terms with the

581
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:18,970
exact meaning of the poem. A
certain word. And this is of course,

582
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:21,610
what kept you in your high
school classes for so long.

583
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,640
A certain word has five or
six different meanings. Uh,

584
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,780
the new criticism delights in showing
how all five or six of those meetings do

585
00:41:28,781 --> 00:41:33,290
have some bearing on the meaning of
the Po. That's all legitimate evidence.

586
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:38,291
That is what one uses to build up the
structure of the interpretation of the

587
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:43,490
pond. What is not relevant is
what I've mentioned already. Uh,

588
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:47,750
what the author said about
the palm, uh, in letters, uh,

589
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:52,490
two friends, two newspapers and
so on, uh, that has no relevance.

590
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:56,840
Then when's that acknowledges that
there's a sort of Massey third category of

591
00:41:56,841 --> 00:42:01,841
evidence which has to do with language
and is therefore a legitimate to a point,

592
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:05,240
but also has to do with the
author's idiosyncrasies.

593
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:09,050
That is to say the way that
author in particular use language,

594
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,300
certain codery words,
uh,

595
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:16,250
a simply a private misunderstanding
of certain words. Uh, uh,

596
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,720
you know, you got to know when you're
reading Whitman what he means by Comarado.

597
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,700
You know, it's not exactly what the
rest of us typically mean. Uh, when we,

598
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:30,560
when we went, well, we don't use that
word exactly, but, but it's what we,

599
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:34,910
what we typically mean when we speak
of comrades or a comradeship. Uh,

600
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,230
there is an,
in other words,

601
00:42:36,231 --> 00:42:40,550
the word is loaded in ways that women
that would probably acknowledge need to be

602
00:42:40,551 --> 00:42:44,840
taken into account if we're going
to understand what Whitman is up to.

603
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,160
Now this is very tricky.

604
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:51,310
And he spends the rest of his essay
talking about the murky boundaries between

605
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,950
evidence type of evidence to which
is out of play and type of evidence.

606
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:58,460
Three,

607
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:03,460
which may be in play but has to be dealt
with in a gingerly and careful way.

608
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:09,590
Um, and, but I'm more interested
actually in a footnote,

609
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:14,890
which arises from this argument about
the idiosyncratic nature of language as a

610
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:23,330
particular author may use it
because the footnote says,

611
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,260
you know what,

612
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:29,090
that's just one consideration we bring
to bear on the function of language and a

613
00:43:29,091 --> 00:43:32,120
poem.
This is this footnote number 11,

614
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:37,121
bottom of page 18 for eight 14 over to
eight 15 is just about as devastating and

615
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:43,001
counterintuitive a pronouncement as is
made anywhere in our entire syllabus.

616
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:48,950
I mean, you know, the, the new critics,
what you would think you would find, uh,

617
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,400
the most,
the most earth shattering pronouncement,

618
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:56,390
that one that anybody could ever
possibly make in the new critics. Well,

619
00:43:56,391 --> 00:44:01,280
look at this footnote and the history
of words after a poem is written,

620
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:05,870
may contribute meanings,
which if relevant to the original pattern,

621
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:10,610
should not be ruled out by a scruple
about intention that is bold.

622
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:15,380
The great creator raised his plastic arm,
all right,

623
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:20,270
everybody knows Aiken signed,
didn't mean Paula didn't mean polymers,

624
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,870
but now we're all into cyber borgs
and we're, you know, we, we, we,

625
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,960
we take all of this very seriously and it,
and it,

626
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:32,250
in a way it's a tribute to the great
creator and also an of the fact that the

627
00:44:32,251 --> 00:44:36,900
great creator lives in the terminal
moment. He's not subject to history.

628
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:41,460
I mean the great creator new in the 18th
century that someday plastic would mean

629
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:45,450
polymer, right? And, and, and
obviously that's, that's one of the,

630
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,970
one of the divine attributes.
Therefore,

631
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:51,900
if the great creator chooses
to raise his prosthetic limb,

632
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:57,020
that is simply a way of understanding
what it is like to be everything

633
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:02,400
omnipotent and omniscient in the
eternal moment. In other words,

634
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,120
if you take wind sites,
11th footnotes, seriously,

635
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,460
that is a perfectly legitimate way.

636
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,690
Not too ironically
undermine Aiken sides line.

637
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:17,460
But actually to reinforce it and to
give it a kind of formal richness,

638
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,640
which it does not otherwise have.
Uh,

639
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,620
I realized that I'm out of time.

640
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:28,260
So I'll begin the next lecture by talking
about a bomb of Yeats called Lapis

641
00:45:28,411 --> 00:45:31,470
lazily written in 1935.
Uh,

642
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,520
and which he talks about the way in which
people who build up things that have

643
00:45:36,991 --> 00:45:41,280
been destroyed are always gay.
And of course,

644
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,320
and of course, nature doesn't
mean we say invoking intention.

645
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:50,320
Nature doesn't mean that
they're always gay. Uh,

646
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:55,370
he is using the English translation
of the German word ferulic from,

647
00:45:55,770 --> 00:46:00,240
from a niche as the gay
science. Uh, he is, uh,

648
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:02,190
a,
an astute and,

649
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:06,960
and careful reader of Nita and in some
ways elaborating on what nature says in

650
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:11,610
that book, in his poem, Lapis Lazily.
But beginning of the next lecture,

651
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:16,230
we will do the same thing with the word
gay that we've just done with the word

652
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:20,740
plastic. And then we will go ahead,
uh, and we will consider the SIF,

653
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,250
Clarence Brooks and other
aspects of the new criticism.
