1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,730
All right now I thought I'd begin today.
This is by the way,

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,280
a regular practice.
Um,

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,930
this is as close as I get to
bulleted PowerPoint. It's all there.

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,610
I ought to have got through those
topics by the end of the lecture.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,290
If I don't,
not to worry,

6
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:24,291
I'll pick up wherever the dotted line
emerges a in the subsequent lecture.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,801
But in any case,

8
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:30,801
I thought I'd begin today by making a few
remarks about the title of our course,

9
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,380
uh, because it has some big words
in it, theory and literature,

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,790
but also introduction.

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:43,410
I think it's worth saying a word or two
about the word introduction as well.

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,070
Uh,

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,070
now theory has a very complicated Adam
illogical history that I won't trouble

14
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,670
you with.
Uh,

15
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:54,480
the trouble with the atomology of theory
and the way in which the word has been

16
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:59,280
used traditionally is that sometimes
it actually means practice. And then,

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:00:59,760
uh,

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,710
at other historical periods it means
something very different from practice.

19
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,390
Something typically from which
practice is derived. Well,

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,730
that's the sense of theory that
I, I like to work with. Um,

21
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,650
and I would pause over it
by saying that after all,

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,190
there is a difference and we should
and we shouldn't too quickly at least

23
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:24,570
confused the terms. There's a difference
between theory and methodology.

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,320
Yes,

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,320
it's probably fair enough to say
that methodology is applied theory.

26
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:31,920
Um,

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,920
but there's a great danger and supposing
that every aspect of theory has an

28
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:42,171
immediate application theory is very
often a purely speculative undertaking.

29
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,551
Uh,

30
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:49,551
it's an hypothesis about something
the exact nature of which one needn't

31
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:54,000
necessarily having view.
It's a supposition that uh,

32
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:57,270
whatever the object of theory might be,
it must,

33
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,330
owing to whatever intellectual constraints
one can imagine be of such a form and

34
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:08,130
at this level of abstraction plainly,
um, there isn't all that much,

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,390
uh,
incentive to apply thinking of that kind.

36
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,890
But on the other hand,

37
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,010
undoubtedly theory does exist for the
most part to be applied very frequently.

38
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:24,630
Courses of this kind have a text,
uh,

39
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:29,490
listen to us, the rime of the
ancient mariner, a short story.

40
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,860
And then once in a while they
disquisition of the lecturer will pause,

41
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:38,970
the text will be produced and whatever
theory has recently been talked about

42
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:43,971
will be applied to the text so that
you'll get a post colonial reading of the

43
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,500
rime of the ancient mariner
something by the way,

44
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:50,870
which is absolutely fascinating
and important to do. Uh, and uh,

45
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,640
so on through the course.
Now I suppose it's my, uh,

46
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,420
reluctance,
um,

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,380
to get into the intricacies of questions
having to do with applied theory that

48
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:04,510
makes me prefer to keep it simple.

49
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,290
Our text is a story for toddlers
called Tony The tow truck.

50
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,970
I've decided not to pass it
out today because after all,

51
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:17,680
I want to get it into the right hands.

52
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,090
You can't read it unless you take the
course. Uh, and, and so, you know,

53
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,090
I'm going to wait a little bit. We
don't, we don't come back to it, um,

54
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,070
at least for the moment. And, uh, but
you see that it's mercifully short.

55
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,860
Um,
and as time passes,

56
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,190
we will do some rather
interesting tricks with it.

57
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,020
We will revert as others revert
to listen to us, to Donner,

58
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:45,280
the tow truck for the purpose of
introducing questions of applied theory.

59
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,580
Now this may suggest a
certain condescension both
toward theory and toward

60
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,490
literary texts, uh, which
is not at all intended.

61
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,310
It's much more a question
of reminding that, uh,

62
00:03:57,311 --> 00:04:01,970
reminding you that if you can do it with
this, you can do it with anything. Uh,

63
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,940
but also of reminding you that
after all reading, reading,

64
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:08,920
just anything,
um,

65
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:14,070
is a complex and potentially
almost unlimited activity.

66
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,510
That's one of the good things,
uh,

67
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,310
that theory teaches us and that I hope
to be able to get across, uh, in our,

68
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:23,550
in the, in the course of our, of, of,

69
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:27,850
of our varied approaches to Tony,
the tow truck.

70
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Now theory resembles philosophy perhaps
in this that it asks fundamental

71
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:39,760
questions and also at
times builds systems.

72
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:44,761
That is to say theory has
certain ambitions to a
total ization of what can be

73
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:49,480
thought, ah, that resembles
our rival's philosophy.

74
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,910
But theory differs from philosophy.

75
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:55,180
And this is something that I'm
going to be coming back to, uh,

76
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,100
presents tingly in the set in the second
half of this lecture and many times

77
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,190
hereafter theory difference from most
philosophy in that involves a certain,

78
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:10,240
and this is by no means self evident.
Why should this be,

79
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:12,280
is one of the questions
we're going to be asking.

80
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,680
It involves a certain skepticism.

81
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,890
There seems to be a doubt of a variety
of doubts about the foundations of what

82
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:26,581
we can think about the basis of
our opinions that pervades theory,

83
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,250
uh, seen some horror and other
to characterize its history. Now,

84
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,450
not all theory that we read in
this course is skeptical. Uh,

85
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,060
some of the most powerful and profound
thought that's been devoted to the

86
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:43,930
subject of theory of
literature, uh, is positive, uh,

87
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:48,250
in its intentions and in its
views. But by and large, you will,

88
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,250
uh, happily or unhappily, uh,

89
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:55,030
come to terms with the fact that much
of what you're going to be reading this

90
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:59,390
semester is under girded
or perhaps I should say,

91
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:03,680
undermined by this persisting skepticism.

92
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,880
It's crucial as I say, and I'm going
to become back coming back to it,

93
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:11,990
but it's just the point I want to make
in passing about the nature of theory.

94
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,990
Now turning to the word literature,

95
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,540
this is not theory of relativity,
theory of music, theory of government.

96
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:25,220
This is of course in theory of literature
and theory of literature shares in

97
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:28,820
common with other kinds of
literature, uh, other kinds of theory.

98
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,300
The need for definition that is to say
maybe the most central and for me and for

99
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:39,110
me possibly the most fascinating
question theory asks as well,

100
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,010
what is literature?
How do we know it when we see it?

101
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,380
How can we define it?
Now,

102
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,260
much of what we'll be reading
takes up the question,

103
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,550
what is literature and provides
us with fascinating, uh,

104
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,240
and all was for the moment,
I think enticing definitions.

105
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:01,070
There are definitions based on
form, circularity, symmetry,

106
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,060
economy of form, lack of
economy, of form, repetition.

107
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,230
There are definitions based
on psychological complexity,

108
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:12,530
psychological balance,
psychological harmony,

109
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,630
sometimes psychological inbounds
and disharmony. And they're also,

110
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,670
they're also definitions which,

111
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,720
which insists that somehow there's
an epistemological difference between

112
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,480
literature.
And other kinds of utterance,

113
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,630
whereas most utterances purport to be
saying something true about the actual

114
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:34,520
state of things in the world.
Uh,

115
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,790
literary utterance is
under no such obligation.

116
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,850
The argument goes and OT properly to be
understood as fiction making it up as

117
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,910
opposed to referring.
All right?

118
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,970
Now all of these definitions have had
currency will be going over them again.

119
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,740
Uh, and I, and, and, and finding them,

120
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:58,190
I hope more fascinating as
we learn more about them.

121
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,050
But at the same time, even as I
rattle off this list of possibilities,

122
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,000
probably you felt yourself an
upsurge of capitalism is ed,

123
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:11,360
right? Goodness. I can easily find
exceptions to all those rules.

124
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:16,100
It's ridiculous to think that literature
could be defined in any one of those

125
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:20,930
ways or even in a combination of all
of them. Literature is many things,

126
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:23,750
a many splendid thing you say to yourself,

127
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,930
and it simply cannot be confined or
trapped within a definition of that kind.

128
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,040
Well in good, properly ecumenical
of you. But at the same time,

129
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,540
it gives rise to a sense
that possibly after all,

130
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,950
literature just isn't anything at all.
In other words,

131
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:48,010
that literature may not be susceptible
of definition of any one definition,

132
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,080
but it is rather, and this is the
so called neo pragmatist argument,

133
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,320
but it is whatever you think it is or
more precisely whatever your interpretive

134
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:04,200
community sense that it is.

135
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,750
And this isn't really a big problem.

136
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:09,690
It's kind of unsettling because
we like to know what things are,

137
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,830
but at the same time,

138
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:15,831
it's not really a big problem because as
long as we know about the fact that lit

139
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:20,700
that a certain notion of literature
exists in certain communities,

140
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,500
we can begin to do very interesting
work precisely with that idea.

141
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,770
And we can say there's a great deal to
learn about what people think literature

142
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:35,790
is and we can develop very
interesting kinds of thinking, uh,

143
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,440
about the variety of ways in which these,
uh,

144
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,540
in which these ideas are,
are expressed.

145
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,400
And so it's not perhaps crippling
if this is the conclusion we reach.

146
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,450
But at the same time,
it's not the only possible conclusion.

147
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,750
Possibility of definition presents a
definition is important to us and we're

148
00:09:57,661 --> 00:10:00,840
certainly not going to give it
short shrift in this course.

149
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:05,220
We're going to make every
effort to define literature, uh,

150
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,260
as carefully as we can. Now, in
addition to defining literature,

151
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,210
literary theory also asks questions,
obviously not unrelated,

152
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:20,211
but which open up the field somewhat
what causes literature and what are the

153
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,190
effects of literature.

154
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,320
And in a way there's a subset of questions
that arises from those to the effect.

155
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,190
And this is of course what we'll be
taking up next time. The question,

156
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:36,900
what is an author? That is to say
if something causes literature, um,

157
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,620
there must be some sort of
authority behind it. Uh,

158
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,580
and therefore we find ourselves
asking what is an author?

159
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,610
And by the same token,
if literature has affects,

160
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:50,040
it must have effects on someone.

161
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,850
And this gives rise to the equally
interesting and vaccine question.

162
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,470
What is a reader?

163
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,660
And literary theory is very much
involved with questions of that kind.

164
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:01,380
Uh,

165
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,380
and organizing those
questions is basically what
rationalizes the structure of

166
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:07,680
our syllabus.

167
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:12,670
You'll notice that we move in the syllabus
after a couple of introductory, uh,

168
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,180
talks that I'll be that
I'll mention in a minute.

169
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,480
We move in the syllabus from the idea
that literature is in some sense caused by

170
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,600
language to the idea that literature is
in some sense caused by the human psyche

171
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,820
to the idea that literature is in some
sense caused by social economic and

172
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:40,530
historical forces. And there
are corollaries, uh, for the,

173
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,560
for those ideas in terms of the kinds of
effects that literature has and what we

174
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,300
might imagine ourselves to
conclude from them. And finally,

175
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:55,510
literary theory asks one other
important question asked many,

176
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:58,390
but this is the way,
at least I'm organizing it for today.

177
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,220
It asks one other important question,
the one with which we will actually begin.

178
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,470
Not so much what is a reader,
but how does reading get done?

179
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,460
That is to say,

180
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,550
how do we form the conclusion that we
are interpreting something adequately,

181
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,880
that we have a basis for the
kind of reading that we're doing?

182
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,150
What is the reading experience like?
Uh,

183
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,040
how do we meet the text face to face?

184
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,490
How do we put ourselves
in touch with the text,

185
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,380
which may after all in a variety
of ways be remote from us? Now,

186
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:39,580
these are the questions that are
asked by what's called hermeneutics.

187
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,600
Uh, a difficult word that we
will be taking up next week. Um,

188
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:49,330
it has to do with the god Hermes who
conveyed language to man and a certain

189
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:52,890
sense among many other functions,
the god of communication. Uh,

190
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,250
and it is after all obviously,
uh, about communication.

191
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,960
So hermeneutics will be
our first topic and it's,

192
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,370
and it attempts to answer the
last question that I'll mention,

193
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,390
which is raised by theory of literature.
All right?

194
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:14,230
Now let me pause quickly
over the word introduction.

195
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,480
I first started teaching this course
in the late seventies and eighties when

196
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,680
literary theory,

197
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:25,681
it was a thing absolutely of the
moment as I told the teaching fellows.

198
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:27,910
Um,

199
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,560
I had a colleague in those days who looked
at me enviously and said he wished he

200
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,380
had the black leather
concession at the door.

201
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,500
Theory was both hot and cool,

202
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,740
and it was something about which following
from that one had not just opinions,

203
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,420
but very, very strong
opinions. In other words,

204
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,060
the teaching fellows I had in those days,
who knows,

205
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:54,910
they may rise up against me
in the same way this semester,

206
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:57,250
but the teaching fellows
I had in those days said,

207
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,290
you can't teach an introduction.
You can't teach a survey.

208
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,230
You can't say if it's Tuesday, it must
be full cove. It's if it's Thursday,

209
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:09,100
it must be locked calm.
You can't approach theory that way.

210
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,510
Theory is important and it's important
to know what you believe. In other words,

211
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:18,400
what the basis of all other
possible theories. I'm a feminist.

212
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,630
I'm an Acadian.
I'm a student of Paul demonn.

213
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,530
I believe that these are the foundational
moments of theorizing and that if

214
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,690
you're going to teach
anything like a survey,

215
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:35,470
you've got to derive the rest of it
from whatever the moment I happen to

216
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:37,810
subscribe to my be.
All right.

217
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,920
That's the way it felt to
teach theory in those days.

218
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,400
It was awkward teaching an introduction
and privately for that reason,

219
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,000
while I was teaching lit 300,
which was called lit,

220
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:52,310
why Paul Newman was teaching z.
He was,

221
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,200
he was teaching a lecture course
nearby. Uh, not at the same time,

222
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:57,830
uh,

223
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,830
which was interpretation as practiced by
the school the month that was let z and

224
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:10,670
it did indeed apply imply
every other form of theory. Uh,

225
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,520
and it was extremely
rigorous and interesting,

226
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,570
but it wasn't a survey it took
for granted, in other words,

227
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,190
that everything else would
derive from the fundamental idea.

228
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:27,290
But it didn't for a minute think that a
whole series of fundamental ideas could

229
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,370
share space,

230
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:32,340
could be a kind of smorgasbord
that you could mix and match and,

231
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:35,720
and I kind of happy go,
go lucky eclectic way,

232
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,780
which perhaps we will be seeming to do
from time to time in our introductory

233
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:42,300
course.
Well now do one,

234
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,270
does one feel any nostalgia for the
coolness and heat of this moment?

235
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,060
Yes and no. Uh, it was
fascinating to be, uh,

236
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:58,140
as Wordsworth says, bliss was it in that
dawn to be alive. It was fascinating, uh,

237
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,550
to be around in those days.
But at the same time,

238
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:06,551
I think it's rather advantageous
for us to be still in theory.

239
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,310
That is to say we still have views.

240
00:16:10,311 --> 00:16:15,020
We still have to recognize that what
we think derives from this or that

241
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:20,030
understanding of theory and these or those
theoretical principles and we have to

242
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:24,710
understand the way in which what we do
and say what we write in our papers and

243
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:28,130
articles is grounded in
theoretical premises,

244
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,860
which if we don't come to terms with them,

245
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,950
we will simply naively reproduce without
being fully aware of how we're using

246
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:39,350
them and how indeed they're using us.

247
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:43,760
And so it is as crucial as
ever to understand theory.

248
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,200
At the same time,

249
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,500
we have the vantage point of I
suppose what we can now call history.

250
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,170
Some of what we'll be studying is no
longer practiced as that which is the

251
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:02,930
absolutely necessary
central path to methodology.

252
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,520
Some of what we're studying has
had its moment of flourishing,

253
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,790
has remain influential as a paradigm
that shapes other paradigms but is not

254
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:15,200
itself perhaps today.

255
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:20,230
The paradigm which gives
us the opportunity of
historical perspective so that

256
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:24,770
from time to time during the course
of the course of you're trying to say

257
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:29,771
something about why certain theoretical
issues and ideas pushed themselves into

258
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:33,170
prominent at certain historical moments.

259
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,980
And that too then can become
part of our enterprise.

260
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,630
So an introduction is not only valuable
for those of us who simply wished to

261
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,150
acquire knowledge,
it's also a valuable,

262
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:49,151
I think in lending and
additional perspective to
the topic of theory and to an

263
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:52,530
understanding about how
theory is on the one hand,

264
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,730
perhaps in a certain sense now,
uh,

265
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,430
and historical topic and
is on the other hand,

266
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,600
something that we're very much
engaged in and still committed to.

267
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,380
So all that then by way of rationale
for teaching and introduction to theory.

268
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,430
Right now the question, how
does the history of, uh,

269
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:20,310
how does literary theory relate
to the history of criticism?

270
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,240
Not this is a course that
I like to teach to, uh,

271
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,360
usually teach it Plato to ts Elliot or
Plato to Iaa Richards or some sort of

272
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,870
important figure in the
early 20th century. Uh,

273
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,460
and it's a course which is absolutely
fascinating and all sorts of ways.

274
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:43,260
And it has one very important thing in
common with literary theory that is to

275
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:48,261
say literary criticism is to perpetually
concerned with the definition of

276
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:50,874
literature.

277
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,940
Many of the issues that I raised in
talking about defining literature are as

278
00:18:56,041 --> 00:19:00,600
relevant for literary criticism
as they are for literary theory.

279
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:05,930
And yet we all instinctively know that
these are two very different enterprises.

280
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:11,570
Literary theory loses something that
literary criticism just takes for granted.

281
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,750
Literary theory is not concerned with
issues of evaluation and it's not really

282
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:25,020
concerned with concomitant
issues of appreciation.

283
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:30,650
Literary theory just takes
those for granted as part
of the the sense experience

284
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:34,680
as one might say,
uh,

285
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,740
of any reader and prefers rather to
dwell on questions of description,

286
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,820
analysis and speculation.
As I've said.

287
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,930
Now that's what's lost in theory,
but what's new in theory.

288
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,610
And here I come to the topic which will
occupy most of my attention for the

289
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:54,720
remainder of the lecture.

290
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:00,050
What's new in theory is the element of
skepticism that literary criticism by and

291
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:07,030
large, which is usually affirming
a canon of some sort, uh,

292
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,770
doesn't reflect literary theory as I say,

293
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,330
is skeptical about the
foundations of its subject matter.

294
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:20,450
And also in many cases about the
foundations of what it itself is doing.

295
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,440
So the question is,
how on earth did this come about?

296
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,840
It's an historical question,
as I say,

297
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,630
and I want to devote the
rest of the lecture to it.

298
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Why should doubt about the veridical
or truth affirming possibilities of

299
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:42,801
interpretation be so
widespread in the 20th century?

300
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,760
Now here a big glop of
intellectual history.

301
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:54,270
I think it arises from what one might
call and what often is called modernity.

302
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:59,050
Not to be confused with modernism
and early 20th century phenomenon,

303
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:04,380
but a the history of modern thought as
it usually derives from the generation of

304
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:10,390
Descartes, Shakespeare, Cervantes. Notice
something about all of those figures.

305
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:15,391
Shakespeare is preoccupied with
figures who may or may not be crazy,

306
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,860
so Ivantis is preoccupied
with a figure who is crazy.

307
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,290
We're pretty sure of that,
but he certainly is it.

308
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:28,291
He takes it for granted that he is
the most rational and systematic of,

309
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,610
of, of all thinkers and
raises questions about,

310
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:38,110
since we all take ourselves to be rational
to raises questions about just how we

311
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:42,670
know ourselves, not to be paranoid
delusive like Don Quixote.

312
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,500
And so that too can be unsettling when
we think of this as happening at a

313
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:52,090
certain contemporary and contemporaneous
moment in the history of thought,

314
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,320
not Descartes.

315
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,730
You remember in his meditations
begins by asking a serious cause,

316
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,400
a series of questions about
how we can know anything.

317
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,170
And one of the skeptical questions he
asks is, well, might I not be crazy?

318
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:10,330
In other words, Descartes is still
thinking along these same lines. He says,

319
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,780
well, maybe I've been seized
by an evil genius of some kind.

320
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:17,980
Or maybe I'm just crazy. Now
why? And here's the question,

321
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:23,190
why do we get this nervousness about
the relationship between what I know and

322
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:28,600
how I know it arising at this moment?
Well,

323
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:29,920
I think it's characterized,

324
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:34,921
at least in part by what Descartes
goes on to say in his meditations,

325
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,910
Descartes' settles the matter,

326
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,600
perhaps somewhat sweeping
the question whether a,

327
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,930
he's crazy under the rug because I still
not sure he answers that question. Uh,

328
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,060
but he settles them at the
matter of famously by saying,
I think therefore I am.

329
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,950
And furthermore,
as a concomitant,

330
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,100
I think therefore all the things that
I'm thinking about can be understood to

331
00:22:56,171 --> 00:23:00,340
exist as well. Now, the
Cartesian Revolution,

332
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,593
uh,

333
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:06,040
establishes something that is
absolutely crucial for what we call the

334
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:09,670
enlightenment of the next hundred,
hundred 50 years. In other words,

335
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:14,170
the idea that there is a distance between
the mind and the things that it thinks

336
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:18,760
about, but that this distance
is a good thing. In other words,

337
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,530
if you look too closely at a picture
or if you stand too far away from it,

338
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,170
you don't see it clearly,
it's out of focus.

339
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,990
But if you achieve just
the right distance from it,

340
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:34,020
it comes into focus and the idea
of scientific object objectivity,

341
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,990
the idea that motivates the creation of
the great encyclopedia by the figures of

342
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:41,350
the French enlightenment.

343
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:46,530
This idea all arises out of the idea
that is a certain appropriate objective

344
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:53,351
distance between the perceiver
and the perceived gradually.

345
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:54,591
However,

346
00:23:54,591 --> 00:23:59,591
the idea that this distance is
not too great begins to erode.

347
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,320
So that in 1796 Kahn who isn't exactly
enlisted on the side of the skeptics by

348
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:07,700
most of his serious students,

349
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,660
nevertheless does say something
equally famous as that,

350
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,580
as that which Descartes said,
and a good deal more disturbing.

351
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,110
We cannot know the thing
in itself. Now, as I said,

352
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:26,560
con erected such an incredibly magnificent
scaffolding around the thing in

353
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:31,970
itself. That is to say the variety of
ways in which, although we can't know it,

354
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,790
we can sort of triangulate it
and come to terms with it. Oh,

355
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:39,791
bleakly that it seems churlish to
enlist him on the side of the skeptics.

356
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,600
But at the same time,

357
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,690
there's a sense of a danger in the
distance between subject and object that

358
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:49,010
begins to emerge.

359
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:54,070
In thinking of this kind now by 1807
Hagle and the phenomenology of mind is

360
00:24:56,901 --> 00:25:01,670
saying that in recent history and in
recent developments of consciousness,

361
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,190
something unfortunate has set in,

362
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:09,530
we have unhappy consciousness,
unhappy consciousness,

363
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:13,160
which is the result of
estrangements and Frendo,

364
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,410
which drives us too far away from
the thing that we're looking at.

365
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,580
We are no longer certain at
all of what we're looking at.

366
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,780
And consciousness therefore
feels alienated. All right?

367
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,520
So you can already began to see a
development in intellectual history that

368
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:34,760
perhaps opens the way
to a certain skepticism.

369
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:39,680
But the crucial thing hasn't
yet happened because after all,

370
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:42,980
in all these accounts,
even that of Hagle,

371
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,990
there's no doubt about the authority of
consciousness to think what it thinks.

372
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:51,500
It may not clearly think
about things about objects,

373
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,740
but it has a kind of legitimate basis
that that generates the sort of thinking

374
00:25:58,581 --> 00:26:00,200
that it does.
But then,

375
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:05,270
and here's where I want you to look at
the passages that I've handed out the

376
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:09,140
here's where, uh, three great
figures, there are others,

377
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:13,640
but these are considered the salmon will
figures begin to raise questions which

378
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:16,430
complicate the whole
issue of consciousness.

379
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,980
Their argument is it's not just that
consciousness doesn't clearly understand

380
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:24,930
what it's looking at. It's also, and,

381
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,020
and is therefore alienated from it.

382
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,320
It's also that consciousness is alienated
from its own underpinnings that it

383
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:37,931
doesn't have any clear sense of where
it's coming from any more than what it's

384
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:40,100
looking at and other eds.

385
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,250
That consciousness is not
only a strange from the world,

386
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,430
but that it is in and
of itself in authentic.

387
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:52,030
So I'll just quickly look at
these passages. Marks is a,

388
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,120
in the famous argument about commodity
fetishism and capital is comparing the

389
00:26:58,081 --> 00:27:03,081
way in which we take the product of human
labor and turn it into a commodity by

390
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:08,841
saying that it has objective value by
saying that we know what its value is in

391
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:14,080
and of itself, he compares that with
religion. The argument is, well,

392
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:17,370
God is a product of human labor.
In other words,

393
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:20,280
it's not a completely supercilious
argument, you know? I mean,

394
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,280
so God has brought into
being the same way.

395
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:28,200
Objects that we make use of are brought
into being God is a product of human

396
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:28,770
labor,

397
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,770
but then we turn around and we say God
exists and has value objectively marks.

398
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:40,140
His argument is that
the two forms of belief,

399
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:45,380
belief in the objective value of the
commodity and belief in God are the same.

400
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,450
Now, whether or not any of
this is true, believe me,

401
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:54,510
is neither here nor there.
The point that Marx is making,

402
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,460
the point that Marx is
making is that consciousness.

403
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:04,461
That is to say the way in which we
believe things is determined by factors

404
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,260
outside its control.

405
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,520
That is to say in the case
of Marx's arguments, social,

406
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:16,521
historical and economic factors that
determine what we think and and and which

407
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,220
in general we call ideology.

408
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,580
That is to say ideology is driven by
factors beyond the Ken of the person who

409
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:33,240
thinks a ideologically. So you'll
see the problem for consciousness.

410
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:37,660
Now it's not just a single
problem, it's two fold. It's,

411
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,660
it's inauthentic relationship with
the things that looks at and also it's

412
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:45,870
inauthentic relationship
with its own underpinnings.

413
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,880
The argument is exactly the same for
Nicha only he shifts the ground of attack

414
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,893
for nature.

415
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:57,260
The underpinnings of consciousness which
make the operations of consciousness in

416
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:01,260
authentic, uh, are the
nature of language itself.

417
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,740
That is to say that when we
think we're telling the truth,

418
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,880
we're actually using worn
out figures of speech.

419
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:13,770
What then is truth,
a mobile army of metaphors,

420
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:18,890
but Tonomys anthropomorphism in short
of some of human relations which became

421
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:23,610
poetically and rhetorically intensified
a et Cetera, et Cetera, et Cetera,

422
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:28,470
and now no longer and are now
no longer have a count as coins,

423
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,250
but our debates now,
that word now is very important.

424
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,960
It's suggests that nature does somehow
believe that there's a privileged moment

425
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,590
in the history of language when perhaps
language is a truth serum when it is

426
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:43,480
capable of telling the truth.

427
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,720
But language has now simply be become
a question of worn out figures,

428
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,710
all of which dictates what
we believe to be true.

429
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,690
I speak, uh, of, you
know, I, I, I speak, uh,

430
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:03,070
in a figurative way about the relationship
between the earth and the sky.

431
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,140
And I believe that there's a sky.

432
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:10,141
God I speak because I simply don't
believe that I'm using figures of speech.

433
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,610
All of this is implied in niches
argument. In other words, language,

434
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,900
the nature of language,

435
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,160
the way language is received by us in
turn determines what we can do with it,

436
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,680
which is to say determines what we think.

437
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,050
So that is so that for nature,

438
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,020
the distortion of truth,

439
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:37,021
that is to say the distortion of the
power to observe in consciousness has as

440
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:41,830
its underlying cause language,
the state of language,

441
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:43,210
the status of language.

442
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Freud finally argues for exactly the
same relationship between consciousness.

443
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:54,640
That is to say what I think I am
thinking from minute to minute and the

444
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:55,510
unconscious,

445
00:30:55,511 --> 00:31:00,511
which perpetually in one way or another
unsettles what I'm thinking and saying

446
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:06,580
from minute to minute. You know that in
the psychopathology of everyday life, uh,

447
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,210
Freud reminded us that the Freudian
slip isn't something that happens just

448
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:14,410
sometimes. And nobody knows better than
those, knows this better than a lecturer.

449
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,070
It's something that happens all
the time and the and and the fruit.

450
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,120
The Freudian slip is something that one
lives with simply as a phenomenon of the

451
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:29,191
slippage of consciousness under
the influence of the unconscious.

452
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,070
Now in the passage I gave you,
Freud says very interesting thing,

453
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,930
which is that after all,

454
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,880
we have absolutely no objective
evidence that the unconscious exists.

455
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,240
You know, I mean the unconscious,
if I could see the unconscious,

456
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:44,500
that it'd be conscious,
right?

457
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:49,740
The unconscious Freud is
saying is something that we
have to infer from the way

458
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:54,250
consciousness operates.
We've got to infer something.

459
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:59,251
We've got to figure out somehow how it
is that consciousness is never completely

460
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:04,150
inhibited, never completely does,
and says what it wants to say.

461
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:09,570
So the spin on consciousness
for Freud is the unconscious.

462
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:14,350
Now someone who didn't fully believe Marx,

463
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,550
Nietzsche and Freud,

464
00:32:15,551 --> 00:32:20,551
a very important modern philosopher in
the hermaneutic tradition named Paul

465
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Ricoeur famously said in the forest
passage on your sheet that these great

466
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,440
precursors of modern thought
and particularly I would
immediately add of modern

467
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:37,860
literary theory together
dominate a school of suspicion.

468
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:43,040
There is an other words in recurs view,

469
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:48,070
a hermeneutics of suspicion and skepticism
or suspicion is a word that count

470
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:55,181
also bay appropriated perhaps more
rigorously for philosophy as negativity.

471
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:01,210
That is to say whatever seems manifest
or obvious or patent in what we're

472
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:07,001
looking at is undermined for
this kind of mind by a negation,

473
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,150
which is counterintuitive. That
is to say, which would seem, uh,

474
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:18,190
not just not just to qualify what we
understand ourselves to be looking at,

475
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,020
but to undermine it altogether.

476
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,560
And these tendencies in the way in
which Mark's nature and Freud had been

477
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,570
received. And when we read food
coast, what does an author,

478
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:34,190
and next time we'll return to this
question of how Marx, Nietzsche,

479
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,400
and Freud have been received and what we
should make of that in view of glucose

480
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,860
idea. That there's, well, you know, not
that there's no such thing as an author,

481
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,340
but that it's rather dangerous to
believe that there are authors, well,

482
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:48,980
if it's dangerous to believe that
there are others. What about Marx?

483
00:33:48,981 --> 00:33:51,860
Nietzsche and Freud Fuko confronts,
uh,

484
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,480
this question in what is an author,
uh,

485
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,940
and gives us some interesting
results of his thinking for us.

486
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,730
The aftermath,

487
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,440
a particular even prefer precisely
of the passages I've just quoted,

488
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:11,650
but certainly of the earth of the three
authors I've quoted from a can it to a

489
00:34:14,361 --> 00:34:15,650
large degree,

490
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,550
the understood as
accounting for the topic,

491
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:23,510
the phenomenon of literary theory
as we study it. In other words,

492
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,640
literary theory because of the
influence of these figures, uh, is, uh,

493
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:33,670
to a considerable degree a hermeneutics
of suspicion recognized as such,

494
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:38,300
both by its, uh, proponents.

495
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,700
And famously, I think, uh,

496
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:44,840
this is perhaps what is
historical for you by its enemies.

497
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:48,770
During the same period when I was
first teaching this course, um,

498
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:53,890
a veritable six foot shelf of diatribes
against literary theory was being

499
00:34:56,031 --> 00:34:59,810
written in the public's fear.
There was the most, I mean you can,

500
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,690
you can take or leave
literary theory fine,

501
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:08,020
but the idea that there would be such an
incredible outcry against it was one of

502
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:13,010
the most fascinating results of
it. That is to say for many, many,

503
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:13,844
many people,

504
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,800
literary theory had something to do with
the hand of civilization as we know it.

505
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:23,120
That's one of the things that seems
rather strange to us today from an

506
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,500
historical perspective,

507
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,640
but the found undermining
of foundational knowledge,

508
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:33,641
which seemed to be part and parcel of
so much that went on and literary theory

509
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,280
was seen as the central crucial threat
to rationality emanating from the academy

510
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,210
and was attacked, uh, in
those, in those terms.

511
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,370
And as I say,
at least six feet of lively polemics.

512
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:58,260
Uh, all of that is the legacy of
literary theory. And as I say,

513
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,370
uh, it arises in part from this element
of skepticism that I thought it,

514
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:08,250
uh, that I've thought it
best to emphasize today. Now,

515
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:11,500
I think that, excuse me, one thing,

516
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,820
recurrent leaves out and
something that will, that,

517
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,850
that we can anticipate as becoming more
and more important for literary theory

518
00:36:19,921 --> 00:36:24,330
and other kinds of theory in
the 20th century as Darwin.

519
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,890
That is to say,

520
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:30,570
it strikes me that Darwin could
very easily be considered, uh,

521
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,720
a fourth hermeneutics of suspicion.
Of course Darwin,

522
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,020
Darwin was not interested in suspicion,

523
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:42,230
but he was certainly the founder of ways
of thinking about consciousness that

524
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:47,160
are determined, socio biologically
determined, determined,

525
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:52,340
and in the realm of cognitive science
determined as artificial intelligence and

526
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:53,490
so on.

527
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:58,490
All of this is Darwinian thinking and
I think increasingly will be central in

528
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:03,120
importance in the 21st
century. What, what,

529
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,730
what will alter the,

530
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,480
the shape of literary theory as it was
known and studied in the 20th century is

531
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:17,241
I think an increasing emphasis on
cognitive science and socio biological

532
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:22,530
approaches, both the literature and
to Interpretive Processes, uh, that,

533
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,600
uh,
will derive from Darwin.

534
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,840
And the same way that strands of thinking
of the 20th century derived from the

535
00:37:30,421 --> 00:37:32,220
three figures that I've mentioned.

536
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:36,030
But what all this gives rise to.

537
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,180
And this brings me finally to the passages
which you have on both sides of your

538
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:44,400
sheet and which I don't
want to take up today,

539
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:49,401
but just to preview passages from James
Ambassadors 1903 and from checkoffs,

540
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:54,570
the Cherry Orchard 1904.
In other words,

541
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:59,750
I'm at pains to remind you that this is
a specific historical moment in which in

542
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:05,541
a variety of ways the speaker
argues that consciousness,

543
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:11,180
that is to say the feeling of being alive
and being someone acting in the world

544
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,880
no longer involves agency.

545
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:20,180
The feeling that somehow to be
conscious has become to be a puppet.

546
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,310
That there is a,
that,

547
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:29,330
that there is a limitation on what
we can do imposed by the idea that

548
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:35,850
consciousness is determined in
ways that we cannot control, uh,

549
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,930
and cannot get the better of.

550
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,080
So that a stressor in the ambassadors
and yet petered off in the Cherry Orchard

551
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,630
speak for a point of view,

552
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:51,990
which is a kind of partially well
informed gloom and doom that could be

553
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:58,130
understood to pervade, uh, texts
that are much better informed, uh,

554
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,460
that we will be considering.

555
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,580
But nevertheless are especially important
as an aspect of their historical

556
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:10,510
moment. And I want to begin the next
lecture, uh, by taking up those passages.

557
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,560
Please do bring them,
and I will also, uh, be,

558
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:18,070
be be passing around Tony the tow truck.
Uh,

559
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,280
and I'll give you a brief description
of what the little children's book

560
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,060
actually looks like. A, and then
we will plunge into the question,

561
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,070
what is an author?
So I'll see you on Thursday.
