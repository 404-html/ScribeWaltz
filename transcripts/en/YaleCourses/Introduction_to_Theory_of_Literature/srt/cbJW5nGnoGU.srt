1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,483
So,
uh,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,490
before we go on to talk a little
bit about the American historicist,

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,410
a hermeneutical scholar,
ed Hirsch and Wolfgang Eser,

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,460
uh, for whom you have your
reading assignment. Uh,

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,490
I want to go back to God them are a little
bit and say something more about his

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,361
taste.

7
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:29,361
That is to say the kind of literary and
intellectual cannon that his approach to

8
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:36,390
hermeneutics establishes.
You. Remember, God,

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,740
Amar is very much concerned
with the norm of classicism,

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,450
which later in his essay he's
inclined to call tradition instead.

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,111
Uh,

12
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:51,090
and the reason that that's so important
to him is that he actually has a very

13
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:56,091
conservative view of what the reader
can accomplish in understanding another

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,630
horizon. God, him or in other words,

15
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:05,631
does think that the reader can perform
any great miracles and intuitively

16
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:11,331
feeling his or her way into the mind of
another time and place so that the value

17
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:18,531
of classicism and of tradition for God
or is that there is evident common ground

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,540
in certain texts.
Sometimes we refer to them as great books.

19
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,380
In other words,
the sort of text that speaks,

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,390
or we feel as though it's
speaking to all places and times,

21
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,170
of course it's contested whether
or not there's really any,

22
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,920
any merit in talking about texts that way.

23
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,100
But God and his view is very strongly
that this conservatism about the cannon,

24
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,970
which is intimately related
to his conservatism,

25
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:55,971
has doubt about the actual capability
of a reader to span enormous gaps.

26
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:03,450
And I use that word advisedly because
it is the word that ease of uses, uh,

27
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,510
to talk about the distance between the
reader and the text and the way in which

28
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:12,420
that in the way in which that
distance it should be negotiated.

29
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,520
So in any case, um, this
conservatism, it seems to me,

30
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:18,031
however,

31
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:23,031
can be questioned and I thought that
we'd begin then by turning to page seven

32
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,760
31, uh, the lefthand
column, the footnote, uh,

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,120
you're beginning to realize,

34
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:35,121
I'm sure that I like footnotes a given
of course was said to have lived his life

35
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,260
in his footnotes.

36
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,390
Perhaps I live my life in the
footnotes of other people. In any case,

37
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,550
in this footnote, God
ever says something. I,

38
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:49,830
I think it's very rare that
we can actually just sort
of outright disagree with

39
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:50,490
God over.

40
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,110
But he says nothing in this footnote
that I believe we can actually disagree

41
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:59,890
with. Toward the bottom of the footnote
seven 31 lefthand column, he says,

42
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,200
just as in conversation,

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,560
we understand irony to the extent to
which we are in agreement on the subject

44
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,690
with the other person.

45
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,080
We understand irony only he means to
the extent to which we are in agreement

46
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:18,820
with the other person.

47
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,900
If you are expressing an
opinion and otherwise,

48
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,390
which differs radically from my own.

49
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,320
I can't understand according to gardener
whether or not you're being ironic.

50
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,770
This seems to me to be
just patently false. Uh,

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,700
think about politics.
Think about political talk shows,

52
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:44,701
think about political campaigns when
our political opponent is being ironic

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,020
about our views. We understand the
irony perfectly. Well, we're used to it.

54
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,190
Uh, we have accommodated ourselves to it.
And of course it's the same in reverse.

55
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:58,300
Our opponent understands
are ironies and there is,

56
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:02,800
it seems to me a perfect
kind of symbiosis,

57
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:07,240
ironically enough between
political opponents. Precisely.

58
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:12,241
Maybe in the measure to which they're
ironies are mutually intelligible.

59
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:16,630
It probably teaches each of them
are good deal, uh, to accommodate,

60
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,110
to encounter,
to get used to the ironies of the other.

61
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,290
And I think this applies
to conversation in general.

62
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,090
It's very easy to pick up most
forms of irony we don't have,

63
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,880
we don't have an enormous
difficulty grasping them.

64
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:35,881
And it doesn't seem to me that our
capability of grasping irony is founded on

65
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,190
unnecessary underlying agreement.

66
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,420
That's what he's saying.
Now, if this is the case,

67
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,720
it seems to me that one has found a
loophole and got him or his conservatism

68
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,490
about what the reader can do.

69
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,210
His premise is that in order to understand
there has to be a basis of agreement.

70
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,560
But if what we've just said about
understanding each other's ironies,

71
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,760
even where there is pretty
wholesale disagreement is true,

72
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,480
that ought to apply also to our
capacity to read work that with which we

73
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:24,790
distinctly disagree with, which we
feel we can never come to terms, uh,

74
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,010
in terms of affirming it's value,

75
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:32,190
but which we nevertheless can understand
if understanding is not predicated on

76
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:38,170
agreement,
the possibility of opening up the Canon,

77
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,011
as we say,

78
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:44,011
insisting that it doesn't have to be an
absolutely continuous traditional cannon

79
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,680
is available to us once again and got,

80
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,060
or his conservatism on this
issue can be questioned now.

81
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,890
It's not the gardener's insisting
on absolute continuity on contrary.

82
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,030
You'll probably remember that
on page seven 32, um, it,

83
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,710
the, the, uh, um, the,
it can't be seven 32,

84
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:10,850
so please disregard that. I'm not going
to read this passage anyway. Uh, uh,

85
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:16,420
he says early in the essay that in
order to recognize that we are in the

86
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:23,531
presence of something that isn't merely
within our own historical horizon,

87
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,350
we need to be pulled up short.
In other words,

88
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:31,100
to go back to that example
once more, the, um,

89
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,050
we need to recognize that
there's something weird
about that word plastic. Um,

90
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,300
and in being pulled up short,

91
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,990
we recognize the need also for the
fundamental act of reading and God umber,

92
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,170
which is the merger of horizons with the,

93
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:51,650
in other words that we are dealing
knowingly with the horizon,

94
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,250
not altogether our own.
That has to be negotiated,

95
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,280
that has to be merged with our own
for understanding to be possible.

96
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,600
So got her. In fact, God,

97
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:06,500
we're even insist that if we don't have
this phenomenon of being pulled up short,

98
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:09,080
our reading is basically
just solid cystic. We,

99
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,550
we just take it for granted that what
we're reading is completely within our own

100
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:14,730
horizon.
Um,

101
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,840
and we don't make any effort at all to
understand that which is fundamentally,

102
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,110
or at least in some ways different
God I'm or acknowledges this,

103
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,030
even insist on it as I say,

104
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,240
but he doesn't lay stress on it because
the gap that is implied in the need to

105
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:39,761
be pulled up short is not a big one that
has to say it's one that we can easily

106
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:44,360
satisfy plastic again. Oh Gee,
that's a strange word we say.

107
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:45,770
So we go to the OED,

108
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,610
we see it meant something different than
our problem is solved and we continue.

109
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,770
No big deal, right? But there
may be a ways of being pulled up,

110
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:59,771
short occasions for being co pulled up
short that God of Earth thinks exceed the

111
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:04,370
imaginative grasp of a reader.
And this,

112
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,410
as you'll see when we return to ease
or after I've said a few things about

113
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,780
Hershey,
this as you'll see,

114
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,960
is the fundamental difference between
God and man and or where it gut wherefore

115
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:22,151
God them or the gap between reader and
text between my horizon and the horizon

116
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,740
of the text isn't it?

117
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,850
Is perforce a small one for either,

118
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:34,150
it needs to be a much larger one in
order for what he calls the act of the

119
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:38,720
reader, the Reading Act really
to swing into high gear.

120
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,140
And we'll see that this has implications
for the obvious difference between

121
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,320
their two cannons.
All right,

122
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,330
but now I want to say something about
the person who, the passage of whom,

123
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,180
uh, I quoted over against
the passage from God.

124
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,400
I'm at the end of the God and or a
lecture you remember got him or said, um,

125
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,090
we have to be open to the
otherness of the past.

126
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,860
Uh, and, and in order that
for us it may speak true,

127
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,490
but if we simply bracket
out our own feelings, uh,

128
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,200
that can't possibly happen.

129
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:21,410
So that we have to recognize that in
this mutuality of the reading experience,

130
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,570
we really are in a conversation.

131
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,780
We're open to being told
something true by someone else.

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,030
Hirsch on the other hand
says, oh, well, you know,

133
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:37,200
the important thing is to know the
exact meaning of that other person,

134
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,670
because that's the only way to honor
the otherness of the person. You know,

135
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,170
concepts people ought to be, uh,
an end and not a means for us.

136
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:50,640
We ought to understand them on their
terms, God and or his claim, however,

137
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,650
was that if we do that,

138
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,770
we are in fact suspending the way in
which it might be that they speak true.

139
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:58,950
We're sitting,
we're,

140
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,950
we're honoring instead the integrity of
what we're saying without thinking about

141
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,940
whether or not it might be true.

142
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,060
So I introduced Hirsch in that context
and now I want to go back to him a little

143
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:15,240
bit. Uh, and I want to
work with two passages,

144
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,260
which I've sent you all an email form,

145
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,770
which I've neglected to put on the board,
but there is so short,

146
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:24,810
I don't think that will be necessary.

147
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,110
The first of the two passages I want to
talk about is Hershey's argument that

148
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:36,711
consciousness is an of that meaning is
an affair of consciousness and not have

149
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:40,524
words.

150
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,810
Meaning is an affair of
consciousness and not have words.

151
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,943
In other words,

152
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,980
the text is what makes the ascertainment
of meaning possible and available to

153
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:56,640
us.
But meaning is not in the text.

154
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,510
Meaning is in the intention of the author.

155
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,250
And that is the,

156
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,110
and that is what we need to arrive
at as we work through the text.

157
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,760
Meaning is an affair of consciousness
and not have words. Now think about this.

158
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,200
What it means is that
in understanding a text,

159
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,450
we are attempting to grasp it.
In paraphrase,

160
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,261
we are,

161
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:27,180
in other words attempting to grasp it
in a sentence that might read something

162
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:31,820
like what the author
means to say is right.

163
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,790
That is it. So that it's a,
it's not what the text means,

164
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,150
which might be anything according to her.
She,

165
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:40,860
if you've just appealed to the text,

166
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:46,080
it's what the author means to say is,
okay,

167
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,670
so what's implied here?

168
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,260
On the one hand you can say this is just
absolute total nonsense and we use a

169
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:56,260
text to find meaning and something
that we don't have available to us.

170
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,110
Why don't we just find meaning in the
checks which is available to us? Uh,

171
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,940
that would make more sense. It's
up to us to construe the text. Um,

172
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,160
we can't possibly know what the author
meant except on the basis of our

173
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:13,660
determination of the meaning of the text,

174
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,800
so why not just focus our
attention to meaning on the text.

175
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,620
Hirsch was a student of whimsy at Harris,

176
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:23,170
was engaged in lifelong
that's agreement with God,

177
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,080
but he was a student at wounds,

178
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,300
wounds that the author of
the intentional fallacy,

179
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,420
obviously Hirsch was a rebellious student
and insisted that far from wanting to

180
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:35,620
take websites.

181
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,280
Position appealing to intention was
the most important thing you can do.

182
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:40,840
The only thing you can do,

183
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,400
which establishes according to the
title of his first important book on

184
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:49,450
Hermeneutics, validity in
interpretation. All right.

185
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,480
Now it seems it's very difficult.

186
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:58,120
It's very difficult intuitively to assent
to Hershey's position and I'll just

187
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:01,000
tell you by the way that I don't,
I can't,

188
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,720
but I will say in passing in defense of
Hirsch that if we reflect on the matter,

189
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,250
we realized that in common sense terms,

190
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,620
appealing to an author's intention
is precisely what we do for practical

191
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:22,030
reasons. Let me give you an
example. You're all students.

192
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,480
You are sitting in classrooms that in
many cases oblige you to take exams.

193
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,140
Your instructor tells you
when you write your exam,

194
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,910
don't just para the words of
the authors you're studying.

195
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,860
I wanted, I want to know that
you understand those offers.

196
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,353
Think about it.

197
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,900
You prove to your teacher
that you understand the
authors by being able to put

198
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:53,470
their meaning. In other
words, in other words,

199
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:56,290
to say the author is
intending to say something,

200
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,150
not just that the text says something and
this is what it says it's at with your

201
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:04,210
exam. Then you know one
long screed of quotation.

202
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,490
Ironically, the the, the,

203
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:12,250
the instructor doesn't really
want just quotation on an exam.

204
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:16,450
He wants explanation and the form
of explanation is paraphrase.

205
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,810
You can't have paraphrase unless
you can identify a meaning,

206
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,590
which is interpersonal meaning,

207
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,620
which can be shared among a group
that understands and can be expressed.

208
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,720
In other words, that's the
key. If you can put it,

209
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,310
in other words,

210
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,850
those other words take the
form of an appeal to intention.

211
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,670
All right, so that's, and
that's an important point.

212
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,230
Argument in Hirsch's favor.
We realized that practically speaking,

213
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,040
the necessity of appealing to
paraphrase in order to guarantee mutual

214
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:09,071
understanding certainly does seem to
be something like agreeing or admitting

215
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,710
that meaning is an affair
of consciousness, not of
words. My consciousness,

216
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,430
the author's consciousness,
the consciousness that we can all share.

217
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,700
That's where we find meaning and
meaning takes the form of that kind of

218
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:29,720
paragraph paraphrase that everyone
can agree on so much then,

219
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,400
uh, to the, uh,

220
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,580
to the t to the advantage
or benefit of Hirsch.

221
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,620
Uh, there are lots of things to be
said against it. On the other hand,

222
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:42,800
which I don't want to pause
over now because I think a,

223
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,040
a course of lectures and literary theory
will inevitably show the ways in which

224
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,100
paraphrase is inadequate to the
task of rigorous interpretation.

225
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,070
Clans, Brooks, uh, the new critic, uh, uh,

226
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,340
rights of famous essay called
the heresy of paraphrase,

227
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,400
insisting that a proper literary
interpretation is a wooden mechanical

228
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:14,090
inflexible exercise if it reduces the
incredible complexity of a textual

229
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:20,240
surface. To paraphrase. Um,
and so it's a complex issue.

230
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,690
Uh, and I should, I should
leave it. Having said this much,

231
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:28,130
leave at x at least for the moment.
Now, one other thing that her says,

232
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:32,900
the other thing that I uh, that
I quoted, um, is in effect,

233
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:36,260
I'll paraphrase now that uh,
that uh,

234
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:41,261
that what got them or omits to realize
is that there is a difference between the

235
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:46,481
meaning of a text and the significance
of a text that is Hirsch's other key

236
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,070
position. And we can understand
it by saying something like this.

237
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,630
The meaning of a text is
what the author intended it.

238
00:16:56,631 --> 00:17:01,010
To me that is to say what we can
establish with a reliable paraphrase.

239
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,320
The significance of the text,

240
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:08,321
which Hirsch does not deny interest
to the significance of the text is the

241
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:10,280
meaning for us.

242
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:14,750
That is to say what we take to
be important about this meaning,

243
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,640
uh, the way in which for example, we
can translate it into our own terms.

244
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:24,641
Historically we can adapt it to a
cause or a or an intellectual position.

245
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,460
The ways, in other words in which we can
take the meaning of a text and make it

246
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:33,410
significant for us,

247
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,120
the difference between meaning and
significance then is something that purse

248
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:42,320
takes very seriously and he insists
and here's of course where it becomes

249
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,220
controversial.

250
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,030
He insists that it's possible to tell
the difference between meaning and

251
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:50,250
significance if good basis that you are,

252
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,400
you can pin down accurately
an incontestably the
author's meaning appealing to

253
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,780
all the philological tricks that you have,
uh,

254
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,890
throwing out irrelevancies and insisting
that you finally have the meaning.

255
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,340
Right? And of course, how
many times has that happened,

256
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:12,870
which is obviously one
point of disagreement with
hers and insisting that you

257
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:16,980
finally have the meaning, right?
Then once you've done that,

258
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:21,570
once you've secured the integrity
and accuracy of the meaning,

259
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,490
her says, okay, fine. Now you can do
anything you like with the text. You know,

260
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,240
you can adapt it for any,
any sort of possible purpose.

261
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,620
But the crucial thing is to keep
the distinction between meaning and

262
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:38,910
significance.
Clear obviously got 'em or refuses,

263
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:44,390
refuses to argue that we can
distinguish in that way reliably.

264
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,080
We don't know because it's a
question of merging horizons.

265
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,480
My horizon in the horizon of the tax,

266
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,630
we don't know with any guarantee where
meaning leaves off and insignificance

267
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:02,721
begins so that the splitting apart of
the two terms is something that simply

268
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:08,151
can't be accomplished by the way in which
we enter the hermaneutic circle that's

269
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,480
got hammers position.
Uh,

270
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:17,040
and it is the position of
anyone who supposes that, uh,

271
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,150
Hirsch, uh, although the,
once again, the distinction,

272
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,510
what he means by that distinction
is clear enough. Yes, yes. You say,

273
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:26,940
I see exactly what he means.
Nevertheless,

274
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:32,090
that to secure the distinction
is that in actual practice say,

275
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:35,940
okay, this is the meaning and now this
is how I'm going to make it significant.

276
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,260
Well, you know, it seems unlikely indeed,

277
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:45,270
that this is something anyone could
ever accomplish. All right? Finally,

278
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,690
to turn to Wolfgang easier

279
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,660
ease or is concerned with what
he calls the act of the reader.

280
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:55,481
Does.

281
00:19:55,481 --> 00:20:00,481
AHC does lasers a as the title
of one of his books and he is an,

282
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:02,460
and in so doing,

283
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:07,550
he establishes himself as a person very
much in the tradition of phenomenology,

284
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:13,761
deriving from Husserl more directly in
[inaudible] case from a an analyst of the

285
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:20,400
way in which the reader moves
from sentence to sentence
and negotiating a text,

286
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:25,730
a Polish intellectual named Roman in
garden who is quoted frequently in the

287
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:31,440
essay that you have. Um, those are
the primary influences on either,

288
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,530
but he himself has been tremendously
influential in turn reader's interest in

289
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:42,620
the reader. There's interest
in the reader's experience, uh,

290
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,690
is part of a school of thought that he
helped to found that grew up around the

291
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:52,540
university of Constance in
the sixties and seventies, uh,

292
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:57,570
which resulted in a series of seminars
on what was called reception history or

293
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:04,200
alternatively the aesthetics
of reception and ease.

294
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,500
Or his colleague was Hans
Robella [inaudible] whom
we will be reading later in

295
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,740
the course.
Uh,

296
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,560
the influence of the so called constant
school spread to the United States,

297
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,060
uh, and had many ramifications
here, uh, particularly, uh,

298
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:23,800
and crucially in the early work of
another critic will be turning to later in

299
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:26,170
this semester, Stanley fish. Uh,

300
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,200
so reception history has been
a kind of partly theoretical,

301
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,700
partly scholarly field,
uh,

302
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:38,290
one that's really still flourishing
ever since the early work in the great

303
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:43,240
Constance seminars of Eser.
Uh, yes and others. So,

304
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,710
and easier later in his career.
He died just a couple of years ago,

305
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,810
later in his career, taught annually
at a university of California, Irvine.

306
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,080
And by that time he was very much
engaged in a new aspect of his project,

307
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,130
uh, which he called the anthropology
of fiction. That is to say,

308
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:07,270
why do we have fiction?
Why do we tell stories to each other?

309
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:12,510
All of eases work is grounded in
the notion of literature as fiction.

310
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,770
He's almost exclusively a scholar
of the novel. And by the way,

311
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:20,110
one of the first obvious differences,
uh,

312
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,270
you can notice between Eser and got
her is that whereas God omers and

313
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,280
intellectual historian who's canonical
texts are works of philosophy,

314
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:34,360
uh, works of social thought, uh, as
well as great works of Literature,

315
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,910
uh, for easier. It's a
completely different canon.

316
00:22:36,911 --> 00:22:41,911
He has exclusively concerned with fiction
and how we read fiction and how we

317
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:47,161
come to understand fiction and how
we determine the meaning of a work of

318
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:49,360
fiction.
And as I say in the,

319
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,710
in the last phase of his career when he
started thinking about the anthropology

320
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,640
of fiction, he raised the even
more fundamental question.

321
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,320
I think a very important one though,

322
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:02,850
not necessarily to be aimed
exclusively at fiction. Uh,

323
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,520
the anthropological question,
why we have fiction at all,

324
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,610
why it has been a preexisting
trans historical phenomenon
of human culture that

325
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:16,990
we tell stories to each other,
that we make things up. Uh,

326
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:21,370
when after all, when after all we
could be spending all of our time.

327
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,060
Well just talking about things
that actually are around us.

328
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,070
How is it that we feel the need
to make things up? All right.

329
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,190
Now as you read easier,

330
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:38,191
you'll see immediately that he in tone
and in and in a sense of what's important

331
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:43,441
and his understanding of the way in which
we negotiate the world of texts that

332
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,480
he much more closely
gossamer than Hershey.

333
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,450
We can say this in two different ways.

334
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:54,070
We can say that [inaudible]
position is a way is,

335
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,460
is a reconstruction of what got him or
says has essentially to say about the

336
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:05,120
merger of horizons. For
example, on page 1002,

337
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,650
a the bottom of the left hand column
over to the right hand column,

338
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,190
he says,
the convergence of texts and reader,

339
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,040
the convergence of text
and reader got him,

340
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:21,020
or his way of putting that would be
the merger of the uh, readers horizon.

341
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:26,021
My horizon with the horizon within
which the text appears either says the

342
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:31,691
convergence of text and reader brings
the literary work into existence.

343
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,350
This is implied in God Amar as well.
It's not your horizon,

344
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,390
it's not my horizon.

345
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:43,250
It's that effective history which
takes place when our horizons merge.

346
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:48,170
That is the locus of meaning for Ghana.
By the same token,

347
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,420
for what what,

348
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:54,430
what [inaudible] is saying is that the
space of meaning is virtual and this is

349
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:59,450
the word he uses. It's neither
in the taxed nor in the reader,

350
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:04,870
but the result of the negotiation back
and forth between the text and the

351
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:06,920
reader,
he says,

352
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,450
sort of brings the literary work
into existence in a virtual space.

353
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,160
And this convergence can
never be precisely pinpointed,

354
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,340
but must always remain virtual and is
not to be identified either with the

355
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:27,221
reality of the text or with the
individual disposition of the reader.

356
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,650
So you'll see this has got a mirror in.
This is the result.

357
00:25:30,651 --> 00:25:35,651
This is the fruit of they hermaneutic
engagement between horizons that results

358
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,030
in meaning,
let's put in a different way by his there.

359
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,810
But it is in a large degree the same idea.

360
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,630
He also plainly shares with God.

361
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,960
They assumption the supposition that
the construal of meaning cannot be all

362
00:25:55,401 --> 00:26:00,120
together. Objective, in other
words, is there is no more, uh,

363
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,600
and historicist then God I'm or is,

364
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,660
but insist rather on this mutual exchange
of prejudice between the two horizons

365
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:15,080
in question.
So he argues on page 1005,

366
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:19,220
the right hand column
one text,

367
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,110
this is halfway down the column one
text is potentially capable of several

368
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,140
different realizations and no reading
can ever exhaust the full potential for

369
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:36,100
each individual reader will
fill in the gaps in his own way.

370
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,800
And this of course brings us to the issue
of gaps and the role that they play,

371
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,200
uh,

372
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,200
in the act of reading as
ease or understands it a gap.

373
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,130
It's an interesting term.
I don't know.

374
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,050
I don't actually know whether
either to be Hershey and means,

375
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,320
uh,
what I'm about to say about gaps,

376
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:02,610
but plainly a gap isn't a bit,
so it's a distance between two points.

377
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:07,110
But what's really interesting
is that we think of spark plugs.

378
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,320
We think of gapping a spark plug.
In other words,

379
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,960
I don't know if you know how the
spark plug words but, but, but,

380
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:17,961
but for the electrical current to
fly into operation and a spark plug,

381
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,800
the two points of contact
have to be gapped.

382
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,970
They have to be forced apart
to a certain degree. Too much.

383
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:31,500
There's no spark too little. There is
no to too little you short out, right?

384
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,290
There's no spark.
So you have to gap a spark plug.

385
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:39,410
And it seems to me that the Aha effect
of reading the movement back and forth

386
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:47,930
across the gap between the reader and
the text can be understood in terms of a

387
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:54,180
spark, right? As though the relationship
between the reader and the text where the

388
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:57,560
relationship between the
two points of a spark plug,

389
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:02,990
whether God Umer means that when he speaks
of gap or whether he simply means and

390
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:07,060
a bis or distance to be
crossed. I couldn't say. Um,

391
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,540
but I think it's useful. Uh, you know,

392
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:14,420
like the opportunities in the word
plastic. I think it's useful, uh,

393
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,470
to suggest that the sense of gapping as
spark club may have some relevance to

394
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:24,180
our understanding of what goes on in this,
in this reading process.

395
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,753
Now,

396
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:32,930
how then does he differ from
God are one way that is I think,

397
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:36,660
not terribly important but I think is
interesting in view of what we've just

398
00:28:36,661 --> 00:28:41,490
been saying about Hershey and another
way that's absolutely crucial that we've

399
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:46,410
implied already and to which we need
to return the way that's perhaps not

400
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,800
terribly important,
at least for president present purposes.

401
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:53,580
Although this is a distinction that's
going to be coming up again and again

402
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:58,670
later in the semester is the way in
which he actually seems to distinguish.

403
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:04,920
This is page 1006, uh, in the, uh,

404
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:09,360
how can it be? I've got it,
uh, in the um, uh, yeah,

405
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:11,670
in the upper left hand column,

406
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:18,930
the way in which he appears to distinguish
between reading and interpretation,

407
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,120
very top of the left hand column.

408
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:25,680
He says the text refers back
directly to our own preconceptions.

409
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,300
Got them or would call those prejudices
to our own preconceptions which are

410
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,120
revealed by the act of interpretation.

411
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,800
That is a basic element
of the reading process.

412
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:42,940
So there's a wedge there between the
concept of reading and the concept of

413
00:29:42,941 --> 00:29:43,810
interpretation.

414
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:49,050
I would suggest that it's not unlike
the wedge that her drives between the

415
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:53,670
concept of meaning and
the concept of Inter of,

416
00:29:53,671 --> 00:29:58,671
of significance and meaning is construal
significance is the application of that

417
00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:03,880
construal to something.
I think that the distinction is,

418
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:08,881
is making between reading
an interpretation can be
understood in much the same

419
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:13,600
way is or doesn't make much of
the distinction. In other words,

420
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:16,720
it's not an important part of
his object of his argument,

421
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,710
which is why I say that the difference
with gardener who never makes the

422
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:23,330
distinction between reading
and interpretation. Uh,

423
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,350
the difference we've got 'em
or in this matter is slight.

424
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:32,040
But the other difference is very important
and that is to return to this point

425
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:38,370
that eser stresses innovation
as the principle of value
governing the choice and

426
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:49,081
the interpretive strategies of reading
innovation is what easier as Canon is

427
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:55,540
looking for. That's what makes it so
different from God. Numerous conservative,

428
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:56,500
continuous,

429
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:01,420
traditional cannon is as
understanding of gapping.

430
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:05,350
The spark plug is a much more bold,
uh,

431
00:31:05,351 --> 00:31:09,010
affirmative of the imaginative
powers of the reader.

432
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,590
A much more bold process than the uh,

433
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,640
hesitant conservative process
suggested by God ever.

434
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:21,880
Now in order,
in order to illustrate the way in which,

435
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,230
what ease or calls virtual
work gets done in this regard,

436
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,400
let me just run through
a few passages quickly.

437
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:36,030
If God ever says in a way that PR that
he doesn't really stress in the long run,

438
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:41,430
that in order to know that there is
actually a difference between the reader's

439
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:45,850
horizon and the horizon of the text,
you need to be pulled up short.

440
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,070
Something needs to surprise you.

441
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,640
Well easier throws his whole
emphasis on this element of surprise.

442
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,330
If it doesn't surprise, it isn't worth
it, it doesn't have value. And we'll,

443
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:03,420
and we'll talk in more detail about the
ways in which it doesn't have value in a

444
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,580
minute.
So the gap,

445
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:12,030
if the element of surprise is to become
absolutely central and paramount in the

446
00:32:12,491 --> 00:32:17,380
reading process, the gap has
to get bigger. The the, you
know, there just has to be,

447
00:32:17,381 --> 00:32:20,440
it has to be a bigger distance,
a broader of bits.

448
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,100
And that's what either is working with
in the passages I'm about to quote,

449
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,810
as I said, I'm going to quote
three more or less rapid fire.

450
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:31,780
The first is on page 1003,

451
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:37,410
the upper left hand column in
this process of creativity,

452
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:43,050
that is to say the way in which a text
induces the feeling of surprise in the

453
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:48,080
reader.
In this process of creativity,

454
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:53,410
the text may either go not
far enough or may go too far.

455
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:58,610
Now I admit in this particular passage,
you get a hint of God, hammers,

456
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:02,450
element of conservatism. The text
may go through far. In other words,

457
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:07,220
it may make demands on us
that are too great. Yeah,
we're reading Finnegan's wake.

458
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,130
We haven't got a clue. You know,
the text has gone too far. Uh,

459
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:14,630
we can't get from sentence to sentence.
Even within the sentence,

460
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,440
we have no idea what the words
mean. And so we're at sea, uh, uh,

461
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,400
unless of course we really
rise to meet the challenge,

462
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,140
but typically are characteristically
it in [inaudible] terms,

463
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:31,940
the text has gone too far.
So we may say he elaborates here.

464
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:36,941
So we may say that boredom and
overstrain form the boundaries,

465
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,660
the on which the reader will
leave the field of play.

466
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:45,800
And that as if there are no surprises,
that's just the Yon. I mean,

467
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:49,610
why bother to read it all and
at the surprises are too great.

468
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,860
They induce overstrain. Uh,
and we throw away the book, um,

469
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,450
in frustration and despair.
Uh,

470
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:01,520
and so the distance of the gap needs to
be between the outer limits of boredom

471
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:08,830
and overstrain according to
according to Eser page 1004,

472
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,060
the upper right hand column

473
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:19,310
expectations and this word
is, uh, what, uh, eser thanks.

474
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:24,430
The sort of dialectic that the reading
process is playing with reading consists

475
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:25,960
according to his,
her,

476
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:31,350
and the violation of expectations
for the violation to work.

477
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:36,100
The expectations have to be there.
So that's the dialectic.

478
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:38,020
That's what's negotiated.
The,

479
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:42,550
there has to be a sense moving from
sentence to sentence that something is

480
00:34:42,551 --> 00:34:47,140
likely to happen next.
If that underlying sense isn't there,

481
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:50,080
then whatever happens is
simply met with frustration.

482
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,490
But if we have the expectation that
something's going to happen next and then

483
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:59,610
something different happens or if the
suspense of wondering what will happen

484
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:06,130
next is in play so that anything can
happen and it and, and, and, and the but,

485
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,590
but but the experience is suspense,
um,

486
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,760
has been gone through then in those cases,
that's all to the good.

487
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,490
That's a good part of the reading process.

488
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,240
Expectations says eser are scarcely
ever fulfilled in truly literary texts.

489
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,171
You see,

490
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:28,171
that's where the evaluative principle
that completely revolutionizes got

491
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:34,860
hammers. Cannon comes in. In other words,

492
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,850
innovation is that the
principle of change,

493
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:43,851
the principle of violated expectation
is what imposes or establishes value and

494
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:49,200
the literary text,
not continuity,

495
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:54,740
not a sense that across the abyss
truth is being spoken to us,

496
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:00,020
but rather the sense that across the
abyss we are being constructively

497
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,430
surprised. Right? That's that,

498
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,410
that that's what has changed between,
between these two positions.

499
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,660
We implicitly demand of expository text.

500
00:36:11,661 --> 00:36:15,570
He goes on and he may be alluding to God,
I'm are here because after all,

501
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,920
God Ameren is talking primarily about
expository text works of Philosophy,

502
00:36:19,921 --> 00:36:24,060
works of social thought, which of course
aren't trying to surprise or trickest.

503
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:28,130
They're trying to lay out an argument
which is consistent and continuous, um,

504
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,270
and keeps surprise to a minimum. It's
difficult philosophy and social thought,

505
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,360
but it's not difficult because
of the element of surprise,

506
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,830
but it's the vocabulary.

507
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:41,670
It's the complexity of the thought
and so on that makes it difficult.

508
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:46,540
So easily said and easily
acknowledges this. He says, uh, uh,

509
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:51,590
we implicitly demand of expository
text that there be no surprise,

510
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,400
um, as we refer to the objects
they're meant to present,

511
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,790
but it's a defect in a literary text.

512
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,970
That's the difference for Eason between
nonfiction and fiction and nonfiction.

513
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,140
We don't want to be
surprised. It has other, it,

514
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:15,540
it poses other kinds of difficulty,
let's say. But in the case of fiction,

515
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:20,460
in order to be engaged, in order to
enter the hermaneutic circle properly,

516
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:24,210
we need the element of surprise.
So as I say,

517
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,220
a way of distinguishing between
fiction and nonfiction. Page 10, 10,

518
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,980
the lower right hand column,

519
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,940
the word defund linearization we will
encounter soon when we take up the Russian

520
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:40,050
formalists.

521
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,200
D familiarization means precisely
pulling you up short or taking you by

522
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:47,940
surprise,
making you,

523
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:53,090
making you feel that what you thought
was going to be the case or what you

524
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:59,280
thought was the state of affairs
is not the state of affairs.

525
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,480
Uh,
Wallace,

526
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:05,070
the poet Wallace Stevens
puts it beautifully when
he says that poetry should

527
00:38:05,071 --> 00:38:08,820
make the visible a little hard to see.
In other words,

528
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,880
it should be a d familiarizing of
that which has become too familiar.

529
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,480
That's an aspect of the reading process.

530
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:23,070
And so is her says this d familiarization
of what the reader thought he

531
00:38:23,071 --> 00:38:28,071
recognized is bound to create attention
that will intensify his expectations as

532
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:33,000
well as his distrust of those
expectations. In other words,

533
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:38,001
the tension itself of simultaneously
having expectations and feeling that they

534
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:44,710
should be valid, violated the
probably they will be violated,

535
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,950
being on the alert for how
they're going to be violated.

536
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:51,040
This is a kind of tension,
a constructive tension,

537
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:56,220
which constitutes for either the
psychological excitement of reading.

538
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,600
All right.
Having said all of this,

539
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,370
obviously what easy means to say is
that the reader should work hard.

540
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,700
There should be that the virtual work
done by the reader to constitute,

541
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,600
to bring into existence a virtual meaning,
uh,

542
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:18,750
should be hard work and there's not much
work to do if two things are the case,

543
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,050
first of all, if the techs just
seems real, in other words, if,

544
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:28,150
if it's, it is, if there's
no spin on reality,

545
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:33,180
if there is no sense of
this being a fictive world,

546
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:38,970
if it's just seems to be about the every
day about life as we live at the life

547
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:45,130
that we find ourselves in according
to ease, or at least there are no,

548
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:50,710
there are no, there's no violation of
expectations. The gap isn't big enough.

549
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,900
This is of course disputable.

550
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:57,901
There is a kind of a vogue recurrently
and the history of fiction for a kind of

551
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:04,510
a miraculous sense that this is
just exactly the way things are.

552
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:09,370
People enjoy that in ways that ease or
may not be fully acknowledging in this

553
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:09,970
argument,

554
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:14,530
but there's no question that it doesn't
involve the violation of expectations.

555
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,570
There's not much gap at all.

556
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:21,460
It's another kind of pleasure that re
that either is perhaps not taking into

557
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:26,461
account that we take in that which seems
to be simply incontestably real as we

558
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:32,050
read it. Uh, and and easier leaves
that out of account. On the other hand,

559
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,740
he says that there is no use either a no
value either in that form of engagement

560
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:44,701
with the text in which an illusion is
perpetually sustained and that it's an

561
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:49,780
illusion is created a never,
never land is created.

562
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,400
We know it's an illusion,

563
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:56,730
but we get to live in it so comfortably
with so little alteration of the nature

564
00:40:58,391 --> 00:41:03,391
of the illusion or of the way in which
we negotiate the illusory world that it

565
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:08,050
becomes kind of womb like
and cozy. Uh, it is, I mean,

566
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,790
and here of course either is referring
to what he calls culinary fiction.

567
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,560
The very, the, the sub genres of
literature like, well, nurse novels,

568
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:21,550
bodice, rippers, uh, uh,
certain kinds of, of,

569
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,050
of detective fiction.

570
00:41:23,051 --> 00:41:27,250
Although a lot of detective fiction is
much better than than that description

571
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,260
would imply.
In other words,

572
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:34,280
novels in which undoubtedly it's an
illusory world just don't happen the way

573
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:36,980
they happen in nurse novels and
bought us for a prison. You know,

574
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,780
somehow or another, you know, the pauper
marries the prince. This doesn't happen.

575
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,790
But at the same time,

576
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:48,910
it's a world of illusion in which
the reader lives all to comfortably.

577
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,100
Right. So these are forms
of reading, of the reading,

578
00:41:52,101 --> 00:41:53,960
of the experience of reading fiction,

579
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:59,120
of which either disapproves
because there's no work being done.

580
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,890
The virtual work of the reader
does not involve surprise,

581
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,690
does not involve the
violation of expectations.

582
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,960
The relationship between text and
reader must be a collaboration.

583
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:19,090
Eser argues the poly
semantic nature of the text.

584
00:42:19,091 --> 00:42:23,330
That is to say the fact that the
text sort of throws up all sorts of

585
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:27,920
possibilities of meaning. If
it's a good text, the policy,

586
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:32,921
romantic nature of the text and the
illusion making of the reader are opposed

587
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:34,670
factors.
In other words,

588
00:42:34,671 --> 00:42:38,150
there's something in the raider that
wants to settle comfortably into the world

589
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,160
of the nurse novel,
the Bodice ripper,

590
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:45,310
the formulaic detective novel wants just
to sort of exist comfortably in those

591
00:42:45,531 --> 00:42:47,720
worlds,
but a good taxed.

592
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,750
It's perpetually bringing the reader up
short and preventing that comfort zone

593
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,560
from establishing itself.
So that the tension between the,

594
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,311
the,
the,

595
00:42:58,311 --> 00:43:03,280
the tendency on our part to sustain an
illusion and the way in which the rate of

596
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:06,800
the tax keeps undermining
the illusion is again,

597
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:11,660
that aspect of the
psychological excitement of
reading that ease or wants to

598
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:12,530
concentrate on.

599
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:17,180
Now a word about then Tony,

600
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:22,010
the tow truck in this regard.
Um, I brought the text with me.

601
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,370
Uh,
you can look at it now or at your leisure

602
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:31,700
and I wanted to call attention to a
few places in the text in which it is a

603
00:43:31,701 --> 00:43:36,701
question of expectation and of the
way in which this expectation can be

604
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:38,150
violated.
Now,

605
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,860
it's only fair to say that if we're
going to read Tony seriously in this way,

606
00:43:42,861 --> 00:43:45,440
we have to put ourselves
in the shoes of a toddler.

607
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:50,030
That is to say as readers or
auditors, we have to, we, you know,

608
00:43:50,031 --> 00:43:53,870
we have to think of ourselves and
of the psychological excitement of

609
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:57,620
experiencing with text as that
of a toddler. Uh, we, you know,

610
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,670
and it's not so very difficult
to do. For example, um,

611
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,350
I'm Tony if tow truck,

612
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:06,140
I live in the little yellow Varage
I helped cars that has stuck.

613
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,800
I told them to my garage. I
liked my job one day. I am stuck.

614
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,850
Who will help Tony the tow truck.
All right.

615
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Now this is a wonderful example of the
tension between having expectations x

616
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:25,230
with the expectation that someone
will help Tony and being in a state of

617
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:28,910
suspense,
not knowing who it will be.

618
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,290
Now from the adult point of view,

619
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:35,760
this is culinary because we know that
we're in the world of folklore and that in

620
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:37,800
folklore everything happens three times.

621
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:41,550
We know that two vehicles are going
to come along and not help Tony.

622
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,690
And that the third vehicle will,
because everything, as I say, ah,

623
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,480
but happens in threes in folklore.

624
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:53,340
And Notice Tony the tow truck next week
when we read the Russian formalists,

625
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,130
uh, we will, we will learn, uh,

626
00:44:56,131 --> 00:45:01,131
the research finding or one of the early
formulas to the effect that repetition

627
00:45:01,651 --> 00:45:05,000
in verse is analogous to
Tautology in folklore.

628
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:09,480
We have exactly that going on in
Tony the tow truck Tuck, Tuck, Tuck,

629
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,370
and then the three events, Nido, the
car, speed of the car, bumpy, the car,

630
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,383
uh,
you know,

631
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,900
it's coming along and sequence and
bumping finally resolving the problem.

632
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,710
So in any case, we, we,
we have an expectation.

633
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,760
We have the dialectic of suspense.
On the one hand,

634
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:31,360
how will this be resolved
and inevitability on the
other? Oh, it's a folk tale.

635
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,770
It'll be resolved. Don't worry
about it. Uh, uh, and we have,

636
00:45:34,771 --> 00:45:38,730
and we have this suspense, as
I say, between expectation,

637
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:43,530
the possibility of violation
and simply not knowing. Ah,

638
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:47,730
okay. Now, so we continue. I
cannot help you says neato the car.

639
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:51,450
I don't want to get dirty. I cannot help.
You said speed of the car. I am too busy.

640
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:54,900
I am very sad.
Then a little car pulls up.

641
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:58,050
I think it's wonderful because you know,
it's pulls,

642
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:02,400
it pulls up just like God and we're
being pulled up short. And there isn't,

643
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:06,930
it seems to me that there's another
crisis of expectation in this line is that

644
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:11,100
especially as a toddler,
I need to negotiate that expression.

645
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,240
Idiomatically you know,
I'm three years old, maybe.

646
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:18,860
I don't know what pulls up
means, you know, it's a strange,
you know, I mean, it, it,

647
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:23,070
it, it's probably not very good writing
for a toddler precisely for that reason,

648
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,930
but at the same time, you know, it,

649
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:29,940
it lends itself to us because we recognize
that there's a reading problem or a

650
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:35,991
piece of the virtual work that needs to
be overcome before you can get on with

651
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:36,510
it.

652
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:41,510
You have to find out what pulls up means
in the same way that the adult reader

653
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,890
of pleasures of the imagination has to
find out what plastic means. And, uh,

654
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:48,450
and as I say,
it's a,

655
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,800
it's a wonderful irony that
this particular difficulty
in reading is precisely

656
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:56,640
what God, her calls being
pulled up short. All right?

657
00:46:56,641 --> 00:47:00,030
So you solve the problem
and then Lo and behold,

658
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:05,010
it turns out that it is my friend,
bumpy, bumpy, gives me a push.

659
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,710
He pushes and pushes and I'm
on my way. Thank you. Bumpy.

660
00:47:07,711 --> 00:47:09,930
I called that you're welcome.
Says Bumpy.

661
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,390
And now I think we got
another expectation.

662
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:17,490
This is the kind of story that has
a moral, it's a feel good story.

663
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,470
Uh, there is, you know,
something good has happened. Uh,

664
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:26,340
there is this sense of reciprocity is
established between the tow truck, uh,

665
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,390
and the person who helps the tow
truck, uh, out of being stuck, uh,

666
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,490
of,
of a fine sense of reciprocity.

667
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:36,940
So the expectation is that
there will be a moral,

668
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:41,160
the tension or a suspense is
what will the moral be. Yeah.

669
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,190
There are a variety of ways. In
other words, in which this story,

670
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:48,850
just like the rime of the ancient
mariner, good end. I mean, it's not,

671
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:51,700
it's by no means clear that the rime of
the ancient mariner, we'll end budget,

672
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:51,941
you know,

673
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:55,330
love all things great and small things
that could have ended any number of other

674
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:59,260
ways. Uh, and just so this story
could end a number of ways.

675
00:47:59,261 --> 00:48:03,610
It happens to end now that's
what I call a friend. Well, fine,

676
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:08,670
the moral is that reciprocity
is friendship and good all,

677
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:11,750
all to the good. But
as I say, there's that,

678
00:48:11,751 --> 00:48:16,751
there's a moment of suspense
in the expectation at the
point in the text when we

679
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:18,490
expect a moral,

680
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:23,530
but we don't know what the moral
is going to be. So once again,

681
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,400
there's a kind of,

682
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,400
there's that moment of suspense that
the reader is able to get through with a

683
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:35,071
kind of pleasurable excitement and
then overcome as the moral is actually

684
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:40,600
revealed. All right? Now. So even
Tony, the tow truck in other words,

685
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,200
is not absolutely culinary and can be a
and can be treated in ways that I hope

686
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:52,210
shed some light on, uh, the reading
process. All right? Very quickly,

687
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,410
uh,
the time is up.

688
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:58,411
So let me conclude by saying that if
there is this remarkable distinction

689
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:03,220
between God and easier between cannons,

690
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:08,730
where the methodology of God seems to
impose on us a traditional cannon and the

691
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:15,121
methodology of Eser seems to
impose on us and innovative cannon,

692
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:20,380
isn't there some relief
in historicism after all?

693
00:49:20,381 --> 00:49:24,670
Because the whole point of historicism
as got him or herself puts it is that it

694
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:29,510
lets the cannon B,
we're not interested in establishing a,

695
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:34,030
a,
a principle of value that shapes a canon.

696
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:39,130
We're interested in hearing everybody on
his or her own terms and letting those

697
00:49:39,131 --> 00:49:41,110
texts be,
in other words,

698
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,200
doesn't historicism open the cannon and
indeed make the process of reading the

699
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:51,030
experience of reading, archival, uh, and,

700
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:54,700
and omnivorous rather than canonical.
You know,

701
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:59,760
if every text just is what it is and we
can't bring a methodologically speaking

702
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:06,130
any kind of preconception to bear on
what's a good text or what's a bad case,

703
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:11,290
haven't we solved the problem of the
limitation imposed on the reader by any

704
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:14,860
kind of cannon formation?
Well,

705
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,220
only I say in conclusion,

706
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,880
if we can distinguish between meaning
and significance. In other words,

707
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:27,090
only if we really are sure that the
historicist act of is effective and works.

708
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,940
If I know the meaning of a
text, well fine. Then later on,

709
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:39,380
if I wish I can establish a Canon
by saying certain texts have certain

710
00:50:39,381 --> 00:50:42,770
significance and those are the texts
that I care about and water rate.

711
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,800
But I can only do that if I can
distinguish between meaning and cigarette.

712
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:50,690
But if meaning and significance
bleed into each other, what I'm in,

713
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,050
what I'm going to be doing is
establishing a canon as it were,

714
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,380
unconsciously or 70 consciously,
I'm going to say, oh,

715
00:50:57,381 --> 00:51:00,560
this is just what the text means.
But at the same time,

716
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:05,360
I'll be finding ways without realizing it,
of affirming certain kinds of meaning,

717
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:10,340
uh, and discrediting certain other kinds
of meaning. Um, all the while saying,

718
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:14,990
oh, it's just meaning I'm not, I'm, I'm
not doing that. Uh, and that would if,

719
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:19,310
but if in fact my reading practice can
be shown not clearly to distinguish

720
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:23,930
between meaning and significance,
well then that's what would happen.

721
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:24,530
Uh,

722
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:29,530
so it's still up in the air and it's
still perhaps in escapable that we read as

723
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:31,310
it were.
Canonically uh,

724
00:51:31,311 --> 00:51:36,311
but I think what is shown by thinking
of various approaches to hermeneutics in

725
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,664
these terms,

726
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,760
I think what's shown is that there is
a relationship between methodology and

727
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:46,400
Canon formation that
certain things follow, uh,

728
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:50,570
from our assumptions about how to read,
uh,

729
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,970
evaluation,
uh,

730
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:57,080
would seem rather at a distant remove
from simple considerations of how to read.

731
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:02,960
But in fact, I think we've shown that
evaluation is in one way or another,

732
00:52:02,961 --> 00:52:07,961
implicit in certain
methodological premises as they
establish themselves in the

733
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:12,230
work of these various writers.
Okay. Thank you very much.
