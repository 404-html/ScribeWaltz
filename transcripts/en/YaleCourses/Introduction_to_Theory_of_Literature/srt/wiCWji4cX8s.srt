1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,390
I'm not sure how long this
lecture is going to be.

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,350
We could be finished in 10
minutes though. I doubt that. Um,

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,790
and if we're not finished
at the end of the 50, um,

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,150
there is some things that I've reserved
for the end of the lecture that I

5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,270
definitely do want to get said.
I don't know if you've noticed.

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,790
There are times when,
uh,

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,580
the last point or two that I appeared
to have been preparing to make,

8
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:28,950
never did get made,
but in this case,

9
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:33,951
I want to make sure that they are
made so that if I don't finish today,

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,570
uh, or if I still have a
point of tooth to make,

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,190
I'll definitely be taking up those points
at the beginning of Thursday's lecture.

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,290
All right, now, um,

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,770
the African American tradition of literary
production is rich and longstanding

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,760
as Henry Louis Gates tells
you, uh, the first, uh,

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,400
really rather important poet and the
tradition Phillis Wheatley is, uh, a,

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,540
an American colonial writer.
Uh,

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,720
the flourishing of the slave narrative
form begins in the 18th century,

18
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:12,210
continues into the 19th,
uh,

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,010
in the 19th century witnesses, uh,
extraordinary works of fiction.

20
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,750
And in the 20th century, of course, most
conspicuously in the Harlem Renaissance,

21
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:23,650
but throughout the century,
uh,

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,700
there has been a extraordinary work
done in the African American literary

23
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:32,580
tradition. It's a very rich
tradition. In other words, uh,

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,640
somewhat in contrast with the very
rich but also very recent tradition of

25
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:42,450
African American literary
theory and criticism,

26
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,750
it's possible to argue that
the development of theory
and criticism in this

27
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:52,791
tradition was somewhat
barked by a preliminary way
in which it found itself at

28
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,450
odds with itself.
Um,

29
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,820
black criticism and black feminist
criticism from the beginning saw that they

30
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,550
didn't have quite the same agenda.

31
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,720
This is something that can
resonate perhaps later in
this lecture when we moved

32
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:14,550
to other topics. Uh, but in the
meantime, critics like Barbara Christian,

33
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,670
Barbara Smith, Debra
McDowell, Hazel Carby,

34
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,110
bell hooks were in there
a variety of ways, uh,

35
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,070
working with emphases that, uh, other, uh,

36
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,300
and sort of typically male, uh,
African American critics, uh,

37
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:34,710
weren't quite comfortable with.
And so while a work,

38
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,660
especially beginning in the 80s, a
proliferated there was, as I say,

39
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:41,640
a kind of internal divide,

40
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,960
which has been a complex matter
to negotiate and which, uh,

41
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:50,961
is I think now largely a sort
of detente has been achieved.

42
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,640
Uh, and, uh,

43
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:58,320
African American literary theory is
moving forward unfettered any longer by

44
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:02,860
these concerns or at least, uh,
by any excess of these concerns.

45
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,000
But in the meantime,

46
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,560
that may partly account for a certain
delay and the emergence of theory and

47
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:11,700
criticism, uh, given the, uh, uh,

48
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,760
sort of longstanding richness
of the literary tradition.

49
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,330
Now the role of Henry Louis Gates in a
African American criticism is it seems to

50
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:23,650
me a exemplary,

51
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:27,190
although there are some rather harsh
moments in this essay moments that I,

52
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:31,480
that I, I wished to take up,
uh, that would suggest, uh,

53
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,370
an element of what shall I
say, extremism or overkill, uh,

54
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,293
in,
uh,

55
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,300
gates is thinking this is actually
not at all the persona that he has,

56
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,840
uh, projected. Uh, and indeed. Um,

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,740
what's extraordinary about
gates? Who's, who's, uh, uh,

58
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,720
administrative power, whose, whose
abilities as a program builder,

59
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:57,910
as we say,
are remarkable.

60
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,820
After he left Yale to go to Harvard,

61
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:04,480
he was able to gather to Harvard,
Anthony Appear,

62
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,120
Cornell West and others, uh, who
have since departed from Harvard. Um,

63
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,900
but gates is in a way an empire
unto himself. And, uh, he,

64
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:17,710
he has been an extraordinary figure.
The earliest work,

65
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:20,500
which is actually among
the earliest work is,

66
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:22,990
is what you've been reading for today.
Uh,

67
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,100
established his reputation
together with, um, a, the,

68
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:32,101
his discovery of not so much discovery
of but authentication of a manuscript by

69
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:37,780
Harriet Wilson, which he published
an important contribution,

70
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,470
uh, to 19th century, uh, uh, our,

71
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:45,640
our knowledge of 19th century
African American literature. Uh,

72
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,630
in any case, uh, what
happened then was that gates,

73
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,180
who's who by some miracle or an or other,

74
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:54,340
he was a perfectly good
writer in the first place,

75
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,280
but gradually became a marvelous writer,

76
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,800
began writing for the New Yorker,

77
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,570
and during this phase of
his, uh, of his career when,

78
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,620
among other things,

79
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:10,360
he produced a remarkable autobiography
about growing up in West Virginia.

80
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,370
Um,
during this phase,

81
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,940
Gates really became a
spokesperson for a detente among,

82
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,620
uh, races and racial
factions. In other words, uh,

83
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,660
he was a voice of moderation without
incurring any amputation of Uncle Tom Ism

84
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:35,440
or anything of the sort. Uh, his very,

85
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,150
his sheer urbanity as the
remarkable writer that he is,

86
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,870
uh, in those years when he
wrote under Tina Brown, uh,

87
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,640
for the New Yorker, uh, it was just a
remarkable achievement and his career, uh,

88
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,510
is still,

89
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:55,510
is still going strong now for gates as
for Elaine Showalter last week and for

90
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:00,590
Wolf before her,
uh,

91
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,810
the problems surrounding the,

92
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,900
the concept of identity
possessed identity, uh,

93
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,750
which of course is, um, uh,

94
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:16,751
an important anchor for the thinking of
people who feel the need for voices for

95
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,390
a place,
uh,

96
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,650
in the literary and cultural
horizon is nevertheless,

97
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,710
at least potentially as we've begun
to notice already a kind of quicksand.

98
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,670
Um, the problem that there are two
problems really that dog, uh, I,

99
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,920
the, the issue of identity. One of
them is the problem of essentializing,

100
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:43,220
which I'll take up now and
then as I'll take it up next.

101
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,490
Also the problem of what might
be called the identity queue. Uh,

102
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,020
in other words, I am a, um, a lower class,

103
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,680
a black lesbian feminist who's,
uh,

104
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,760
who's a nation is Palestine.
Uh,

105
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,620
needless to say, I have a variety
of identity options to choose from.

106
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,030
Uh, but the result is the result is
I've got to figure out which of them has

107
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,530
priority.
In other words,

108
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:13,430
which of those identities do I suppose is,

109
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,910
has the underlying,
uh,

110
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,360
integrity and essence,
sensuality,

111
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,980
uh, that can motivate, um, as it were,

112
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,460
the characteristics of
my other identities, uh,

113
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,230
at which are therefore somehow or another
placed, uh, further down the cute.

114
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,580
Uh, so this, uh, is, is, is a topic
that I'll come back to in a minute,

115
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,080
but in the meantime,

116
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,670
the problem of essentializing
as we say a as we call it,

117
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,970
um, for example, uh, uh,

118
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:51,971
as gates describes it on page 1893 in
the right hand column where he's very

119
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:58,031
clear on the dangers of ascribing whether
positively or negatively attributes to

120
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:07,100
any group that is constituted as,
or thought of.

121
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,851
Because of course,

122
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:12,851
the notion of race and whether there
is race is in itself according to gates

123
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:17,830
problematic. Um, the problem
of ascribing attributes, uh,

124
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,420
even unethically,
uh,

125
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:24,920
to erase race as he
describes it on page 1893,

126
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,390
the sense, the sense of difference
defined in popular usages.

127
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,740
Finally, finally, my voice is
changing. Uh, the set, the,

128
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:42,910
the sense of difference defined in popular
usages of the term race has been used

129
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:48,530
both to describe an inscribed
differences of language,

130
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,170
belief system,
artistic tradition,

131
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,590
gene pool and all sorts of supposedly
natural attributes such as rhythm,

132
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,270
athletic ability,
cerebration,

133
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,750
usury and fidelity and other words,

134
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:08,751
obviously a portioning out stereotypes
to the various groups that may come

135
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:12,030
forward as candidates to be racist.

136
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,250
And pointing out that all of these
stereotypes do nobody very much.

137
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,000
Good. Um, so the problem
of essential Ising which,

138
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:26,030
which under girds they wish to make
manifest the existence of race because,

139
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,400
because, think about
it. On the other hand,

140
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,860
Gates seems to be divided
in the beginning of,

141
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:39,861
as of his essay between a certain
candor about race as in the work of

142
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,150
[inaudible] 10 that he
describes in which race, uh,

143
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,270
[inaudible] a and cultural moment are
considered the key determining issues of

144
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,390
any kind of artistic or cultural
production. He says, well,

145
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:59,070
at least race is being talked about
while at the same time obviously wincing

146
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:04,071
away from the implications of race and
from the belief that there is such a

147
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:08,590
thing as rice, which goes all the way
back to Montesquieu and others, uh,

148
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,410
in 10.
Nevertheless,

149
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,550
he's rather cheerful about the fact that
at least race is being discussed unlike

150
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,680
the 20th century when the whole thing
is swept under the rug. Uh, and, uh,

151
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:24,681
kind of birth sites and hypocritical
politeness prevents anybody from talking

152
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:27,930
about such categories at all.
Uh,

153
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:32,430
and gives rise to the idea that we
all exist in the same great tradition.

154
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,050
Uh, that work either belongs to that
tradition or if it for some reason seems

155
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:39,120
egregious or outside the tradition,

156
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,120
it just can be shoved aside and neglected.

157
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,890
That's the supposition of the 20th
Century When folks don't talk about race.

158
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,630
And so, you know, the very
questioned whether it is an issue,

159
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,260
uh, is part of this
problem that is dogged, uh,

160
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:01,080
by the more complicated, uh, the
issue of a centralized for example,

161
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,220
suppose as, and of course you've
been reading about this and in,

162
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,450
in show Walter as well,

163
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,510
suppose you ascribe positive value
to what another person might call a

164
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:16,710
stereotype. This is
what, uh, the, uh, the,

165
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,770
the important a francophone African poets
Song Gar does a as gates says at the

166
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:27,690
top of page 1901 the right
hand column Gates says,

167
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:32,691
when we attempt to appropriate by
inversion race as a term for an essence,

168
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,160
as did the negritude movement,
for example,

169
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:43,190
we feel therefore we are a song Gar
argued of the African we yield too much,

170
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,000
such as the basis of a shared humanity.

171
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Such gestures as Anthony of
Pia has observed are futile
and dangerous because of

172
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:58,990
their further inscription of
new and bizarre stereotypes.

173
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,080
So you can see there are a lot of land
mines to be avoided and negotiating the

174
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,460
discourse of race. Uh, and certainly, uh,

175
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:13,630
certainly gates is aware of them.
Now,

176
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,580
there's also the problem,
as I say,

177
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:20,581
of the identity Q and Gates himself
may have a little difficulty with this,

178
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:25,420
at least from time to time because
as I said at the beginning,

179
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:30,570
he does have this sort of uneasy detente
with feminism in the African American,

180
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,660
uh, critical tradition, uh, still
to work within. And so exact,

181
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:41,830
for example, on page 1894, um, uh,

182
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,950
somewhat problematic passage in
which the identity queue, uh,

183
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,970
seems to be at issue about a third
of the way down the left hand column,

184
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,923
he says,

185
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,080
the sanction of biology contained
in sexual difference simply put,

186
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,370
does not,

187
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,520
and can never obtain when one is
speaking of racial difference.

188
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,370
Yet,

189
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,370
we carelessly used language in such a
way as to will this sense of natural

190
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:15,100
difference into our formulations.

191
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,160
So what he's saying is in biological term,

192
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:22,660
there's definitely a difference between
the sexes, but in biological terms, uh,

193
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,400
there is not necessarily a
difference among, uh, the, uh,

194
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:30,610
so called primary races.
So that,

195
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,850
so that at least when one speaks of
women and men in the feminist tradition,

196
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,180
one has to come face to face with it,

197
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,540
with the problem of actual difference.
Whereas one,

198
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:51,541
one speaks of black and white in the
traditions of discourse about race.

199
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,800
One isn't actually talking about a
genuine difference at all and their

200
00:13:56,801 --> 00:14:00,190
[inaudible] and the
therefore, uh, the, uh,

201
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,250
the discourse with the greater integrity
of the two as the one which is about

202
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,750
differences that are absolutely a femoral
as opposed to the one which is about

203
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:11,351
differences,

204
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:15,460
which whatever one thinks of them and
whatever one wants to make out of them are

205
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,300
nevertheless essential. Now, plainly,

206
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,840
when we go back to feminist criticism,
particularly the,

207
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:26,560
the gender theory of Judith Butler,
we'll see of course,

208
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:31,090
that the whole question of the
biological basis of sex, uh,

209
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:35,780
the biological, uh, difference
between the sexes, uh,

210
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,950
which essential AISES.
Uh,

211
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,440
what we will be wanting to
talk about is of course,

212
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,070
something that is profoundly in question
and not just because of so-called

213
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,830
transgender transgender issues,
but also at the same time,

214
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,720
uh, because of the way in which, uh,

215
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,780
are very sexual identity is something
which according to Butler we construct.

216
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,110
And so there is,
um,

217
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,670
an insistence here on biological
difference between these two forms of

218
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,410
discussing identity,

219
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,500
which may or may not seem
to us to be problematic.

220
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,150
Now, I think this is the point at
which we can see the importance,

221
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,900
uh,

222
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,900
the extraordinary essay that I've also
asked you to read by Tony Morrison.

223
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,940
You know,
her best of course as a novelist,

224
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,890
but she's also a distinguished critic
as she has been a distinguished editor,

225
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,390
uh, of, of, of, of other
important work. Um,

226
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,610
and here,
uh,

227
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:44,650
it seems to me that her reflections in
some ways give us a sideways exit from

228
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:51,140
the predicaments that I've been talking
about. The problem of, of essential ism,

229
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,320
the problem of the identity queue
because what Morrison wants to say,

230
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,500
and I think she borrows a
here particularly from the
famous discussion of the

231
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:07,970
master slave dialectic in
Hegel's phenomenology of mine.

232
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,630
What Morrison wants to
say is that it's not,

233
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,870
is that identity isn't so much
a question of what something is,

234
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,480
but rather a question of what it is not.

235
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,750
She says it's not that we should be so
much preoccupied with what it is to be

236
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:27,134
black,

237
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,360
but rather as we think
about the way in which, uh,

238
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,200
being black is inscribed
within the white tradition.

239
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,970
As we think about that,

240
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:43,030
we need to think about
what white is not at about.

241
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:48,200
In other words, as she says
repeatedly about black as absence,

242
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,310
as negation, as negativity. And that we,

243
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,150
and we have to understand the absolute,
and this is where,

244
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,890
this is where she drives her argument
from the master slave dialectic, uh,

245
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:06,070
the absolute necessity in the construction
of white identity for there to be as

246
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:11,330
an absence,

247
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,800
as a lack a over against white identity,

248
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,820
the existence of the African American.

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And more particularly for the better part
of the American cultural tradition of

250
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,290
the slave. Uh, let me quote then, uh,

251
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,300
from her essay on page 1795,

252
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,240
the left hand column where she says,

253
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,610
construction of black,

254
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:42,611
this is third of the way down construction
of blackness and enslavement could be

255
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:44,510
found not only the,

256
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:49,511
not in that construction of blackness
and enslavement could be found not only

257
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,020
the, not free, but also the
projection of the not me.

258
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,260
The result was a playground
for the imagination.

259
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,560
What rose up out of collective needs
to la internal fears and rationalize

260
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,370
external exploitation
was an African Islam,

261
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,060
a fabricated brew of darkness,
otherness,

262
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,050
alarm and desire that
is uniquely American.

263
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,460
And then she points out that although
her subject is the American tradition,

264
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:25,461
there also exist to European Africanism
with its counterpart in its own colonial

265
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,620
literature. Um, to reinforce this,

266
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,730
she takes a remarkable example,
which must've reminded you those,

267
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,840
those of you who know Faulkner of
Thomas Satanic at least reminded,

268
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,990
reminded you in some ways of Thomas
Sut pen of this character Dunbar,

269
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,230
uh, who actually rose up not
so much out of the swamp.

270
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:50,220
Has Out of the Scottish enlightenment
and came to the United States.

271
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,260
And according to Bernard Bailyn,

272
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:55,860
the historian from whom she
takes this information, um, uh,

273
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,670
who became a transformed character.
Um,

274
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,430
I won't quote to the long passage from
Baylands tax too, which makes what, uh,

275
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,570
Morrison wants to take from it clear,

276
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,390
but rather from what Morrison
summarizes of it. Uh,

277
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,240
on page 1796,

278
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:17,241
the top of the right hand column I take
says Morrison William Dunbar to be a

279
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:23,871
succinct portrait of the process by which
the American as new white and male was

280
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:26,790
constituted.

281
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,410
It is a formation that has
several attractive consequences,

282
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,470
all of which are referred to in Balan
summation of Dunbar's character and

283
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:41,040
located in how Dunbar fields
within himself a power,

284
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,760
a sense of freedom he
had not known before.

285
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,490
This is uncannily parallel,
by the way, to the rational,

286
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,480
the rationalization for
slaves in Greek culture.

287
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,170
The way the Greeks always said that
the reason they had slaves with so they

288
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:57,280
could be free, in other words, uh,

289
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,160
so that the home or ruling
population could, was liberated. Uh,

290
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:06,660
in the case of the Greeks from a
performing the daily necessities of,

291
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:11,100
uh, that our life sustaining and
keep us going. Uh, in other words,

292
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,660
to be free,
uh,

293
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,670
according to the citizen of the Greek
Polis is to be free from work. Now,

294
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:18,690
in a certain way,

295
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,750
this is still a rationalization
that Toni Morrison sees in,

296
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,550
uh,
the American slave owning tradition.

297
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:31,440
But it's not so much in the case of
this Dunbar of freedom from work.

298
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,041
It's,

299
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:37,041
it's the case of a more broad
and insidious idea of freedom,

300
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,530
freedom from responsibility,
freedom from the need, uh,

301
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,600
to acknowledge otherness as human
freedom and other words from the sorts of

302
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:53,611
confront constraint imposed by all world
civility in Scotland and in London,

303
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:00,460
uh, freedom on this
frontier, in this wilderness,

304
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:04,690
in this swamp,
simply to be whatever one wants to be.

305
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:09,810
And that freedom is a achieved
on the backs of the black slave.

306
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,590
It is, uh, in some ways, similar,
as I say, to the rationalization,

307
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,230
rationalization for
first slavery in grace.

308
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,060
But it is in a way more insidious,
uh,

309
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:25,960
and certainly more,
uh,

310
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:30,700
in the terms that Morrison's giving it
to us and more dialectical that is to say

311
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:35,701
it is that the question whether a
person could become white without the

312
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:43,780
availability of a black
absence of a, of, of that,

313
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:48,781
which a of that which can be
oppressed like a kind of like,

314
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:53,200
like it like a kind of a spring,
uh, for the Jack in the box,

315
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:57,860
which allows the White Jack in the
box to leap out of the box, uh,

316
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,820
because of that, which is suppressed
down below all of that. Uh,

317
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,870
as part of Toni Morrison's concern at,

318
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,540
at colors her, well,
certainly controversial, uh,

319
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:15,400
reading of huckleberry Finn, which
nevertheless it seems to me, uh, has,

320
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,180
uh, a quite profound interest. Now, uh,

321
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:24,210
my own first instinct when when people
single out huckleberry Finn as to wince

322
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:29,080
away because, uh, it's an
extraordinary novel. Um,

323
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:33,820
the controversy about it, uh, in the
school districts which made it, um,

324
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,620
banished book, uh, had mainly
to do with the n word, uh,

325
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:43,330
to which we'll return the question
who has the right to use the n word,

326
00:22:43,331 --> 00:22:47,920
which is not an easy question
to answer as we'll see. Um,

327
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,780
but that controversy while it had a,
an authentic basis,

328
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,610
uh,
seeing was nevertheless,

329
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:59,470
certainly in literary terms and in terms
of the imagination, uh, perhaps, um,

330
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,690
perhaps rather limited.
Uh,

331
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Morrison gives rise to another equally
and intensely critical way of thinking

332
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:09,400
about huckleberry Finn.

333
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,170
She argues that to liberate gym,

334
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,550
which of course is the tremendous
failure at the end of the novel,

335
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,390
a failure of imagination
on the part of Tom Sawyer,

336
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:27,550
a failure of a will or independence of
mind on the part of huck himself that the

337
00:23:29,771 --> 00:23:33,640
failure to liberate gym, which would
have been the easiest thing in the world.

338
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:35,680
All they had to do was point,
was point out.

339
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:39,160
The right fork in the river is a,

340
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:44,220
is an absolute necessity for the ongoing
self definition of whiteness as it's

341
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:52,070
available both to hop to Tom and to huck.
And after all,

342
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:54,740
by implication to mark Twain himself,

343
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,430
he couldn't figure out how to
end the novel. He wrote it, uh,

344
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,390
it lay on his desk for a long time because
he just couldn't figure out what to

345
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:06,500
do with it. And he finally comes
up with this as we all agree,

346
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,700
a polling ending.

347
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,840
Toni Morrison says it's the
only of ending available.

348
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:16,970
It's the only ending available
because in ways that the, uh, as she,

349
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,750
as she sees it
sentimentality of the novel,

350
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,640
the sentimentality of the relationship
between hock and, uh, uh, Jim,

351
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:30,350
which is so strong that it caused another
critic named Leslie Fiedler to talk

352
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:34,670
about, uh, uh, um, homoerotic
relation between them. The, the,

353
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:39,290
the title of Fiedler's famous essay
has come up on Duran huck honey. Uh,

354
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:44,060
you know, with all w w w with
all that in the background, uh,

355
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,440
Toni Morrison says,

356
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:50,441
the basic structure of consciousness
in Twain's novel is obscured a basic

357
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:53,090
structure,

358
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,950
which makes it absolutely
imperative that Jim not be free.

359
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,870
If Jim has freed,

360
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,580
then there is no other
over against twitch.

361
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,220
Whiteness can define itself.

362
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,840
That's the way in which she makes
use of the general argument about the

363
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:14,610
traditions of American
literature and culture, uh,

364
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,580
in applying it to huckleberry
Finn. All right, let's go back to,

365
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,860
uh, skip gates. Oh, sorry.
Henry Louis Gates. Sorry. Wait.

366
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,250
And another person who was at
Yale and whom I knew very well.

367
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:33,020
I actually had little bit to do with the
origin of the notion of the signifying

368
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:37,850
monkey. Uh, I'll come back to that later.
Barbara Johnson also now at Harvard. Um,

369
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:42,800
and I, uh, had a lot of conversations
with skip at that period, uh,

370
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:47,780
about this. And so it's not that
I feel proprietary, it skips idea.

371
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:52,820
Um, but I, you know, I was in on
that. Um, and so, uh, and, and so,

372
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,920
um, I, it's not just
name dropping. I get to,

373
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,260
I get to call him by what his friends
caught. So, so in any case it is, however,

374
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:04,700
I'll try to remember to say
Henry Louis Gates. Um, and, uh,

375
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:07,310
in any case to return to him.
Um,

376
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,640
I want to talk a little bit about
simply in the before moving on to this,

377
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:16,760
to this crucial central issue.
I want to talk a little bit, uh,

378
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,280
simply about his understanding
and the other staff,

379
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,790
the understanding of other African
American tradition, a critics,

380
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:27,910
both of the critical tradition
and of the literary tradition.

381
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:28,994
First of all,

382
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,280
the grasp of the critical tradition
as basically a two step or two part

383
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:38,990
progression is something that he shares
with Elaine Showalter from last time.

384
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,770
You remember, Joe Walters says
that the important movement of,

385
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,610
um,

386
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:49,610
of feminists interventions in literary
criticism begins with the moment that she

387
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:54,290
calls feminists. That is to say
the moment of Kate Millet, uh,

388
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,850
and other authors who talk
about the degradation, uh,

389
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:02,010
and unfair treatment
of women in male books.

390
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,110
And then what Showalter perverse
and suppose as to have super,

391
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,400
to have to have, uh, uh,
uh, uh, supervened, uh,

392
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:15,930
and to have become more important
gyno critical, uh, criticism,

393
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,820
which as women's appropriation of
literary traditions for themselves,

394
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,350
uh, the, uh,

395
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:27,240
the archival work that makes
the Canon of women's literature,

396
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:31,110
not just, uh, leaping from
great name to great name,

397
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:36,230
but an actual unfolding and continuous
development from decade to decade as show

398
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:41,040
Walter puts it. Um, now
gates on page 1896, uh,

399
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:45,190
the right hand margin sees
it in much the same way, uh,

400
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,290
for the development of African American.
Because you can do two things.

401
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:52,980
Basically says gates. He doesn't put
them chronologically, but you could see,

402
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,530
you could,
you could map onto what he's saying here,

403
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,750
the same chronological sequence.

404
00:27:57,751 --> 00:28:02,751
He says what I mean by citing these to
overwork terms he's talking about the

405
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,020
other in particular,
uh, is precisely this.

406
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:10,050
How blacks are figures in literature.

407
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:14,790
That is to say how they're represented
in literature demeaningly even perhaps

408
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,903
terrifically,

409
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,960
how blacks are figured in literature
and also how blacks figure as it were,

410
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,350
literature of their own making.
You can see, in other words,

411
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:30,351
the same movement and his thinking
about these issues now as show,

412
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:35,460
alter argued the question or the
literary tradition is more complicated.

413
00:28:35,461 --> 00:28:38,040
It has more steps. The, in other words,

414
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:43,041
the powers of self expression available
to women from the beginning of their,

415
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,440
uh, creative expression, um,

416
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,170
pass through more than just two stages.

417
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:53,340
And the same thing is true of
African American literature.

418
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,090
Now I think that,
uh,

419
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,820
Gates simply takes for granted
as an implicit premise. Uh,

420
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:03,380
the work that was done the
year before he published, uh,

421
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,320
this essay in critical inquiry,
uh,

422
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,890
by another colleague of ours here at
Yale who died tragically not too long

423
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:13,080
thereafter named Michael Cook,

424
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,320
who in 1984 wrote a book called African
American Literature in the 20th century.

425
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:25,010
The achievement of intimacy
and cook argued in his book
that the history of Afro

426
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,900
African American literature passes
essentially through four stages.

427
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,990
It begins with what Cook
Calls Self veiling, uh,

428
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,980
the period in other words in which
people attempting for the first time, uh,

429
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,800
uh, two, right. And of course, gates
talks about the way in which, uh,

430
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:49,480
writing is really writing
oneself into the human community.

431
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,160
Uh,
for black people,

432
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:55,360
the people who first attempted
to write used white models,

433
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:00,310
Phillis Wheatley, the poet whom
gates talks about a remarkable poet.

434
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,160
And a very interesting one,
nevertheless wrote, uh,

435
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,320
in the manner of Alexander Pope.

436
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,280
So much so that a great deal of
her work is almost impossible,

437
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,040
which is of course, as
you know, point of praise,

438
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,990
almost impossible to distinguish
from that of Alice Alexander Pope.

439
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:21,430
So she is an instance of
the first phase, uh, which,

440
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:25,630
which cook calls self veiling.
Second Phase, which cook calls.

441
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:30,010
Solitude involves continuing
to use white models,

442
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:34,810
a white pro style, uh, uh,
way of, uh, of narrating,

443
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,650
um, which is obviously derived from, uh,

444
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,360
white teachers and white models,

445
00:30:40,361 --> 00:30:45,361
but which nevertheless involves as its
central theme self-definition here.

446
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:49,140
Uh, you might want to
think of Douglas, uh,

447
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,470
and of slave narratives in
general where the emphasis is,

448
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,220
where the emphasis is on
being taught by white people,

449
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:02,170
but nevertheless, the tension
which never w which exists, uh,

450
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:04,240
and which founds,
uh,

451
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:08,830
and governs the possibility of
self liberation and self freedom.

452
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,870
In other words, uh, the slave
narrative, uh, as an ongoing form,

453
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,670
uh, partakes of, uh,

454
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:19,990
this second phase in the development
of African American literature is cook

455
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:24,140
understands it. Thirdly, there's
what cook calls kinship, uh,

456
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,360
a literature in which African
Americans reach out to each other,

457
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:33,361
identify themselves as a community and
not as individuals struggling to be free,

458
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,670
but rather as a community.

459
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:41,890
And Cook identifies this phase with
the experimentation with dialect,

460
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,260
uh, and uh, the A and a way of, of, of,

461
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,910
of, of narrating and poets
[inaudible], uh, which is which, which,

462
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,280
which involves a self
conscious, uh, uh, uh,

463
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,990
insistence on verbal and
linguistic difference.

464
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,570
You can think of many of the poems,
for example,

465
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,720
of Langston Hughes in this regard and
have a great deal else that goes on in the

466
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,340
Harlem Renaissance. So that's the third
phase kinship. And then the last phase,

467
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:16,300
and what I'm going to want to say is that
gates doesn't think we've reached this.

468
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,530
Uh,
in other words,

469
00:32:17,531 --> 00:32:22,120
the point of disagreement between Cook
and Gates is precisely about this.

470
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:27,270
The last phase which cook calls intimacy
is the freedom to expropriate any and

471
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:33,610
all models, not in other words, to
insist necessarily on one's own,

472
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,540
uh, uh, on, on one's own
creative paradigms, uh,

473
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,770
as a racial tradition,
uh,

474
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,830
to expropriate anything that comes
ready to hand Ellison's invisible man,

475
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:49,500
for example, as a masterpiece
of high modernism. Uh, it, it,

476
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,010
it takes freely,
in other words,

477
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,270
from whatever traditions
si come, come to hand, uh,

478
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:00,920
and are most readily available for the
kind of work that Ellison wants to do.

479
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:05,690
A cook identifies this perhaps rather
optimistically with what he calls

480
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,340
intimacy.
In other words,

481
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:12,460
a merger of finally achieved
merger of traditions such that,

482
00:33:12,861 --> 00:33:17,330
and this is plainly the ideal
of Virginia Wolfe as well,

483
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,360
such then one such that one no longer
has to write as a spokesperson.

484
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:28,250
One no longer needs to be concerned,
uh, for Thema [inaudible].

485
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,000
Uh,

486
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
the kinds of identity that out of which
one writing one's writing has arisen.

487
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,750
One can write just anything one
wants to, uh, in other words, a,

488
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:43,040
the Utopian vision of no matter who I am,
uh,

489
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:47,690
having access to absolutely
any forms, uh, and themes,

490
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:52,550
uh, I care to work with. That
is the vision of Michael Cook,

491
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:53,750
which gates,
um,

492
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,960
I think unfortunately rightly feels
that we haven't quite arrived at.

493
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,280
And that's why,
um,

494
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:06,310
I deliberately use the word expropriate
in talking about Cook's fourth phase.

495
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,520
If I use models other than models
made available by my own tradition,

496
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,200
I'm not just kind of
pulling them out of the air.

497
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,980
I'm using them with a calculated purpose.

498
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,630
I always have something in mind and
choosing the model that I choose.

499
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,480
Uh, we're, we're not, you know, we're,

500
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:34,481
we're not really quite at intimacy
because self definition is still at issue.

501
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,890
You can talk about the high modernism
of the invisible man, all you like.

502
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,270
But think of what the
invisible man is a bout.

503
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,870
The invisible man is still about what it
means to be black. You know, what is it?

504
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,920
I said, what is passing? Uh,
what does it, what does it mean?

505
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,840
In other words, uh, to have, um,

506
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,810
this racial identity so
that, yeah, traditions, uh,

507
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,950
US manners styles have been,
uh, have been expropriated,

508
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,600
but at the same time,

509
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:10,660
the business of writing avid as an African
American continues and it is as much

510
00:35:13,221 --> 00:35:17,180
after all a question of self definition,
uh,

511
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:22,330
as it has been hither too. So
that as, as Gates sees it, uh,

512
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:27,290
is, is, continues to be the
issue. We use other models.

513
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,320
We need to make them our own.

514
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,240
Otherwise we're just colonized by them.
And after all,

515
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,410
we're back in phase one.
Right?

516
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,740
We're back in self
veiling because after all,

517
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:43,340
Phillis Wheatley used other models.
Phyllis,

518
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:48,530
Phyllis Wheatley actually aspire to
the idea that she was just deport.

519
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,310
She could write about anything.

520
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:54,450
She wanted to write about the tears of
Nivea and the painting by Richard Wilson,

521
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,650
whatever it might be. She could
write about it. Uh, because, um,

522
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,120
she was just a poet.

523
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:05,220
That was her great aspiration was to be,
was to be received,

524
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:09,660
not as, uh, you know,
that amazing thing. Uh,

525
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,830
a young black slave woman who could write,

526
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:19,410
she wasn't interested in that. She wanted
to be a poet. And so in a certain sense,

527
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,580
you can see the problem

528
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:27,090
if intimacy as achieved in
the fourth pays fourth phase,

529
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,260
well then that's finally
just the realization of what
Phyllis Wheatley wanted in

530
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:35,250
the first phase. And,
uh, we have to admit, uh,

531
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,880
for all of the complicated reasons
that these critics go into,

532
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
that this is not a moment which can
be said yet to have been achieved.

533
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:48,090
Okay. Now this brings us
to gates is key concept.

534
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:53,210
What does it mean and what is the
advantage of x two to expropriate,

535
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:58,470
uh, uh, other people's
traditions? Eh, more particularly,

536
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,480
uh, the white tradition. And here, uh,

537
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:05,790
gates is after all thinking
primarily about criticism.

538
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,970
How can we do theory and criticism
in the White Man's language?

539
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:19,250
How can we appropriate
expropriate for ourselves?

540
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:25,310
The white man's language and the
necessity of bending language to one's own

541
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:31,911
purposes is what is emphasized in the
remarkable epigraph on page 1891 that

542
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:37,470
gates takes from [inaudible]. Uh, this is,

543
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:41,370
it seems to me as central a
passage in Bakhtin by the way,

544
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:45,210
as anything that we studied when
we were actually reading Bactine.

545
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,580
And I'd like you to make note of it,
uh,

546
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:51,730
because I think it really can
eliminate a great deal, uh,

547
00:37:51,731 --> 00:37:54,270
that's going on in Bactine that we didn't,
uh,

548
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,140
perhaps fully articulate at the time.
This is what buck teen says,

549
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:03,890
language for the individual consciousness
lies on the borderline between oneself

550
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,023
and the other.

551
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,480
The word in language is half someone
else's to become one's own only when it

552
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:15,030
becomes one's own.

553
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,320
Only when the speaker populates
it with his own intention,

554
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,530
his own accent.
And you can,

555
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,340
you can hear gates wanting to
emphasize that word, accent,

556
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,090
his own accent when he
appropriates the word,

557
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:35,130
adapting it to his own semantic
and expressive intention.

558
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,320
Prior to this moment of appropriation,

559
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:43,270
the word does not exist in a
neutral and impersonal language.

560
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:48,040
It is not after all out of a dictionary
that the speaker gets his words.

561
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,840
You know how true,
how true it is.

562
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:54,520
Not after all out of a dictionary
that the speaker gets his words,

563
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,090
but rather it exists in
other people's mouths,

564
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:03,250
in other people's contexts,
serving other people's intentions.

565
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:08,430
It is from there that one must take
the word and make it one's own.

566
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:14,340
Now actually, during the course
of his essay, uh, uh, uh,

567
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:19,330
gates echoes the sentiment of
Bactine by quoting dairy. Dot.

568
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:24,331
At the very top of the right hand
column on page 1901 where he says,

569
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,310
uh,
we must master as Derrida wrote,

570
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:32,490
how to speak the other's language
without renouncing our own.

571
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,770
Now how do you do this?
What does,

572
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:40,771
how do you set about taking
the language you are given?

573
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,160
And this isn't of course, just a question
of the difference between the races.

574
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:49,550
It's a question of all of us in relation
to each other. As black teen, uh,

575
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,790
says in what you have already read,

576
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:56,340
most of the time we're speaking
other people's languages, um, are,

577
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:01,600
it is rare indeed that we can say,
uh,

578
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:05,770
feeling very much like creative writers
when we do so that we've somehow

579
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:10,771
wrenched other people's language
out of its conventional usages.

580
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,340
And made it our own,

581
00:40:12,341 --> 00:40:16,690
slightly rewritten it so
that it is truly our own.

582
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:21,550
So, uh, more broadly speaking,
this is the challenge that faces,

583
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,300
uh,

584
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:27,220
a theoretical tradition or a
theoretical enterprise I should say.

585
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:30,140
That doesn't want to be just derivative,
uh,

586
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:34,270
from what other folks have already said.
The word,

587
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:39,300
the concept that gates brings to bear on
this because after all he recognizes as

588
00:40:40,781 --> 00:40:45,781
does show Walter to that the notion of
the sign is probably the cornerstone of

589
00:40:47,741 --> 00:40:50,230
white male literary theory.

590
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,790
They are agonizes that in order
to perform this x procreative act,

591
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:57,850
he's got to do something
with the notion of the sign.

592
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:03,120
And so he talks about the way in
which one can signify on something.

593
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,450
He introduces it very
quietly, uh, on page 1900,

594
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:11,590
uh,

595
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:16,590
the right hand column just seemingly in
passing since we're top of near the top

596
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:19,420
of the right hand column.
Since writing according to Hume,

597
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:23,380
was the ultimate sign of difference
between animal and human.

598
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,160
These writers implicitly we're signifying
upon the figure of the chain itself.

599
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,470
Notice the accent.

600
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:36,600
You don't necessarily pronounce the GE,

601
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,800
they were signifying on the chain.

602
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,400
And of course the great chain of being,
which is hierarchical

603
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:48,380
is very different from the vertical
chain of the chain gang, isn't it?

604
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:49,640
It's very difficult.

605
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,880
It's very different from the
chain that holds slaves together.

606
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:57,770
That's part of what it means
to signify on something.

607
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:02,930
The signifier, at least allegedly,
the signifier in the white male,

608
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,290
uh,

609
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:08,290
theoretical tradition is just a kind
of placeholder in a play of linguistic

610
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:10,874
differences.

611
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:15,970
The question of the underlying
sociological and cultural
basis of this play and

612
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:22,160
or the way in which this play take
shape isn't taken into account again,

613
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,470
allegedly because well,
you know,

614
00:42:24,471 --> 00:42:28,010
in ways that you can probably grasp
from what we've said all along,

615
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:32,540
this is slightly to oversimplify, but
this is the position taken up. Uh,

616
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:33,950
and in any case,

617
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,600
you therefore need to take the
signifier and signify on it. Well,

618
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:40,610
what is it to signify on something?

619
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,760
This is an expression that gates
takes from the trickster tradition,

620
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,760
the tradition of African storytelling
in which the weaker is also the smarter

621
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,570
and the monkey or a non-key the spiders.

622
00:42:57,571 --> 00:43:02,030
Some of you may remember the songs of
Rafi from your childhood. About a non-key,

623
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:06,770
the spider and which the
monkey or the spider tricks,

624
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,650
the big bad guys, the elephant, the lion,

625
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:13,160
all the bad guys get tricked
because they're stupider.

626
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,030
And the Little Guy,
uh,

627
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,240
is always able to signify on them,
to trick them,

628
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,680
to lie to them without their
realizing what's going on.

629
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:30,310
And this way of talking about signifying
is very much in the tradition of

630
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,900
African American folklore
and is, and, and,

631
00:43:35,901 --> 00:43:39,360
and his first comes to
public consciousness, uh,

632
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,390
in a song by the Scott Singer, Oscar
Brown, Jr written by Oscar Brown,

633
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:49,320
Jr called the signifying monkey. If
I could sing, I would sing it to you.

634
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:53,430
Uh, fortunately I can't sing.
Uh, but you can, it, it, it,

635
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:57,260
it became extremely popular and was
picked up by various instrumental jazz

636
00:43:57,261 --> 00:43:58,640
groups, uh, and was,

637
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:03,641
and was a staple in the jazz
tradition of the fifties and sixties.

638
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,650
Uh, in any case, uh,

639
00:44:06,651 --> 00:44:10,310
Oscar Brown jr his notion of
the signifying monkey, uh,

640
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:15,370
is where gates takes his essays
title from a and which is where,

641
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:20,680
uh, also, um, uh, he
gets this idea of, uh,

642
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:26,060
taking somebody else's
discourse out of its context,

643
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:27,080
uh,

644
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:32,080
and insisting on bending it into
an African American context.

645
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:33,031
In other words,

646
00:44:33,031 --> 00:44:38,031
a context which is one's own and
not just the context one is given.

647
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,700
Now, uh, the other
example of signifying on,

648
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,710
uh, that gates gives as the
culminating example of, uh, of,

649
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,260
of, uh, the color purple, uh,

650
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:57,120
and the conversation about getting the
men, getting the man out of your eye,

651
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,710
uh, which, uh,

652
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:03,740
is a way of taking back a problem that
exists even within the African American

653
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:11,600
tradition as gates has been pointing
out Wheatley and later Rebecca Cox, uh,

654
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:16,590
or rather Rebecca Jackson,
um, take their models, uh,

655
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:21,620
of education and self development from
white male figures who have taught them

656
00:45:23,431 --> 00:45:26,340
how to read. And in each case, of course,

657
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:31,170
this is pernicious because the
existence of the white male figure is,

658
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:36,030
um, is, uh, very much
still in the, in your eye.

659
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,490
You got to get the man out of your eye,

660
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:43,560
at least according to the dialogue gates
quotes from the color purple. Well,

661
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,600
the interesting thing there is that in
a way the issue of feminist criticism

662
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:51,180
comes back to haunt gates.
His argument,

663
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:56,390
because plainly shook doesn't just mean
the white man when she says the man.

664
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:00,270
A big issue in the color purple of course,

665
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,900
is the emergence of a possible feminism,
uh,

666
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:09,540
from, uh, social constructions
that aren't just defined by race.

667
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:14,800
So that when Gates says, you know, the
man, which all of us recognize, uh,

668
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:18,250
as shorthand for the white man,
uh,

669
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,300
can be signified on by an African
American tradition making it a term of

670
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:27,570
opprobrium, right? Get
the man out of your eye.

671
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:33,000
At the same time, it can be signified
on by the feminist tradition,

672
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:37,440
making it a term of opprobrium,
not in a completely different way,

673
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,550
but in an overlapping and
partially different way. Uh,

674
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:46,320
and gates in emphasizing the one as
opposed to the other is perhaps tilting

675
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:50,400
again, uh, toward a certain imbalance.

676
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,630
Now finally, I want to take
up, uh, the example, uh,

677
00:46:54,631 --> 00:46:58,230
the most controversial
example in his essay one, uh,

678
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,210
which is a source of outrage
for most readers. Uh,

679
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:06,090
at the bottom of page 1893
in the left hand column,

680
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:11,250
he's been talking about the new, he's been
talking about the new agrarian moment,

681
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:16,350
uh, out of which there emerged a number
of figures associated with the new

682
00:47:16,351 --> 00:47:19,770
criticism, uh, including
Robert Penn Warren,

683
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:24,630
who very early on repudiated the
new Agrarians, uh, and became,

684
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:29,250
um, uh, a politically progressive
figure in his own writing. You've,

685
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,380
many of you have probably
read all the king's men, uh,

686
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:36,820
certainly in his poetry as
well, but who was a, an Avatar,

687
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:41,710
a central figure in the,
in the development of the
thinking of the new criticism,

688
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:45,160
which we have briefly studied.
Now,

689
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,930
Warren wrote a poem called
Pondi Woods, which, uh,

690
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:53,490
is quoted completely out of
context by Sterling Brown, uh,

691
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:58,360
uh, and unfairly out of
context, uh, in the passage,

692
00:47:58,361 --> 00:48:03,040
which I'm not going to read because I
don't think I have the right to speak the

693
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:07,510
n word. Uh, and so, uh, I'll
just have you look at it.

694
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:12,010
Um, but then, and I'll come back
to that in a minute. Um, and then,

695
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,510
uh, uh, the sterling Brown's response, uh,

696
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,910
is also recorded there, uh, for you. Well,

697
00:48:18,911 --> 00:48:23,650
the problem is this for this from the
standpoint of anybody who's actually read

698
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,070
the poem,
but remember in,

699
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:29,680
in some ways it's a problem raised by a
new critical perspective. And I'll show,

700
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:31,930
and I'll explain what I mean in a minute.

701
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:38,310
That expression is spoken by
a buzzard or vulture from,

702
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:43,390
I forget whether it's
Tennessee or Kentucky.

703
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:47,530
They episode takes place
in northern Louisiana, uh,

704
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:52,770
and the buzzard is sitting expectedly on
a tree waiting for a fugitive slave who

705
00:48:55,061 --> 00:49:00,061
has been chased into the swamp
by his white pursuers to die.

706
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:03,820
And the vulture is sitting
there. Well, if it could,

707
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:07,570
it would be rubbing his hands with
glee waiting for this to take place.

708
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,770
And it's the vulture that says
it and the poem, nothing to do.

709
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:16,060
In other words,
as we say with the author of the poem,

710
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,020
Warren,

711
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:22,020
who is writing a completely sympathetic
evocation of what it's like to be a

712
00:49:23,591 --> 00:49:27,520
fugitive slave in this state of terrible,
uh,

713
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,410
and overwhelmed panic.

714
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:35,080
And so it seems completely
unfair and it is, I think,

715
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:40,500
unfair as sterling brown took it up and
as gates then perpetuates the idea in

716
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:45,640
his own reference. The one
thing I would add, however,

717
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:51,270
is that it's a new critical idea that
we invoke to say that it's unfair.

718
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:55,870
It's the new criticism of which
robbery in which Robert War.

719
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,960
Penn Warren was a participant that tells
us we shouldn't confuse speakers in

720
00:50:01,511 --> 00:50:05,290
poems with authors.
In other words,

721
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:09,010
and author,
as someone according to Lou criticism,

722
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:13,030
who's dispassionate and who
introduces dramatic voices,

723
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,560
even in lyric poems,

724
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:19,390
voices with which we are
merely confusing ourselves. Uh,

725
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:23,680
if we associate them, uh,
with, uh, with an author.

726
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:29,090
Now this is, uh, something that we
just for granted when we read poems,

727
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:34,120
all poems for us are to some
degree dramatic monologues
on the model of Browning

728
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:39,680
and others, uh, in the 19th
century. We read them that
way now. But it is, as I say,

729
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:44,360
a new critical idea.
And it comes back to the question,

730
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,570
who has the right to use the n word?

731
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,660
It's a frequently,

732
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:54,800
it's a frequent sort of term
used on the street as you know,

733
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:59,830
and African American culture used
almost with a certain fondness, uh,

734
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:03,710
as a form of mutual greeting.
But at the same time,

735
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:08,800
it is a term that continues rigorously
to be rejected as available to anyone

736
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:13,460
other than someone who
belongs within this community.

737
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,780
And so that issue lingers.
It's an issue that Warren,

738
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,430
because of course he wrote long before,
uh,

739
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:24,450
this sort of controversy began
to arise around the word. Uh,

740
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:29,240
the controversy really boiled over
precisely at the time of the banning of

741
00:51:29,241 --> 00:51:33,290
huckleberry Finn from public
schools. Uh, uh, and so, uh,

742
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,400
there's a kind of innocence perhaps,
uh, in Warren's use of the word.

743
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,640
But nevertheless, uh, in
the critical tradition,

744
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:43,430
it's a question who has
the right to use it?

745
00:51:43,431 --> 00:51:48,431
And this gives rise perhaps to the
suggestion of a certain insularity in the

746
00:51:49,071 --> 00:51:52,720
thinking of the new criticism.
Take the fee,

747
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:57,020
let let use any model you like.
The model of the Floridian unconscious,

748
00:51:57,021 --> 00:52:00,200
the model of the political unconscious.
In other words,

749
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:05,350
we've been reading a lot in this course
about are never quite saying what we

750
00:52:05,841 --> 00:52:10,841
mean to say of our never quite being
fully in control of our discourse because

751
00:52:11,421 --> 00:52:15,140
it bubbles up from the
unconscious right now,

752
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:17,180
if you take a model like this,

753
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:22,390
even though it's a nasty buzzard from
Kentucky that's saying what gates quotes.

754
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:24,920
Nevertheless,

755
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:29,630
there is an author and it has bubbled
up from the unconscious of that. Well,

756
00:52:29,631 --> 00:52:33,050
what are you going to do with that?
There's a kind of impasse there.

757
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:38,290
We feel distinctly and vividly and
even bitterly because I love Warren.

758
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:42,050
I love Ponti Woods and I also
am something of a new critic,

759
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,220
so we feel a bitterness
about the expropriation,

760
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:51,250
the signifying on what
Warren says in this fashion,

761
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:56,950
but at the same time we have entertained
these ideas of a subliminal author,

762
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:03,140
not an authority,
but an author welling up from below.

763
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:06,530
And if that's the case,
if that's the case,

764
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:10,940
then we have to worry a little bit about
how an expression like that got into

765
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:14,000
the poem afterwards, after all. Um,

766
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:16,160
and so that to,

767
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:21,280
I call it a lingering problem because it
strikes me as one of those moments when

768
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:26,730
probably would have been better if gates,
uh, hadn't followed sterling Brown.

769
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,800
Uh, one of those moments
when there is a kind of, uh,

770
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,710
overkill in the zeal of argumentation,
uh,

771
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,900
but which at the same time,

772
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:42,020
we can't absolutely dismiss out of hand
for the variety of reasons that I've

773
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:45,060
mentioned. Okay. I'll
leave it like at there,

774
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:50,210
and we'll return to many of these issues
in a new vocabulary and in new forms.

775
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:55,790
When we read the examples of postcolonial
criticism on Thursday that you've been

776
00:53:56,281 --> 00:53:56,610
assigned.
