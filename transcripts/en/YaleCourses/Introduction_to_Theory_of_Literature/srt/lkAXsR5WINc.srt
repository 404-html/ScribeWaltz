1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,160
Well, I'd really better
start, I can infer,

2
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:10,161
I think from looking around the room that
there is either post paper depression

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,570
at work or that having
read written the paper, uh,

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,690
is scarcely had time to read a 15
page labyrinthine essay by law call.

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,660
Um, that's unfortunate. Uh,

6
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:29,150
and I hope you're able to make up for
it soon. And those of you who, uh,

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,410
are here today,
uh,

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,500
can take such notes as you can figure
out how to take and then go back to the

9
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:42,670
text of Laconia and try to
make use of them. Uh, I, uh,

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,830
it is a pity that not everyone's here,
but we'll fair forward.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,810
Nevertheless. Uh, now there
is an obvious link between,

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,470
uh,

13
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,470
the work of Peter Brooks that you read
last time and this particular essay of

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,010
Laconia, uh, which of course I'd
like to begin by underlining.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,460
It has to do with the part
of the argument of Lacan,

16
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:10,461
which probably is most accessible to you
after your tour through structuralism

17
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,540
and related Isms and which,
uh,

18
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,550
in a way I think really can be used to
anchor a certain understanding of luck

19
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:22,490
call. Uh, and it's something
I am going to spend a walk,

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,130
want to spend a lot of time
with in the long run today.

21
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,430
And then a case Brooks understood,
uh,

22
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,590
the fictional texts,

23
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:36,591
the co and the completed
fictional narrative as a
sustaining of desire through a

24
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:46,790
series of day two or detours, uh, um,

25
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,310
inadequate and improper and points
overcome a resulting in a continuation of

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,190
desire, uh, resulting in a proper ending.

27
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:04,191
That is to say something corresponding
to what Freud understood as the desire of

28
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,940
the organism to die in its own way,
uh,

29
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:13,941
and not according to the modification
or pressure of something from without.

30
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,680
Uh, and this sequence of day to, uh,

31
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,730
in the elaboration of a narrative plot,

32
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,910
Brooks called Matana me in a way that by
this time we ought to recognize as what

33
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,300
happens,
uh,

34
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,350
in the putting together of signs along
the axis of combination as it's described

35
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,540
by [inaudible],

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
but Brooks remarks also that at the
same time there is a binding of this

37
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,700
sequence of signs of events.
In the case of a plot,

38
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,010
there is a binding of these signs.
There is an effect of unity,

39
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,040
a feeling that the experience one
has in reading a fictional plot is an

40
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:06,400
experience of unity. And this
effect, uh, he calls metaphor.

41
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,450
That is to say our sense of the
unity of a fictional pro plot.

42
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,570
We understand as metaphor some kind
of identity or self identity or close

43
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:23,130
correspondence in the
meaning of the variety of,

44
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,310
of events that we have encountered results
in a unity that can be understood in

45
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,410
metaphorical terms. Uh, in other words,

46
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,090
something like what Y'all cups and
calls the poetic function has been super

47
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,240
imposed on the med anemic,
uh,

48
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,250
access of combination in such a
way that the feeling of unity,

49
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,410
the sense of the recurrence of identity
in the signs used is something that we

50
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:52,240
can come away with.

51
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,450
And this a Brooks argues accounts for
our sense of the unity of the plot,

52
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,510
even as we understand
it to be a perpetual,

53
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,600
a form of the delay of desire.
Uh,

54
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,190
that's how I speak of the delay of
desire. That's most obvious. Of course,

55
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:13,440
at a marriage plot, a marriage plot
being the heart of fiction perhaps, uh,

56
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,010
and most immediately intelligible. But
of course, desire takes many forms.

57
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,990
There are many sorts of plot,
uh,

58
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,670
and they always do in one form or
another half to do in Brookson sense with

59
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:27,870
desire. Now, uh, I, I pause, uh,

60
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,880
in this way over Brooks because I think
you can see whatever frustration you may

61
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:36,050
also be feeling and encountering con,

62
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:41,190
I think you can see that the same basic
movement is at work in luck because

63
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,110
understanding of the unconscious,

64
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,890
the discourse of desire for luck car,

65
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,040
the perpetual deferral of
bringing into consciousness,

66
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,110
into being into presence,

67
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,260
the object of Desire Lacan to
hearkening back to Freud as Brooks does.

68
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,760
Hearkening back to the,
uh, distinction made, uh,

69
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,940
th th the, the, the, the,
the, the connection made, uh,

70
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,020
in Freud and thought and picked up by
[inaudible] between condensation and the

71
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:21,070
dream work and metaphor and the Dream
Work and displacement in the dream work

72
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,990
and my autonomy in the dream work.

73
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,410
This is central as well to luck argument,

74
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,120
the deferral of desire and for a la carte.

75
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,150
The impossibility ever of realizing
one's desire for a certain kind of other

76
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,540
that I'm going to be trying to identify
during the course of the lecture is

77
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:48,541
understood as much autonomy just as Brooks
understands the movement of metonymy

78
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,930
as a purpose, as not a
perpetual, uh, but a cyst,

79
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,020
a plot sustaining day tour
or deferral of the end.

80
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,970
So there's two, one finds
in desire and uh, in, in,

81
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,110
in Laconia and metaphor.
On the other hand,

82
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:09,410
he understands to be what he calls it.
One interesting point,

83
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,180
the quilting of the mat,
anemic chain,

84
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:19,390
the plan to copy Tom or quilting button
that suddenly holds together a sequence

85
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,060
of disparate signifiers in such a way
that a kind of substitution of signs as

86
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:34,670
opposed to a displacement of
science can be accomplished.

87
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,810
And we'll come back to this later on.
Uh,

88
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,920
in attempting to understand what Lacan
has to say about that line from victor

89
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,940
goes, Poem Boaz Asleep. Uh, the line,

90
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,930
his sheaves were not miserly nor spiteful.
We'll come back to that.

91
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,340
But in the meantime,

92
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:58,030
the point of Lacan and what makes a lot
cause reading of desire different from

93
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,650
Brooks's.
And indeed,

94
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:05,600
what makes his reading of desire different
from that of anyone who thinks of

95
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,720
these structuralist issues
in psychoanalytic terms as
that Laca really doesn't

96
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:16,571
believe that we can ever
have what we desire.

97
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,300
He has no doubt that we
can have what we need.

98
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,730
He makes the fundamental distinction
between having what we desire and having

99
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:30,640
what we need. The distinction is often
put, and when you read a Slovak g Zach,

100
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,520
next week, you'll see who makes a
much more central point of this.

101
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:39,420
It's often put as the distinction
between the big other. And uh,

102
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:44,060
later on we'll talk about why
it's big, uh, the big other,

103
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,590
which one can never appropriate
as an object of desire.

104
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:53,540
It is perpetually and always
elusive. And the OBC j petite, ah,

105
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,000
the little, uh, object of desire, uh,

106
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,870
which is not really an
object of desire at all,

107
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:04,370
but is available to satisfy
need socio biologically.

108
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,910
You can get what you need
a psychoanalytically,

109
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,540
you cannot get what you desire.
Now,

110
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,550
the obvious gloss here I think,
um, is the rolling stones. Uh,

111
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,410
if,
uh,

112
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:22,410
Lacan were the rolling stones and he'd
had slightly rewritten the famous refrain

113
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,410
by saying, you can never
get what you want, right.

114
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,740
But sometimes if you
try and you got to try,

115
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,630
I mean, even for what you
need, you've got to hear it.

116
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,440
You can't just sit there
sometimes if you try,

117
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,130
you can get what you
need. And so, and, and I,

118
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:48,200
I'm sure that a Mick Jagger had many
sticky fingers in the pages of Lacan in

119
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:52,700
order to be able, in order to be able
to make that important distinction.

120
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,360
Um,

121
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,690
but I think it's one that perhaps you
might want to salt away the next time you

122
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:02,691
feel confused about the distinction
between desire and need.

123
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,570
Uh, now obviously it'd be great
if we could just stop there,

124
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,400
but we do have to get a little closer
to the text and try to figure out why in

125
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,880
these terms given to us by Lacan terms,

126
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:17,760
both structuralist and psychoanalytic,

127
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,250
we have to figure out why this
distinction prevails, uh, and, and,

128
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:27,240
and what it amounts to. So we,
we soldier on. Uh, first of all,

129
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,350
let me just say a couple of things
in passing. There's, there is,

130
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:36,180
there is for humanistic studies
more than one Jacques Lacan.

131
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,660
There is the luck call for
literary studies who I think
is very well represented

132
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,060
by the text we have before us,

133
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:50,061
even though some of his most important
ideas are only hinted at in this text.

134
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:54,120
For example, we hear nothing in
this text about his famous, uh,

135
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,640
triadic distinction among the real,

136
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,710
the imaginary and the symbolic.
This is something we can't really explore,

137
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,200
uh,
with only this text before us.

138
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,220
And there's only the slightest hint at
the very end of the essay on the last

139
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:12,750
page of the distinction I've just made
between the big other and the object

140
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,380
Patea we'll have lots of time to think
about that because it's central to the

141
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:20,490
essay of Dziedzic that you read next week.
But for literary studies,

142
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:24,900
focusing on the structuralist
legacy for a lot call, uh,

143
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,850
this is an exemplary selection,
but there's also the lock car.

144
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,010
Perhaps a more current Lacan,
one better known,

145
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:35,130
perhaps even to some of
you have film studies,

146
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,670
the [inaudible] of the gays,
uh,

147
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,430
the complicated dialectic of the gaze,

148
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:46,431
which does very much
involve up negotiating the
distinctions among the real,

149
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,550
the imaginary and the symbolic.
And as I say, this luck, Huh?

150
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,820
We're obliged largely to leave aside,
uh,

151
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:58,821
if only because of the selectivity
of what I've given you to read.

152
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,400
Uh, but as I say, these are,
these are lock call, uh,

153
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,730
luck cause with very,
with,

154
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:09,390
with quite different emphases
overlapping only to a certain degree.

155
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,920
Now the other thing I want to say in
passing explains some of their other

156
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:15,900
strange tone of this essay.

157
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,150
You notice that Laca is just
sort of bristling with hostility,

158
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,740
uh, and of course as well,
condescension of all the big egos.

159
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:29,890
And in our syllabus, this is by far
the biggest and we, and you know,

160
00:11:29,891 --> 00:11:33,420
it's just something we have to live
with and come to terms with. Uh,

161
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,980
but the condescension isn't just toward
the natural stupidity of all the rest of

162
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,150
us.
It's toward,

163
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:44,151
in particular what he takes to be the
distortion of the legacy of Freud by most

164
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,760
of his psychoanalytic contemporaries,

165
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:52,110
particularly the international
psychoanalytic association,

166
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,400
many members of whom were the so
called American ego psychologist.

167
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,280
Now what does an ego psychologist,

168
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:02,710
it's somebody who begins
as Lacan does too.

169
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:04,690
And this is something
we'll want to come back to.

170
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,860
It's somebody who begins with
Freud's famous proposition,

171
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,290
vo s Var,

172
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,930
Zol Zine where it was there I should be.

173
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,270
And other words out of the
raw materials of the ID, it,

174
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,470
it s in the unconscious,
the ego.

175
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,500
That is to say the capacity of the human
organism to develop into its maturity

176
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,730
should arise.
In other words,

177
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,260
they relationship between
instinctual drives and,

178
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:41,980
uh,

179
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,980
the proper inhibitions of human or adult
consciousness should be a progressive

180
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,930
one.
And the purpose of psychoanalysis,

181
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,800
the purpose of bringing people beyond,
uh,

182
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,480
their entrapment in the
various infantile stages, uh,

183
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,320
or beyond,
uh,

184
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,520
their entrapment in some
form or another of neurosis.

185
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,820
The idea of progress or development
in psychoanalysis has to do with the

186
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:13,270
emergence and reinforcement of the ego.
Huh?

187
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,800
Hates this idea.
And there isn't.

188
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,820
He hates it is because that idea of the
emergence of a stable and mature ego is

189
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:28,351
presupposed by the idea that there is
such a thing as stable human subjectivity.

190
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,580
In other words,

191
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,580
that there is such a thing
as consciousness from
which are communicated and

192
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:41,851
linguistic and other sorts of systems
derive laca takes a completely different

193
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:44,320
view of consciousness.

194
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,580
And this of course is something
to which we will turn in a moment.

195
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,970
But the basic disagreement and the
source of his most intense hostility

196
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,260
throughout this essay,
uh,

197
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,320
concerns the question whether or not
there is for each of us a stable and by

198
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:09,220
implication unique subjectivity.
We are not each other.

199
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,350
We suppose ourselves. Indeed we
complain when we think about ethics,

200
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,380
uh, of our, about our
isolation from each other.

201
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:22,000
We suppose ourselves to be all
together individual. Uh, uh,

202
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,290
whereas for a lot car,
um,

203
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,080
there is a kind of
continuousness in consciousness.

204
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:33,460
The reason for which I'll explain
at which is not absolute, uh,

205
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,460
in the long run.
And this essay you will find,

206
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,320
and I hope to be able to understand this
as a kind of turn in his argument in

207
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:42,610
the long run.
In this essay,

208
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:47,611
you will find that Lacan does actually
hold out a limited sense of individual

209
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,090
subjectivity, not as, not really
as autonomous subjectivity,

210
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:58,860
not something that can,
uh, that, that, that,

211
00:14:58,861 --> 00:15:03,861
that can authorize a sense of
free will or power of agency,

212
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,463
but a,

213
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,470
a way in which the simplest owing simply
to the complexity of the unconscious,

214
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:17,450
a way in which each of us,
uh, as it were and habits,

215
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,510
a slightly different
form of that complexity.

216
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,750
Lacan goes that far in the direction
of the subject or of subjectivity,

217
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,380
but refuses the idea that the subject
that is something that can emerge from

218
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,740
analysis,
a analysis or in the case of,

219
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:41,570
I suppose most of us simply
through maturation as a stable,

220
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,560
coherent, uh, uh, well organized, uh,

221
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,730
a sense of self and identity.
All right,

222
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,200
let's start then with the one piece of
really solid clinical work that Lacan

223
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,570
ever did.
Uh,

224
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,600
la cause a psycho psycho analytic
philosophy is as he would be the first to

225
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:09,410
admit and even sort of tearfully to
endorse, uh, largely speculative.

226
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:11,720
That is to say he works,
uh,

227
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,390
in depth with philosophical and
literary materials. He is, uh,

228
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:20,510
uh, not glued to the analysts chair. Uh,

229
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:25,511
he is a notoriously impatient
with his annual exams,

230
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,550
uh, and uh, is uh,

231
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:33,580
very interested in matters of analysis
either in on the one hand shortcuts or on

232
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:36,290
the other hand,
uh,

233
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,180
championing Freud's late essay
analysis terminable or interminable,

234
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,470
uh,
taking the side.

235
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,610
That analysis is just obviously such
as the complexity of the thing in

236
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,563
terminable,

237
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,600
but they want really solid piece of
clinical research that Lacan did.

238
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,050
Uh,

239
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:59,050
and that is accepted as part of the
psychoanalytic psychoanalytic lore is his

240
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:04,580
work that he did in the
1930s on the mirror stage.

241
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:10,450
And that worked actually does generate
the system of ideas that [inaudible] has

242
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,380
to offer.
So what is the mirror stage?

243
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,160
A baby in the anal phase,

244
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:22,880
that is to say no longer identifying
with the abreast with the breast of the

245
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:27,750
mother, but aware of a sense
of difference between, uh,

246
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,180
whatever it might be. And that
otherness, which is out there,

247
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,510
a baby views itself in the mirror.

248
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,190
And you know, I mean, maybe it views
itself like this, right? It, it,

249
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,580
it can only crawl, you
know, it can barely touch.

250
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:45,920
It's knows it can't feed itself and it,
and,

251
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:48,290
and it's the actual nature of its body.

252
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,260
It's still frag fragmented and
disorganized. It lacks coordination.

253
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,693
And in fact,

254
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,730
it lacks in any ordinary
sense of the term uprightness.

255
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,780
But you know, let's say it's looking
at itself in the mirror like this.

256
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,760
And so, you know, what it
sees is something like this.
It sees, in other words,

257
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,850
it sees something which is coherent,

258
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,670
coordinated at really rather
handsome. Yo, you know, it,

259
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,450
it says, wow, you know,
I'm, I'm okay. Uh, and, and,

260
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,370
and it acknowledges itself to be at,
recognizes itself to be,

261
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,730
it's the object of the mother's desire,
right?

262
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:34,080
And that is the moment in which it no
longer identifies with the breast but

263
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:39,081
thinks of itself as the object of
the desire of another because of,

264
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:43,980
because it's so pleased with itself. So
somebody's gotta desire me, you know,

265
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:48,930
it's probably mom, you know,
so, so, so, so there it is. Uh,

266
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:49,890
and this is,

267
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,540
and this is the moment
of the mirror stage.

268
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,600
Now what happens after that,
and by the way,

269
00:18:57,601 --> 00:19:01,020
the rather wonderful epigraph
from Leonardo Davinci,

270
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:03,420
which begins your essay is all about this.

271
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,660
What happens after that is rather tragic.

272
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,830
The baby falls into language
and in the moment of and,

273
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:16,860
and, and, and I'm going to come back
in a minute to the whole question.

274
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:21,861
Why is it language that does this in the
moment at which it falls into language?

275
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:28,310
It no longer sees itself as the ideal.

276
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,820
I, that's Eda. I'll ish
in Freud's language.

277
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,150
It no longer sees itself as the ideal eye,

278
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:41,330
but it comes into the recognition that
it doesn't even have its own name,

279
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,900
let alone and identity it
has the name of the father.

280
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,280
It sort of doesn't have
the Phallus of the father.

281
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,350
And it begins to recognize
competition in desire.

282
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:00,890
And it begins to recognize that what it
itself desires is not accessible in a

283
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:07,500
kind of mutuality of desire.
And that it is,

284
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,530
it has no choice but to admire while at
the same time envying and indeed forming

285
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:19,310
as an object desire because
that's what it lacks the father.

286
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,260
And that's the sense in
which, uh, but, but it's,

287
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,130
it's the father only in a
phantasmagoric sense in [inaudible],

288
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:31,340
the object of desire can
be just absolutely anything
depending on the course of

289
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,550
the, of, of, of, of the,
of, of the unraveling of a,

290
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,420
of, of a, the men anemic sequence, uh,

291
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,100
that desire follows.

292
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,460
But this is what Lacan associates
with the oedipal phase.

293
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:51,130
And that's why I say
in passing the father,

294
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,170
and it does have something to do
with luck cause revision of Freud.

295
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,950
Uh, uh, in saying that the object of lack,

296
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,420
the object of lack,
that perpetually motivates desire.

297
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:09,420
The desire for what one
lacks is not an all physical.

298
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,950
I mean, if you make that mistake,
you're right back in, in, you know,

299
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:18,130
sort of mindless Freud, hedonism.
You know, it's not the penis.

300
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,460
It is on the contrary something which
is by nature symbolic something which is

301
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,440
an ego ideal.
That is to say,

302
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:34,150
but no longer oneself.
That is to say no longer what one has,

303
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,330
but what through the gap
opened up by language.

304
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,240
One recognizes that one lacks.

305
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,480
And so it takes a variety of,

306
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,500
let's just say fellow go centric forms,
uh,

307
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,530
in film criticism.
Some of you may know the essay,

308
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:55,531
the Lacanian Essay of Laura Molavi in
which the female object of the spectators

309
00:21:56,801 --> 00:22:01,801
desire or gays dressed in a sheath
dress is actually just like the baby.

310
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,350
Just like anything else.
It is this. In other words,

311
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,030
it is sort of, despite being obviously
an incredibly different kind of thing,

312
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,240
nevertheless,
in symbolic terms,

313
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,590
the Fallis all right. Now,
so the question then is,

314
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:26,190
why is it that it's language that does
this lacoss speaks of the impossibility

315
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,790
of realizing a and object of desire?

316
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Because the metronomic structure of
desire follows what he calls an ace in

317
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:40,420
[inaudible] course,

318
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:45,630
a syntonic meaning the line which curves
toward the lion it wants to meet but

319
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:48,250
never reaches it.

320
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,620
And there's a kind of an underlying
punning sense in that word of the met

321
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:58,270
anemic, uh, course of desire
not revealing the symptom.

322
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,180
It's a symbiotic in that sense as well.
Uh,

323
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,420
the only thing that can reveal the
symptom is those moments of quilting. Uh,

324
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,710
the, the moments at the plant
to copy tall when metaphor,

325
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,740
as Lakana says on two different occasions
in the essay reveals the symptom.

326
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:21,520
So this is what happens when you can't

327
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,100
get ever when you can't
ever get what you want.

328
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,780
And the question is,

329
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,590
but don't worry because you can always
have what you need as long as you try. Uh,

330
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,970
so the question is why
does language do this?

331
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:42,300
What is it about language that
introduces this problematic beyond repair

332
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,840
call?
It begins with an,

333
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,730
he begins the essay with a claim
about the Freud in unconscious,

334
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,080
a claim which he takes.

335
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:59,081
He says from the interpretation of dreams
where Freud speaks of the relationship

336
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:04,631
between condensation and displacement
in the dreamwork Lacan says,

337
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,360
the unconscious is structured like a
language that's perhaps the most single

338
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,680
expression that people take away
from luck on. And rightly so,

339
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,310
because it is again, foundational and, uh,

340
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:23,780
what we need to understand, uh, if
we're to get, uh, get along with him.

341
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,000
The unconscious is structured like
a language. Now what does this mean?

342
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:34,130
It means that the UNCA, he doesn't say
the unconscious is a language, by the way.

343
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,600
And he doesn't say that he means the
unconscious is structured exclusively like

344
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,980
human language.

345
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:45,140
He means that the unconscious
is structured like a
semiotic system. And in fact,

346
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:47,900
he draws from Freud's
interpretation of dreams.

347
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:53,110
The idea that the way the dream work
works and the way everyday life and Freud

348
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:58,310
sense of the psychopathology of
everyday life works is like a rebus.

349
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:03,260
In other words, one of those
puzzles in which you can find the,

350
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:05,180
an underlying sentence.

351
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:10,040
If you figure out how to put
together drawings, numbers,

352
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,350
syllables,
and other words,

353
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,210
a sequence of signs taken from
different semiotics systems,

354
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,870
uh, that can put themselves
together into a meaning.

355
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,820
That's how Lacan understands
the dream work and the, uh,

356
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:29,320
the movements of
consciousness, uh, to go. They,

357
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:34,330
the unconscious then is structured like
a language which is not the same thing

358
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:38,750
as to say it is a language now,
okay.

359
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,080
Structured like a language.
This means,

360
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:47,510
and this is where there is this
enormous gulf between Loc and most other

361
00:25:47,511 --> 00:25:49,730
practitioners of psychoanalysis,

362
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:55,030
the unconsciousness is not in that case
to be understood as the seat of the

363
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:59,900
instincts. It's not to be
understood as something prior.

364
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,490
In other words,
to those forms of derivative articulation,

365
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:09,491
those forms of articulation emerging
through maturity that we're accustomed to

366
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:14,690
call language. If the unconscious
is structured like a language,

367
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,920
then it,

368
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:21,130
the ID s itself is
precisely the signifier,

369
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,460
the signifier that is that,

370
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,800
that that emerges as language.
Not,

371
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:35,890
not that that is foundational to language
because luck Han's point like the

372
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:41,360
point of many other people in our
syllabus is not that is not that language

373
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,620
expresses thought.

374
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,860
Not at all that language
expresses thought,

375
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,250
but that language constitutes thought.

376
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,180
That language brings
thought consciousness,

377
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,080
a sense of things into being that
this is articulated through language.

378
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,940
Now this of course brings
us immediately to um,

379
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,280
certain issues, uh, of
conflict that lock car has,

380
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:10,530
not just with other
forms of psychoanalysis,

381
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:14,730
but with a whole philosophical tradition.
If you are a materialist,

382
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,840
in other words,

383
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,840
if you believe that things come
first and consciousness comes second,

384
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,550
that is to say if you're a Marxist,
if you, if, if you believe that,

385
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,120
uh,

386
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,120
that that consciousness ideology call it
what you will is determined by existing

387
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:35,970
material circumstances.
As one says,

388
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:41,130
you can't very well think that existing
material circumstances are produced by

389
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:45,690
language. Whoa. You know, and if by
the same token you're a positivist,

390
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,720
if you believe that the meaning of
things is something that is expressed by

391
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:56,340
language, something that language
is brought into being to express,

392
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:01,670
then also you're giving priority to
things to that which is behind language to

393
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:07,521
that which gives rise to language rather
than as Lacan does giving priority to

394
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:13,041
language and he actually attacks both
the Marxist tradition and the positive

395
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:18,690
tradition at various points in
your text. Uh, the, uh, the,

396
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,640
the sideways blow at at
Marxism is on page 1130,

397
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:26,730
the right hand column, the
size, what the sideways blow it.

398
00:28:26,731 --> 00:28:31,080
Positivism is on page 1132,
uh, the right hand column.

399
00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:35,670
I don't want to pause, uh, to quote
them. Uh, but uh, you can, you,

400
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,100
you can go to them in,
in your text.

401
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,800
So what is it?

402
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,750
Id s what is what that which
is normally called, uh,

403
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,680
the instinctual drives, the
Id, you know, that, you know,

404
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:53,420
these are sort of the
UN unmediated, uh, the,

405
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,490
the unmediated wish for something.
Well,

406
00:28:56,491 --> 00:29:00,720
lock on says it is nothing other
than the signifier. He says,

407
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,230
what do I mean by literalism?

408
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,740
How else can I mean it except literally
it is the letter that is to say

409
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:14,490
consciousness begins with the letter.

410
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Remember Levy Strauss saying
in the text quoted by Derrida,

411
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,380
remember Levy Strauss sang.

412
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,830
The language doesn't come into
being just a little bit at a time.

413
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,720
One day there is no language and the next
day there is language which is to say

414
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:35,721
suddenly there is a way of conferring
meaning on things and that way of convert

415
00:29:36,781 --> 00:29:39,180
conferring meaning on
things is differential.

416
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:43,780
That is to say it introduces the
arbitrary nature of the sign and the

417
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:48,781
differential relations among signs which
are featured in the work of so Seward

418
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,380
so it has so it is for
lock off the letter,

419
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:59,190
is that not which is brought
into being to express things.

420
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:06,090
Not that which is brought into being in
the service of the ego to discipline and

421
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:11,320
civilize the ID but rather is it itself.

422
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,390
That is to say it is the beginning.

423
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:18,391
In the beginning was the
word in the beginning was
the letter which disseminates

424
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:24,790
consciousness through the signifying
system that it makes available.

425
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,510
Now. Actually, I'm hoping
that in saying these things,

426
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:33,480
you find me merely and, and, and
rather dull. He repeating myself, uh,

427
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,210
saying things that I've said
before because it seems to
me that this is the part

428
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:42,050
of, of lock core, which is
accessible and which, uh, is,

429
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,580
is, is central to the sorts of
things that we've been talking about,

430
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,210
which I rather imagine you must
be getting used to by this time.

431
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:54,870
Yaka Epson lock car shares a structuralist
understanding of how the unconscious

432
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,220
discourses he accepts Jaak Upson's
distinction between metaphor and Mytonomy.

433
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,400
And he sees the cooperative
building up relationship of matter,

434
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,730
metaphor and metonymy in the discourse
of the unconscious and of the

435
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:17,710
psychopathology of everyday day life in
much the same way that [inaudible] does.

436
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:21,610
Remember Yacob son, uh,
associates matter for an autonomy,

437
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:26,080
not just with poetry and prose,
not just with certain kinds of style,

438
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,420
but actually with pathologies.
Uh,

439
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:33,550
and it's extreme forms metaphor and
my autonomy as manifest in linguistic

440
00:31:33,551 --> 00:31:34,630
practice,
uh,

441
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,660
take the form of Aphasias and
so yuck as Lakoff points out.

442
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,970
And so y'all cups in
two is concerned with,

443
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:48,030
with something sort of built in hard
wired in the way in which language works.

444
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,670
Uh, in an as the unconscious, uh,

445
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,700
that in its extreme forms is aphasic and
always expresses itself in tendencies,

446
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:01,570
either met anemic or
metaphoric. Now, of course,

447
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:03,640
he also draws on,
so sir,

448
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,380
but as your editor rightly
points out and a footnote, uh,

449
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:11,350
the way in which he reads.
So sewer,

450
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,500
the signifier,
the big signifier over the signified,

451
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:21,760
the little rather insignificant signified.
Because after all,

452
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:23,860
what does it signified matter?
You can never,

453
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:28,450
you can never cross the bar.
All right to get to it,

454
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,800
you are barred from it. The
signified, uh, is you know,

455
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:37,360
that what, which from which you
are forever excluded. And we'll,

456
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,700
we'll go into lock cons. Example of
the examples of this in a minute.

457
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,320
This is actually quite
different from so sewers, uh,

458
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,830
signified over the signifier,

459
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,060
uh,

460
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:54,710
anchored by a kind of mutuality
whereby it's never a question,

461
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,040
uh, what generates what, uh,

462
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,960
but rather a question. And, but,
but, and which has in common,

463
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:07,430
I think with a lot so-called
algorithm only, in fact,

464
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:08,270
the bar itself,

465
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:13,300
the fact that the relationship between
signifier and signified or signified and

466
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:18,461
signifier is an arbitrary one that can't
be crossed by evoking anything natural

467
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:26,090
in the nature of the signified that calls
forth the signifier there they agree,

468
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,850
but as to what produces what.

469
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:34,940
So Sarah is agnostic about it
and Lacan incests that the big s,

470
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,480
uh,

471
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,480
is that which generates the signified
that from which any possibility of

472
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:45,580
grasping a signified, uh,
arises and derives. So,

473
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:50,170
so Lacoste Algorithm is act is
in fact rather difficult, uh,

474
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,680
different from, uh, so
sewers diagram now, okay,

475
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,310
let's, let's exemplify this, uh,

476
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:01,670
by going back to what I said about the
red light, right? Because here too,

477
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,950
I think we'll have continuity,
right?

478
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:09,100
The red light over a door is a signifier
which has a great deal to do with

479
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:14,580
desire, right? Uh, this week,
this we take for granted the reds,

480
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:18,860
the red light in other contexts has
nothing to do with desire, but the,

481
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,750
a signifier,
a red light over a door suggests desire.

482
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:28,040
But desire for what? Well, we
think we know desire for what,

483
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,140
but look at the signifier.
Desire for the door does,

484
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:33,501
I mean,

485
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:38,501
what is the relationship between the
signifier and what would seem to be the

486
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:41,990
signified? Right? That's
not what you desire.

487
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:47,000
You don't desire the door. And it's the
same with on a farm. Right? You know?

488
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,650
So what is this [inaudible] a farm.
Well, okay, the little girl says,

489
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:56,360
we've arrived at gentlemen and the little
boy says we've arrived at ladies. Well,

490
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:59,860
that seems to be quite healthy,
right? We're on our way. We're, we're,

491
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,430
we're on our way to something like
heteronormative desire. Great,

492
00:35:04,431 --> 00:35:09,020
terrific. But wait a minute, this,
I'm here. Right? What, what does,

493
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,600
um, what does that have to
do with the price? I mean,

494
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,500
the only thing you can do with,

495
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,450
even behind this door is restore
your personal comfort. I mean,

496
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,180
it has nothing to do with, it
has nothing to do with right, or,

497
00:35:21,181 --> 00:35:25,520
or anything else for that matter.
Uh, and if it's the, and if the,

498
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:29,630
the visible signified,
uh, is in question, well,

499
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:32,570
in what sense can we call this door?
Um,

500
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,800
right and it's the same with farm and uh,
there is in any case,

501
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,560
uh, in uh, in La Cause Anecdote, um,

502
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,250
the wonderful existence
or the railroad tracks,

503
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:46,350
which for him constitutes the bar.

504
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,500
That is to say that owing to the nature
of language whoring to the arbitrary

505
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:57,081
relation of the signifier to the signified
the little boy and little girl who

506
00:35:57,511 --> 00:36:01,230
are, who are wonderful characters right
out of no buck off's, Ata, I don't know,

507
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,080
I don't know if any of
you know that novel,

508
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:06,810
but the little boy is a
sort of a little genius,

509
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:11,460
obviously Lacan but his sisters even
smarter than he is, she says, you know,

510
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,850
just like a character in the Volkov.

511
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:18,540
But both this little boy and
little girl are barred from desire,

512
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:22,080
from their desire because they have,

513
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:27,140
they are already putting up
with a substitute precisely
in so far as they seem

514
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:31,970
to be on track towards something like,
uh,

515
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,980
the heteronormative expression of desire.

516
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,900
It's not an expression of desire at all.

517
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:41,880
It's an expression of need because they
are not able to bring into being or

518
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:44,970
consciousness or before themselves.

519
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,590
The object of desire
indicated by the signifier.

520
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:55,010
The signifier is always displaced from
the object of desire and precisely the

521
00:36:57,631 --> 00:37:02,460
ways that are borne out
diagrammatically in, in these formulas.

522
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:08,100
All right, so, um, what then is desire?

523
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:11,200
Well, perhaps we've
covered it. It is the, uh,

524
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:16,430
endless deferral of that which cannot
be signified in the Metta Nimic movement

525
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,420
of discourse or of dreaming or of the way
in which the unconscious functions and

526
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,340
Lacan is very ingenious in showing,

527
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,960
I think convincingly showing us how it
is that we get from one signifier to

528
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:38,340
another. In other words, how, what he
calls the chain of the signifier works.

529
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,340
You have a series of concentric rings,

530
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,380
but each concentric ring is made up
of a lot of little concentric rings,

531
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,440
which Hook on to associated
surrounding signifiers,

532
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,270
uh, in ways that could be variable. This,

533
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:58,380
I think very nicely up re diagrams,

534
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,500
so serious sense of the associate
of structure of the vertical axis.

535
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:07,560
That is to say,
of the sin chronic moment of language,

536
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:12,710
the way in which some signifiers naturally
cluster with other signifiers and not

537
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:17,100
just one group of signifiers,
but a variety of groups of signifiers,

538
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:22,220
but don't all naturally cluster with just
any or all signifiers so that you get

539
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,790
associated clusters in
the access of selection.

540
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,580
And they are indicated by this.

541
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:33,570
And as the chain of signifiers unfolds,
um,

542
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:38,660
the one or another of these possible
associations links on and remember all of

543
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:43,130
these, I mean, all of
these signifiers, uh,

544
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:47,620
are made up in turn, have a chain
of, uh, of concentric circles.

545
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:52,750
So I think this is a rather good way
of understanding the unfolding of,

546
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:57,130
of, of autonomy. Now every once
in awhile you get metaphor.

547
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,870
Whoa. You know, and it's a moment
to be celebrated in lock con, uh,

548
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,830
because it's as he says,
poetic. And it is also,

549
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:09,060
as he says in a number of places,
the manifestation,

550
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:13,420
the only possible manifestation of
the symptom. What is the symptom?

551
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,600
The awareness of the lack of an object
of desire expressed in a displaced

552
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,860
manner. That is to say, expressed in
a manner which is not, however said,

553
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:31,870
it's completely Upfest gatory of
the lack of the object of desire.

554
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,830
And it just sort of caught up
in my endless battling, uh,

555
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,920
but rather is that moment of pause in
which there is a gathering together of

556
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:46,261
signifiers and ultimately a substitution
of one signifier for another in such a

557
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:51,370
way that one says, Aha, I
see it. I can't grasp it.

558
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:56,380
I can't have it. But I see it.
I see the object of desire.

559
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:01,410
I see what has been displaced by
the very act of signification.

560
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,160
That's what he calls metaphor.

561
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,780
And he sees matter for as appearing
at these planned to copy. Tom,

562
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:11,620
think of this as a quilt.
Think of this as quilting.

563
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:15,790
What are your column
quilting, quilting, those,

564
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,330
you know what I'm talking
about? Quilting, nuts.

565
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,250
Pins knit. No, not needles.

566
00:40:24,251 --> 00:40:28,450
That's what you make a quilt with.
Uh, uh, uh, those little buttons,

567
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:32,680
quilting buttons, right. You
know, that's what a quilt is
like. He's, it's, it's, it's,

568
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:34,720
it's filled with something and then,
and then the,

569
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,690
the stuffing is held in place by buttons,
right?

570
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,900
So the stuffing of men and [inaudible]
signification is held in place usefully

571
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,240
for the analyst, for the
reader, for the interpreter,

572
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,480
by these quilting buttons
or plan to copy Tom.

573
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,940
And so the example that,
Yuck Yuck,

574
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,220
I'm sorry that luck comp
gives, uh, is as I say,

575
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:01,660
he gives several examples there.
There are the wonderful dazzling ratings,

576
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:06,661
both the four lines from Valerie and
of the one line from Victor Hugo,

577
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:13,070
I focus on the ego because it's a
little easier just the one line. Um,

578
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:18,270
he says there is something that happens
in this line which is metaphoric and he,

579
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,520
I'm delighted that he uses the word
sparks. In other words, the metaphoric,

580
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,250
the presence of the metaphor is a spark.

581
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:32,290
I remember I was talking about in Wolfgang
[inaudible] the need to gap a spark

582
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:34,130
plug, spark plug. In other words,

583
00:41:34,131 --> 00:41:38,510
the need to have a certain
distance between two points
in order for the spark to

584
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:41,930
happen. If it's too close, it doesn't
happen. You can, you just share it out.

585
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,160
And if it's too distant,

586
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,010
it doesn't happen because you
know the distance is too great.

587
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,990
So the spark that lock cause
talking about is the relationship.

588
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:55,991
His sheaves were neither miserly nor
spiteful as the relationship between Boaz

589
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:01,880
and his sheets because
the shades themselves,

590
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:04,970
which give of themselves,
you know, you know,

591
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:09,420
just as certain other things we could
mention give of itself, the sheet,

592
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,390
the shades,
the themselves,

593
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:16,310
which give of themselves and certainly
are not miserly or spiteful for that

594
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:20,570
reason. They're generous,
they're open, they give, they
feed us, et Cetera, et Cetera,

595
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,340
et cetera. Um, uh,

596
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,520
are supposed in Matana me to
indicate that Boaz is like that.

597
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,880
Oh, look at the munificence
of Boaz is crop. You know,

598
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,710
it's neither miserly north spiteful,
but as Lacan points out,

599
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:37,723
you know,

600
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,350
the miserliness and spitefulness
comes back in an unfortunate way,

601
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:45,680
precisely in that word, his, the word.

602
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:50,030
Because if he is a possessor of the Sheaf,

603
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:54,210
he is, he, he, this involves, uh,

604
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,050
perhaps sort of the hole as it were,

605
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:01,610
structure of capitalist or
Darwinian competition, uh,

606
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,370
and involves,
at least in an underlying way,

607
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,700
all the elements of
friction, if you will, uh,

608
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:12,350
and competitive envy, spite, if you will,

609
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:16,730
that seem to have been
banished. Uh, from the sentence.

610
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,640
In other words,
metaphorically speaking,

611
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:24,110
Boaz returns in his absence,

612
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,450
he substitutes.

613
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:31,750
He is substituted for by
the expression his sheets.

614
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:37,930
The possessive means that he is not
the things that he said to be met,

615
00:43:38,151 --> 00:43:43,151
an ethnically speaking and the shades
themselves are precisely what he is in the

616
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:46,100
oedipal phase.

617
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:51,101
That is to say precisely what he is if
he is objectified by a baby looking at

618
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:57,590
him, but at the same time, uh, not at all,

619
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,390
uh, what or where we expected
him to be. In other words,

620
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:07,510
they plan to copy ta of the sentence
of the line is the substitution of his,

621
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:14,100
of boy ads for his sheaves
and his sheaves for boys.

622
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,560
The,
so,

623
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:20,561
so the line has both a mat anemic reading
and a metaphoric reading here I think

624
00:44:21,231 --> 00:44:25,790
you can see lacan sense of the relation
between metaphor and Matana me hovering

625
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:30,590
between that of York,
Epson or Brooks and that of demand,

626
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:36,140
because there seems to be an underlying
irreducible tension between reading the

627
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:43,011
sentence as the reading the line as though
it says Ma Boaz was generous and free

628
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:49,701
of spite and rating the line as though
it said boy as just necessarily because

629
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,920
he's one who possesses something.

630
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,060
A person who has the
characteristics of miserliness,

631
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,920
miserliness and spitefulness and other,

632
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:05,040
the tension in other words seems to
me to be in Lacan and irreducible one,

633
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,930
so that at least in that regard,

634
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:12,050
we can place him closer to Lacan than
we have a to say Brooks or [inaudible],

635
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:19,430
which isn't to say that [inaudible] is
not the primary and central influence on

636
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:24,690
lock cons way of thinking about
the access of combination, the,

637
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,760
the, uh, the appearance of metaphor
on the access of combination.

638
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:35,120
They way in which we can identify these
quilting buttons on the axis of common

639
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:40,310
is nothing other than what Jakobsen
Yacob son said and meant when he said the

640
00:45:40,591 --> 00:45:45,591
poetic function is the transference of
the principle of equivalents from the

641
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:51,510
access of selection to the
axis of combination. All right,

642
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,850
so this, uh, this, uh, I'm not saying in,

643
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:59,400
in speaking, in passing of this
sort of irreducible conflict,

644
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:04,080
one senses between autonomy and
metaphor. Here, I'm not saying that, uh,

645
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:04,980
that,
uh,

646
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:09,600
Jaco Epson is not the primary influence
behind lock cons thinking in this

647
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:13,390
regard. All right? Now, Lacan says,

648
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:16,590
language is a rebus says,
I've said, and he says,

649
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,910
the movement of the signifier,
which is the movement of desire,

650
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,370
is the articulation of a lack.

651
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:28,430
That is to say it is in the
impossibility of as the,

652
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:32,580
uh, as, as, as certain kinds of
language philosophers would say,

653
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:37,690
of making the signifier hook
onto the signifier signified,

654
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,980
or as we might say,
hook up with the signified.

655
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,940
The impossibility of doing that,
uh,

656
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:49,070
is precisely the impossibilities
of realizing and object of desire.

657
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:55,020
So all of this, uh, all of this
should I hope now be clear.

658
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:56,310
So at some of the,

659
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:01,310
some of the consequences are that language
and the most obvious consequence is,

660
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,880
and this isn't the first time or last
time that we will live encounter this in

661
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:10,881
various vocabularies and context
is that language thinks me odd.

662
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:15,360
Page 11, 42, the right
hand column for example,

663
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:20,540
I think where I am not therefore I am
where I do not think that is to say that

664
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:23,570
which,
uh,

665
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:28,560
that which brings my thinking
into being is not present to me.

666
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,630
It, it, it is the letter.

667
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:36,760
It is the signifier which is
perpetually, uh, the signified.

668
00:47:36,761 --> 00:47:41,320
I'm sorry to say, I meant to say
which is, which perpetually evades us.

669
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,340
Uh, and which cannot
possibly be present to us.

670
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:47,110
I am not present to myself.

671
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:52,111
I cannot be present to myself because
what is present is the way in which my

672
00:47:53,391 --> 00:47:58,330
self comes into being in discourse,
which cannot identify me.

673
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,030
They cannot identify me,
uh,

674
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:05,050
either as subject or,
uh,

675
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:10,410
in a phase of narcissism or a supposing
I can somehow or another re imagined

676
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:14,740
myself in the mirror phase
as an object of desire.

677
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,930
All right. So, uh, I
actually think that, um,

678
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,810
without quite having meant to,

679
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:27,640
I've pretty much pretty much exhausted,

680
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,850
uh, what I have to say, an
outline about luck call.

681
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:36,130
I haven't said nearly enough about the
relationship between desire and need as

682
00:48:36,131 --> 00:48:40,480
it plots itself in our
actual lives and in fiction.

683
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:45,370
Because the extraordinary thing about
it is it's not just a slogan from the

684
00:48:45,371 --> 00:48:50,350
rolling stones or from Lacan
as we think about it, you know,

685
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:54,290
not that we're not happy
with, uh, with our,

686
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:58,000
with the, our relationship,
with the things that we need.

687
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,680
Obviously we are.

688
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:04,240
But the extraordinary thing about it
is that we recognize in our lives,

689
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:09,600
in the magical world of film that
is to say the world of illusion,

690
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:12,180
deliberately promoted by film.
Uh,

691
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:17,430
and in fiction we recognize the
absolutely central significance of this

692
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:20,014
distinction.

693
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,740
That's what's so wonderful and
amazing about the essay by Jijak,

694
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:29,680
you'll be reading for next week called
courtly love, which I, which I love,

695
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:31,690
uh, and which, which,

696
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:36,550
which is headlines which features
readings of a series of films,

697
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,270
uh,

698
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:42,270
in which the law Keynesian distinction
between the impossibilities ever of

699
00:49:43,061 --> 00:49:46,180
achieving the big other. By
the way, there seem to be,

700
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:50,530
there are times in various kinds of
fictional plots in which you can actually

701
00:49:50,531 --> 00:49:52,240
have the object of desire.

702
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,670
But what always happens in plots
like that is that the unconscious,

703
00:49:57,671 --> 00:50:01,830
the psyche finds ways of rejecting it.
You know,

704
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:06,520
I can't have that. It's my brother
or I can't, I can't have that.

705
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:10,690
It is in one form or another
forbidden, right? In other words,

706
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:15,670
it is in actuality,
in the way in which the psyche works,

707
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:19,380
uh, according to the
structure of the films, uh,

708
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,400
Jijak undertakes to analyze.

709
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:25,360
And he's so profused and examples that
he really does leave us feeling that

710
00:50:25,361 --> 00:50:28,910
there's a kind of universality
in what he's saying. Uh, yeah,

711
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,400
there are all kinds of,
there are all kinds of, uh,

712
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,750
object choices that can
happen and do happen.

713
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,660
And may even seem satisfactory,
but the,

714
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:42,410
those are all objects of Jay Patea,

715
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,820
whereas the big other,
the, the, that, that,

716
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:50,170
which is the true object of desire
is something that will prevent,

717
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:54,590
that will provecho perpetually
evade a possession. Okay.

718
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,850
So next time we're actually talking
about the anxiety of influence and Harold

719
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:01,310
bloom.
And then in the ensuing lecture,

720
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:06,170
we'll return in a way to lock con
when we take up Deleuze Guattari and,

721
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:08,210
uh, slower. Dziedzic. Thank you.
