1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.150
For the experts in emotion interview.
We'll have the honor.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.380
Speaking with Doctor Jessica Tracy.

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.720
I'm doctor Tracy is an associate professor of psychology at the University of

4
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.490
British Columbia in Vancouver,
Canada,

5
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.930
where she's also a Michael Smith Foundation for health research scholar and a

6
00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:19.840
Canadian Institute for health research new investigator.

7
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.310
She received her phd from the University of California Davis in 2005.

8
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.620
Doctor Tracy's research focuses on emotions and emotion expressions and in

9
00:00:29.621 --> 00:00:33.700
particular on the self conscious emotions of pride,
shame and guilt.

10
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.660
Dr Tracy's research has been covered by numerous media outlets,

11
00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:40.930
including ABC's Good Morning America and prs,

12
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:45.820
all things considered the New York Times,
the Los Angeles Times,
the Boston Globe,

13
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:50.650
the economist,
the New Scientist,
and scientific American among many others.

14
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.750
So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Doctor Jessica Tracy.

15
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.230
So welcome Jess.
Thanks for speaking today.

16
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.010
<v 1>Thank you.
Thanks for having me.</v>

17
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.520
So I thought what we could do is start off a little bit by asking you about what

18
00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:09.170
first got you interested in emotion in the first place.
Sure,
yeah.
Um,

19
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:12.980
so I started Grad school in the late nineties,
early two thousands,

20
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.040
and at that time,
emotion was sort of the hot topic.

21
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.180
I think it's still pretty hot,

22
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.900
but at that time it was the new thing that kind of everyone was studying.

23
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.840
And I learned that,
you know,
kind of upon entering Grad school.

24
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.790
And it was great because emotion,

25
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.630
something that I've sort of had this kind of intrinsic interest in.

26
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.970
And I think that's for a couple of reasons.

27
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:35.270
One is that I've always kind of been most interested in basic level processes,

28
00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:40.130
things that sort of go on in the mind,
the direct everything else.
Um,
I think my,

29
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.790
my sort of orientation has always been,
you know,

30
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.030
how could I study something complex like relationships or group behavior without

31
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:50.240
first knowing what's going on within one person's mind.
It's guiding all that.

32
00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:53.270
And I'm amazed by people who do work on that stuff.
Cause I,
you know,

33
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.350
that's sort of my,
that's the way I understand things.
Um,
and so,
you know,

34
00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:58.640
I think emotions are so essential.

35
00:01:58.641 --> 00:02:01.760
They shaped so much of what we do and what we want and how we think and behave.

36
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.910
And at the time,
you know,
at the time I got into studying them,

37
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.210
I feel like there was actually sort of a perfect amount of scientific

38
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:08.870
understanding.

39
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.130
There'd been all this great work done by people that Pollock men and uh,

40
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.360
Richard Lazarus and Bob Levinson and,
and you know,

41
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:17.330
at that point we knew emotions were biological and they could be studied through

42
00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:20.660
the scientific method,
but there was still also a great deal of mystery.

43
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.770
And I think there still is.

44
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.250
And to me that's always made them sort of this really fascinating topic of

45
00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:27.110
inquiry.
So very cool.

46
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:30.320
So I won't ask you some questions about your own research where you've really

47
00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:34.460
been a pioneer in this domain of self conscious emotions.
So,
I mean,

48
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:37.280
like I'm saying you've just connected some of the most influential work in this

49
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:40.280
domain and as an expert in self conscious emotions,

50
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:43.820
I wanted to just sort of pick your brain and ask you sort of what do you see as

51
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:46.130
the most important or you know,

52
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:50.600
unique features of self conscious emotions?
Yeah,

53
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:52.640
so I would say subconscious motions,

54
00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:55.280
the way that I've always defined them and I think this is consistent with

55
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.650
definitions that are out there.
The way they,

56
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.550
the reason that they differ from other emotions is because of the south.

57
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.750
And that sort of goes with the name.

58
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:05.410
But the idea is that to feel as self conscious emotion you have to make a self

59
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:09.160
evaluation,
which means you have to use for the ice self,

60
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:12.640
the self that's the reflector and actually reflect on the self,

61
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.860
which is sort of yourself representations,
your identity,
your self concept.
Um,

62
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.270
and once you start doing that,
you know,
you make a self evaluation essentially.

63
00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:22.240
You sort of think,
well,
how does the,
I feel about the me?

64
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:25.750
Do I feel good about myself that I just do a good thing or a bad thing?

65
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.770
And that results in emotions like shame,
guilt,
pride,
embarrassment and so on.

66
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.250
And you know,
I think that's a very unique feature.
These emotions,

67
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.330
other emotions like anger,
fear,
sadness,
absolutely can involve self evaluations,

68
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:38.200
but they don't have to,

69
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.990
that you can experience fear without thinking about yourself at all.

70
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.880
Whereas for these emotions you have to,

71
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.520
and I think that makes them unique and it also makes them,

72
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.660
I didn't really interesting,

73
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:50.350
especially as a social personality psychologist cause they're kind of

74
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.490
intricately interwoven with some of the processes that we all care most about.

75
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:59.260
Right.
Things like self esteem,
narcissism,
self concept formation,
self awareness,

76
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.470
um,
all kinds of interesting stuff that,
um,

77
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.890
I think lots of self or self researchers for sure.
But social researcher.

78
00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:06.550
So I've always been interested in so,

79
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.580
<v 0>so what do you think are some of the most important next steps then?</v>

80
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:13.630
Is this field of self conscious emotions kind of,
you know,
charts ahead,
you know,

81
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:15.340
forward.
Yeah.

82
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:16.351
<v 1>Um,
you know,</v>

83
00:04:16.351 --> 00:04:19.890
I think there's been a good body of evidence building suggesting that at least

84
00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:24.690
too self conscious emotions,
pride and shame are biological,
uh,
universal,

85
00:04:24.691 --> 00:04:28.800
probably a Nate,
um,
this means that they're likely to be adaptations.

86
00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:32.430
And this is kind of how I study stuff is sort of very evolutionary perspective.

87
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.740
And so from that angle,
you know,
I think one big question is,
um,
you know,

88
00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:41.370
to what extent are these emotions sort of as core or basic as an emotion,

89
00:04:41.371 --> 00:04:45.390
like anger or fear?
And to some,
to some extent this is sort of a semantic issue.

90
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.780
Um,
you know,
some things are innate and evolve.
It's an eight and above.

91
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.520
It doesn't really matter how core basic it is,
whatever that means.

92
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.210
Let me look again.

93
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.450
I think that neuroscience can be really useful in terms of figuring out what's

94
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:57.900
different in the brain when you experience something like pride versus
happiness.

95
00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.250
There's gotta be a difference,
right?

96
00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:00.840
Otherwise they wouldn't be different emotions.

97
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.510
So what is that difference and how does that help us understand the difference

98
00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.190
between these two emotions?
Um,

99
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:07.330
I think cross species where it could also be really useful.

100
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.690
What other animals do we see these kinds of emotions in?

101
00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:11.280
What did the evolutionary precursors,

102
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.240
and then I think in a whole other direction,
social,
uh,

103
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.740
social effects of these emotions,
right?

104
00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:20.350
There's been a lot of work on the social impact of various emotions and,

105
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.610
and growing body of work on the social impact of pride and shame and guilt.

106
00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:24.740
And I think that's where,
you know,

107
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.810
much more is needed because I think these are some of the most important

108
00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:30.360
emotions that we have in terms of shaping social behavior,
right?

109
00:05:30.361 --> 00:05:33.060
How we are in our relationships,
how we are as groups.
Um,

110
00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:36.630
and they have huge effects on things like,
you know,
prejudice,
war,
patriotism,

111
00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:37.410
all kinds of stuff.

112
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.350
And so I think that that's a really kind of exciting direction for staff.

113
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.650
<v 0>So,
I mean,
in this realm,
I mean,</v>

114
00:05:42.651 --> 00:05:44.930
what's really exciting is some of the work you've done,
right?

115
00:05:44.931 --> 00:05:46.160
So you've conducted this,
you know,

116
00:05:46.161 --> 00:05:50.690
someone will work sort of systematically describing and empirically documenting

117
00:05:50.691 --> 00:05:54.320
the nature of pride.
Right?
And I wonder for those of us,
we all have,

118
00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:56.990
may have some sort of intuition of what pride is,
but you,

119
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.160
what are the core features

120
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.360
<v 1>of pride really,
you know,</v>

121
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:04.050
from the scientific perspective that you've taken for the first time?
Yeah,
no,

122
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.860
thanks.
Um,
so yeah,
so when I started getting pride,

123
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:10.280
we kind of built on definitions that were out there largely from appraisal

124
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:13.010
theorist,
people like Richard Lazarus who said,
well,

125
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:16.460
pride is the emotion you experience when you've done something you feel good

126
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:18.530
about or you are someone that you feel good about,
right?

127
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:21.860
Basically it's a positive self evaluation.
And so taking it from that,

128
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:24.560
we kind of did a bunch of research to find,
well first of all,

129
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.540
actually there's two different ways of feeling pride,
right?

130
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:28.280
There's what we call authentic pride,

131
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.830
which is feeling good about something you did right?

132
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.210
And then there's hubristic pride,

133
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:34.250
which is more feeling good about who you are as a person.

134
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:37.520
It's a little bit more arrogant,
a little bit more global and stable.
Um,

135
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.650
and it turns out that these two kinds of pride are really different,

136
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.080
both in terms of how they feel,

137
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.040
but also in terms of what kinds of social effects they have rights.

138
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.780
They lead to different behaviors.
When you feel hubristic pride,

139
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.450
you actually become less empathic toward others.

140
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:52.890
And you might even feel prejudice against people who are different from

141
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.970
authentic pride actually promotes all kinds of pro social behaviors.

142
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.610
And they had divergent personality correlates as well.

143
00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:01.880
So people who tend to feel authentic pride are agreeable and conscientious and

144
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:05.690
high achieving versus people who tend to feel hubristic pride are much more

145
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.860
aggressive,
a disagreeable intolerant,
that sort of thing.

146
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.220
So it's really kind of interesting distinction.
Um,

147
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.140
and then I guess the other kind of main finding I've,

148
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.540
I've done is that their pride is expressed through,
you know,

149
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:20.580
it's distinct nonverbal signal,
which is reliable,

150
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.200
recognized as displayed by people all over the world.
So yeah,
I was going to ask,

151
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:26.870
to what extent do you think pride really is this,
you know,
cultural,

152
00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:31.730
universal emotion?
You know what I mean?
The data would suggest it is.
I think,

153
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:34.280
you know,
we,
we've done studies where we went to Burkina Faso,

154
00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:35.390
which is west Africa,

155
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.150
and found that the people who live in a teeny little tribe there in the middle

156
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:40.730
of nowhere,
they almost never seen a white person.

157
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.150
You showed them photos of the pride expression and they recognize it and they

158
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:46.600
recognize it as well as they recognize pretty other every other,

159
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.200
pretty much every other emotion that we showed them,

160
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.080
which to me is fairly convincing.
Yeah.
Um,

161
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:54.440
we've also found that people all over the world spontaneously displayed this

162
00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:58.240
expression.
I'm like doing it now.
Your success,
it's hard.

163
00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.750
It's hard to talk about it and not do it.
But

164
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.010
so people all over the world spontaneously show it.

165
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.010
And that even holds for people who are congenitally blind.

166
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.860
So these are people who never seen anyone show the pride expression.

167
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.710
And yet after they've had a success,
that's exactly what they do.

168
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.130
And it's hard to come up with an explanation of why these people are,

169
00:08:16.131 --> 00:08:19.520
how they would have come to learn about it if it wasn't sort of an innate

170
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:23.420
universal phenomenon.
So fascinating.
I mean,
I know you've also done some work.

171
00:08:23.421 --> 00:08:26.780
I wonder if you could say a little bit about how to displace of pride even

172
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:29.510
influence things,
you know,
as a sort of,
you know,

173
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:34.370
socially gigantic in terms of influencing social power or status.

174
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.420
How can that display,
you know,
do just that,
right?
Yeah,
right.

175
00:08:38.421 --> 00:08:41.270
Well let's certainly,
that's an idea that's been around for a long time.
I think,

176
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.150
you know,
as early as people began thinking about pride and psychology,

177
00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:45.820
which isn't actually that early,
um,

178
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.470
they sort of talked about it as a high power emotion or status emotion and,

179
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.890
and work that I've done with [inaudible] Sharif.

180
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.470
What we've found is that when people show the pride expression,

181
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:59.830
other people on seeing it have this automatic really unavoidable tendency to

182
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:04.920
assume that the person showing it deserves high status and this tendency to see

183
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:06.300
the pride expression as high status.

184
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.200
Do you need to pry be compared probably with lots of other emotions including

185
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.510
things like happiness and anger,
which are also pretty powerful.
Emotions,

186
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.430
pride RB to them.

187
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:19.200
And then we found that even if people know that the person showing pride doesn't

188
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:22.680
deserve high status.
So for example,
we had a homeless person showing pride.

189
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.170
This is sort of the lowest status segment of society.

190
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.740
And we had a businessperson and it turns out that when the homeless person shows

191
00:09:28.741 --> 00:09:31.060
pride,
he and his case was he,

192
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:35.190
he is perceived to be as high status as a business person who shows chain,

193
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.260
which is the low status motion.
Wow.
Yeah.

194
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:40.050
So I mean it really shows the piece emotions have these incredibly strong

195
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:43.980
effects that can overwhelm sort of rational judgment that we based on contextual

196
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:46.950
cues.
And we found that the effect of pride on status,

197
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:51.150
perceptions generalize across cultures as well.
So for this one we went to Fiji,

198
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.530
another sort of highly isolated small scale society in Fiji.

199
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.820
It's very isolated.
And we did this automaticity study where we had laptops,

200
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:03.420
which these people had never used and we measured the reaction times and sure

201
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:07.650
enough,
they also associated the pride expression with high status very reliably.

202
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.370
Oh Wow.
That's fascinating.
It was like,
and just,

203
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.040
I love how you're conducting your work.
Just all around the world too.

204
00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:16.470
Cause I think so much of understanding and motion is understanding the different

205
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.040
potential cultural influences or to what extent your findings are robust to

206
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:23.840
culture.
Right?
And that they're universal.
Yeah,
absolutely.
And I,
you know,

207
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.210
I mean I have sort of more taken a universalist sort of perspective,

208
00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:29.610
but I think there's lots of stuff that's influenced by culture.

209
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.340
Self conscious emotions are absolutely influenced by culture and you know,

210
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.060
that's incredibly important too.
So it's important to you.

211
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.420
I wanted to ask about one other really important demand of work you've done that

212
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:40.430
I've been reading about.

213
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.860
I know a lot of other people have that's just got really important behavioral

214
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:45.330
health,
you know,
consequences.

215
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:49.500
So you've been looking at to what extent self conscious emotions like shame can

216
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:54.501
actually predict things like relapse or worsening among alcoholics in terms of

217
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.340
severity.
I wonder if you could say a little bit more about this.
Yeah,
no,
that's,

218
00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:00.270
I'm glad you asked about that.

219
00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:04.200
That's a really new study that we have that I'm super excited about.
Um,
yeah.

220
00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:07.200
So what I did keep his project was,
um,
we kind of had,

221
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.140
I'd been studying shame for awhile and you know,
you get,

222
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.870
you get people who are undergrads to write about their shame experiences,

223
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.660
they're good.
You know,
so you get stories like,
oh,
I broke up with my girlfriend,

224
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.750
I felt really bad.
I forgot to call my mom.
It's good shame.

225
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.290
It's not sort of real intense shame.
And so thinking about this,
I thought,
well,

226
00:11:22.291 --> 00:11:22.501
you know,

227
00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:26.670
people who are coming from addiction addiction is so linked to shame as a

228
00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:28.170
clinical psychologist,
I'm sure you know that.

229
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:32.520
And the kind of shame experiences that people who are recovering from alcoholism

230
00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:32.911
have.

231
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:36.330
I'm just almost in a different realm from the undergrads that we are looking at.

232
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.450
So what we did was we did this study where we had alcoholics recovering

233
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:43.470
alcoholics come into the lab and talk about the last time they drank and felt

234
00:11:43.471 --> 00:11:46.320
badly about themselves for it.
So it's sort of a shame induction procedure,

235
00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:49.590
but it's almost getting it shame specifically about their addiction.

236
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.040
And the theory behind this is,
um,
you know,
a lot of people,

237
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.050
especially policymakers,

238
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.010
and there's a number of judges out there who sort of said,
well,

239
00:11:57.011 --> 00:11:59.650
if you did something wrong,
you should feel shame about it.
And in fact,

240
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:02.110
that's exactly how you stopped doing that wrong thing.

241
00:12:02.111 --> 00:12:04.720
You feel badly about it and then you fix,
you fix it.

242
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.140
And while that may be true for guilt and June Tangney has done a lot of work

243
00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:11.770
showing that guilt has all these positive effects in the moral domain for shame.

244
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:14.620
It's,
it's less clear that that's the case because when you feel shame,

245
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.450
you sort of feel like this bad person.

246
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.180
And how did they make you want to fix things?

247
00:12:19.181 --> 00:12:20.830
It makes you want to hide and run away.

248
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.550
And drinking alcohol for an addict is a great way of running away.

249
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:27.730
It's a really good escape.
And so our predictions were that will actually,

250
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:31.210
if you feel shame about your addiction from alcohol or your addiction to
alcohol,

251
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.740
it's not going to make you stop drinking.

252
00:12:32.741 --> 00:12:35.620
It's actually going to have the reverse effect and make you kind of feel like

253
00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:39.600
you need to escape that shame perhaps by drinking more.
Yeah.

254
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.650
So what we did was we had these alcoholics coming to the lab,

255
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.120
they've been sober about three months,

256
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:46.240
so newly sober and the relapse rate for people who've been sober about three

257
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:50.590
months is incredibly high overall.
Um,
it's just that sort of how it works.
Um,

258
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.740
and the human allowed me to talk about the last time they drank and felt bad

259
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:56.680
about it and we,
we,
we videotaped them all.

260
00:12:56.681 --> 00:12:59.440
They did that and then we measured their nonverbal behaviors.

261
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.870
And the great thing about shame is you can actually measure it from people's

262
00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:05.630
behaviors.
It's associated with things like a head tilt down,
shoulders slump,

263
00:13:05.631 --> 00:13:08.920
chest narrow.
Yeah,
exactly right.

264
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.220
So we had a team of coders rate the extent to which they showed shame.

265
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.120
We then had everyone will come back about four months later.
It varied,

266
00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:18.610
but on average it was four months later.
And when they came back,

267
00:13:18.611 --> 00:13:21.100
we measured their health and we measured their health the first time to with

268
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:21.934
your questionnaires.

269
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.020
And we also asked them about whether they had drank since the last visit.

270
00:13:26.021 --> 00:13:27.970
Now we didn't say,
did you drink since?
Since the last visit?

271
00:13:27.971 --> 00:13:31.060
Because that's sort of a question.
It's a little bit almost biased.

272
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.820
Instead we just asked one of the last time you drank and you figured it out from

273
00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:37.330
that.
And we also asked,
how many drinks did you have over the past three months?

274
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:37.600
I mean,

275
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.180
we give them a calendar and they had to fill it when people are generally pretty

276
00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:43.630
good at remembering this kind of thing and you give him a calendar.
Um,

277
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.740
what we found was that the extent to which they showed shame and their bodies at

278
00:13:47.741 --> 00:13:51.730
that first session strongly predicted whether they had relapsed when they came

279
00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:55.630
back three months later,
four months later.
And for those who did relapse,
the,

280
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.990
the extent of shame that they showed predicted how many drinks they had.

281
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:00.970
In other words,
how bad the relapse was.

282
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.490
And that's even getting rid of the people who did relapse at all.

283
00:14:03.491 --> 00:14:07.660
So it's not driven by that.
And they also have worst health.
Um,
so,

284
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:11.170
so it's really consistent with what we expected that in fact shame seems to be a

285
00:14:11.171 --> 00:14:12.940
predictor for relapse.

286
00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:16.660
And we controlled for all kinds of other variables that might be sort of third

287
00:14:16.661 --> 00:14:20.620
factor stuff that could contribute to both like depression and low self esteem.

288
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.600
None of that was was accounting for this.

289
00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:25.480
It's really the shame behaviors we think that are driving this effect.

290
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.770
That's fascinating.

291
00:14:26.771 --> 00:14:30.280
With such important translational health outcomes too that you can link from the

292
00:14:30.281 --> 00:14:34.240
basic science worlds who you know,
the mental health world.
Yeah,

293
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.220
no I would love that.
You know,
I'm not in clinical scientist,

294
00:14:36.221 --> 00:14:38.620
but I love the idea that I'm actually doing something that could help people.

295
00:14:38.621 --> 00:14:41.170
That's not something I've done in the past.
So it's exciting.

296
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.800
So I mean you've really done just this beautiful body of work from like just

297
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:48.640
really bringing the,
the field of self conscious of emotions to life,

298
00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:52.520
looking at pride and then this recent work on shame and leaking it to
alcoholism.

299
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.880
And as you think about sort of where the field was,
when you started,

300
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.480
where you've come,
you know,
during that time,
if you look ahead sort of,

301
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:04.240
where do you see the future of this field going?
You have to get questioned.

302
00:15:04.241 --> 00:15:08.630
You know what I mean?
I think the easiest answer to that is more neuroscience.

303
00:15:08.631 --> 00:15:09.170
But you know,

304
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.600
the reason it's the easy answer is because that's been the answer since I got

305
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:14.870
into the field.
And in fact when I got into the field,

306
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:17.690
I was told if you're going to study emotions you're going to have to do

307
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:20.940
neuroscience.
And you know,
I have no problem with neuroscience.

308
00:15:20.941 --> 00:15:23.840
It's just never been my thing.
And so far I haven't gotten into it.

309
00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:26.030
I'm getting more into it sort of physiological stuff.

310
00:15:26.031 --> 00:15:29.060
I've done some research cortisol.
Um,
but you know,

311
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:31.590
I haven't gotten into the hardcore neuroscience stuff and I think,
you know,
it,

312
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:36.200
I do want to point out that you can do really important emotion work just by

313
00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:37.730
looking at behavior.
I think,
you know,

314
00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:40.570
behaviors incredibly important window into this stuff and,

315
00:15:40.571 --> 00:15:44.630
and that will never change.
So,
um,
so there is that.
Um,
and you know,

316
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:48.740
I think what I would say is,
I guess,
I don't know if this is the actual future,

317
00:15:48.741 --> 00:15:51.020
but maybe my hope for the future is,
um,

318
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:55.700
I'd like to see more sort of ecologically valid work,
maybe more field work.

319
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.990
I think that,
you know,
like all,
um,
certainly all social psychology,

320
00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:03.290
but maybe all social and cognitive and a broad range of fields,

321
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.800
aspect of science has been really kind of taking place in the lab,
right?

322
00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:07.850
It's so experimental.

323
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.550
And then some point important and emotions are something that I think are great

324
00:16:10.551 --> 00:16:13.310
to study with experiments because we can manipulate them for the most part.

325
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.850
But I think that what goes on in the lab is really different than what goes on

326
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:17.570
in the real world.

327
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.630
And I think we really need more studies going on in the real world,

328
00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:23.990
measuring actual emotions that occur out there with different populations,

329
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:25.570
not just on the grads,
you know,

330
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.630
basically studying people in their natural habitat.

331
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.620
So I guess my hope for the future,
it's a good hope for the future.

332
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.770
And so when you have students come to you and ask you for advice who are

333
00:16:33.771 --> 00:16:38.240
thinking about embarking in this field,
what do you tell them?
Um,
I guess,

334
00:16:38.241 --> 00:16:42.400
you know what I would say is the thing you could start by doing is reading.
Um,

335
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.480
I think that's the most important thing.
You know,
when I,

336
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.240
when I started Grad School in 1999,

337
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.060
the first thing I did when I wanted to study emotions was I read this big book

338
00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:54.630
that came out in 1995 by Ekman and Richie Davidson.
That was this questions.

339
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.480
But you probably know this book.
Yeah.
And it,

340
00:16:56.481 --> 00:16:59.870
so they have like kind of 10 or 12 questions about emotions and then they had

341
00:16:59.871 --> 00:17:02.840
all the leading emotion researchers give their little answer to the questions.

342
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:06.920
It's totally out of date now.
But it was great because,
you know,
he told me,
okay,

343
00:17:06.921 --> 00:17:08.150
here are the major issues,
right?

344
00:17:08.151 --> 00:17:10.790
The questions and here's what each thinker thinks and hear the debates.

345
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:15.020
And I just felt like I learned so much about the field from reading that book.

346
00:17:15.021 --> 00:17:17.960
I don't think they've,
they've done a new additional where they should,
but um,

347
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.990
you know,
the handbook of aspect of science,
handbook of emotions,

348
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.430
all those kinds of things.
I think you're,

349
00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:25.850
you're going to get the leading experts telling you what the big issues are and

350
00:17:25.851 --> 00:17:28.850
what their opinion on those issues are.
And,
and that's,
I think the way to start.

351
00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:32.030
You've got to know what we know before.
You can kind of move on from that.

352
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.540
And then,
you know,
read,
read journals,
read the journal emotion,
right.

353
00:17:35.541 --> 00:17:39.080
I think it's a great journal.
It's a really good resource.
And um,
you know,

354
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.360
if you're,
if you're interested in this is what you want to study,

355
00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:45.800
you should be reading at least the titles and maybe abstracts of every issue,

356
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:46.131
you know,

357
00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:48.290
to know what's going on in there and then the articles for the ones that you're

358
00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:50.070
actually interested in.
So reading,

359
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.020
<v 0>I would say that's,
that's the way to start reading.
Excellent.
Well,</v>

360
00:17:55.021 --> 00:17:57.870
I want to say thanks for speaking today,
just,
it's been really,

361
00:17:57.871 --> 00:18:01.050
really awesome talking to you.
No problem.
Happy to do it.
Yeah.

362
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.890
So this concludes our experts in emission interview with Doctor Jessica Tracy

363
00:18:04.891 --> 00:18:08.130
from the University of British Columbia and Vancouver.
Thanks again.
