00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.730
Welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.750
Today we'll be answering the question of what is an emotion?

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.100
So William James said to the psychologists alone,

4
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.960
can such questions occur as,

5
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.200
why do we smile when pleased and not scowl?

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.730
Why are we unable to talk to a crowd as we talked to a single friend,

7
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.260
why does a particular maiden Turner with upside down?

8
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.490
<v 1>Okay,</v>

9
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.700
<v 0>the common man can only say,
of course we smile.</v>

10
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.970
Of course our heart palpitates at the side of the crowd.

11
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.370
Of course we love the maiden and so probably does each animal feel about the

12
00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:45.080
particular things it tends to do in the presence of certain objects.

13
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.110
So today we're going to answer this question that William James brought up long

14
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:56.280
ago of what is an emotion?
Because you can see here on our roadmap,

15
00:00:56.281 --> 00:01:01.080
we'll do it as follows.
We'll first discuss some early theories of emotion,

16
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.480
then the components of what an emotion responses followed by two different

17
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:09.480
approaches to classify the landscape of emotion,

18
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.070
followed by some takeaway questions of the main points covered in our brief

19
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:14.904
lecture today.

20
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.990
And finally with an expert interview of an emotion scholar in the field.

21
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.230
So let's begin here with theories of emotion.

22
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.750
So what I'm going to do here is approach this question by time traveling

23
00:01:28.751 --> 00:01:33.640
together to see how different scholars thought about what an emotion was and how

24
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:37.300
these theories have you evolved over time,
starting in ancient Greek,

25
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.840
going through the enlightenment,
then to Darwin.

26
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.600
<v 1>Okay,</v>

27
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.710
<v 0>William James,</v>

28
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.360
his predecessor's can embark Schachter singer and concluding with some cognitive

29
00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:48.620
theories by Lazarus.

30
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.540
So let's start first here with ancient Greek approaches to the question of what

31
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.600
is an emotion.
So as you can see here,

32
00:01:56.601 --> 00:02:01.040
theories about emotion stretch back as far as the stoics of ancient Greece,

33
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.200
some of the main points to take home.

34
00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:07.790
When you think about how did they answer the question of what is an emotion is

35
00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:11.210
first looking at Hippocrates,
who said there were four humors,

36
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.010
the four humors were black bile,
yellow bile,
phlegm and blood.

37
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.080
And emotional health really consisted of a balance between all these four
humors.

38
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.660
And when these forking Mers,
we're out of balance,

39
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.690
both mental and physical disease could take over.

40
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

41
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.390
<v 0>Aristotle really advocated this principle of moderation,</v>

42
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.010
essentially saying that part of what an emotion is and part of what sort of

43
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:39.980
predicts emotional health is finding a balance,

44
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.120
not having too little emotion or having too much emotion.

45
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.600
And so he's stressed at this was a really important principle of emotional

46
00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:50.210
functioning.
Both of these theories,
however,

47
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:55.211
still saw emotions as somewhat inferior to or in conflict with both reason and

48
00:02:55.761 --> 00:02:59.980
rationality.
Next,
we move into

49
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.710
<v 1>the enlightenment.
So during the enlightenment period,</v>

50
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:06.820
we see this flourishing of intellectual attention devoted to really trying to

51
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.230
pinpoint or understand what an emotion is.

52
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.410
And here we see philosophers such as de Carte spinosa and Hume really trying to

53
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:21.400
kind of get in deep to think about what an emotion is.
And for example,

54
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.460
Descartes,
uh,

55
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.250
he provided an intricate techsonomy of emotions or description of their bodily

56
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:31.090
causes,
their effects and functions in his text,

57
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.770
the passions of the soul.
Yeah,

58
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.770
<v 0>perspectives on emotions from an evolutionary perspective were initiated in the</v>

59
00:03:39.771 --> 00:03:42.800
19th century by Charles Darwin.
In his book,

60
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.920
the expression of emotions in man and animals.

61
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.180
Darwin really advocated that emotions are not simply irrational,

62
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.620
that they actually serve an important purpose for us as humans in both

63
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.920
communication and also an aiding in our survival.

64
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.600
So he therefore argued that emotions is did evolve via natural selection and

65
00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:06.530
that they were not specific to humans and that we also see them in animals as

66
00:04:06.531 --> 00:04:07.190
well.

67
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.110
So this worth thinking about this evolutionary approach to emotion really paved

68
00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:13.550
the way for future research,

69
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.180
not only trying to understand the function of emotion across time,

70
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.460
but also for more recent.

71
00:04:19.461 --> 00:04:24.461
There is looking at the physical and neurobiological kind of underpinnings of

72
00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:25.820
emotion today.

73
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.620
<v 0>They go through time.</v>

75
00:04:28.621 --> 00:04:32.970
We are now back to William James seen as the father of psychology in many ways.

76
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.880
When he thought about the question of what is an emotion,

77
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.530
he advocated what we think of is now as the physiological approach.

78
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.600
So he really argued that,
uh,

79
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.810
the essence of emotions is a physiological response and that each emotion has a

80
00:04:47.941 --> 00:04:52.080
specific sort of profile in the body.
Certain patterns of heart rates,

81
00:04:52.081 --> 00:04:54.600
certain patterns of muscle tension.
And in this way,

82
00:04:54.601 --> 00:04:59.550
emotions are really secondary to sort of bodily or physiological phenomena.

83
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.510
So he would argue,
for example,
that you might have a stimulus in the environment,

84
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.160
a snake,
as you can see here,

85
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.030
followed by a certain physiological response in the body,

86
00:05:09.031 --> 00:05:10.710
such as your heart rate increasing.

87
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.030
And that that is what would lead to the experience of an emotion such as fear.

88
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.540
He worked with this student to sort of further push this idea of the

89
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:23.970
physiological approach and together,
um,

90
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.830
they wrote that the perception of bodily states as they occur is the emotion.

91
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

92
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.150
<v 0>Later theories by Canon and Bard suggested,
well,</v>

93
00:05:35.151 --> 00:05:40.151
no emotions are not simply physiological phenomena and that as you can see here,

94
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.980
physiological responses alone cannot explain emotion experience.

95
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.730
So this theory really argued that,
uh,
instead,

96
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.640
physiological responses are too slow.

97
00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:55.910
It takes a while for our heart rate to increase and often imperceptible.

98
00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.090
So this can not for our relatively rapid and intense emotions that often come

99
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:04.220
online.
So this theory one is falls.

100
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:07.340
You'd see a stimulus just as you see a snake here.

101
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.050
This would be followed by certain patterns of subcortical brain activation,

102
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.440
sort of registering and getting that input that this is a snake in the

103
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:16.274
environment.

104
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.360
And this would be followed by the almost simultaneous experience of both your

105
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:24.710
physiological responses kicking into gear such as your heart rate increasing as

106
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:28.280
well as the experience or subjective quality of fear.

107
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.700
Schachter and singer then came along and propose what they called a two factor

108
00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:36.720
theory of emotion.

109
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.500
So here they said the appraisal of the physiological experience defines and

110
00:06:42.871 --> 00:06:46.200
determines the emotion.
So in other words,

111
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.350
they suggested that physiological reactions contribute to emotion experience by

112
00:06:51.691 --> 00:06:55.350
really facilitating a certain kind of cognitive appraisal or way that you

113
00:06:55.351 --> 00:06:57.900
evaluate what's going on in your body.

114
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.050
And that evaluation is what really defines and gives rise to the emotion itself.

115
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.081
So again,

116
00:07:04.081 --> 00:07:08.730
they talked about two factors and emotion or two stages and they go something

117
00:07:08.731 --> 00:07:09.564
like this.

118
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.340
So in the first stage you see physiological arousal in response to an evoking

119
00:07:14.341 --> 00:07:18.480
stimulus such as the snake here.
And then second,

120
00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:22.590
you have what they thought of as a cognitive elaboration or a way in which

121
00:07:22.591 --> 00:07:25.890
you're appraising the meaning of her heart rate increasing.

122
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.280
And it's the way that you think about what that heart rate means.

123
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.630
That simultaneously gives rise to the experience of emotion or fear.

124
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.960
So if you interpret your heart rate as a sign that something's threatening,

125
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.520
you're likely to feel fear.

126
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.100
If you interpret your heart rate is something exciting,

127
00:07:41.101 --> 00:07:44.760
the environment you're less likely to experience experience,
fear,

128
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.030
perhaps more likely to experience something like happiness or joy.

129
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:50.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

130
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.310
<v 0>More recent cognitive theories,
um,</v>

131
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.520
advocated originally by Lazarus here really argued that cognitive activity in

132
00:07:58.651 --> 00:08:01.140
the form of judgements,
evaluations,

133
00:08:01.141 --> 00:08:04.920
or thoughts is necessary for an emotion to occur.

134
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.460
So for example,
again,

135
00:08:08.461 --> 00:08:12.420
you might see a snake in the environment and then what would happen next to you?

136
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.590
So you'd have some sort of cognitive evaluation that the snake is dangerous.

137
00:08:16.591 --> 00:08:19.290
You'd be thinking or evaluating the world is such,

138
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.540
you would see your heart rate increasing,
right?

139
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:26.900
In response to sort of thinking and evaluating cognitively at the snake is

140
00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:30.110
dangerous and that would lead to the fear experience.

141
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.840
So without being able to judge,
evaluate,

142
00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:35.750
or think about a stimulus in the environment such as a snake,

143
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.810
that there is no emotion without cognition.

144
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.740
So we've sort of covered the landscape of some early theories of emotion dating

145
00:08:44.741 --> 00:08:47.440
all the way to more recent cognitive theories of emotion.

146
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.630
Now I'd like to turn to thinking about,

147
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:54.340
well what is the sort of necessary ingredients or components that make up an

148
00:08:54.341 --> 00:08:59.190
emotion response?
So here we'll turn now to the components of emotion.

149
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:00.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

150
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.710
<v 0>So emotions are not one single phenomena.
They have multiple pieces,</v>

151
00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:07.030
multiple components.

152
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:12.220
The first one that you can see here is this idea that emotions have a valence.

153
00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:17.470
This simply means emotions have a flavor to them.
They can be positive,

154
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.020
they can be negative or they can be neutral.

155
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:21.600
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

156
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.670
<v 0>Second,
they have what people call in about nus.
Um,</v>

157
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.270
there's something emotions are about,
um,

158
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.590
this is referred to as in eliciting or an intentional object.

159
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.700
The emotion could be about a snake,
for example,
as we discussed earlier,

160
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.740
but emotions rarely occur without anything to which they're about or that sort

161
00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:42.420
of gets them started or triggered.

162
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.660
This third component really dates back to the early writings of Darwin who said

163
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:52.770
that emotions serve a certain purpose or function,
and in particular,

164
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.260
emotions are vital to our survival.

165
00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.330
They enable us to pursue important goals.
Without having emotions,

166
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.480
we would have a lot of trouble pursuing things,
meaningful tests in our,

167
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.290
in our everyday life.
Then finally,
here on the left,

168
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.910
emotions have multiple components themselves.
So an emotion is online.

169
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:12.930
When it gets started.

170
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.740
There's different pieces to what makeup or characterize and emotion.

171
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:22.020
And let's turn here to this multicomponent response to see exactly what it
means.

172
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.790
So when we think of an emotion,
it has three kind of core pieces or parts.

173
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.520
The first is a subjective experience or quality of what the emotion is.

174
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.780
This is your internal representation or experience of what it feels like to have

175
00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:39.614
an emotion.

176
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.910
Second is the sort of outward display of behavior.

177
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.360
So like this woman here,
when you're feeling a certain emotion,
like fear,

178
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.740
you're likely to show it,

179
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.760
show it in your face and show it in a different kind of bodily actions or

180
00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:57.930
movements that go along with the emotion.
And then finally,

181
00:10:57.931 --> 00:11:02.250
and importantly,
there's physiological aspects to an emotion response.

182
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.390
So we can see this both in our brain as you saw there as well as in our

183
00:11:06.391 --> 00:11:10.740
autonomic nervous system.
So things like showing,
uh,
changes in heart rate,

184
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.860
changes in sweating,
changes in,
in breathing.

185
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.080
So as much as we've talked about what an emotion is,

186
00:11:19.081 --> 00:11:22.110
we've talked about early theories and we've talked about components of an

187
00:11:22.111 --> 00:11:22.944
emotion.

188
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:27.060
I think part of what helps a lot of students really understand what an emotion

189
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:30.330
is,
is also defining what an emotion is not.

190
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.350
So let me tell you a few things that an emotion definitely is not
an emotion,

191
00:11:35.351 --> 00:11:40.270
is not a mood.
So mood,
as you can see here,
is a more long lasting state.

192
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.570
It can last days to weeks to even months.

193
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.310
And unlike an emotion it does not have an about in a state does not have an

194
00:11:48.311 --> 00:11:53.050
intentional or eliciting object.
It's something more diffuse.
So for example,

195
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:58.230
may simply wake up in a bad mood for no particular reason and you may feel that

196
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:03.130
way for some time.
That's more of a mood state,
not an emotion.

197
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.900
Emotion is also not a feeling though in colloquial speak,

198
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:12.460
we often use the term feeling to to refer to motion saying I'm feeling happy or

199
00:12:12.461 --> 00:12:15.400
I'm feeling sad,
but really feeling,
uh,

200
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.330
refers to the subjective representation of an emotion.

201
00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:23.530
This kind of private internal experience to the individual,

202
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.380
whereas an emotion also has a behavioral component.

203
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:28.150
We express emotions in our face.

204
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.360
It also has a physiological response in our bodies.

205
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.430
As you can see here on the right emotion is also not an effect.

206
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.970
So Affleck does this term,
you'll hear a lot as he go through the course.

207
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.340
That's I think of as a broader umbrella.

208
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:47.610
So it's a broader all encompassing term and refers to general topics of emotion,

209
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.020
feelings and moods all together.

210
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.130
So under the broad umbrella of an affect emotion is just one particular

211
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:55.510
component or instance.

212
00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.290
An emotion is also not a personality trait.

213
00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.150
So personality traits are stable individual differences across situations in

214
00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:05.984
time.

215
00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.340
Whereas emotions are these more brief response typically to something external

216
00:13:10.341 --> 00:13:13.250
knee environment or maybe an internal thought or feeling.

217
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.780
And finally,
emotions are not our thoughts or cognitions.
Although cognitions,

218
00:13:19.781 --> 00:13:20.710
as Lazarus said,

219
00:13:20.711 --> 00:13:25.240
can give rise to emotions cognition's themselves or something quite distinct.

220
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:30.430
Cognition's do not have facial expressions and they do not always have

221
00:13:30.431 --> 00:13:34.630
physiological changes in arousal that are accompanied by them.

222
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.400
So we're now going to turn to our third point on the roadmap,

223
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.140
which is looking at different classification systems for trying to organize

224
00:13:44.141 --> 00:13:47.410
these different components and pieces of emotion.

225
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.550
And there's two main classification systems that we'll walk through today.

226
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.450
The first is,
you can see here on the left is a classification system,

227
00:13:55.451 --> 00:14:00.451
often referred to as the basic or discreet classification system for emotion and

228
00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:06.280
hear what you see is the basic nuts and bolts of the theories that emotions are

229
00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:09.790
discreet or specific entities or categories.

230
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:14.620
They're biologically fixed and they're universal to all humans.

231
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.251
Um,

232
00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:19.390
some examples of emotions that fall under this perspective or what they think of

233
00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:24.391
as these basic hardwired emotions that were sort of evolutionarily equipped to

234
00:14:25.061 --> 00:14:29.200
experience,
uh,
and display these include anger,

235
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.940
disgust,
fear,
happiness,
sadness and surprise.

236
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.540
And it's these basic emotions that form the sort of primary colors of emotion

237
00:14:40.001 --> 00:14:44.500
landscape that give rise to more complex emotions.
Um,
things like guilt,

238
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.030
pride,
shame,

239
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:50.710
and these are thought to arise from the combination of basic emotions that are

240
00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:55.370
culturally influenced and constructed.
And as you can see at the bottom,

241
00:14:55.371 --> 00:14:57.350
and that we also have pictures of at the top,

242
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.570
some sample theorists that really sort of champion this basic or discrete

243
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:07.430
classification system where Paul Ekman,
Rene Descartes and Silvan Tomkins.

244
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.900
So this is in contrast with what's referred to as a dimensional classification

245
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:14.080
system to emotion.
So here,

246
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.120
emotions are not individual or specific categories,

247
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.440
but rather they're thought of as a combination of several psychological

248
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:24.200
dimensions.
And you can see here a picture.

249
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.490
This really for refers to two different dimensions of an emotional response.

250
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.000
So we see here a UC unpleasant,
unpleasant.

251
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.450
This is sort of thought of as the valence dimension of emotion.

252
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.600
How pleasant versus how unpleasant our emotions.

253
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.630
And this is contrasted with the arousal dimension.

254
00:15:41.631 --> 00:15:44.660
It says anxiety and at the top and boredom at the bottom,

255
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.340
really we're thinking of how highly arousing our emotions versus how sort of

256
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.130
lethargic or low arousing on are they.

257
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:57.140
You can plot these two dimensions kind of side by side perpendicular and pick

258
00:15:57.141 --> 00:16:01.640
out an emotion depending on where it sort of fits on this emotional landscape.

259
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.380
And here you can also see three kind of commonly associated theorists with the

260
00:16:06.381 --> 00:16:08.630
dimensional account here.
Um,

261
00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.620
you can see the sort of the father of our first psychology laboratory,
uh,

262
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.520
Wilhem want,
uh,
James Russell and Lisa Feldman Barrett.

263
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

264
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.020
<v 0>So now that we've gone through theories of emotion,</v>

265
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.040
components of emotion to major kind of classification,

266
00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:26.120
systems of emotion,

267
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.960
we're going to conclude here with what I refer to as our takeaway questions.

268
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.100
So these should try to help highlight what were some of the main points

269
00:16:33.101 --> 00:16:36.140
discussed today that you want to take home from this.

270
00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:39.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

271
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.570
<v 0>And there'll be three takeaway questions that will go along with each of these</v>

272
00:16:42.571 --> 00:16:43.590
lecture modules.

273
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.640
The takeaway questions for today include one,

274
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:52.350
what are the differences between early emotion theories discussed today?

275
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.550
How are they similar?

276
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:58.790
How are they distinct to what are the three components of an emotion response

277
00:17:00.511 --> 00:17:04.050
that we discussed today?
So when you experience an emotion,

278
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.410
what are three pieces that are happening simultaneously?

279
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:08.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

280
00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:13.780
<v 0>And then finally,
what are the two main emotion classification systems?</v>

281
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.640
What do they each prescribe?

282
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:20.260
What are examples of emotions that arise from them and who are the major emotion

283
00:17:20.261 --> 00:17:21.970
theorists associated with them?

284
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.150
<v 1>Okay,</v>

285
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.900
<v 0>we're going to now conclude with our expert interview who someone we just</v>

286
00:17:28.901 --> 00:17:32.800
referred to in our lecture today when speaking about the dimensional approach to

287
00:17:32.801 --> 00:17:37.630
the question,
what is an emotion?
So let's now turn to our expert interview.

288
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.580
Um,
and this is part of a series called experts in emotion.

289
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.690
What we're going to be exploring questions about emotion through the eyes of

290
00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:49.620
some of the most distinguished scholars in field.

291
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:56.070
I'll be speaking with Dr Lisa Feldman Barrett about the age old question of what

292
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.270
is an emotion?

293
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.710
Dr. Barrett is a distinguished professor of psychology at northeastern

294
00:18:01.711 --> 00:18:06.330
university where she directs the interdisciplinary aspect of science laboratory

295
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.590
and is also the founding editor in chief of the journal Emotion Review.

296
00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:16.200
Doctor Bera is an internationally renowned expert on the nature of emotion and

297
00:18:16.201 --> 00:18:21.201
has authored more than 150 papers and chapters on emotion and emotion

298
00:18:21.271 --> 00:18:25.350
regulation.
She's received numerous rewards for this work.

299
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.330
This includes the NIH director's pioneer award and the career trajectory award

300
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.240
from the society of experimental social psychology.

301
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.860
So I'm going to now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Dr. Barrett

302
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.930
on what is an emotion.
