For experts in emotion interview.

2
00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:06.630
Today we have the honor of speaking with Dr. Tour Waker.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.280
Dr Wagger is the director of the cognitive and affective neuroscience laboratory

4
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:12.880
at the University of Colorado,
Boulder,

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.250
boulder and received his phd from the University of Michigan and cognitive

6
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:20.220
psychology with a focus in cognitive neuroscience.

7
00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:25.140
In 2003 he joined the Faculty of Columbia University as an assistant professor

8
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:30.141
in 2004 and was appointed associate professor in 2009 and recently in 2010 he

9
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:34.470
joined the Faculty of the Department of Psychology and neuroscience at the

10
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:36.980
University of Colorado Boulder.
Uh,

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.200
doctor wiggers research focuses on how expectations shape responses to pain and

12
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:43.980
emotion in the brain and body.

13
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.340
His work integrates new and novel analytic and Mehta analytic methods,

14
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.720
f Mri and psychophysiology.

15
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.940
He's published over 60 articles and received numerous awards including

16
00:00:56.941 --> 00:01:00.330
innovation award from the social and aspect of neuroscience society,

17
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.610
as well as the Janet Taylor Spence award from the association for Psychological

18
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.820

His work has been highly featured in media outlets,

19
00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:12.870
including the New York Times,
La Times,
National Geographic,

20

the Huffington post,
science,
daily,
CNN,
and more.

21
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.330
So I now turn with great pleasure to our experts and emotion interview with

22
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:26.331
Doctor Tor Waker on the question of where exactly is emotion in the brain.

23
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.190
So welcome tour.
Thanks for speaking with us today.

24
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.420
<v 1>Thanks for having me.</v>

25
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.520
<v 0>So what,
I wanted to start out asking you a bit about what sort of,</v>

26
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.340
what got you interested in emotion in the first place,

27
00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:42.380
sort of where did the journey begin for you?

28
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.560
<v 1>I've been interested in emotion for a long time.</v>

29
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.280
I started off studying cognitive controlling graduate school and working memory.

30
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.840
And that's important stuff,

31
00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:57.370
but emotion is really important because I think it's an organizing principle

32
00:01:57.371 --> 00:02:01.750
that guides how we structure our lives and our everyday interactions.

33
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.250
So I think that's why I've been guided towards that for years now.

34
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.220
All right,

35
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.760
<v 0>cool.
So I wanted the nasty a little bit about where the years have taken you,</v>

36
00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:13.790
you know,
since he's gotten interested in this topic.
So,
I mean,

37
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.010
you've done a lot of things and um,

38
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.230
so where do I begin asking you about your work is always a challenge because you

39
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:20.810
done so many exciting things.

40
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:24.320
But one of the things I want to start with is just your work where you've

41
00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:26.450
conducted this really impressive,
you know,

42
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:30.650
and widely influential Meta analysis on the neuroanatomy of emotion,

43
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.300
particularly in the human brain.

44
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.570
And I wondered if you could just say a little bit in doing this,
you know,

45
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:36.410
Meta analysis,

46
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:40.730
what you found to be some of the most exciting discoveries out there?

47
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.190
<v 1>Um,
yeah,
we,
we started,
uh,
Gosh,</v>

48
00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:50.191
I think about 10 years ago now and we've been continuing to do med analyses and

49
00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:52.030
we have several things that are ongoing.

50
00:02:52.031 --> 00:02:55.690
So it's really a series people started off,

51
00:02:55.691 --> 00:03:00.650
I think with some sort of relatively simple ideas about emotion.
Uh,

52
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.150
it was,

53
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.840
it's been harder to get a handle on emotion then it has other sorts of cognitive

54
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:06.910
phenomena that are easier to study experimentally.

55
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.060
So people had these ideas like,
uh,
the,

56
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.650
the right hemisphere is the emotional hemisphere and there's less right

57
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:16.690
lateralization for positive versus negative emotion.

58
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.030
And what we've found with the met analysis for one thing is that it's much more

59
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:23.790
complicated than that.
Uh,

60
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.300
the pattern of lateralization is more complicated and the pattern of

61
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:30.700
interactions that creates a signature for each,

62
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.230
a different kind of emotion if there is one is I'm not as straight forward to

63
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:40.210
find.
So I think people also started off with the idea that,
uh,

64
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.510
that there's a region that codes for a particular emotion.

65
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:47.770
Like the Amygdala is fear and the insula is discussed.
And,

66
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.280
um,
certainly each of those regions participates in that process.

67
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:56.281
But one of the things that we found is that most of the regions involved in

68
00:03:56.801 --> 00:04:00.310
emotional processes participate in multiple kinds of,
of processes.

69
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:05.311
So I think it points towards the fact that we have a lot more work to do to

70
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:09.220
understand what the signature is of a particular emotional state.

71
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.260
So it's not just the Amygdala,
uh,
um,
it's something much broader.
Uh,

72
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.561
you know,

73
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:17.290
one of the things that led us to believe that is if you look at what the

74
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:21.550
Amygdala response to in human neuroimaging studies that responds to faces,

75
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.130
the making facial expressions of emotion,

76
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.560
they don't even have to be consciously perceived.

77
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.320
And so that's quite different than then identifying,

78
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:32.050
they make the law with the experience of fear.

79
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.740
<v 0>Yeah.
So I mean,
it's interesting,
it sounds like from this med analysis,</v>

80
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.800
the land sort of landscape of where we think about emotion as being sort of,

81
00:04:41.961 --> 00:04:42.320
you know,

82
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.220
placed in the human brain is much more complex than we could ever appreciate.

83
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.620
Um,
and from what you're saying,

84
00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:52.370
it sounds like this met analysis provided an interesting road map for maybe

85
00:04:52.371 --> 00:04:56.360
where researchers should be,
you know,
spending their energy's moving forward.

86
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.791
<v 1>That's right.</v>

87
00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:02.140
It's helped us to evaluate what's consistently coming out in the human neuro

88
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:06.310
imaging literature and,
uh,
and,
and what's not and how,
uh,

89
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.750
how general versus specific are the profiles of activity in different regions

90
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.440
and our future work.
Um,
we're sort of pursuing that.

91
00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:16.750
We're trying to understand is there a signature,

92
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.320
a signature for each different kind of emotional state.

93
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.930
<v 0>That's really exciting.</v>

94
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.810
I mean one of the other things you've been doing that I think is also really

95
00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:29.550
interesting is studying,
you know,
machine learning as sort of one route towards,

96
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.390
you know,
providing specificity as to whether some of these observed patterns,

97
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:36.270
you know,
of neural activity might represent,
you know,

98
00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:40.050
potential biomarkers of underlying aspect of processing.

99
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.990
And this is also an area I think that's a really exciting,

100
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:46.140
really new in this domain.
And I wonder from your perspective,

101
00:05:46.141 --> 00:05:49.920
what are some of the promise that this approach could provide for people trying

102
00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:52.800
to study,
you know,
emotion and the human brain?

103
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.480
<v 1>Great.
So machine learning,
uh,
income.</v>

104
00:05:55.481 --> 00:06:00.150
This is a very broad set of techniques in a very important one for finding

105
00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:05.151
patterns from complex multivariate data and developed in statistics and computer

106
00:06:05.461 --> 00:06:08.530
science for those reasons to find those patterns.
Uh,

107
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.200
I think it's really important the application of those techniques to brain

108
00:06:13.201 --> 00:06:17.940
imaging data in particular.
Um,
because it does a couple things for us.

109
00:06:17.941 --> 00:06:22.941
One is we can ask the questions about is there a unique neuro or brain signature

110
00:06:25.891 --> 00:06:29.520
for a particular type of process,
whether it's pain or sadness.

111
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.030
I don't think we've yet found pain or sadness or joy or disgust in the brain.

112
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.860
We don't really know what time,

113
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.250
what the processes are that contribute to those things and they would probably

114
00:06:41.251 --> 00:06:42.450
differ based on the situation.

115
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.690
So machine learning offers a way forward to anchor our Britain analyses on

116
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.470
these,
uh,
on the outcomes that we care about,

117
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.570
on the psychological outcomes that we care about.

118
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.050
And so that's very exciting and I think,
you know,

119
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.650
it's going to be interesting to see how machine learning and the use of machine

120
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:06.410
learning involves,
uh,
as a trend and in the human neurosciences.

121
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.760
Um,
I think there's a few sort of hold over ideas,
uh,
that are,
are probably,

122
00:07:11.761 --> 00:07:16.410
um,
myths or at least been in some ways they're miss.
Uh,
one of them is that,

123
00:07:16.411 --> 00:07:20.520
um,
the machine learning is a complex procedure that yields are very complicated

124
00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:24.700
pattern and it's hard to understand and it doesn't have to be the case.
Um,

125
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.030
and so I think with the right kinds of,

126
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.150
of judicious use of those techniques,

127
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.200
I really do think that we're going to be able to move forwards towards

128
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:38.530
understanding psychological and,
and um,
and,

129
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.200
and behavioral principles.

130
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.300
<v 0>Exciting.
I mean,</v>

131
00:07:42.301 --> 00:07:45.300
so I mean you've done really neat work dazing Meta analysis techniques,

132
00:07:45.301 --> 00:07:48.630
looking at the role of machine learning and you've also done some work on a

133
00:07:48.631 --> 00:07:53.631
topic that I think is really familiar and controversial to many people,

134
00:07:54.031 --> 00:07:55.920
which is the placebo effect.

135
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.310
And you've done some really interesting work looking at the placebo effect as it

136
00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:01.860
relates to the experience of pain.

137
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.130
And I wondered if you could just say a little bit about these findings that have

138
00:08:05.131 --> 00:08:07.200
really captivated a wide audience.

139
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.953
<v 1>Great.
Um,
I,</v>

140
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:13.970
I've always been fascinated by the ways in which conceptual processes,

141
00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:18.960
things that you think about,
recall from memory,
et Cetera,
can,

142
00:08:18.961 --> 00:08:22.050
can influence a health related outcomes.

143
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.790
And so you could view placebo effects through this lens.
In part,

144
00:08:26.791 --> 00:08:29.910
it's a way of understanding how we can,
you know,
you,

145
00:08:29.911 --> 00:08:32.280
you can actually create a laboratory paradigm where you experimentally

146
00:08:32.281 --> 00:08:36.960
manipulate someone's beliefs about a situation or about the context and then you

147
00:08:36.961 --> 00:08:41.270
can quantify outcomes that are relevant for,

148
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.790
for health and disease in various ways.
And so that's kind of for me,

149
00:08:44.791 --> 00:08:49.530
one of the things that's interesting about placebo effects,
um,
another,

150
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.120
an in a sort of another angle on that is this,
it is clinically relevant.

151
00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:57.990
People haven't yet or they don't understand what happens.
What's,

152
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:01.110
what are the implications of when you give people a placebo treatment in a

153
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:02.970
clinical trial?
Um,

154
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.230
and does the drug just sort of work on top of the placebo if there is a placebo

155
00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:11.880
effect or does it interact with that,
um,
that,
that placebo effect?

156
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.690
And so,
you know,
I think there's,
clinically speaking,

157
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.780
I think there's this opportunity to contribute to a shift from thinking about

158
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.980
drugs and treatments as agents that act on a very simple mechanical system,

159
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:30.981
which is a brain towards thinking about the brain as a very complex,

160
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:32.340
responsive,

161
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:37.341
not just reactive evolving system and the effects of pharmacological treatments

162
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.840
operate in this highly dynamic environment.
So you really,
you know,

163
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:46.950
I think it's the clinical aspect is there's this promise that it can help to put

164
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:47.640
the,

165
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.640
the brain back into biomedicine as a colleague of mine used to say.

166
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.090
Um,
and I think from a psychological perspective,

167
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.120
it's interesting to me because placebo effects a sit at the nexus of conceptual

168
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:07.760
processes and beliefs,
um,

169
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.980
learning processes and memory,

170
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.790
episodic memory retrieval and how you recall context and,

171
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:18.720
and effect and how emotional processes are generated in the brain.

172
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.470
And so I think that they're kind of,
you know,

173
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.480
provides a kind of a window into this central integrative organization of how

174
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.820
we,
how the brain shapes motivation and an effect.
Uh,
and so,

175
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.770
and that makes it complicated to study.

176
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:37.950
But also I think interesting in a lot of different directions.

177
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.720
<v 0>I mean,
one of the interesting things here that people often wonder is sort of,</v>

178
00:10:41.721 --> 00:10:44.780
well how do placebo treatments work in the first place?

179
00:10:44.781 --> 00:10:49.670
Like what are the kind of necessary ingredients or components that really make

180
00:10:49.671 --> 00:10:53.270
placebo treatments work?
And I don't know what your thoughts are on this.

181
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.580
<v 1>Yeah,
I,
you know,
I thought so are evolved.</v>

182
00:10:55.581 --> 00:10:58.760
My thoughts are evolving on that and they've really been shaped by the research

183
00:10:58.761 --> 00:11:02.120
that we're doing.
So I was surprised,
really,

184
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.220
honestly surprised years ago when we did the first studies and found out that,

185
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:11.480
um,
essentially placebo treatments can change the way the brain processes pain.

186
00:11:11.481 --> 00:11:16.130
They can cause changes in endogenous opioid release.
Um,

187
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:21.200
and so how,
how do they work?
I think we're still very much figuring that out.

188
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.880
But some of the things that we now know and I think are really important are,

189
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.340
it's not just about belief.

190
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:33.550
I don't think you can manipulate someone's belief without introducing a placebo

191
00:11:33.801 --> 00:11:37.010
effects on brain processes that are meaningful.

192
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:42.710
And it's not just about conditioning or learning.
It's not sort of a passive,
uh,

193
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.460
you know,

194
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.360
behavioristic kind of process because you can give people all the experiences

195
00:11:47.361 --> 00:11:49.370
that are consistent with a placebo effect.

196
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.350
They should create one and not get that.

197
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:56.770
And so where we're headed now is towards developing models that combine,

198
00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:58.961
uh,

199
00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:03.961
ideas about learning in the brain and plasticity with ideas about conceptual

200
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:04.570
thought.

201
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:09.570
And the basic core idea is that if you have the right kind of belief and you get

202
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:14.770
the right kind of have experience to back it up,
then there is a,

203
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.980
a process of,
uh,

204
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:22.230
changing the response to especially affective and motivational events in the

205
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:24.370
brain.
So that's just a little,

206
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:28.240
a little bit I'm at and we're learning a lot I think right now.

207
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:29.241
<v 0>I mean,</v>

208
00:12:29.241 --> 00:12:32.470
then you talk about all these things you've done in sort of the next steps in

209
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:34.060
what you're learning and where you're going.

210
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.310
And it makes me wonder from your perspective,

211
00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:38.500
someone who really is a leader in this field,
you know,

212
00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:41.620
where do you see the face of the future headed as we,

213
00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:44.440
as we look forward and try to decide where to go next?

214
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.630
<v 1>Well,
I think there are a number of exciting things happening in our field.</v>

215
00:12:48.631 --> 00:12:52.500
Really.
I think there's kind of an explosion.
Um,
for me personally,

216
00:12:52.501 --> 00:12:57.501
one of the things I think is very exciting is the idea of anchoring

217
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:04.460
the psychological concepts of emotion onto brain processes so that we can,

218
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.720
and as we make that mapping between brain and emotion,

219
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:14.820
we can then start to use the brain to understand the emotional processes better.

220
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.700
So I don't think right now we can,

221
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.900
I don't think anybody can really look at a brain scan of any kind and say,
oh,

222
00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:25.230
this person was feeling joyful and this person was feeling melancholy.
Well,

223
00:13:25.231 --> 00:13:29.070
this person was feeling good versus bad.
Um,
and,

224
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.000
but I think that it's possible that we could develop those measures.

225
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.230
And so for me,

226
00:13:34.231 --> 00:13:38.850
I think the idea of anchoring the study of emotions in biology is an extremely

227
00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:39.684
important one.

228
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.840
<v 0>And so when students then come to you and ask,
you know,
where should I be going?</v>

229
00:13:44.841 --> 00:13:47.570
You know,
as I'm embarking in this study of emotion,

230
00:13:47.571 --> 00:13:49.670
or what advice do you have for someone like me,

231
00:13:49.671 --> 00:13:52.430
his thinking about maybe entering this field,
right?

232
00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.050
What do you tell them sort of,

233
00:13:54.051 --> 00:13:57.770
what is your advice to students who are dabbling or thinking about studying

234
00:13:57.771 --> 00:13:59.540
emotion and the human brain?

235
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.293
<v 1>Um,
I,</v>

236
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:06.450
I think that I think everyone thinks in a very different way and each person has

237
00:14:08.921 --> 00:14:12.580
a profile of strengths or weaknesses in the way they think and interests.

238
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.880
And so I guess my advice to students would be to find something that really fits

239
00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:19.650
defined,
uh,

240
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.780
area of study in a way of studying it that plays to your strengths so that

241
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:30.630
you're capitalizing on what you're really excited about.
I think,
you know,

242
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.020
you've got to love what you're doing or,
or find a way to do that.

243
00:14:35.021 --> 00:14:39.280
You don't have to love everything about it.
Um,
but that,
that's kind of my,

244
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.430
you know,
my broad advice.
And you know,
for me personally,
I,

245
00:14:42.431 --> 00:14:47.160
I like to think about the connections between I think what I'm doing and,

246
00:14:47.161 --> 00:14:48.880
and lots of different kinds of areas,

247
00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:52.430
people doing very different kinds of things,
at least as much as possible.
Um,

248
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.880
and I liked the technical development.
Um,

249
00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:58.790
so those things are just exciting to me.
I do them late at night,
but you know,

250
00:14:58.791 --> 00:15:02.270
I find myself still program and you know,

251
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:04.740
not everybody has to be like that.
Um,
but,

252
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.740
but I think each person can find the way in which they really can contribute in

253
00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:12.170
a unique way and,
and fit into that.

254
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:12.930
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

255
00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:17.930
So love what you're doing and also find what you're good at and really go at it.

256
00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:22.080
You know,
like your tour staying up till late at night programming way.

257
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:24.900
<v 1>Guess my better judgment.</v>

258
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:29.740
<v 0>Yeah.
Well toward,
thanks for speaking with us today.</v>

259
00:15:29.741 --> 00:15:30.870
I really appreciate it.

260
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.500
<v 1>Thank you June.
It's really been fun.</v>

261
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.500
<v 0>Well,
thanks.</v>

262
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.630
So this concludes our experts and emotion interview with Doctor Tour wigger from

263
00:15:39.631 --> 00:15:42.450
the University of Colorado at Boulder.
Thanks again.
