00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.790
Today for our expert interview,
we'll be speaking,
um,

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.490
with the sort of father of rat laughter research.

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.490
Doctor Jaak Panksepp.
He will share his thoughts on rodent emotions.

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.700
So he holds an endowed chair at Washington State University's College of

5
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.490
Veterinary Medicine and is an emeritus professor of psychology at Bowling State

6
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.910
University.

7
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.570
He received his phd from the University of Massachusetts and behavioral

8
00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:27.580
neuroscience.
And importantly,

9
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.450
he is a world famous expert in aspect of neuroscience.

10
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.490
He employs a detailed understanding of basic emotional systems at the neural

11
00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:40.510
level,
often using animal and human models.
In his research,

12
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.330
he specializes in understanding how fear,

13
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.590
social bonding and separation processes are organized in the brain.

14
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.010
He has published a remarkable 300 plus scientific articles,

15
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.100
Co edited a multivolume handbook of the hypothalamus,

16
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.160
as well as for emotions and psychopathology.

17
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.850
And he's the author of a text entitled aspect of neuroscience,

18
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.240
the foundations of human and animal emotions.

19
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.710
His work has received well-recognized merits,
including for example,

20
00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:16.600
among many the NIH research scientists development award.
Um,

21
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.930
so we have a special pleasure today to speak with doctor Pan Panksepp on the

22
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.470
emotional life of rodents,
animal models of human brains.

23
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.940
So welcome Yak.
Thank you for speaking with us today.
Thank you.
Adrenaline.

24
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.870
What I wanted to start out with was asking you a bit about sort of where your

25
00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:40.270
journey in the field began.
In other words,

26
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.060
what first got you interested in studying emotion?

27
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.220
<v 1>Well,
I think go.
We all have emotional lives.</v>

28
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.140
Any intelligent person is very interested in these mysteries.

29
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.610
May have been a traditional topic of conversation ever since we could talk.

30
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.930
Of course talking is not evolved function.
We learn how to talk.

31
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.540
So we had many different words for it,

32
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.460
but it became very clear to me when I first entered graduate school in clinical

33
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:13.461
psychology that there was not a conversation about the real nature of emotions.

34
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.590
And I realized at that point at the very beginning of the cognitive neuroscience

35
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:23.010
revolution that one really had to understand these,

36
00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:24.900
that the neuroscientific level.

37
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.320
And really the precipitant for me was working in the back wards of a psychiatric

38
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:32.910
hospital when I was an undergraduate.

39
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.330
And seeing the people coming into the hospital in emotional turmoil and becoming

40
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:43.260
fascinated by this human drama.
So I wanted to be part of it.

41
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.810
And that light and undergraduate work,

42
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.510
the best route was clinical psychology.

43
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.750
But that was the day of behavioral modification.

44
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.720
And talking about emotions was not permitted.

45
00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.220
<v 0>Hm.
So since then,
I mean,
you've just pioneered whole field of research.</v>

46
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:03.190
I mean,
you've played this role in not only founding,

47
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:06.490
but coining this term aspect of neuroscience,
you know,

48
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.960
that we'll use so widely today devoted to understanding these emotional

49
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:15.961
processes through psychophysiological tools and being a founder of this field,

50
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:20.140
you know,
coming from a time where emotion was not a sort of,
you know,
uh,

51
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.140
allowable phrase.
I wonder,
you know,

52
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:26.800
as you see the field when it's emerged in sort of where it's come now,

53
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.720
what are some of the most fundamental discoveries we've made through an affect

54
00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:34.990
of neuroscience?
I think gone are the most fundamental.
General principle

55
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.660
<v 1>is an evolutionary one.</v>

56
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.790
We will never understand emotions and human brains and minds on unless we take

57
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:47.600
an evolutionary approach and we have to envision the brain as any bopped or

58
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.260
again,
with many layers of development.
And uh,

59
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.570
if we don't bring these layers at development into the conversation,

60
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.000
we will be talking past each other,

61
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:02.920
which we've been doing ever since I entered the field of psychology has become

62
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:04.870
very excited about emotions,

63
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.280
but they're working at what I call the tertiary process level,
namely,

64
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.540
uh,

65
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.130
emotions that have already been processed by complex cognitive processing,

66
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.640
which were very skilled at,
that's a cortical function.

67
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.910
But practically everything in the Cortex is learned below that you have primary

68
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:28.930
processes,
behaviors,
call them unconditioned responses.

69
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.880
Things activate it by unconditioned stimuli.
They did not study those.

70
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:38.500
But there are a host of the emotional systems down in the brain that we share

71
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:41.620
with the other animals.
If you take an evolutionary approach,

72
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:43.930
you cannot avoid that conclusion.

73
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.870
And affective neuroscience started with that.

74
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.650
So you've got tertiary process on top that you cannot study in animals.

75
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.900
You've got primary and process at the bottom would,

76
00:04:55.901 --> 00:05:00.901
you can't study very well in human beings and in between the two you have what I

77
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.040
call the secondary process,

78
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.280
which is learning and memory and all behaviorism was based upon having solid

79
00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:12.040
tools for learning and memory.
That's very important,

80
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.890
but that's where the unconscious resides.

81
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.880
The unconscious does not reside at the bottom of the brain.

82
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.090
There you have aspect of processes and that is a very difficult lesson to

83
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:27.190
penetrate through the jungle of words.

84
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.150
<v 0>So given you know,
you're talking is very important,</v>

85
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:32.710
this jungle of words as you say,

86
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.940
I mean that may have gotten in the way of some of the most important insights

87
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.640
that that need to be brought out in this field.

88
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.080
From this sort of what breakthrough is would you like to see in this field?

89
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.820
<v 1>Well first of all I think I would like to see everyone acknowledge that if we do</v>

90
00:05:49.821 --> 00:05:52.850
not take levels of control into account,

91
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.730
we might be talking past each other.

92
00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.060
And I think everyone has to accept the data that comes from the animal research,

93
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.610
especially when it converges on very robust predictions for our own species that

94
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:10.040
we're all most interested in.
I certainly am.

95
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.760
I entered in clinical psychology for having the same and I realize that without

96
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:19.220
a foundational science,
things will not move forward,

97
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.050
including new medicinal development,
which we are very interested in.

98
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.050
So from my perspective,
one can ask,

99
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.220
what do we find that the foundation of the emotional mind,

100
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.140
and we know we find at least seven types of basic,
not basic,

101
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:40.550
I would call them primary processing motion,
a slightly different concept.

102
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.773
Namely,

103
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.960
we can produce coherent emotional behaviors by stimulating specific parts of the

104
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:51.530
brain.
In every mammal that has been studied,

105
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.520
this emotional display is instinctual.

106
00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.200
It has autonomic components,
it has clear behavioral components,

107
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.990
and we're only putting garbage into the brain.

108
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.000
You're not just electrical stimulation.

109
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:10.030
Other wall socket brought down to very tiny micro amp levels and you get

110
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:11.271
coherence.

111
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:15.710
So that automatically means the coherence was built into the brain.

112
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.420
And the great right through of aspect of neuroscience is to ask,

113
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.770
does the animal like it or dislike it?
Is it good or bad?

114
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.240
I mean,
the behaviors [inaudible] would say the animal doesn't care.

115
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:32.360
It's just a puppet.
These are just actions.

116
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.200
There's no psychological content.
But you can ask the animal,

117
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:40.250
we're not arouse this emotional pattern in you.
Do you like it?

118
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.910
Namely you said a reward.
Do you dislike it?
Is it a punishment?

119
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.260
We've got the tools for that and there's a law of nature that for some reason we

120
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:50.540
were still neglecting and psychology,

121
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.720
wherever in the brain you activate an emotional process is always rewarding or

122
00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.250
punishing,
period.
Hmm.

123
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.890
<v 0>I mean,
I just think that's,
that's so true.</v>

124
00:08:01.891 --> 00:08:05.760
And I think many of these insights are ones that we need to really take with us

125
00:08:05.761 --> 00:08:09.240
as we move forward in this field of affect of neuroscience,
which is now just,

126
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.030
you know,
expanding,
even exploding at fast,
you know,

127
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.490
proportions with lots of new tools and discoveries.
Um,

128
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.090
I wanted to turn to another really important part of your work,

129
00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:25.200
which is where you've scientifically demonstrated something that a lot of people

130
00:08:25.201 --> 00:08:26.820
may you believed wasn't possible,

131
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.480
which is the fact that rats can indeed exhibit laughter,

132
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.220
this kind of special chirp.

133
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.360
And I wondered if you could tell us a bit more about the supportive evidence

134
00:08:36.361 --> 00:08:37.800
that you're really,

135
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.190
really insightful work has done that suggests that rats can laugh.

136
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.400
<v 1>Well,
uh,
we,
uh,</v>

137
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:49.250
we're looking for other clear primary process emotions and it struck us that

138
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:51.320
play might be one of those.

139
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.580
And we develop very rigorous procedures for the first time I study play in the

140
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:59.610
laboratory and it was wonderful,
you know,

141
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:04.611
the animals loved it and they became very resilient to depression.

142
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.420
Uh,
you know,

143
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:11.430
it was as powerful reward is food for hungry animal and uh,

144
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.700
it looks like our own children playing.
And uh,

145
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.370
at one point we started asking,
are there play vocalizations?

146
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.480
Now we know that rats communicate in the ultrasound range,

147
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:29.040
so private tours will not be able to detect them.
And Lo and behold,

148
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:30.660
with ultrasonic equipment,

149
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.890
the playing field was full of little chirpy.
Sounds.

150
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.850
And we called them play vocalizations and we studied them,

151
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:43.350
especially Brian Knutson,
who's now at Stanford.
And part of this project,

152
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.000
uh,
the playing field is full of these little sounds.

153
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:53.460
And Lo and behold,
one morning I woke up,
but I said,
what if that is laughter?

154
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.780
And it took years to come to this insight and I think it came from a dream.

155
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.880
So I immediately went to the laboratory.
Jeff Berg,
dark was waiting for me.

156
00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:06.510
I said,
Jeff,
let's go tickle some Rach.
Okay.

157
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.990
Firsthand.
I'm all chirp like crazy when we tickled them is the second animal,

158
00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:13.890
third animal.

159
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:18.300
We could bring this vocalization under stimulus control.

160
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.920
And now it's our primary measure of positive social,

161
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:26.100
an effect because Jeff and his dissertation,

162
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:31.370
not the system with deep brain stimulation and every place we were able to get a

163
00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:35.610
Chirp,
the animals self stimulated that site.

164
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.880
So we have the first Dalat dated measure of social joy that's based on

165
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.180
neurocircuits as opposed to just theoretical speculation.

166
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:50.100
So in what way do you see that last year as similar or distinct from human

167
00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:53.700
laughter will?
Uh,
it's homologous.

168
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.710
There's a evolutionary continuity.
Nothing and evolutionist identical.

169
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.090
A lot of people accused me.
How can it be identical?
That's nonsense talk.

170
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:08.730
Homology means there's the evolutionary relationship and there are bound to be

171
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:12.000
similarities in the mechanisms.
For instance,

172
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:17.010
the human brain contains no neurochemistries that are not present in the other

173
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:21.450
mammals.
So we are not unique at that level.

174
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:26.510
We're only unique because we have a enormous neocortex and a that neocortex is

175
00:11:28.201 --> 00:11:32.820
empty at birth.
Everything is constructed there including vision.

176
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.730
The vision has to be learned in the NEOCORTEX.

177
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.180
So I'm a constructivist in the neo cortex,

178
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.280
but at the bottom of the brain we have to understand the instincts and the

179
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:45.660
instinct of laughter.

180
00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:50.160
And humans appears to come from those same circuits.
You know,

181
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:54.160
people that have,
you know,
gymnastic,
uh,
there,

182
00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:59.080
you know that it's caused by epileptic fits that is triggered down deep in the

183
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:03.910
brain,
very much in the areas of the brain that we mapped for rent.
Laughter.

184
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.570
So we think by working out the chemistries of rat laughter,

185
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.840
we will have new ideas for antidepressants.

186
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.530
<v 0>Yeah,
I wanted to ask,
I mean,</v>

187
00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:16.780
what do you think this can tell us about what ways we can understand social joy

188
00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:21.040
in molecular terms and develop as you're saying novel,
you know,

189
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:23.150
treatments like antidepressants?

190
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.570
<v 1>Well,
what we did with my colleagues at Northwestern university,</v>

191
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.820
you Joel Moscow's group,
uh,

192
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:34.830
we did micro arrays on the Neocortex,
which is not needed for play,

193
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.320
but which play influences play programs.

194
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.910
The neocortex for me,
a higher social brain.
And uh,

195
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.930
we found that the micro ray analysis yielded one third of the genes that we

196
00:12:48.631 --> 00:12:51.720
measured being modified either up or down.

197
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:56.790
And we had very simple strategy,
whatever gene is upregulated.

198
00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.590
And the top one was insulin,

199
00:12:58.591 --> 00:13:03.591
like growth factor one might be a molecule that promotes social joy and insulin

200
00:13:05.281 --> 00:13:10.140
like growth factor does the second one,
but it also increases cancers.

201
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.080
So it's not a good target for medicinal development.

202
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.090
But the second one was the NR,

203
00:13:15.091 --> 00:13:19.800
two B subunit of the glutamate and glycine receptor complex.

204
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.360
And that is a target that doesn't have any medicines.

205
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:25.710
And Lo and behold,

206
00:13:25.711 --> 00:13:30.711
we develop some molecules to tickle that site and it elevates 50 kilohertz

207
00:13:31.051 --> 00:13:33.030
chirps,
which is what we want.

208
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.770
We want to antidepressant to elevate positive social feelings.

209
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:42.690
So we pursued that molecule first pre,
clinically namely animal research.

210
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.330
And it's now gone through human testing.

211
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:48.450
Well they went through phase one toxicology.

212
00:13:48.451 --> 00:13:51.450
It was safe phase two a,

213
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:56.660
which was the first feasibility study and it produced robust anti depressant

214
00:13:57.571 --> 00:14:02.520
effects,
namely have bigger effects sizes,

215
00:14:02.521 --> 00:14:06.960
then the SSR i's,
which having enormous problems,
Ssri,

216
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.790
you know,
if you're on them for years,

217
00:14:08.791 --> 00:14:11.750
you get addicted to them and you can't get off them,

218
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.830
which just makes it a wonderful money male.
Uh,

219
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.840
so we have a molecule on development and the whole philosophy of aspect of

220
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:20.933
neurosciences.

221
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.940
When you see the similarities of the animal than other mammals and the human

222
00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:30.690
brain,
you're going to work out the details that you can never do when humans.

223
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.123
Wow.

224
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.100
<v 0>So what do you think we can also learn,
um,</v>

225
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:39.450
in terms of molecular terminology about things like sorrow and you were talking

226
00:14:39.451 --> 00:14:41.180
about joy and the,
you know,

227
00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.400
there's always sorrow as well as part of our emotional life.

228
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.450
<v 1>That's a wonderful question.
I'm glad you asked it.
The cause,</v>

229
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:53.690
the very first set of major that we did when we open up the Pandora's box of

230
00:14:55.191 --> 00:14:57.710
bath backed across species neuroscience,

231
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.930
was to try to identify the brain systems that mediate social attachments,

232
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.380
the kinds of systems that Harry Harlow had shown,

233
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.460
how the motherless monkey is a very sad creature,

234
00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.930
but it cannot function in the world.
And we thought it might be,

235
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.830
there might be a separation distress system in the brain.
And we said,

236
00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:23.831
we can monitor this by looking at separation calls you separate little one from

237
00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:28.370
the mother.
And Lo and behold,
we found a system.

238
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.530
Uh,
it's a very robust one in many mammals,
not laboratory rats,
by the way.

239
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.000
And that's a long story.
I'm,
a lot of people are making mistakes.
You know,

240
00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:41.810
it's been bred out of a laboratory rat.
And,
uh,

241
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.960
we found first that it was modulated by endogenous opioids.

242
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:53.380
And we had this theory at social attachment isn't addictive process that many

243
00:15:55.071 --> 00:15:59.240
people who have psychological pain because they're disenfranchised,

244
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.820
they don't have good social networks,

245
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.290
they're continually feeling bad and they start to self medicate themselves with

246
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:11.291
opioids because the rest of us then have happy families are releasing opioids

247
00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:16.840
all the time during positive interactions like play and uh,

248
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.050
you know,
just hugging a love sex loss,
you know,

249
00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:25.520
all the social positive things facilitate opioid activity.

250
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.180
So,
uh,
you know,

251
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.200
with demonstrated that this separation system actually has opioids around it and

252
00:16:33.441 --> 00:16:38.180
touch activates that evening.
So,
you know,
little baby that's being cuddled,

253
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.950
you're releasing their opioids and you are producing a social addiction.

254
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.780
Addiction is a bad word there.
You know,
this little luck,
you know,

255
00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:52.520
there's prime more evidence that opioids mediate love more than oxytocin.

256
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.790
Oxytocin also,
I was very effective,
but oxytocin increases confidence,

257
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:04.150
which every mother needs to have this baby coming and you don't have confidence,

258
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.650
you're not going to be a good mother.

259
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.980
<v 0>So this is all really interesting.
I mean,</v>

260
00:17:09.981 --> 00:17:12.380
thinking about the field of aspect of neuroscience,

261
00:17:12.381 --> 00:17:16.010
that you played such a fundamental role in founding,
you know,

262
00:17:16.011 --> 00:17:19.730
transitioning to understanding social joy in the molecular terms of it and

263
00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:24.731
studying it and in rodents and then now thinking about sorrow and how we can use

264
00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:29.570
some of these insights to help to develop novel kind of targeted treatments.

265
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.410
When you think about sort of where the field started,
where it's come,

266
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.190
how do you project into the future in terms of thinking,
well,

267
00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:39.590
what's in store for the future of emotion here

268
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.010
<v 1>we'll,</v>

269
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:46.010
I think a really wonderful aspect is that we finally can scientifically

270
00:17:47.491 --> 00:17:52.491
understand the foundation of the human mind by studying other animals.

271
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:58.530
The animal research will not reveal how are upper mind works,

272
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.470
but if we take an evolutionary point of view,

273
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.560
we have to realize that what came first always rules.
You know,

274
00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:11.040
these solutions for living,
that the primary process,

275
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:16.100
the emotions are constituted from these are foundational for learning and

276
00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:17.634
memory.

277
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:22.670
So we had a law of effect Thorndyke we should now have a wall up aspect exactly

278
00:18:24.751 --> 00:18:27.150
the way Thorndyke originally phrased it.

279
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.830
It's the aspect of circuits of the brain that control learning.

280
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.780
And we have to realize that these fundamental aspects are tools for living.

281
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:42.290
And the way nature saw projecting itself into the future is to generate the

282
00:18:43.421 --> 00:18:46.530
spooky things,
call feelings,
aspects.

283
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:51.510
Neck tell you immediately whether you're on the path of survival or destruction.

284
00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.910
So every good feeling indicates you're on the path of survival just

285
00:18:56.911 --> 00:19:01.230
statistically and all the negative feelings tell you,

286
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:06.120
you might be on a path of destruction.
This is anticipating the future.

287
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.040
That is the function of bath back.

288
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.960
And then you anticipate through learning and memory.
So aspect controls,

289
00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:17.010
learning and memory and learning and memory give you the tools for thinking.

290
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.160
You have to have facts before you can have ideas,

291
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:25.370
but the ideas or the creation of our higher mind and they can be anything we can

292
00:19:25.621 --> 00:19:30.420
imagine.
And that's why there's so much controversy at the verbal level.

293
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:35.340
So if we accept the foundations,
we can have a clear discourse,
I believe.

294
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.360
<v 0>So what advice do you give men to future students who are just thinking about</v>

295
00:19:41.701 --> 00:19:45.420
embarking the study of emotion or just getting into their first few years?

296
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.050
<v 1>Well,
uh,</v>

297
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:51.170
I think I would suggest that they need you read aspect of neuroscience,

298
00:19:51.171 --> 00:19:55.790
1998 in a restaurant,
10 dozen years writing that book.

299
00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:00.410
And I wrote it for other psychologists so they would be attracted to the

300
00:20:00.411 --> 00:20:05.411
neuroscientific analysis and I just came out with archeology and mine and make

301
00:20:05.901 --> 00:20:09.920
it a little bit simpler,
updated,
especially for clinicians.

302
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:14.950
And I was delighted the first community of psychologists who were interested in

303
00:20:15.261 --> 00:20:18.830
it.
In this vision,
we're clinicians.

304
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.200
So that was very gratifying for me.

305
00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:26.670
And I would say that every future generation of psychologist has to realize that

306
00:20:26.961 --> 00:20:31.961
you cannot be a real psychologist unless you understand the brain and you're

307
00:20:32.811 --> 00:20:36.680
able to navigate in your mind how the brain is organized.

308
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.100
That has to be the foundation of psychology.

309
00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:45.460
I argued for this starting in the 19 seven days when we had the Utah Conference

310
00:20:46.221 --> 00:20:50.320
on graduate,
but it still has not happened.

311
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.680
I don't think we can graduate psychology majors who have not taken neuroanatomy

312
00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:01.000
and functional on neural processes that is foundational,

313
00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:04.180
just like DNA was foundational for biology.

314
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:09.370
<v 0>So it seems that what's most important is to truly understand the human brain</v>

315
00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:11.770
and for to understand anything about emotion.

316
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.820
<v 1>I would say we cannot understand emotions without the brain analysis that does</v>

317
00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:23.200
not neglect or negate higher level analysis.
That is very interesting.

318
00:21:23.201 --> 00:21:24.100
But remember,

319
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.270
every human being is interested in the higher part of it.

320
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:33.040
We would not have our,
we would not have theater,
music novels,

321
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:37.420
we would not had any of the riches of,
you know,
the arts,

322
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:40.540
which are so important to our lives without emotions.

323
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:46.320
But the arts are beautiful creations of the basic emotional tools that we have.

324
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.630
But the symphony finally is created by the full brain.

325
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.780
And of course we have the most rich and complex upper emotional life of any

326
00:21:57.781 --> 00:21:58.614
creature.

327
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:04.270
<v 0>Well,
on that beautiful note,
um,
I want to thank you for speaking today.</v>

328
00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.250
It was a pleasure to talk with you.

329
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.390
<v 1>Wonderful to talk to you.
Thank you,
Joan.</v>

330
00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.513
<v 0>Thank you.</v>

331
00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:15.350
So this concludes our experts in emotion interview series with Dr Jaak pants up

332
00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:19.790
from Washington State University's College of Veterinary Medicine and emeritus

333
00:22:19.791 --> 00:22:22.820
professor of psychology at Bowling State University.
