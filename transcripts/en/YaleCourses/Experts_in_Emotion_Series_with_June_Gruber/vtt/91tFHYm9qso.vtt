00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.720
Today for our experts in emotion interview.

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.830
We'll be speaking with Dr Judith Moscowitz on emotion and physical health.

3
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.300
Doctor Moscowitz is an associate professor in residence and the Department of

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.420
Medicine and the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of

5
00:00:14.421 --> 00:00:16.010
California San Francisco.

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.110
She received her phd in social psychology from Dartmouth College and our mph in

7
00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:22.910
epidemiology from UC Berkeley.

8
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.620
Her research is focused on coping and emotion in the context of chronic stress.

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.791
In particular,

10
00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:32.480
she studies the impact of positive emotion on psychological and physical

11
00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:37.190
adjustment to serious stress and illness using both quantitative and qualitative

12
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:38.060
methodologies.

13
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.320
She examines how caregivers and those with chronic illness appraise and cope

14
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.390
with the illness related stress and how those processes are related to
wellbeing.

15
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.040
Doctor Moscowitz is the Pi of an NIH funded randomized controlled trial of an

16
00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:56.050
intervention designed to increase positive effect during a stressful health

17
00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:59.030
related event such as testing positive for HIV.

18
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.460
She's modifying the positive effect intervention for high school and middle men,

19
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.470
middle school students,
people with type two diabetes,

20
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.850
women with stage four breast cancer and university employees and testing in

21
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:13.640
person and online approaches to delivering the intervention.

22
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.950
So I now turn to a very special experts in emotion interview together with Dr

23
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:21.590
Judith Moskowitz on emotion and physical health.

24
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.760
Welcome Judy.
Thanks for speaking today.

25
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.570
<v 1>Thanks.
I'm sorry to be invited to be part of the series.</v>

26
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.603
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

27
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.230
What I wanted to start out asking you about was a little about your journey into

28
00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:39.760
the world of emotions.
So where did it first get started for you?

29
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.190
<v 1>Well,
it started,</v>

30
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.420
I think for like it is with a lot of people that started in graduate school.
Um,

31
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.450
I went in really interested in psychology and the effect of stress on health,

32
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.700
which is,
uh,

33
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.390
led me directly to the work of Lazarus and Folkman and looking at stress and

34
00:01:58.391 --> 00:02:02.560
coping theory and emotion is an integral part of that theory.

35
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.110
Um,
and as I started doing some research in the area,

36
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.390
um,
uh,
the,

37
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.170
my interest is sort of differentiating between positive and negative emotion.

38
00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:16.600
And the differential effects started to emerge.

39
00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:20.020
So working with my advisor at Dartmouth j hall,
um,

40
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.610
he was also a really get into it getting into structural equation modeling at

41
00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:25.121
the time.

42
00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:28.360
So we started looking at the structure of coping and the structure of emotion

43
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.230
and started really looking at a positive emotions and negative emotion as

44
00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:37.020
separate concepts at that point.
Um,
yeah,
so it's,
it's,

45
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.070
it's been,
you know,
a good 20 years.

46
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.090
<v 0>Well,
I mean,</v>

47
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.650
and over that 20 years you've done I think so many exciting things in this
realm.

48
00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:49.130
So I still want to ask you to speak a little bit about them because I know a lot

49
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:52.910
of people listening to this conversation or really interested in thinking about

50
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:57.830
the fact that emotions can actually tangibly affect really important physical

51
00:02:57.831 --> 00:03:02.470
health outcomes.
So I mean,
one area among many that you've done is,
um,

52
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.890
your work where you're really well known for this influential work on the

53
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:09.260
predictors and consequences of positive effect,
uh,

54
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.940
in the context of health related outcomes such as chronic stress.

55
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.450
And I wondered if you could say a little bit about what you see as the most

56
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:19.480
important discoveries here in your work?

57
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.160
<v 1>Well,
I think the core discovery,
that positive emotion,</v>

58
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:28.950
it does have a unique role in health and that,
um,

59
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.600
it,
it influences really important health outcomes like mortality.

60
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.000
Um,
that was really where I started with this work,
sort of,

61
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.540
um,

62
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.860
looking in other datasets earlier datasets that where the data had already been

63
00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:47.040
collected and looking for this unique relationship.

64
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.840
And once we found the relationship between positive emotion and longer life,
um,

65
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.160
that opened up a whole world of possibilities for looking at,
well,
okay,
yeah,

66
00:03:56.161 --> 00:03:57.360
it's great you live longer.

67
00:03:57.361 --> 00:04:00.180
But what leads to that and sort of all the steps in between,

68
00:04:00.181 --> 00:04:02.520
is it health behaviors?
Is it immune function?

69
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.820
Is it other biological mediators that we have yet to really understand?

70
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.450
Um,
so at that point I think things really opened up,
but the starting with,

71
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.210
you know,
positive emotion leads to longer life,

72
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.940
<v 0>which is fascinating,
right?</v>

73
00:04:16.941 --> 00:04:20.840
Because most people might've thought positive emotions is just kind of this
epic,

74
00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:24.920
phenomenal thing that happens,
but that you should actually really drives,

75
00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:27.560
you know,
important health outcomes.
Huge.

76
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.890
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
It was really exciting.
It's the only time,
you know,</v>

77
00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:35.310
of the millions of analysis I've done where I had literally jumped out of my

78
00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:39.030
chair and ran into someone else's office and said,
look,
it's really there.

79
00:04:39.031 --> 00:04:43.500
It's really true.
So it's been really exciting and really launched a lot of,

80
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.460
um,
work that I'm,
you know,
our whole team is really passionate about.

81
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.320
<v 0>Yes.
I wanted to ask you,
I mean,</v>

82
00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:52.800
have you found distinct kinds of predictors when you looked at varied

83
00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:55.050
populations?
I know you've said it,
caregivers,

84
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.130
people newly diagnosed with HIV as well as those with pancreatic tumors.

85
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.550
Are you finding distinct effects in these groups or is there a common theme

86
00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:03.384
across,

87
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.643
<v 1>um,</v>

88
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.550
we're not at a point with our intervention work where we're seeing a

89
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.780
differential effects based on the type of illness or the type of stress.

90
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.430
My Gut instinct is that the illness or the,
um,

91
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.470
the particular stressor that,
uh,

92
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:27.550
the samples dealing with is not going to be the key thing driving the outcome.

93
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.820
I actually think they're probably the,
the question of

94
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.720
when is positive emotion,
um,

95
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.370
a key predictor of health and for whom is it a key predictor?

96
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.110
I think it's going to come down more to personality variables.
Um,

97
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.210
and again,
it's too early in our data to to see that.
Um,
but that's,

98
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.980
that's my gut of where things are headed.

99
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.081
<v 0>So interesting.</v>

100
00:05:52.081 --> 00:05:55.740
It seems like there's so many like exciting unknown's too on the horizon.

101
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.890
<v 1>Yes.
Yeah,
a huge,</v>

102
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.160
<v 0>um,
huge new territory for research I think.</v>

103
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.610
So I wanted to ask you then about this seminar work you've done examining these

104
00:06:06.611 --> 00:06:11.611
positive effect related interventions aimed at helping reduce stress across a

105
00:06:11.801 --> 00:06:15.250
variety of populations.
And I wondered if you could say in your opinion,

106
00:06:15.251 --> 00:06:19.540
what you see as some of the most essential ingredients of these interventions

107
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.340
that's making them work and really amazing and maybe surprising ways.

108
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.960
Yeah,

109
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.520
<v 1>I think,
um,
our basic idea is that,
so we,</v>

110
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.530
we've developed this intervention that has eight or coping skills for increasing

111
00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:38.270
positive emotions sort of on a daily basis.
Um,

112
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.820
even if you're experiencing stress,
we think that these skills can help you,
um,

113
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.600
increase your daily experience of positive emotion and help you cope with the

114
00:06:46.601 --> 00:06:49.120
stress better no matter what the stress is.
Right?

115
00:06:49.121 --> 00:06:52.780
So the idea is that we are giving people this toolbox,

116
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.100
this buffet,
the s a selection of skills to choose from.

117
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.320
Um,
the real trick is that you then have to practice the skills,

118
00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:04.270
like make it a habit.
Um,

119
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.220
so where we're really headed with this is not so much that,
you know,

120
00:07:09.221 --> 00:07:13.030
we think that mindfulness is the key thing or positive reappraisal is the key

121
00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:15.130
thing or noticing positive events or gratitude.

122
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.780
We think all of these things can work.
Um,
if you make it a habit.

123
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.770
Um,

124
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.770
so where our work is really heading now is trying to figure out how to help

125
00:07:27.041 --> 00:07:31.240
people engage in these skills and make them part of their daily lives and part

126
00:07:31.241 --> 00:07:34.960
of how they think about the world.
And how they view the world.
Um,

127
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.440
so,
uh,
you know,
I think there's,

128
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.170
there's a lot of really good work being done out there that looks at,
um,

129
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.320
a lot of these skills sort of individually.

130
00:07:44.321 --> 00:07:48.670
And I think that we're all really important and should definitely be pursued.

131
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.140
But for our main questions it's more about,
um,

132
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.430
we think there's enough evidence for each of these skills for it to be included

133
00:07:57.431 --> 00:07:58.264
in the package.

134
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.840
But now we're moving forward and trying to figure out ways to deliver the

135
00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:06.640
intervention and to make it appealing to people and make it and help people stay

136
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:09.430
motivated to engage with the skills.

137
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.860
<v 0>Yeah.
So when I think about different kinds of individuals and gate,
uh,</v>

138
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.010
engaging with these skills,

139
00:08:14.011 --> 00:08:18.570
do you find that certain individuals are benefiting more from certain skills

140
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.320
than others or some individuals may not be benefiting from certain components?

141
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.920
<v 1>I think there's,</v>

142
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.760
there's definitely a lot of individual differences in how much people like the

143
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:32.750
skills and how much people practice the skills.
And again,
our work,

144
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.470
most of our studies are at a very early pilot phase where we're just trying to

145
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.460
deliver the skills and have them understand it and looking to see if people are

146
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:45.410
practicing.
We have one large trial going on now that'll be,

147
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.740
um,
probably about 160,

148
00:08:47.741 --> 00:08:52.741
175 people newly diagnosed with HIV and half of them will be given the skills

149
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.860
and that once the data are in for that study,

150
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:58.380
we'll have more of a sense of really,
you know,

151
00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:01.770
we'll be able to look at the data and see,
um,
are there,

152
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.880
what are the individual differences that drive who takes up which skills and

153
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:06.990
what works and for whom.

154
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.470
I can tell you anecdotally that there are some people who,

155
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.450
and it's surprising to me when we put together the eight skills,
there are some,

156
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.630
there's something for everyone.
I'll almost,

157
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.590
without exceptions did people can find one of those eight that really speaks to

158
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:23.590
them.
Um,

159
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:28.380
and at the same time there's usually one that they just can't stand or they say,

160
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.850
oh yeah,
I already do that and they have no interest in.

161
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.490
And really looking at it and trying to make it more of a habit.
So,
um,

162
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.120
I think mindfulness is probably the best example in terms of people love it.

163
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.190
Or then there's also people who just hate it.

164
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:46.650
They hate the breathing meditation and they hate the bell.

165
00:09:46.651 --> 00:09:50.040
They need everything about it.
So,
um,
yeah,

166
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:53.880
it's been really fascinating to listen to and we get a lot of participant

167
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:56.610
feedback cause we're piloting so much of this.
Um,

168
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.810
but it's been really fascinating to hear people really radically different

169
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:03.090
responses to the individual skills.

170
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.660
<v 0>Have you found any individuals respond in a way where they have skepticism about</v>

171
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:12.070
how can I be building positivity in an authentic way that's not promoting this

172
00:10:12.071 --> 00:10:14.680
kind of,
you know,
Pollyanna view of the world that,
you know,

173
00:10:14.681 --> 00:10:16.950
everything is fantastic and great.
Okay.

174
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:22.260
<v 1>Right.
And we are really careful to,
um,
not,
uh,</v>

175
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.710
not be Pollyanna about this.
So we really,
and again,

176
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:29.640
coming from a background in stress and Cook Clean Research,

177
00:10:29.641 --> 00:10:31.260
we're very aware that,
you know,

178
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:36.261
life is hard and really bad things happen and we aren't minimizing the real

179
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.800
negative consequences in the real stress that people experience.

180
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.100
So we're really careful to,
um,

181
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.270
honor the stress that they're undergoing and we're explicit about it.

182
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.980
So in our work with people with HIV,
we acknowledge that they are,

183
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:53.520
you know,

184
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.280
participating in this study because they've just been diagnosed with a really

185
00:10:56.281 --> 00:11:00.220
serious illness and we do not,
um,

186
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.460
in any way encourage them to,
uh,

187
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.920
suppress the negative emotions or deny that their life is stressful or that what

188
00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:10.020
they're going through a stressful.
Um,

189
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.710
instead we really point to the data and we say that,
you know,
we've,

190
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.770
we've done a number of studies now of people experiencing really serious stress

191
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.860
and what we see is that even though there is a lot of distress and there is

192
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:25.890
depression,
there is sadness and there's fear and anxiety.

193
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.430
There's also a positive emotion alongside that and that,
um,

194
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:35.580
people reported this to us.
We didn't go in looking for,
uh,
for report.

195
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.430
It's a positive emotion,
but this is what the participants were telling us.

196
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.060
So when we're trying to teach people the intervention,

197
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.950
even though they're going through a really significant stressful event,
we,

198
00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.220
we give them the data and we say,
you know,

199
00:11:47.221 --> 00:11:51.700
there it is possible to feel the positive alongside the negative.

200
00:11:51.701 --> 00:11:55.750
So what we're trying to do is teach you skills for making more room for the

201
00:11:55.751 --> 00:11:56.650
positive.
Hmm.

202
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.270
<v 0>So almost finding that balance as opposed to just being completely skewed in one</v>

203
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:02.170
way that's Pollyanna.

204
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:05.920
It's balancing the positive with the reality of the negative stress that they're

205
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:06.754
facing.

206
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.980
<v 1>That's right.
That's right.
Yeah.
I think,
you know,</v>

207
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:13.480
in the field has sort of swung back and forth on this as well as,
you know,

208
00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:14.530
it's um,
you know,

209
00:12:14.531 --> 00:12:17.890
for a long time psychology was really focused on the negative and that's

210
00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:20.680
important and it continues to be important and we need to figure out ways to

211
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:24.640
reduce,
um,
out of control,
negative emotions.
Sure.

212
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.630
And then we started discovering that positive emotions had these sort of unique

213
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:31.600
beneficial effects.
So then,
you know,

214
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.040
to some extent we swung maybe too far in the other direction.
We're like,
well,

215
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.320
let's just all look at positive emotion and see what we can do there.
But,

216
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.040
you know,
extreme positive isn't good either.
So.
Yeah,
exactly.

217
00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:45.730
So it's the balance and finding the balance and helping people find that
balance.

218
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.920
<v 0>So it makes me think about,
you know,</v>

219
00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:52.090
the volume that you and I have been co-editing.
Um,
the title,

220
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.680
the dark and light sides of positive emotion.
I'm with Oxford University press,

221
00:12:56.681 --> 00:12:58.330
really thinking about these,
you know,

222
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.930
two facets of the ways in which positive emotions can have all these robust

223
00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:02.830
benefits for us,

224
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:07.630
but when taken to an extreme or experience in the wrong context may actually be

225
00:13:07.631 --> 00:13:12.190
maladaptive for us.
And I wonder,
you know,
from your perspective on you,

226
00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:14.680
and I've had a lot of conversations about this,
you know,

227
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.420
in what way can positive emotions really have these two sides,
right?
I mean,
it's,

228
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:23.230
I think counterintuitive to a lot of people that really see positive emotions,

229
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.310
you know,
as a,

230
00:13:24.311 --> 00:13:28.630
as a way through which you experience all these fantastic robust effects.

231
00:13:28.631 --> 00:13:30.340
And how could there be a dark side?

232
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:35.620
<v 1>Right,
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean there's,
again,</v>

233
00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:36.880
I'm,
I'm in our work,

234
00:13:36.881 --> 00:13:41.560
we're really careful to acknowledge the dark side and acknowledged that this

235
00:13:41.561 --> 00:13:46.180
isn't all about positive emotion and certainly clinically you can swing way too

236
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:49.250
far in the positive direction.
One of the,

237
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:53.910
the studies we're working on right now with,
uh,
Sherry Johnson at Berkeley is um,

238
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.000
modifying and tailoring our positive effect intervention for people with bipolar

239
00:13:58.001 --> 00:14:02.470
disorder.
Because there's a real question for people who are at risk for mania.

240
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.670
Do you want to give them skills for experiencing lots of high activation,

241
00:14:06.671 --> 00:14:11.650
positive emotion and a number of our skills?
Um,
things like,

242
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.580
um,
goal setting,
um,
are,
uh,

243
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.680
a particular,
uh,
particular weaknesses for people with bipolar disorder.
So we're,

244
00:14:20.681 --> 00:14:24.860
we're tailoring the intervention to try to um,
um,

245
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.030
help people with bipolar disorder have,

246
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.200
have more positive emotions so they're not engaging in this sort of dampening

247
00:14:32.201 --> 00:14:33.250
coping response.
Again,

248
00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:37.450
that Sherry and her team have found that people with bipolar tend to avoid all

249
00:14:37.451 --> 00:14:40.570
positive events and it really impacts their quality of life.

250
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.010
So what we're trying to do is,

251
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.600
is give them skills for finding sort of the lower activation,

252
00:14:46.601 --> 00:14:50.350
positive effect so they can have the experience of positive emotion and the

253
00:14:50.351 --> 00:14:54.560
benefits with without the real dark side of the really high activation positive

254
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.800
that can then spin out of control.
And I think,
you know,

255
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:02.030
more generally that this is true for everyone.
Again,
it's,

256
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.690
it's the balance that you talked about.
Um,

257
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.700
and finding a place where if you're experiencing a significant life event are

258
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:14.480
not,
um,
you know,
drowning in the negative emotion.
Um,
that's,

259
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.290
you know,
adaptive and useful in many cases,
but you're not,

260
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.350
you're not overcome and overwhelmed by it.
And that the positive,

261
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.740
if you can practice some of these skills and bring more of the positive emotion

262
00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:26.990
and as well,
maybe you can find that balance.

263
00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:27.401
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

264
00:15:27.401 --> 00:15:30.820
So it sounds like when you think about the implications for emotion and physical

265
00:15:30.821 --> 00:15:34.540
health more generally,
it's this theme of just finding balance,
right?

266
00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:38.920
And if there's a relative deficiency and positive emotion may be bumping up it

267
00:15:38.921 --> 00:15:39.401
up a little,

268
00:15:39.401 --> 00:15:43.450
but if there's an excess in positive emotionality kind of attenuating or curbing

269
00:15:43.451 --> 00:15:46.540
it down a little to find that safe kind of sweet spot.

270
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.510
<v 1>Right,
exactly.
And you know,
like everything in psychology,</v>

271
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.230
it's probably really complicated on an individual level and your sweet spot is

272
00:15:54.231 --> 00:15:56.990
probably different from my sweet spot is different from the next guy.
Sweet spot,

273
00:15:56.991 --> 00:15:57.230
right?

274
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:01.910
So helping people find their individual optimal balance I think is going to be

275
00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:03.470
one of the big challenges going forward.

276
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:08.960
<v 0>So then when you think about going forward and sort of see the future of emotion</v>

277
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.620
and how it relates to physical health,
we're,
where do you see the future headed?

278
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:18.740
<v 1>Well,
one of the things I'm really excited about is um,
this uh,</v>

279
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:19.960
movement board,

280
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:24.400
a mobile health and health information technology and being able to use various

281
00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:29.140
types of sensors or things on your cell phone or ambulatory measures to really

282
00:16:29.141 --> 00:16:32.830
get at both health in the field,
you know,
and health indicators in the field,

283
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.950
but also getting at emotion measurement in the field.
Um,

284
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.760
I am definitely a fan of self report emotion.

285
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:43.150
I think that people are very capable of reporting how they're feeling.

286
00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.870
And I do think it's still the gold standard.
Um,
that said,

287
00:16:46.871 --> 00:16:50.230
there are a lot of drawbacks to self report emotions,

288
00:16:50.231 --> 00:16:53.710
particularly if you want to get at daily experience of emotion and moment to

289
00:16:53.711 --> 00:16:57.820
moment experience of emotion.
And I think if there are ways for us to,

290
00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.103
um,

291
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:04.150
a couple positive or self report with um,

292
00:17:04.151 --> 00:17:07.000
some other sort of ambulatory,
um,

293
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.300
measure that at well that will be a huge leap forward.

294
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.990
So it is one of the things that we're experimenting with some of the things

295
00:17:13.991 --> 00:17:16.990
where you can get at like heart rate variability in the field.

296
00:17:16.991 --> 00:17:21.250
You can get at heart rates.
Certainly you can get at um,
galvanic skin response.

297
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.150
So,
um,
uh,

298
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:28.240
we're really excited about the possibility of being able to take all of these

299
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:33.110
um,
mobile or ambulatory measures that are non self report and,

300
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.810
and,
and bring them together in large samples and see is there a strong enough

301
00:17:37.811 --> 00:17:41.710
correlation with self reported emotion to be able to use these going forward.

302
00:17:41.711 --> 00:17:45.890
So that's,
you know,
today that's one of the things I'm really excited about.
Yeah,

303
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.320
<v 0>no,
that's really exciting.</v>

304
00:17:47.321 --> 00:17:51.450
And I imagine you have a lot of students who will to you and ask you for advice,

305
00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:54.990
you know,
that they're thinking about embarking in this field.
What should I do,

306
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.360
you know,
how should I spend my time?
Um,

307
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.570
what kind of advice do you give to students who are thinking about embarking in

308
00:18:00.571 --> 00:18:01.404
emotion?

309
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.970
<v 1>Um,
I think,</v>

310
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.350
I mean certainly the thing that stands out to me when I'm talking to a student

311
00:18:07.351 --> 00:18:11.610
is if they've got a real passion for the question.
Um,

312
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:16.380
so my advice would be find the question that you get really excited about.

313
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.750
Um,
I think,
you know,

314
00:18:18.751 --> 00:18:23.730
there's often a pull toward doing what's being done in your graduate lab or

315
00:18:23.731 --> 00:18:24.570
being done.

316
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.470
It's your university and that's all really good and it's a way to get exposure.

317
00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:33.150
But,
um,
sometimes that overall question is interesting.

318
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:37.630
It may be,
may not be what's really exciting to you.
And I think,
uh,

319
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.530
you know,
if you're going to stay in it for the long term and there,

320
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.670
there will be bumps along the way and it's challenging to make a career in,
um,

321
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.580
psychology or certainly in psychology and health,

322
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.420
you need a question that's going to sustain you and it needs to be something

323
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:55.530
you're really passionate about and you can imagine studying forever.

324
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.250
Um,
so yeah,
find,
find the question you're really passionate about.

325
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.970
<v 0>I like that advice of finding your passion.
It's so important.
Um,</v>

326
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.300
and I think that's a great note to conclude on that,
you know,

327
00:19:08.301 --> 00:19:12.590
it's all about passions science to keep it going for the longterm.
That's right.

328
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.410
That's right.
So thank you so much for speaking today,
Judy.

329
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.830
<v 1>Thanks.
It's been a lot of fun.
Thank you.
Great to see you</v>

330
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:20.993
<v 0>two.
Okay,</v>

331
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.050
so this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Doctor Judith Moscowitz

332
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:27.810
from the University of California San Francisco.
