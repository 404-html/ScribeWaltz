00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.060
For today.
We have the honor of speaking with Dr Jeannie Psi,
um,

2
00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:09.770
about the question regarding to what extent are emotions culturally shaped?

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.390
Dr Sigh received her phd in clinical psychology from the University of

4
00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:18.950
California Berkeley and did her clinical internship and post doctoral fellowship

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.240
in minority mental health at the University of California San Francisco.

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.160
She's currently an associate professor of psychology at Stanford University and

7
00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.380
director of the culture and emotion lab.

8
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.690
Dr. Size research focuses on how cultural ideas and practices shape our

9
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:40.340
feelings,
identities,
and even mental health.
She's highly regarded,

10
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:44.780
especially for her work that we discussed today on an affect valuation across

11
00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:45.650
cultures.

12
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.070
She's received numerous awards including a young investigator award from the

13
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.250
National Alliance for research on schizophrenia and depression and early career

14
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:59.660
award for distinguished contributions from the Asian American Psychological

15
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.220
Association and the Dean's Award for distinguished teaching from Stanford

16
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.720
University.

17
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.720
So I now turn to a very special experts and emotion interview with Doctor Janie

18
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.300
Sy.
So welcome jeany.
Thanks for coming today and speaking.
Oh,

19
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:16.590
it's my pleasure.
Thanks June.

20
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.150
So what I often like to ask people to sort of start his tasks in a little bit

21
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:23.640
about where you first started in the study of emotion,

22
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:26.070
kind of how did it all begin for you?

23
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.380
<v 1>Well,
um,</v>

24
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.200
I was an Undergrad here at Stanford and I was starting to take psychology

25
00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:36.460
classes because I was really interested in human behavior and understanding why

26
00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:40.870
people do the things they do.
And when I started taking the psychology classes,

27
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.130
it became really clear to me that a lot of the models of human behavior that I

28
00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:49.660
was learning in class really didn't apply to my experience as,
you know,

29
00:01:49.661 --> 00:01:53.050
the child of Taiwanese immigrants.
And so,
and,

30
00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:57.550
and one of the examples that I thought was the most surprising was descriptions

31
00:01:57.551 --> 00:02:02.551
of East Asians and particularly Chinese as stoic and inscrutable and is not

32
00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:06.520
having any emotion because my family was so emotional.

33
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.720
And um,
yeah.
So when I was applying to graduate school,

34
00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:13.930
that's Bob Levenson at the University of California,

35
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:17.350
Berkeley was just starting to write a grant on ethnicity to emotion.

36
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.370
And it just seemed like a really good place to start because you know,

37
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.380
emotions do,

38
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:26.560
you have this universal quality to them and we think that we can really read the

39
00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:28.990
emotions of other people and it's really what unites us.

40
00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:33.250
And yet at the same time we talk a lot about cultural differences and there

41
00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:36.250
wasn't really that much research on culture and emotion.

42
00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:40.150
Most of it was ethnographic and so it seemed like a really good place to start.

43
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.790
So that's why I was trying to look on motion.

44
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.771
<v 0>I mean,</v>

45
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:47.580
so since then you've really paved the way for how we think about the way that

46
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:50.670
culture does shape emotional responding and especially,

47
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:54.270
I mean you're wide known from your groundbreaking research and understanding the

48
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:56.670
link between culture and emotion through your theory,

49
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.980
looking at athletic valuation and wonder if you could tell us

50
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.980
<v 1>a little bit about the fundamental principles of what Aflac valuation is and how</v>

51
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.950
it shapes emotional responding cross culturally.
Yeah,
sure.

52
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.870
Well with theory,

53
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.090
athlete valuation theory really came from the work on culture and emotion that I

54
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:17.800
was doing with Bob Levinson.

55
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:21.160
And then later with my graduate students where we were really trying to

56
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:25.630
understand how culture influences how we respond to different emotional events.

57
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.160
And um,

58
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.550
there at the time there wasn't really any debate that if you had some sort of

59
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:33.710
event that meant something different across cultures,

60
00:03:33.711 --> 00:03:37.390
then you'd have a different emotional response.
But the question at the time was,

61
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.000
if you had an event that meant the same thing,

62
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:44.020
would you see differences in physiology and paving subjective experience.

63
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.780
And what we found,
um,
you know,

64
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:50.110
study after study was that there were more cultural similarities than

65
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:53.620
differences.
And I was really surprised by that.
Wow.
And,

66
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.520
but it really made me start thinking that maybe,
um,
what,

67
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.020
what was differing across cultures was more how people want it to feel,

68
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:05.080
what we call their ideal ethic more than how they actually felt,

69
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:06.210
where their actual effect.

70
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.730
So ethic valuation theory was really a way of trying to incorporate that insight

71
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.580
and um,
ideal ethic into current models of emotion,

72
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:18.100
which really focused on actual effect.

73
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.860
And so the first premise is really just that how we want to feel are ideal

74
00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:26.020
athletic differs from how we actually feel our actual ethics.

75
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.250
And that might seem like really obvious,
but what's surprising is,

76
00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:31.450
as you know in psychology,

77
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:33.790
most of it is search is really focused on actual ethic.

78
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.780
And so we just created measures of self report measures will,

79
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.650
where we asked people how much do you actually feel these states on average,

80
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:43.720
and how much you want to feel these states on average.

81
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.130
And we find across a variety of different cultures that people consistently

82
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:52.360
report wanting to feel more positive and less negative than they actually feel.

83
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.660
And when we use much more complicated statistics,
again,

84
00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:59.150
we sort of find that there are these differences between actual and ideal
aspect.

85
00:04:59.151 --> 00:05:02.530
So this sort of sad story is that even though there are some times where you

86
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:06.070
feel how you really want to feel,
most of the time you don't.
Um,

87
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.330
so that's the first premise.

88
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.350
And then that distinction really matters when it comes to thinking about how

89
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:13.240
culture influences how we feel.

90
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.740
Because the second premise is that although culture influences how we want to

91
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:19.240
feel and how we actually feel,

92
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:23.770
it influences how we want to feel even more than how we actually feel.
And again,

93
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:27.010
we've done lots of studies that have shown this using a variety of methods.

94
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.420
When we use self report methods or um,
or behavioral methods,

95
00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:36.280
we find that the cultural differences are larger for how people want to feel

96
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:37.600
than how they actually feel.

97
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.030
And most of those studies are comparing European American and Chinese,

98
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.890
um,
samples.
And what we find is it your Americans really value excitement,

99
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.080
enthusiasm because these high arousal positive states,
um,

100
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.240
more than in Chinese culture where there's more of an emphasis on,
um,

101
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.830
low arousal,
positive states,
calm,

102
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.210
peacefulness and serenity and these cultural differences in ideal athletic

103
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.930
emerge even when you control for differences in actual effect.

104
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:09.710
And oftentimes we don't find any differences in how much people actually feel

105
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:13.500
these states really more and how they want to feel a states.
Um,

106
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.080
so we've also done studies where we look at widely distributed cultural products

107
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:21.230
like magazine advertisements or children's storybooks.
And again,

108
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:25.670
we find that the content of these products really reflect these cultural

109
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:29.720
differences.
An ideal ethics of American magazines have more excitement,

110
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:33.820
smiles and pure comms,
miles and Chinese magazines.
Um,

111
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.730
we think then just comes to the third premise of ethic valuation theory.

112
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:41.870
That ideal aspect really plays an important role in our emotional lives.

113
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:42.500
And again,
it's,

114
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.190
this is one of these things where because most of the work on emotion really

115
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:47.720
focused on American context,

116
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:50.750
it was sort of be given that everybody wanted to feel the same way.

117
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.720
But by doing this cultural analysis,

118
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:57.740
it really revealed that people actually vary within and across cultures and how

119
00:06:57.741 --> 00:07:01.940
they want to feel and that this plays itself out and what people do to feel good

120
00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:06.770
whether you decide to go bungee jumping to go to yoga class or meditate.

121
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.120
Um,
so we,

122
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.070
so we find that how people want to feel influences lots of different choices in

123
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:15.800
their lives.
Like what kind of music they want to listen to,

124
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.490
even what kinds of consumer products they use if you choose a more calm and

125
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:22.910
soothing lotion versus a more exciting and stimulating lotion.

126
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.950
And it also influences things like what kind of physician you want to be,

127
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:32.390
your primary care physician,
um,
and what kinds of social partners you choose.

128
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.500
So those are three sort of premises of ethic valuation theory.

129
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.300
I mean it's shapes just such a broad domain of not only I tell feeling states

130
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:43.700
and the kinds of emotions that people gravitate towards,

131
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:48.350
but you're saying just a profound array of behaviors to in everyday life.
Right?

132
00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:52.670
And that the idea that can influence these things even more than actual ethics.

133
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:55.580
It's not saying that how we actually feel doesn't influence these things.

134
00:07:55.581 --> 00:08:00.020
It certainly does that ideal athletic may influence certain kinds of behaviors

135
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.670
even more so.

136
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:05.180
I mean you've also done this work on cultural variation across emotion response,

137
00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:09.170
looking at physiology,
behavior and subjective experience of emotion.

138
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.160
And you alluded a little to us earlier in your original work with Bob Levenson

139
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.010
and I wonder if you could say a bit more about what were some of the most

140
00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:16.581
exciting,

141
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:20.000
and it sounds like some surprising discoveries here when you embarked on this

142
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.790
multi-method approach to understanding cultural differences and emotion

143
00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:26.240
responding.
Yeah,
we were really,
I mean,

144
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.050
I really was expecting so many more cultural differences and cultural

145
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:32.510
similarities and we would bring,
um,

146
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.290
European Americans and Asian Americans by Cultural Asian Parkins into the lab

147
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:37.124
and we'd have them,

148
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.460
we lived there for an emotional episodes and watched emotional film clips.

149
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:43.310
We had couples talk about emotional topics into the relationship.

150
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.390
And across these different studies we found more similarities than differences,

151
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:49.880
similarities in their physiological responses,

152
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.050
in the reports of subjective experience.
When we found differences,

153
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.130
they were in behavior.
Um,

154
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.300
and those behavioral differences or facial expressions,
um,
we're,

155
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:02.970
we're more pronounced in interpersonal context.

156
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:06.180
So in the couple of studies when people are actually interacting with another

157
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:09.510
person,
we found more of these differences in behavior then when they were,

158
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.510
you know,
watching a film by themselves.
Um,

159
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.480
but even those differences that we found were surprising.

160
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:20.481
So the literature up until then had suggested that Japanese smile more during

161
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:26.070
negative emotion as a way of masking or controlling their negative emotions.

162
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.870
So we thought maybe we would find that.

163
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:32.040
But what we found actually was that the European Americans smile more during

164
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.450
positive events like during happiness and then Asian Americans,

165
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.620
even though they reported feeling the same amount of subjective happiness.

166
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.250
And we now understand this as again,

167
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:47.100
another manifestation of these cultural differences in ideal,

168
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:51.270
an effect that when you come from a culture that really encourages you to feel

169
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:51.991
excited,

170
00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:56.940
a lot of times behaviourally what you're doing unconsciously is amplifying your

171
00:09:56.941 --> 00:09:59.220
positive emotions,
are amplifying your happiness.

172
00:09:59.221 --> 00:10:03.390
And this is what we found that our European Americans were doing in these

173
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.130
studies of emotional responding.

174
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.610
So the study found more similarities than differences.
It's again,

175
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:12.960
what led to us to start thinking about cultural differences and ideal ethic.

176
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.620
But we do think these cultural differences and ideal ethic influenced different

177
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:19.440
aspects of response,
particularly expressive behavior.

178
00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:24.550
<v 0>So what you're saying is that ideal AFX sort of shapes what emotional behaviors</v>

179
00:10:24.551 --> 00:10:26.590
you amplify or show to the world,

180
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.650
<v 1>right?
Or,
and then really unconsciously and really quickly.
So you know,</v>

181
00:10:31.651 --> 00:10:36.420
when you think of what's the most happy smile we think of the Julia Roberts

182
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:40.510
Smile,
right?
I think the big smile,
oh right.
The big plan,

183
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.300
that's really happiness.

184
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:46.170
And I think that really is reflection of the emphasis our culture places on

185
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:50.850
these high arousal positive states.
And again,
like when we look at,
for example,

186
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.920
websites,
your Facebook page,

187
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
as you can see that Asian Americans who are also and Hong Kong,

188
00:10:57.001 --> 00:11:00.450
Chinese also showing happiness or showing more calm smiles,

189
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:03.810
they're not showing that Julia Roberts smile that were,
that we all love.

190
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.610
<v 0>And there you go with your,
Julia Roberts went out.</v>

191
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.340
So one of the things that's also fascinating about the work you do is it has

192
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:17.570
this really kind of beautiful translational component where you've looked at how

193
00:11:17.571 --> 00:11:20.510
cultural variation and emotion responding,
you know,

194
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.130
maybe influenced or how it looks in individuals with symptoms of depression.

195
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.790
And I wonder if you could say a little bit about how different kinds of social

196
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:33.791
cultural context may shape the onset and course of this common chronic and

197
00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:36.650
really debilitating disorder for many people.

198
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:38.670
<v 1>You know,
um,</v>

199
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.200
this is was one of the reasons I was really interested in studying emotion for

200
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:45.710
the obvious clinical implications.
And again,
you know,

201
00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:49.340
there's just a lot of literature suggesting that culture influences the

202
00:11:49.341 --> 00:11:53.680
expression of,
um,
a variety of emotional disorders,

203
00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:57.970
but not a lot of research on how,
and what I really think is true,

204
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:01.270
and this is the anthropologists had been arguing this for a while,
but,
uh,

205
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.750
how we define,
um,
depression and other forms of,
um,

206
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.650
and other abnormal behavior really depends on how we define what's the more

207
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.450
normal.
And so,
in a series of studies with Yulia 10 Sova Denton,

208
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.400
and we looked at the impact of depression on emotional functioning in European

209
00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:19.780
Americans and Asian Americans,

210
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.370
and we replicated the common finding that for European Americans who are

211
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:28.480
depressed,
depressions dampens their emotional functioning,
right?

212
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.160
They show the splat ethic.

213
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:34.600
They're less likely to smile during an amazing film clip.
Um,

214
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.710
but for your,
for Asian Americans,
we actually see the opposite effect.

215
00:12:38.711 --> 00:12:41.980
Asian Americans actually amplify their emotional responses when they're

216
00:12:41.981 --> 00:12:45.550
depressed.
Wow.
Cry More and response to a sad film clip.

217
00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:48.910
They smile more when they're,
I'm watching them using film clip.

218
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.070
And we think that this has to,

219
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:56.130
this really illustrates how cultural norms of emotion play a role in the

220
00:12:56.441 --> 00:12:57.940
manifestation of depression.

221
00:12:57.941 --> 00:13:02.770
So European Americans are probably dampening because they can't adhere to the

222
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:07.150
cultural ideal of expressing their high arousal,
positive ethic,
right?

223
00:13:07.151 --> 00:13:10.450
So they depression and being depressed means they're there,

224
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.980
they're showing flat flattened or damp and responses.
But for Asian Americans,

225
00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:17.500
their ideal really is to moderate their emotions,

226
00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:20.350
to try to get to this low arousal state.
So when they can't do it,

227
00:13:20.351 --> 00:13:23.680
when they're depressed,
you're actually showing a greater response.

228
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:28.330
So I think that this work really suggests that even how we assess depression,

229
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.040
um,
has,
has to,

230
00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:33.400
we have to take into consideration the cultural ideals and practices of the

231
00:13:33.401 --> 00:13:38.020
group that we're looking at.
And that depression can manifest itself differently,

232
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:42.180
looks different depending on the cultural context or the cultural norms of the

233
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.670
patient.
And this,

234
00:13:43.671 --> 00:13:47.140
so this obviously has implications for how we assess depression.

235
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:52.141
We have some studies that show that American clinicians are more likely to call

236
00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:58.690
and non-depressed Asian American depressed because at showing that excitement

237
00:13:58.691 --> 00:14:01.990
that they're expecting that they're going to see in somebody who's not
depressed.

238
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.570
Um,
and so I,
you know,

239
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.660
we think that clinicians really need to take this into consideration when

240
00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:10.750
they're assessing depression and even when they're treating depression.

241
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:15.370
So there's a lot of data that suggests that ethnic minorities and Asian

242
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.640
Americans in particular don't adhere to.
Um,
they,

243
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.810
they don't continue with psychotherapy and they don't adhere to a variety of

244
00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:24.880
psychiatric treatments.
And in part,

245
00:14:24.881 --> 00:14:29.350
that may be because the treatments that they're receiving are treatments that

246
00:14:29.351 --> 00:14:31.900
are trying to get them to this high arousal positive state,

247
00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:34.060
which is in a state that they actually want to feel.

248
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.000
So the data that I love the most,

249
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:41.320
it's sort of come from your area of expertise or the data that suggests that,

250
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.880
you know,
an American context.
Um,

251
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:47.320
American bipolar patients are just notorious for not wanting to take their mood

252
00:14:47.321 --> 00:14:48.220
stabilizers.

253
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:53.870
And because it takes away the highs that they like.
But in Hong Kong,

254
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:58.430
the adherence rates for mood stabilizers are significantly higher.

255
00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:01.850
Almost everybody takes them among the bipolar patients.
And again,

256
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:03.680
I think it's because we don't know for sure,

257
00:15:03.681 --> 00:15:08.300
but my theory about it is that it's because in would stabilize mood stabilizers

258
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.860
are that low arousal state.
It's valued by the culture.

259
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.840
So culture can influence,
you know,

260
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.170
even whether or not you would hear two particular treatments.

261
00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.970
<v 0>That's amazing.
I mean,
in,
in the case of bipolar disorder,</v>

262
00:15:20.971 --> 00:15:24.030
I know we've been talking about this and some of the work we're doing,
I mean,

263
00:15:24.031 --> 00:15:28.170
that is one of the most significant barriers to treatment is just having people

264
00:15:28.171 --> 00:15:32.540
accept what the treatment target is and adhering to medications or thigh

265
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.820
psychotherapy that's gonna bring them down from that high arousal states.
Right?

266
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:40.040
<v 1>Yeah.
So I would also suggest that maybe in therapy what we need to be doing is</v>

267
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:43.090
changing people's aspect of ideals.
Yeah,
no.

268
00:15:43.091 --> 00:15:46.280
And that maybe that's a way to get them to adhere to treatment more.

269
00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:47.371
<v 0>Well,</v>

270
00:15:47.371 --> 00:15:51.510
you said also made me wonder too about how we track symptom change over time.
So,

271
00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.810
you know,
you're talking about how an Asian American cultures there can be this

272
00:15:54.811 --> 00:15:58.560
amplification of even positive affectivity the more depressed they are.

273
00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:02.580
So in many ways it seems that what they're manifesting is the opposite of the

274
00:16:02.581 --> 00:16:06.090
kinds of changes that are tracked in your typical sort of,
you know,

275
00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:08.960
western American,
uh,
you know,
treatment protocol.

276
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.800
We're looking for more amplified emotion expressions as a sign that depression,

277
00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:17.910
you know,
being going into remission.
Right,
right.
Exactly.
Yeah.

278
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.051
I mean,

279
00:16:19.051 --> 00:16:23.130
so as someone who's an expert in so many things in this domain from the kinds of

280
00:16:23.131 --> 00:16:24.450
emotions we want to feel,

281
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.290
the kinds of emotions people manifest and experience coming from different

282
00:16:28.291 --> 00:16:32.640
cultural context and also the way the shapes such important mental health

283
00:16:32.641 --> 00:16:34.920
outcomes as depression.
Um,

284
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.480
when you think about what got you into motion and all the work you've done now,

285
00:16:39.481 --> 00:16:41.940
he sort of turned towards the future horizon,
sort of,

286
00:16:41.941 --> 00:16:46.800
where do you see the future going in emotion,
sort of,
where does it,

287
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.140
where is it headed next in your opinion?

288
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.520
<v 1>Well,
I think that um,</v>

289
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:56.580
one relate same direction is that people are really assuming more of an

290
00:16:56.651 --> 00:16:59.140
interdisciplinary approach to your emotion.
I mean,

291
00:16:59.141 --> 00:17:01.510
they're really trying to bridge different areas.

292
00:17:01.511 --> 00:17:04.000
So I think of a lot of the work that is going on,

293
00:17:04.001 --> 00:17:07.990
on emotion in cancer and in lots of different kinds of health settings.

294
00:17:07.991 --> 00:17:09.550
So I think that's really exciting.

295
00:17:09.551 --> 00:17:13.060
We're looking at emotions in the workplace and I mean,

296
00:17:13.061 --> 00:17:17.140
there's always been some of that work now,
but I think there's even more,

297
00:17:17.141 --> 00:17:21.640
it's being brought into the mainstream aspect of science work.
Um,

298
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:25.300
but I think really the future has to be in,
this obviously comes from,
you know,

299
00:17:25.301 --> 00:17:28.900
my interest to really think about how culture,

300
00:17:28.901 --> 00:17:32.770
our cultural ideas and practices shape how we do the science of emotion.

301
00:17:32.771 --> 00:17:35.380
And you know,
what our assumptions are about emotion.

302
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.290
Because if we really want to study human emotion,

303
00:17:38.291 --> 00:17:41.530
we really have to think about our socio cultural context.

304
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.690
I mean everybody is shaped by their,

305
00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.660
the dominant cultural ideas and practices in one way or another.

306
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:51.390
And we can see that even in how we do the,
the work on emotion.
So for example,

307
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:51.601
you know,

308
00:17:51.601 --> 00:17:56.601
in a lot of the work we define positive emotion as high arousal positive states,

309
00:17:56.761 --> 00:17:57.780
it just makes sense,
right?

310
00:17:57.781 --> 00:18:00.690
The people who are putting together the inventories are coming from an American

311
00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:04.950
context and um,
and are unconsciously,
you know,

312
00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:08.070
defining states in a certain way that are a product of their culture.

313
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:13.110
And so I think we really need to try to rethink some of our assumptions about

314
00:18:13.111 --> 00:18:17.490
emotion aspect of processes that take into consideration other cultural ideas

315
00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:22.110
and practices.
I think that's how we're going to really understand really,
um,

316
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:26.510
all the ins and outs of the emotional life.
So that's where I,

317
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:31.240
I hope is going.
Um,
so birth interdisciplinarily and,
um,

318
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.830
and then I think in doing this work across cultures and taking into

319
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.780
consideration cultural ideas.
And practices,

320
00:18:36.781 --> 00:18:40.410
I think we're going to be integrating even more across different levels of

321
00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:42.270
analysis.
I think that's really exciting

322
00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.300
<v 0>and I love to,
the emphasis you're putting on context,
right?</v>

323
00:18:46.301 --> 00:18:48.460
That everyone comes from a different context.

324
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:52.150
And culture is one of the most profound context that we live in.
Right?

325
00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:57.070
And we're conducting these studies many times acting as if people live in a

326
00:18:57.071 --> 00:18:59.530
vacuum and that everyone lives in the same vacuum.
Right.

327
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.450
<v 1>Wait.
Right.
Yeah.
And I think the real question is,</v>

328
00:19:03.451 --> 00:19:08.451
I mean the interesting thing about human emotion is how flexible it is and how

329
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:11.310
much it is shaped by our cultural context.

330
00:19:11.311 --> 00:19:14.280
So I'm really hoping that's where we're going to go next.

331
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:15.320
<v 0>I hope so too.</v>

332
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.450
So then often I'm sure people come to you and ask you about the future of

333
00:19:20.451 --> 00:19:21.560
emotion to our students,

334
00:19:21.561 --> 00:19:25.400
or maybe just the general public getting interested in emotion and wanting to

335
00:19:25.401 --> 00:19:26.234
learn more.

336
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.840
So when you do have students or people in general who come to you and ask you

337
00:19:29.841 --> 00:19:32.150
for advice,
what do,
what do you tell them?

338
00:19:32.151 --> 00:19:34.790
For those who are thinking about embarking in this exciting,

339
00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.030
mysterious and like you're saying,
flexible world of emotion.

340
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:44.070
<v 1>Well I think it's really exciting all of the tools that we're developing to</v>

341
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:46.760
study different aspects of,
um,

342
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:49.680
the emotion process or different aspect of phenomena.

343
00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:54.681
So I think it's important to learn as many tools as possible and to learn the

344
00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:59.400
models.
But I also think it's important to think outside the box.

345
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.960
And so at the same time that you're mastering these different techniques and

346
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:09.020
mastering use different models to really be open to a variety of different

347
00:20:09.121 --> 00:20:11.340
perspectives and to question,
you know,

348
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.130
are these really the emotions that we should be studying?

349
00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.730
Are there other states that we could include in our studies that might reveal

350
00:20:17.731 --> 00:20:20.040
other interesting things about our emotional lives?

351
00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:25.460
So it's a combination of mastering existing tools and integrating them in new

352
00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:27.060
and interesting ways,

353
00:20:27.061 --> 00:20:31.440
but at the same time sort of questioning them and always sort of pushing the

354
00:20:31.441 --> 00:20:34.380
envelope in terms of,
you know,
what we include in our studies.

355
00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.350
That's probably what's going to future students of emotion.

356
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.620
<v 0>Well,
I think it makes it a very exciting future.
Talking to you.</v>

357
00:20:40.621 --> 00:20:42.510
So many opportunities,
right.

358
00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:46.890
And so many different levels to tackle it at and to try to also look at these

359
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.410
different levels simultaneously.
Yup,
exactly.

360
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.950
So thank you again for joining us today,
Jeanie.
