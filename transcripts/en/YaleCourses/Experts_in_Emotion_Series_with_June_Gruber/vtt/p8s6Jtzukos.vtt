1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.000
For our experts in emotion interview.

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:06.230
We have the honor of speaking with doctor June Tangney,
um,

3
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.950
on shame and guilt,
the good,
the bad,
and the ugly.

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.660
So Dr Tangney received her phd in clinical psychology from the University of

5
00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:15.950
California,
Los Angeles,

6
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.240
and is currently a professor of psychology at George Mason Mason University.

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.670
She's a fellow of the APA is division of personality and social psychology and

8
00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:27.590
the American psychological society.

9
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.210
She's authored or edited several books on shame,
uh,
including and,

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.550
and as well as guilt and self conscious emotions.

11
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.440
These books include shame and guilt,

12
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.770
social psychological foundations of clinical psychology,

13
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.600
the self conscious emotions,

14
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:45.230
theory and research and the handbook of self and identity.

15
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.390
Her research has been funded by the end,

16
00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:52.070
Ida and I see HD NSF and the John Templeton Foundation.

17
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.730
Um,

18
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.730
she's also a very much loved teacher and recipient of the George Mason

19
00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:00.560
University's teaching excellence award.

20
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.860
So I now turn to our experts in emotion interview with doctor June Tangney.

21
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.110
Okay.
Oh,
welcome.
June.
Thanks for speaking with us today.

22
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.620
<v 1>Thank you for happy.</v>

23
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.360
<v 0>It's always nice to speak to another June out there.</v>

24
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.940
So I wondered if I could ask you to start off by telling us a little bit about

25
00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:25.550
what first got you interested in the study of emotion.

26
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.520
<v 1>Um,
hold on.
I've always been an emotional person and interested in emotions and,</v>

27
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.470
um,
when I first started doing work in this area,
yes,
I'm almost 30 years ago,

28
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:40.010
I guess I'm [inaudible] we're not really you seen?
Yes.

29
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.773
<v 2>Hm.</v>

30
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.530
<v 1>I do.
Yup.
For sure.
For both.</v>

31
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.960
That Eh,
Eh,
Eh,

32
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.510
was dissuaded by a number of people to bed.

33
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.410
I had become interested in the emotions of shame and guilt.

34
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.720
Having read Helen Block Lewis's buy canned.

35
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.210
<v 3>Yes.
I was raised a Catholic and um,</v>

36
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.470
really had some fundamental questions about how these emotions can be useful and

37
00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:10.400
when they go awry.

38
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.010
<v 0>Hmm.
So I mean,
since then you've really pioneered the field of research,</v>

39
00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:17.650
looking at a family of self conscious emotions.

40
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.730
And so I wanted to ask you a bit about your work here.
Um,
and in particular,

41
00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:23.230
I mean,
like I said,
you know,

42
00:02:23.231 --> 00:02:26.590
you're well known for your influential work in the family of self conscious

43
00:02:26.591 --> 00:02:29.140
emotions and particularly looking at guilt and shame.

44
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.440
And I wanted to start off asking some broad questions,

45
00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:37.030
which is sort of what do you consider to be the most important features of what

46
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:41.510
makes self conscious emotions a unique class in themselves?
What,

47
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.360
what are they in your perspective?

48
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.890
<v 1>Well,
it's a really interesting set of emotion where,
um,</v>

49
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.950
the target of evaluation is the fell and the evaluator themselves.

50
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.120
So the self is evaluating the self.

51
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.300
These are pretty advanced it emotions.

52
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.490
They don't appear within the first six months of life.
In fact,

53
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.320
people argue about when exactly they emerge,

54
00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:11.321
but it's necessary to have a sense of self is separate from the world.

55
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.570
It's necessary to have a set of standards by which you evaluate it,

56
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.100
the self.
And in the case of guilt,

57
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.130
it's necessary to have the ability to make a distinction between oneself and

58
00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:25.490
one's behave here.

59
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.470
So these are emotions that develop later in life.
Um,
certainly,

60
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.240
um,
shame may emerge around age three,
guilt,
maybe five or six or seven.

61
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.570
Um,
and,
um,
they're,

62
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.890
they're really complex social emotions that have a lot of implications for once

63
00:03:42.891 --> 00:03:47.540
and interpersonal relationships and also emotions that have important

64
00:03:47.541 --> 00:03:51.860
implications for how we feel about ourselves and how we behave in the future.

65
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.740
And so what do you see as some important sort of next steps or self conscious

66
00:03:57.741 --> 00:04:02.530
emotions?
Oh,
there's so much yet still.
Um,

67
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.910
it's been exciting to see,
um,

68
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.600
Ma researchers doing work on the self conscious emotions,
um,

69
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.840
and really broadening our,
our notions about what falls within that,

70
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.830
that families,
for example,
shame and guilt are really,
um,

71
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.750
kind of classic self conscious emotions.

72
00:04:20.751 --> 00:04:25.300
But pride has been receiving a lot of the attention recently and,
um,

73
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.700
a little less so embarrassed.
Yeah.
So that's exciting to see,

74
00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:33.701
but we still have so many questions left on an third for the next generations of

75
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.100
served jury.
Uh,

76
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.020
I think we'll keep question is,
um,

77
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.950
that we need to better understand the situations or the conditions under which

78
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.560
shame and guilt can be adaptive versus maladaptive.

79
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.580
I think a lot of the research is kind of

80
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.263
the adaptive

81
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.270
<v 3>functions of guilt and the hidden costs of shame.
Um,</v>

82
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.360
but I think understanding when Shane can be useful and adaptive is something

83
00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:02.380
that we need to explore.

84
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.450
And also when guilt can be become problematic for people both as individuals and

85
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.220
in their relationship.
Um,
another big question for me is,
um,

86
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.280
when did Shane lead to anger and aggression versus withdrawal and depression?

87
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.190
We know that shame can take us down a number of different paths,

88
00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:26.191
but it's not really clear for whom and under what conditions people respond to

89
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.440
threatening feelings of shame and these different ways.

90
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.700
I'm a big question that has

91
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.540
puzzled me for,
for,

92
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.570
for decades is where do individual differences in proneness to shame and

93
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:43.030
proneness to guilt come from?

94
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.940
We know that they're pretty well established by at least,
um,
um,

95
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.300
middle elementary school.
Uh,

96
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.940
but we don't know much about how people develop these individuals.

97
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.490
It doesn't seem to cities simply a matter of shame,

98
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:03.491
prone honors have shame prone daughters or should feel prone fathers have built

99
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.520
on.
Um,
and it doesn't seem to be just a matter of temperament.

100
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.860
And so I think that's a really big mystery for us.

101
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.620
<v 0>So,
I mean,
you're talking about guilt and shame a lot.
And I mean,</v>

102
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.970
one part of your risk that's been so important is to,
you know,

103
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.890
systematically compare these two motions,

104
00:06:19.891 --> 00:06:23.850
which I think a lot of people in their everyday life confuse them or use them

105
00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:24.870
interchangeably.

106
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.590
And I wonder if you could say a little bit about what are the core features of

107
00:06:28.591 --> 00:06:30.810
guilt and shame and what are their similarities,

108
00:06:30.811 --> 00:06:33.180
but also what are the really important differences?

109
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.950
<v 3>Right.
Well,</v>

110
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.120
the similarities are they're both negative self conscious emotions that feel

111
00:06:40.121 --> 00:06:40.954
pretty bad.

112
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.270
They occur when we fail or track progress in ways that are,

113
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.070
um,
important and meaningful to us in our environment.
Um,

114
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.410
but the differences when people feel shame,
they feel as a

115
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.880
person,
I'm a bad person for having done this.

116
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.630
Whereas when people feel guilt,
they feel bad about a specific behavior.

117
00:07:04.631 --> 00:07:07.090
I feel bad for having done that.

118
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.280
And this differential emphasis on self versus behavior seems to give rise to

119
00:07:12.281 --> 00:07:16.300
very different motivations and very different,
phenomenal,
logical,
uh,

120
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.080
kinds of experiences.
So when people feel shame about the self,

121
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.910
they often want to shrink into the floor.

122
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:27.760
And then disappear or they feel impaired or for the moment they feel defensive

123
00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:29.650
often.
And,
uh,

124
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.210
really want to initially escape from the shame and do seem situation.

125
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.530
When people feel guilt about a specific behavior,

126
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.830
they're not so threatened about the cells and they're more able to focus on the

127
00:07:41.831 --> 00:07:46.800
consequences of their behavior for other people.
So there was a press tours,
um,

128
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.800
confession,

129
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:52.570
apology in somehow repairing the harm that was done.

130
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.660
So I see guilt,

131
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.050
Jen has been a more future oriented kind of prosocial emotion,

132
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.770
whereas shame may sometimes have those,

133
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:04.681
those outcomes,

134
00:08:04.681 --> 00:08:09.681
but often it'd be people down the path of defensiveness and sometimes anger and

135
00:08:09.881 --> 00:08:10.714
aggression.

136
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:11.741
<v 0>Interesting.</v>

137
00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:16.741
So I mean you've also looked at these divergent social consequences associated

138
00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:19.150
with guilt and shame as well,
which you've alluded to.

139
00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:21.220
And I wonder if you could say for example,

140
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.400
I mean your work has looked at ways in which they differentially relate to

141
00:08:24.401 --> 00:08:25.900
empathy.
Um,

142
00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:29.350
so how can guilt and shame be so distinct and the way they relate to how we

143
00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:32.080
understand other people in their minds and their feelings?

144
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.680
<v 3>I think one of the key differences is that is that shame is a very self focused</v>

145
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.570
self.
This kind of emotion,
it's about me,

146
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:50.170
not about you and how I hurt your feelings.
It's about me being a bad person.

147
00:08:50.171 --> 00:08:52.090
And so the focus is really on the self,

148
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.740
taken away from others in the field with guilt,

149
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.600
you're focusing on at behavior somewhat apart from the south.

150
00:08:59.601 --> 00:09:04.601
And I think draws people's attention more the impact of that behavior on other

151
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:09.330
people.
And so it seem like this is a very

152
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.430
close link between feelings of guilt and feelings of empathy,
um,

153
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.030
whereas if anything,
shame seems to interfere with an empathic connection.

154
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:23.010
And we have data now from a study of about 500,
um,

155
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:28.210
felony offenders showing that progress to guilt,
um,
uh,

156
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.710
negatively predicts Rhea fence and a rearrest where shame has a much more

157
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:39.570
complicated relationship with hope,
which released adjustment.

158
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:41.730
So for the most part,
um,

159
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.720
shame leads to external validation of blame,

160
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.550
which then leads to reascend.
Um,

161
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.270
but there's a direct effect which can be in inventory.

162
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:55.050
So what that says to me is that shame is a complex emotion,

163
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.650
which sometimes can be helpful in,
uh,

164
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.440
inhibiting Rhea fence,

165
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.470
but often leads us down a path of defensiveness and basically doing that,

166
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:10.150
learning from our mistakes and doing the same thing in a little break.

167
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:12.760
<v 0>What about,
I mean,</v>

168
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.080
that is so fascinating and I know you've also looked at differences between

169
00:10:18.141 --> 00:10:22.610
guilt and shame and fostering different sort of motivational tendencies to help

170
00:10:22.611 --> 00:10:25.940
redress maybe kind of more socially embedded problems.

171
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.240
<v 3>Yes.
And,
um,
people who do work on,
um,
group based shame and guilt,</v>

172
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:37.670
that's another whole literature that is really been burgeoning in the past year.

173
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.680
So focused a lot on how group-based shame and guilt motivate people to,

174
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.330
um,

175
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.920
address social injustices that have been perpetrated perpetrated by their

176
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.863
groups.

177
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.711
<v 0>Fantastic.</v>

178
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:56.940
So having talked about kind of what first got you interested in motion and then

179
00:10:56.941 --> 00:10:58.050
all the,
you know,

180
00:10:58.051 --> 00:11:01.080
just amazing work you've done in the realm of self conscious emotions,

181
00:11:01.081 --> 00:11:02.310
especially shame and guilt.

182
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.120
I wonder what you think from your perspectives in store for the future of

183
00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:08.790
emotion given it as such a young field still.

184
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.050
<v 3>Yes.
Um,</v>

185
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:17.340
there's lots of additional areas to look at.
I think that the,
uh,

186
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.090
the work that people are now beginning to,
uh,

187
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.960
to do looking at neuro endocrine correlates of shame and guilt to really

188
00:11:24.961 --> 00:11:25.794
interesting.

189
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.970
One of the challenges we have in studying these moral emotions is that they

190
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:34.830
don't have clear facial expressions associated with them.
In fact,

191
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.510
um,
uh,
guilt,

192
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.100
no postural or facial expressions associated with it.

193
00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:45.670
I think that the guilt sign is,
I'm sorry,
you know,
are,

194
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:51.000
um,
and so I think I'm learning more about the brain and um,

195
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.770
uh,

196
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:57.280
how brain functions when we're experiencing these moral emotions and also how

197
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.590
people who are prone to shame versus prone to guilt,
um,

198
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:06.730
may differ in terms of their brains functioning is a really exciting area.

199
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:12.670
<v 1>And that's the thing is we don't know much about how she dealt play out in</v>

200
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.150
interpersonal context.
Even though they're very social emotions,

201
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.010
there's been almost no work done.
Um,

202
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:23.570
the phenomena of guilt tripping and tripping other people,

203
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.450
um,
when people do not,
um,

204
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:31.250
what the outcomes are when this happens a lot in real life.
Um,

205
00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:35.990
but social psychologists haven't really examined very closely and I think that's

206
00:12:35.991 --> 00:12:37.340
an important direction.

207
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.210
<v 0>Well,
I just wanted to ask you then to,</v>

208
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:45.010
so when students come to you and they ask you questions about should I,

209
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:45.281
you know,

210
00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:49.390
embarked in the study of emotion or what should I be thinking about if I do,

211
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.940
what kind of advice do you give sort of the future scholars,
you know,

212
00:12:52.941 --> 00:12:53.774
in the field?

213
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:58.370
<v 1>Yeah,
well I give them the advice my advisor gave me,
which is first of all,</v>

214
00:12:58.371 --> 00:13:01.300
if that's where your heart is,
go for it.
Yeah.
Um,

215
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.990
it's a really exciting field of research now.
Um,

216
00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.100
and I think,
um,

217
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:12.130
the second piece is be the pay very close attention to measurement.

218
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.580
These are difficult emotions too to measure.

219
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:20.590
Sometimes people have difficulty even reporting accurately on feelings of shame

220
00:13:20.841 --> 00:13:22.310
in the moment,
for example.

221
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.570
And I think one of our challenges in the field is to come up with better,

222
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.020
especially it measures about shame and guilt.

223
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.910
<v 0>Absolutely.
So then I just wanted to say thank you so much Jan,</v>

224
00:13:34.911 --> 00:13:36.470
for speaking with us today.

225
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.110
<v 1>It's been a delight.
Thank you very queasy.
And reading this wonderful series.</v>

226
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:41.970
<v 0>Okay,</v>

227
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:46.260
so this concludes our experts and emotion interview with doctor June Tangney

228
00:13:46.261 --> 00:13:48.180
from George Mason University.
