00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.040
Hi.
So welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:06.480
Say we're going to continue to talk about the ways in which emotion shape our

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:11.310
judgements and decisions when it comes to money.
So again,

4
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:15.540
we're going to be trying to pick up this question of in what way does our wallet

5
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:16.800
reflect our feelings?

6
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.330
And also looking at the other direction of a what way do our emotions actually

7
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:25.680
shape the kinds of economic decisions that we make,
how we spend our money,

8
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:28.950
whether or not to save our money,
should we donate to charity?

9
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:32.520
And precisely how should we try to save for our longterm future?

10
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.270
And really what does emotion have anything to do with these questions?

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.800
So this will be our second module looking at judgment and decision making.

12
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.680
And today we'll be talking about emotion and spending.

13
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.890
So here we'll be looking at this question.
As you can see here,

14
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.130
can feelings actually shape our spending?

15
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.120
So this is a roadmap that will take us through this question.

16
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.670
We'll start by looking at emotion and consumption.

17
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.930
So in what way does emotion shape the kinds of things that we consume in terms

18
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:03.840
of,
you know,
what we buy and how we spend them.

19
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:07.320
We'll look at this field of neuroeconomics of emotion,

20
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:11.460
a really novel interdisciplinary field that tries to integrate across

21
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:12.480
psychology,

22
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.300
economics and neuroscience to understand what is the brain basis.
You know,

23
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.100
the ways in which we spend our money and think about our money.

24
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.490
Then we'll conclude with our takeaway questions and expert interview.

25
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.290
So let's start with this topic of emotion and consumption and thinking precisely

26
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:33.291
how does emotion shaped the way that we spend our money and consume products in

27
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:34.710
the world around us.

28
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.430
So we all know that emotions play some role and how we buy things and what we

29
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:45.510
buy.
You can see advertisements here that really tried to provoke us to elicit

30
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:49.530
feelings maybe of desire or have pride and status.

31
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.640
And in some way it seems that the very ads that we see,
you know,

32
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:57.720
just everywhere in our everyday life in some ways are picking up on emotions.

33
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.620
And those emotions in some way may be shaping the kinds of things we want.

34
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.510
Whether it's a,
you know,
diamond set,

35
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:07.050
it's cell phone or a really fancy car or some really cool clothes,

36
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.330
but really precisely how do emotions shape our behavior patterns of,

37
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.890
you know,
financial consumption.

38
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.410
I think it's first important to start with this I question of what do we mean by

39
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:20.940
consumption in the first place.

40
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.000
So here I'm just going to walk through a very basic definition.

41
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.030
So consumption is the process in which goods and services are bought and used to

42
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:31.380
serve people's wants,

43
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.250
which are called luxuries as well as their needs or necessities.

44
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.850
Necessities are goods and services for which a demand is insensitive to changes

45
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:45.810
in consumer income such as medicine,
whereas luxuries by contrast,

46
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:49.620
our goods and services for which demand is sensitive to changes in consumer

47
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:53.820
income.
So things like jewelry or fancy clothing or a fancy car.

48
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.040
So most consumption,

49
00:02:56.041 --> 00:03:00.400
interestingly the United States as the consumption of luxuries instead of

50
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:04.360
necessities.
So for example,

51
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.660
one of the kinds of luxuries you often spend our money on that's um,

52
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.350
an everyday kind of luxury is spending money on movies.

53
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.050
And I think one of the most perplexing questions here,

54
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:18.190
and we think about how we spend our money on this kind of luxury is why do we

55
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:21.010
spend money to feel negative?

56
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.240
Why do we pay to watch horror films like the grudge or saw?

57
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:29.170
You can think of many others that actually make us feel feelings of fear or

58
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:30.010
disgust.

59
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.000
So this has been a really perplexing question in this field for some time now,

60
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:34.271
right?

61
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:38.650
Because consumer research should assume that as human beings we would pursue

62
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.870
pleasure and try to avoid pain.

63
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.320
So then why would so many people enjoy and pay money to be terrified?

64
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:50.410
We have giant industries devoted to,
you know,
horror films.

65
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.910
And why do other people seem to dislike horror films and wouldn't go even if

66
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:56.380
someone paid them to go.

67
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.210
So what is this relationship between spending money and eliciting negative

68
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:02.044
emotions?

69
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.040
So some colleagues did a study to really try to answer this at least as a first

70
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:12.430
pass,
as to why do we consume negative emotions?

71
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.250
So in this study they had participants in two groups.

72
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.120
They had participants who enjoy horror films or dislike horror films.

73
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:23.950
And maybe you can think of yourself in which category you fall into,
um,

74
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:27.160
whether you like horror films or you'd rather kind of stay away from them.

75
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.420
And then the method that they employed here with these two groups of people is

76
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:35.470
they had them rate their emotional states before and after watching a very

77
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:38.650
horrific movie clip.
And here's what they found.

78
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.360
So the results suggest that participants who enjoyed horror films experienced

79
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:48.130
the same increase in negative emotion as those who dislike horror films.

80
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.930
So it's pretty wild,
right?

81
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:54.670
People who do and do not like horror films both feel the same degree of negative

82
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:59.020
emotionality and the same intensity of that experience when they watch these

83
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:01.960
films.
But here's the crucial difference.

84
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.950
They also experienced increases and positive emotion.

85
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.900
So participants who don't like horror films don't experience positive emotion,

86
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.470
but those who do also experience positive emotion.

87
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.480
So what the authors tried to propose here is that this co-occurrence of both

88
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:21.290
positive and negative emotions,

89
00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:26.291
seeing bumps up in both is what makes horror movies particularly pleasurable for

90
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:28.360
those people who seek them out.

91
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.250
It's almost like you're amping up your emotional system in both the positive and

92
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:34.780
negative valence direction.

93
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.740
And that's what motivates people to go out and seek some of these horror films.

94
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.280
And it's those people who have the absence of positive emotion that are going to

95
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:46.720
be less likely to spend money consuming negative emotions.

96
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.750
Okay,
so that's about consuming negative emotions.

97
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.620
What about spending money as an,

98
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.090
in terms of how it relates to our happiness?

99
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.150
Do we think money can buy happiness?
Traditionally?
You know,

100
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:02.780
we know this expression that we say to ourselves and that we hear,
you know,

101
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:05.630
in the media that money really can't buy happiness.

102
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.250
And this has been sort of the long prevailing conception for many years until

103
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:13.470
very recently when two colleagues of mine,
uh,

104
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.960
Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Norton did a groundbreaking study finding that there

105
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:21.710
are actually some ways in which money can buy happiness.

106
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.150
They found though that it's when you spend money on other people.

107
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.750
So they found that spending money on others promotes happiness.

108
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.530
And particularly if you look at the abstract here,
I'll read it with you.

109
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.510
They say,
although much research has examined the effect of income on happiness,

110
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.780
we suggest that how people spend their money may be at least as important as how

111
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:46.730
much money they earn.
So they height.

112
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:51.530
We hypothesize that spending money on other people may have a more positive

113
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:56.531
impact on happiness than actually spending money on oneself providing converging

114
00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:58.640
evidence.
For this hypothesis,

115
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.850
we found that spending money of one's income on others predicted greater

116
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:04.491
happiness,

117
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:09.050
both cross-sectionally in a nationally representative survey study and

118
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:12.620
longitudinally in a field study of windfall spending.

119
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.000
And finally participants who were randomly assigned to spend money on others

120
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.950
experience greater happiness than those assigned to spend money on themselves.

121
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.970
Now these findings have gained widespread attention and really may suggest why

122
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.590
buying presence rather people are donating to charity make us feel so good.

123
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.810
And as a result of this research,

124
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:36.800
both Michael Norton and Liz Dunn have given a lot of talks in the public media

125
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.190
and now have a book that has just come out called happy money.

126
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.620
The science of spark smarter spending.

127
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.980
And here what it explains his ways in which perhaps you can get more happiness

128
00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:52.910
for your money by following what they outline is five core principles from

129
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:56.420
choosing experiences over stuff,
to spending money on others.

130
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.120
And in these five principles outlined in their book,

131
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:01.580
they can be used not only by individuals,

132
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.990
but perhaps also had a bigger group level by companies who are perhaps going to

133
00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:10.610
try to seek to create happier employees and provide happier products to their

134
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:11.271
customers.

135
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:16.271
So both I'm done and Norton really show how companies from Google to Pepsi have

136
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:19.160
put these ideas into action.

137
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.060
So if you're interested in really learning about this really groundbreaking new

138
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:26.300
field of how money might actually promote happiness,

139
00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:29.120
if you spend it on others and you spend in certain ways,

140
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:31.580
I highly recommend checking out their book happy money.

141
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.040
So now we're going to turn to a different side of thinking about emotion

142
00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:37.970
consumerism.

143
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.580
And here what we're going to look at is this idea of consumer ad evaluation.

144
00:08:42.581 --> 00:08:47.581
So how emotions shaped the way that we influence advertisements around us.

145
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:51.860
We all see commercials and everyday life and precisely in what way does our

146
00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:54.680
current mood state shaped the way that we perceive that Ad.

147
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.530
So here's a study that was done by Goran and colleagues and it went is followed.

148
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.710
So participants listen to music.
Um,

149
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.080
they are randomly assigned to either listen to pleasant,

150
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.140
upbeat music or more unpleasant music.

151
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.230
And then they saw a series of advertisements.

152
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.730
One was of a man and woman walking in the distance that was relatively

153
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:17.310
ambiguous.
Um,
this is the one on the right,

154
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:21.600
you can see two people walking in the distance and the other on the left was a

155
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.330
advertisement of a really happy family spending time together.
That is,

156
00:09:27.331 --> 00:09:30.120
has a very clear positive tone.
So again,

157
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:33.720
they saw ads that either had a more ambiguous tone or one that had a clear,

158
00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:35.070
positive social tone.

159
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.670
They were then asked to provide their evaluations of the ad.

160
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.940
So examples of the questions they were asked is I like the ad or the ad is good

161
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:45.090
or bad.
Right.

162
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:50.190
And what they found in their study is that participants in the pleasant music

163
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:52.830
condition reported a rating.

164
00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:57.060
The add more favorably compared to the unpleasant music condition.
Right.

165
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.900
And this was interesting because this was really pronounced for the ad that had

166
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:05.700
a more ambiguous tone.
But when the ad had a very,
very clear positive tone,

167
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.710
the emotional elicitation had no influence on how people evaluated the ad.

168
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.540
So it seems to be that our emotional states may shape how we evaluate an ad and

169
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:16.410
how,
you know,

170
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:21.330
positively we perceive it when the ad is relatively neutral or ambiguous in

171
00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:23.310
tone.
Okay.

172
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:27.810
Here's another very interesting study that looks at how emotions shape the way

173
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:31.380
that we think about advertisements that we're bombarded with all the time.

174
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.510
So this was a study looking at empathy versus pride in beer ads,
right?

175
00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.190
So we see beer ads all the time.

176
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:41.550
And in what way can emotions of empathy and bright up anything to do with

177
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:46.050
thinking about buying beer?
Right?
So what they did is they had participants,

178
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.010
either American participants coming from more individualistic cultures or

179
00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:53.550
Chinese participants coming from more tradition collectivistic cultures.

180
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.780
And what they did is they expose students to beer ads that either evoked

181
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.200
feelings of pride or evoke feelings of empathy.

182
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.920
So an example here of the pride beer ad is,
um,
you know,

183
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.530
aceing the last exam,
winning the big race,

184
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.100
receiving a deserved recognition and having the Ohio,
you know,

185
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.340
flag beer and celebrating life's accomplishments,
right?

186
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:18.900
So beer really being advertised in this very pride eliciting context.

187
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.250
This is contrasted with the empathy condition where,
you know,

188
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.810
they're trying to sell beer,
but it's in a scene if you know,

189
00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:26.550
you're reminiscing with old friends,

190
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.600
enjoying time together with family and relaxing with best friends.
And again,

191
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:34.920
you see the Ohio flag beer and it's about celebrate braiding relationships that

192
00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:38.940
matter the most.
So again,
pride,

193
00:11:38.941 --> 00:11:41.580
the theme they're trying to evoke in the beer ad is celebrating life's

194
00:11:41.581 --> 00:11:43.620
accomplishments or as an empathy.

195
00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:46.530
It's about celebrating relationships that mattered the most.

196
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.580
And here's their findings that I find really,
really interesting.
Okay.

197
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.190
So just to point out what you have is the individualist culture here on the

198
00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:59.191
right and the collected this culture here on the left and you have here other

199
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:02.260
focused emotion,
empathy and ego focused,
what they call it,

200
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:06.070
ego focused emotion or pride.
And look what you're seeing.

201
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:08.530
This is in some ways really surprising.

202
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:13.090
So what you're seeing is that higher values on the scale and indicated greater

203
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:16.450
liking a of the advertisement and the brand.

204
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:21.250
So what you see is that in collectivistic cultures on the left seemed to

205
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:26.251
actually like the pride focused add more than the empathy focused ad.

206
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.050
And you see an interaction here whereby the individualistic culture by contrast

207
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.850
seems to report more favorable liking attitudes towards the empathy or other

208
00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:40.270
focus beer ad as opposed to the individual store pride ad.

209
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.830
So this is surprising because you might've hypothesize that the Chinese are more

210
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:49.690
collectivistic cultures would report a more favorable attitudes towards the

211
00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:52.960
empathy related add.
One that's more consistent props with you might say,

212
00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:56.590
are there cultural,
culturally embedded emotional values?

213
00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.400
Whereas you would expect the American are more individualistic,
you know,

214
00:13:00.401 --> 00:13:03.460
participants to report more favorable attitudes towards the pride.

215
00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:07.760
Eliciting a ad again consistent with our cultural norms of you know,

216
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.440
favoring high arousal positive states that are individualistic focused.

217
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:15.160
So how do we explain this like complete reversal of the findings,
right?

218
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.470
So the authors argue that it's the presentation of a novel type of thought.

219
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.090
Something that's unexpected,

220
00:13:22.091 --> 00:13:26.020
something that goes outside of your everyday sort of traditional way of thinking

221
00:13:26.021 --> 00:13:30.580
about the world that underlies why ads are particularly appealing.

222
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.680
And I'm curious to think what you,

223
00:13:32.681 --> 00:13:35.350
what you think about when you think about ads that seem appealing.

224
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.470
Is it really the novelty that grabs your attention,

225
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.330
that causes you to like them more,

226
00:13:40.331 --> 00:13:43.930
something different than sort of the everyday kind of emotional experience and

227
00:13:43.931 --> 00:13:47.020
culture you live in?
This suggests that perhaps yes.

228
00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:52.021
That's one really important factor in determining how or why people report

229
00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:54.130
favorable attitudes towards ads.

230
00:13:54.131 --> 00:13:57.460
That it sort of breaks outside of their normal cultural values.

231
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:02.080
So we've talked about emotion and consumption and now I just want to turn to

232
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:04.330
this field of neuroeconomics of emotion.

233
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.720
So neuro economic models of decision making have traditionally emphasized the

234
00:14:10.211 --> 00:14:14.170
assessment of value as a critical factor in driving choice behavior.

235
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:19.650
And so this is a newly emerging field and what it tries to do is link economic

236
00:14:20.981 --> 00:14:23.890
decision making to the brain and how it functions.

237
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.150
And so this emerging field of neuroeconomics has highlighted the overlap between

238
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:32.530
neural systems that mediate choice and other behaviors including emotion.

239
00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.520
So we're going to just get a preview of what this exciting field has to share

240
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:40.630
with us and what potential it has as we move forward in the field of aspect of

241
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:45.050
neuroscience and try to integrate it with how we spend our money and with you

242
00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:49.550
know,
models of economic decision making.
So first,
well,

243
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.780
what is neuro economics in the first place?
So here I have a definition for you.

244
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:58.340
Neuro economics is an interdisciplinary research program with the goal of

245
00:14:58.341 --> 00:15:03.110
building biological models of decision making within economic environments.

246
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.880
So here neuroeconomist asks,
how does the embodied brain enable the minder,

247
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:13.030
perhaps groups of minds to make economic decisions and being highly multiple

248
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.210
multimodal.

249
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:18.260
This field combines techniques from cognitive neuroscience and experimental

250
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:20.510
economics as well as an effect of science.

251
00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:25.190
The course that you're taking now to observe how neural activity depends on the

252
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:30.020
economic environment and also ask questions about how the mind makes economic

253
00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:33.890
decisions.
So how do we link neuro economics to emotion?

254
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:38.030
So I really liked this quote here from the New York Times that said people are

255
00:15:38.031 --> 00:15:42.830
efficient,
rational beings who tires loosely act in their own self interest.

256
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.580
They make financial decisions based on reason,
not emotion,

257
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:51.290
and naturally most save money for that proverbial rainy day.
Right?

258
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.320
Well,
no,
in making financial decisions,

259
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:59.240
people are regularly influenced by gut feelings and emotional intuitions.

260
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.460
They cooperate with total strangers,

261
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.380
gambled away the family paycheck and squander their savings on investments

262
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.690
touted by known liars.

263
00:16:08.691 --> 00:16:12.770
So what's really interesting here is that to explore decisionmaking,

264
00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:16.850
researchers are scanning the brains of people as they engage in a variety of

265
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:19.310
games designed by experimental economists.

266
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.690
And these exercises are really intended to make people anticipate what others

267
00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:28.190
will do or what other people infer from one person's own actions.

268
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.600
And so it's a really exciting idea where you look at the brain as this way to

269
00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:36.890
compare how we evaluate objects,
people,
events and memories,

270
00:16:36.891 --> 00:16:37.940
internal states,

271
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.930
and the perceived needs of others so that we can make choices in our everyday

272
00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:46.100
life.
And so interestingly,
instead of dollars and cents,

273
00:16:46.101 --> 00:16:49.130
we know that the brain relies on the firing rates of a number of

274
00:16:49.131 --> 00:16:53.780
neurotransmitters,
chemicals like dopamine that transmit nerve impulses.

275
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.250
So we think of novelty,
money,
cocaine,
a delicious meal,

276
00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.450
a beautiful face,

277
00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:03.020
all these things that APP activate these dopaminergic circuits that we talked to

278
00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:05.120
our earlier in our lectures on brain and emotion,

279
00:17:05.121 --> 00:17:09.410
that signal values of reward and pleasure,
right to varying degrees.

280
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.430
So what you can look at is just how much people have activation in these really

281
00:17:13.431 --> 00:17:18.080
emotionally salient brain regions and how that helps calibrate peoples,

282
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:23.150
you know,
emotional responses and economic decisions in everyday life.

283
00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.050
So I'll give you an example of one kind of question that's relevant to

284
00:17:27.051 --> 00:17:28.430
neuroeconomics and emotion.

285
00:17:28.431 --> 00:17:32.750
And this is how much people value monetary rewards and how we process them

286
00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:33.530
differently.

287
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:37.340
So this is touching on a topic that we delved into earlier in our lecture and

288
00:17:37.341 --> 00:17:38.360
emotion and the brain.

289
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.680
So here we are distinguished in earlier lectures between the anticipation or

290
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:46.220
wanting of a reward.
And so for the dog it's a bone.

291
00:17:46.221 --> 00:17:49.790
But let's imagine it's a human with you know,
a big stack of money,
um,

292
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.670
from the consumer Tory,
pleasure or liking of a reward.

293
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:58.200
And what we found is when we looked at anticipatory processing in the brain,

294
00:17:58.201 --> 00:18:00.540
and you think of this idea of wanting money,

295
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.010
but this is really governed by a special system called the mesolimbic dopamine

296
00:18:05.011 --> 00:18:09.120
system that includes the prefrontal Cortex,
the nucleus accumbens accumbens,

297
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.370
and the ventral tegmental area.
Right?

298
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:16.260
So this is interesting because it's contrast it with an entirely different set

299
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:19.650
of neural systems that are associated with the consumer,

300
00:18:19.651 --> 00:18:23.700
Tory or liking of money,
right?
So sort of having it in the moment.

301
00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:28.410
So liking again as this conscious awareness of pleasure and hedonic experience.

302
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.670
And what you find here from neuroimaging and neural recording studies is that

303
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.410
the liking of rewards is really governed by two different hedonic hotspots.

304
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.430
So you have on the left,
the nucleus accumbens hotspot,

305
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.880
and on the right,
the ventral pallidum hotspot,
right?

306
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.590
And these hedonic hotspots are crucial for how the brain not only produces

307
00:18:49.591 --> 00:18:54.450
pleasurable feelings in response to food and sex and drugs,
but also for money,

308
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:54.931
right?

309
00:18:54.931 --> 00:18:59.370
So there's researchers who have looked at these two different neural systems and

310
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.940
interestingly when they're looking at the anticipate anticipation and then

311
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.460
conservatory,
you know,
processing of money,

312
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.720
it tells us a lot about just how the brain and just how emotion plays an

313
00:19:09.721 --> 00:19:12.120
important role in that process.

314
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.850
And here I'll just wrap up with some other questions that are commonly asked in

315
00:19:15.851 --> 00:19:17.400
neuro economics and emotion.

316
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.610
And these are really cutting edge questions that we're just now trying to

317
00:19:20.611 --> 00:19:22.020
discover the answers to.

318
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.010
So these include questions such as how do emotions shaped the immediate versus

319
00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:28.380
delayed processing of monetary rewards?

320
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.590
How do emotions shape economic negotiations?

321
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.660
How does the brain process the experience of financial risk taking and what are

322
00:19:36.661 --> 00:19:40.680
the neural systems associated with regret and gambling?

323
00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:41.920
<v 1>Okay,</v>

324
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.900
<v 0>so now we'll turn to our takeaway questions.
So here,
the first question asks,</v>

325
00:19:46.901 --> 00:19:51.340
how does emotion influence our consumption patterns?
Second,

326
00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:56.580
how does emotion influence the way people evaluate consumer ads and what are

327
00:19:56.891 --> 00:20:01.600
potential sources of cultural variation and collectivistic and individualistic

328
00:20:01.601 --> 00:20:03.550
groups?
And finally,

329
00:20:03.551 --> 00:20:07.630
what are the kinds of questions the field of neuroeconomics addresses?

330
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:14.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

331
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:19.100
<v 0>And now we'll turn to our experts in emotion interview as part of the experts in</v>

332
00:20:19.101 --> 00:20:23.690
emotion interview series.
And today in this expert interview,

333
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.510
we'll be speaking with doctor Brian Knutson,

334
00:20:26.511 --> 00:20:30.800
who's an associate professor of psychology at Stanford University and the

335
00:20:30.801 --> 00:20:34.070
director of the symbiotic project on affect of neuroscience.

336
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.670
And he is one of the leading figures in this area.

337
00:20:36.671 --> 00:20:40.760
We'll speak with us about the field of neuro economics and emotion.

338
00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.750
So doctor Knutson,
um,

339
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:47.060
received his bachelor degree in psychology and comparative religion from Trinity

340
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.020
and his phd from Stanford University after which he did postdoctoral research

341
00:20:53.021 --> 00:20:57.370
and affect of neuroscience at the UCF medical school and the National Institute

342
00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:01.540
of Health.
His laboratory uses multiple methods including psychometrics,

343
00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:06.190
psychophysiology brain imaging and pharmacology to investigate neural mechanisms

344
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:08.020
that underlie emotional experience.

345
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.950
And he also explores implications of this work for clinical disorders.

346
00:21:11.951 --> 00:21:15.370
Have an effect and addiction as well as for economic decision making.

347
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.320
Their discovery that neural activity correlates with expected value and can be

348
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:24.430
used to predict choice,
including financial risk taking and product purchases,

349
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.270
has helped seed new and exciting interdisciplinary fields,

350
00:21:28.271 --> 00:21:31.780
including neuro economics,
neuro finance,
and neuromarketing.

351
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:37.240
Doctor Knutson has received young investigator awards from the American

352
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:37.510
Psychiatric Association,

353
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.480
the National Alliance for research on schizophrenia and depression,

354
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.180
and the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research.

355
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:48.570
He's also a fellow of the American Psychological Society and Academy of

356
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.000
Behavioral Medicine Research.

357
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.820
His research is funded by grants from several organizations,

358
00:21:51.821 --> 00:21:55.150
including the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation.

359
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:59.140
He's been invited to speak about his research and psychology,
psychiatry,

360
00:21:59.141 --> 00:22:03.340
neuroscience,
economics,
finance,
and marketing departments around the world.

361
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.690
And his laboratories.

362
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:08.980
Research is regularly featured in top journals and popular media outlets.

363
00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.970
So I now turn to our very special experts and emotion interview with Doctor

364
00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:13.810
Brian Knutson.
