1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.150
Welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.240
So today we're going to talk about the way that emotion shape the way we

3
00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:06.230
actually think.

4
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.950
And here we'll try to answer some of the biggest questions that have plagued,

5
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.020
you know,
scientists,
psychologists,

6
00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:15.980
and even philosophers since the beginning of time where we tried to think about

7
00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:20.570
our emotions truly irrational or can they actually help us think?

8
00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:23.720
And in what ways do they,
so for example,

9
00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:27.770
we'll be answering questions such as can emotion change our thinking?

10
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.120
Can it change the way that we actually remember important life events

11
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.810
and count emotion change how we actually perceive the world,

12
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.010
whether we view it through rosy colored glasses or maybe more for Lauren and

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.340
dysphoric glasses.
In other words,
do we see the world,
you know,

14
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:56.640
more Pollyanna or as some people say more as an er.

15
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.580
So here,

16
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.870
emotion and cognition were once thought to be really completely separate

17
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:08.160
entities and actually perhaps even in conflict with each other.

18
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.840
And indeed emotions were thought to be completely antithetical or the opposite

19
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:14.760
of what was thought to be higher order,

20
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.350
rational thinking and cognitive faculties recently,
however,

21
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.670
a studies and emotion,
I found that this is absolutely not the case.
And in fact,

22
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:28.671
emotion and cognition actually overlap and really fascinating and intricate

23
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:29.670
ways.

24
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.840
So what we're going to study today is a little bit of the ways in which emotion

25
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:38.610
and cognition may mutually shape each other and actually change the way that you

26
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:42.660
think about the world merely by changing your current emotional state.

27
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.760
So this is our first part of a three part series on emotion and cognition.

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.571
So in our,

29
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:52.020
in our introduction today we're going to take a broad view to answer the

30
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:55.860
question of do feelings actually shape the way we think?

31
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.130
And let me walk you through a roadmap of how we're going to do this today.

32
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.910
We'll start by looking at the relationship between emotion and memory,

33
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.330
followed by processing style judgment.

34
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.470
And then we'll conclude with our typical takeaway questions and expert
interview.

35
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.690
So today we'll start with looking at how emotion shapes the way we remember the

36
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:20.400
world around us.
And William James First had the initial,

37
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:24.990
very prescient observation that indeed emotions must somehow influenced the way

38
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:26.730
we remember the world around us.

39
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.150
He said an impression may be so emotionally exciting as to leave a scar upon our

40
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:34.230
cerebral tissues.

41
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.430
So he indeed thought that emotions are so powerful that they'll leave this

42
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:40.680
almost indelible mark upon our brain.

43
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:43.380
And the way we remember the world around us.

44
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.440
Since William James,

45
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.160
there's been questions that have really tried to more specifically look at the

46
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:52.920
way in which emotions shape memories.
In other words,

47
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.820
do they make these mental marks upon us that are permanent and not,

48
00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:59.980
cannot be altered or even maybe mutated time.

49
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.150
So the first question we'll look at today is whether or not emotional memories

50
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:05.980
indeed are indelible.

51
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.640
So the original work here,
um,

52
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:13.210
started in the 70s with this concept of flashbulb memories.

53
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.070
So flashbulb memories are really like what you might think of a flashbulb sort

54
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:20.020
of instant photograph of any event.

55
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:25.021
So this is the phenomena whereby emotional memories are often recalled more

56
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:29.380
vividly after an event and they're extra recall called an almost this kind of

57
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.890
photographic form where you can know where you were,

58
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:37.090
what was going on at the time,
who told you the news at the time,

59
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.160
how others felt.
Um,

60
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.610
you may be how you felt and sort of what happened next.

61
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:47.080
So almost what emotions do is they sort of flash this light over what events are

62
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:50.800
going on in the world around you so that you can store them in your mind almost

63
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:55.090
like a still frame or movie that you can play chronologically over time.

64
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.350
So this is the idea of flashbulb memories that emotions really create this

65
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:01.960
almost permanent indelible mark upon your memory.

66
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

67
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.300
<v 0>One example that's often talked about with flashbulb memories,
um,</v>

68
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:11.470
and that many people in the u s can remember is the terrorist attacks of nine
11.

69
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:15.100
So many people will say they can remember where they were,
what they were doing,

70
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:17.140
what they were thinking when this happened.
Um,

71
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.760
and this notion was also confirmed in the former President Bush has televised

72
00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:24.100
address to Congress in September where he said,

73
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.030
each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it happened.

74
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.650
We remember the moment the news came where we were and what we were doing.

75
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.331
Now,

76
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:38.650
some researchers have actually argued against this idea that flashbulb memories

77
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:42.610
exist.
And if we see here in this study here where they say confidence,

78
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:47.590
not consistency,
characterize this flashbulb memories,
we peek at what they wrote,

79
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:51.400
they would actually suggest that flashbulb memories are not special in their

80
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:53.710
accuracy as previously claimed,

81
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.010
but only in their perceived accuracy.
Right?

82
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.390
So what they did is they really questioned whether or not flashbulb memories

83
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.530
actually exist.

84
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.270
And they did this by comparing memories of one the memory of the nine 11

85
00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:12.160
terrorist attacks with a second memory of just some normal everyday event to see

86
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:16.300
whether or not really emotionally sailing events actually indeed do leave these

87
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:18.550
indelible marks upon our,
on our memory.

88
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.870
And here's what they found.

89
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.810
So they found some differences that you can see at the top left.

90
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.430
So the differences are that people believe that fat flashbulb memories such as

91
00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:34.431
those of nine 11 are more accurately and vividly remembered and the intensity of

92
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:38.640
emotions experienced during these events are related to people's greater

93
00:05:38.641 --> 00:05:40.320
confidence in their accuracy.

94
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.590
So the more that we feel we had an intense emotion experience,

95
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.570
the more confident we feel and see in thinking that these are indeed more vivid

96
00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:51.420
memories on our mind.
However,

97
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.610
there were actually no differences and whether or not nine 11 was more likely to

98
00:05:56.611 --> 00:05:58.820
be remembered some everyday event.
Right.

99
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.080
And in fact what might be the case is that the memory for these kinds of

100
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:08.081
emotionally salient traumatic life events actually seems to decline at a similar

101
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:13.361
rate over time for other more every day neutral or non emotional information.

102
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.490
So some may argue that flashbulb memories such as those like nine 11 are only

103
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:22.610
enduring because they'd be become reinforced by the media.

104
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.300
We've seen multiple repetitions of them time and time again online in the news,

105
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:30.410
speaking to people in conversations.

106
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.970
But the actual memory itself of when that happened in our own personal lives is

107
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:37.880
no more memorable than any other everyday event.

108
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.600
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.810
<v 0>So interestingly here,
um,</v>

110
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.840
this is another idea that's looking at a distortion and memory for emotions.

111
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.200
And here what they found is [inaudible] question of is there a memory for

112
00:06:51.481 --> 00:06:53.190
emotions themselves?
Right?

113
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.940
So do we have an enhanced memory for emotional events?

114
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.360
So the method that they did in this study is that they had students write their

115
00:07:00.361 --> 00:07:04.140
anxiety level before midterm and then they recalled their anxiety level

116
00:07:04.141 --> 00:07:08.550
approximately one week later before or after learning our grade.

117
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.090
And the results suggest that compared to students who hadn't yet learned their

118
00:07:12.091 --> 00:07:12.750
grade,

119
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.950
those who did learn that they did well or learn that they did well on the test

120
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.440
underestimated their pretest anxiety.

121
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.090
Whereas students who did poorly overestimated their pretests anxiety.

122
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.150
So this merely suggest when we think about emotions and memory,

123
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.680
that information learned after the fact actually distorts your memory for the

124
00:07:31.681 --> 00:07:33.870
original emotions themselves.

125
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.030
So when we come to this first question,
our emotional memories,
indelible,

126
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.470
not necessarily,

127
00:07:40.471 --> 00:07:44.610
perhaps emotions don't really sort of seal memory in some special way.

128
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.320
But what about the second question here of do emotion states actually improve

129
00:07:49.321 --> 00:07:52.380
memory at all?
So let's look at the second question.

130
00:07:52.381 --> 00:07:54.570
So even if emotion memories aren't indelible,

131
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.830
do they play some role in helping to facilitate or influence our memories?

132
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:00.990
<v 1>Okay,</v>

133
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.190
<v 0>so this is work by Gordon Bauer.
So Gordon power,</v>

134
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.760
like a really push this idea forward of emotion congruent and hear what he did

135
00:08:08.761 --> 00:08:13.290
is he argued that emotions are part of these associative networks in our mind

136
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.240
and that each emotion has what he called inner connected images,
concepts,

137
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.280
labels and interpretations.

138
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.460
And what happens is that when you experience an emotion,

139
00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:27.360
so thinking of it as a node in the middle of a network,

140
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.060
that these associations get activated almost like if you think of an octopus and

141
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:35.340
the center of the octopus and it spreads out with eight branching legs.

142
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.290
When that emotion gets activated,

143
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.430
you see these associations that sort of merge or sort of spire out,

144
00:08:41.431 --> 00:08:45.180
they get activated.
So for an example,
when you're in a happy mood,

145
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:50.160
you're better able to remember associated happy memories or happy related

146
00:08:50.161 --> 00:08:54.370
information.
And here's some evidence for emotion concurrence.

147
00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.350
So he found that people are able to better remember information if they learn it

148
00:09:00.351 --> 00:09:03.230
and recall it in the same congruent emotional state.

149
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.050
So if you learn something while you're in a fearful state,

150
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:10.220
you're better able to recall that information later on if you're also in an

151
00:09:10.221 --> 00:09:13.580
anxious or fearful state than if you're in a happy state leader on,

152
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.620
<v 1>okay.</v>

153
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.280
<v 0>And here's some evidence that he found.
So if you look at this graph carefully,</v>

154
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:22.180
what you find is he looked at people who are induced into either a happy mood in

155
00:09:22.181 --> 00:09:24.010
yellow or a sad mood in blue.

156
00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:29.080
And what he did is he asked people to recall a number of either pleasant or

157
00:09:29.081 --> 00:09:31.000
unpleasant related memories,

158
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.180
but they had before the age of 15 that you can see here on the bottom.

159
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.300
And what you're seeing in this graph is that in the happy mood.

160
00:09:37.301 --> 00:09:38.980
So if we follow the line in yellow,

161
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:44.230
what we see is that people in a happy mood recall significantly more pleasant

162
00:09:44.231 --> 00:09:47.260
memories before they were 15.
By contrast,

163
00:09:47.261 --> 00:09:51.850
people in a sad mood recall slightly more unpleasant memories than pleasant

164
00:09:51.851 --> 00:09:52.271
memories.

165
00:09:52.271 --> 00:09:56.740
So it suggests that our mood states give us some special access to information

166
00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.440
that is consistent with whatever state we're in.
If we're happy,

167
00:09:59.441 --> 00:10:02.380
we can recall more positive information.
If we're sad,

168
00:10:02.381 --> 00:10:04.270
we can recall more negative information.

169
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:06.180
<v 1>Okay.</v>

170
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.650
<v 0>So he further pushed this idea of emotion concurrence in another study.</v>

171
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:12.420
So the method in this study,

172
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.860
he had subjects read a story about two guys who were playing tennis.
Um,

173
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.030
and here's how it went.
So Andre was playing tennis and he was happy.

174
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.190
All is going well for him,
whereas Jack is sad,
nothing's going well for him.

175
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:30.630
So then they were asked to recall the story and ask them the participants,

176
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.060
who do you think is the central character?

177
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:37.410
So the results suggested that happy readers remembered more statements about

178
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.580
Andre the happy character and actually thought the story was about him,

179
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.480
whereas sad readers remember more statements about the sad character.

180
00:10:45.481 --> 00:10:47.670
Jack and thought the story was about him.

181
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.600
<v 1>Hm.</v>

182
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.100
<v 0>So there's some important caveats to keep in mind with emotion concurrence.
Um,</v>

183
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:55.661
here,
I mean,

184
00:10:55.661 --> 00:11:00.070
this was really Gordon Bauer and the fields first serious attempt to try to

185
00:11:00.071 --> 00:11:04.450
integrate emotion in models of learning and memory.
So as a first attempt,

186
00:11:04.451 --> 00:11:07.090
there's always caveats,
right?
So first,
you know,

187
00:11:07.091 --> 00:11:10.900
we see emotion congruency and the graph we saw with the yellow and blue lines,

188
00:11:10.901 --> 00:11:14.350
that seems to be stronger for positive than negative emotional information.

189
00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.540
And sometimes mood incongruent information can be better recalled.
So,
well,

190
00:11:19.541 --> 00:11:20.500
it's an interesting theory.

191
00:11:20.501 --> 00:11:24.010
There's still some caveats that needs to be worked out as future research moves

192
00:11:24.011 --> 00:11:24.844
forward.

193
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.193
<v 1>Okay.</v>

194
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.480
<v 0>So our emotion memories indelible,
not necessarily,</v>

195
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.970
but do emotions enhance memory at all?
Well,
I would say why,
yes,

196
00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:40.200
it seems that they do,
but there's still some interesting caveats as to the role,

197
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.530
um,
where we understand precisely how they do it.

198
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.590
So we've talked a little bit about emotion and memory.

199
00:11:46.591 --> 00:11:50.220
And what I want to do now is move into this concept of processing style.

200
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.770
And here we're looking to look at the ways in which different kinds of mood

201
00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:54.490
states,

202
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.930
positive or negative shaped the way that we process information just in the

203
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:02.770
world around us.
So now we're going to turn to processing style.

204
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.620
So here I want to show you a table and what I want to walk through or some core

205
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:13.000
differences between the ways positive emotions and negative emotions shaped the

206
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:14.740
way that we process information.

207
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
So first what we see here is that positive emotions really facilitate the use of

208
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:25.060
what are called heuristics or mental shortcuts and they actually cause us to

209
00:12:25.061 --> 00:12:28.990
engage in more stereotype related thinking.
So in other words,

210
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:33.700
positive emotions really kind of move us through these kind of information

211
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:37.750
related processes by just taking more quick mental shortcuts.

212
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.770
Whereas negative emotions seem to almost slow us down in some ways and

213
00:12:41.771 --> 00:12:44.980
facilitate more careful,
more analytical,

214
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.530
more detail oriented types of thinking.

215
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.640
As a result,
you can see positive emotions.

216
00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:55.180
What they do is they really seem to promote this kind of broader kind of

217
00:12:55.181 --> 00:13:00.130
creative thinking.
You're sort of focus less on the details of a particular,

218
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.150
uh,
situation that you're in and you're really kind of expanding and broadening,

219
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:08.770
broadening your cognitive repertoire,
right?
Whereas again,
negative emotions,

220
00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:12.760
it's more analytical thought and promotes really more kind of detail oriented

221
00:13:12.761 --> 00:13:13.960
concrete thinking.

222
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:18.100
So they each are seeming to serve really different types of cognitive functions.

223
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.720
Um,
not surprisingly positive emotions or thought to facilitate what's called a

224
00:13:22.721 --> 00:13:27.490
global focus.
They kind of keep us focused on,
you can think of it as the forest,

225
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.260
whereas negative emotions are really about honing in and focusing on the trees.

226
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.170
Um,
not surprising that there's been some empirical work,
um,

227
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.360
by Barb Fredrickson and colleagues that,
you know,

228
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:43.870
positive emotions really do seem to support this broader focus of attention.

229
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.130
Whereas by contrast,

230
00:13:45.131 --> 00:13:48.850
negative emotions are promoting narrowed attention and focus really on the

231
00:13:48.851 --> 00:13:50.140
situational details.

232
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.410
So the way I like to think about it as I think of negative emotions is almost

233
00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:54.940
putting on these blinders and getting new,

234
00:13:54.941 --> 00:13:58.540
really zeroed in on a very concrete task right in front of you.

235
00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.360
So imagine if there was a bear in front of yours,
snake.

236
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.750
You don't want to be sort of paying attention to the landscape as a whole and

237
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.340
engaging in creative thinking.

238
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.990
You want to focus in narrowly on how you're going to either fight or flee that

239
00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:13.840
given dangerous Q be at a snake bear,
et cetera.

240
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.710
Whereas positive emotions really signaled to us that we're in a place of safety.

241
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:21.280
So we can kind of take a step back.
We can broaden our attentional scope,

242
00:14:21.281 --> 00:14:25.420
we can gauge and creative thinking and we don't necessarily need to take the

243
00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:28.630
kind of,
you know,
careful analytical steps that are involved in,

244
00:14:28.631 --> 00:14:31.810
we're in a more negative emotional situation or environment.

245
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.290
So these are different types of processing styles that are associated with

246
00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:37.660
positive and negative emotions.
Um,

247
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.120
the one caveat you can see here on the bottom corner is that says quote,

248
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:46.210
you know,
asterisk except anger.
So anger is then this really interesting,

249
00:14:46.211 --> 00:14:48.550
mysterious emotion because on the one hand,

250
00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:51.890
we all think of it as being negatively balanced.
But on the other hand would,

251
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:55.340
it actually does is it shares a lot of the same processing style features of

252
00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:59.090
positive emotions.
So it's a really exciting mystery in the field,
um,

253
00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:01.680
that we'll definitely talk about later in the course.
Um,

254
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.730
but when we think about sort of what kind of state do you want to be in,

255
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.340
if you're really trying to think carefully and get things right,

256
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.350
there's a lot of controversy on this,
right?

257
00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:12.950
So on the one hand you can imagine people who are engaged in sort of artistic

258
00:15:12.951 --> 00:15:14.750
endeavors,
writers,
musicians,

259
00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:18.260
poets saying that positive emotions are really what you need to sort of get

260
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:20.720
ahead in your creative cognitive endeavors.

261
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.590
Whereas others might say with negative emotions that you really want to be in

262
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:25.730
maybe a bad mood.

263
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:30.110
So this is an article it as be sad and succeed people in a bad mood have better

264
00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:33.410
judgment and pay more attention to details.
Um,

265
00:15:33.411 --> 00:15:35.870
so I think for yourself for a moment,
you know,

266
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.840
what kind of mood states have you been in when you've been able to think the

267
00:15:38.841 --> 00:15:42.560
most clearly and achieve the goals that you are most interested in working on.

268
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.880
Um,
so I recommend you looking at some of the work here,
Joe,
for guests.

269
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:48.650
He's at the University of New South Wales.

270
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.440
If you're interested in further exploring this topic.

271
00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:52.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

272
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.310
<v 0>Um,
and here as you can say,
ah,
it says grumpy,</v>

273
00:15:55.311 --> 00:15:58.790
people pay closer attention to details,
showed less scalability.

274
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.990
We're less prone to errors of judgment and formed higher quality persuasive

275
00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:04.880
arguments,
then they're happy counterparts.

276
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.990
One study even supports the notion that those who showed either signs of fear,

277
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:14.060
anger,
or sadness,
um,
also seem to do better.
And I witnessed recall studies.

278
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.510
So again,
take a look if you're interested in learning more about this,

279
00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:21.380
of the way in which being sad may actually help you think more carefully and

280
00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:22.214
more closely.

281
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:23.050
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

282
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.920
<v 0>So another way in which we look at how,
um,
you know,</v>

283
00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:29.570
emotions shape our processing style.

284
00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:33.730
The world is by looking at patterns of attentional bias or the ways in which we

285
00:16:33.731 --> 00:16:38.731
literally view the world and what ways emotions may actually shaped the lenses

286
00:16:39.071 --> 00:16:40.180
through which we see the world.

287
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.620
So here researchers looking at attention related by a CS will ask questions.

288
00:16:44.621 --> 00:16:47.140
I'm like,
if people are in a positive mood,

289
00:16:47.141 --> 00:16:49.210
do they have what's called a positive attentional bias?

290
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:53.740
Are they more prone to visually orient and pay attention to cues in the

291
00:16:53.741 --> 00:16:57.310
environment that are positive or rewarding?
Likewise,
there's been work,

292
00:16:57.311 --> 00:17:00.460
especially in anxiety and depression showing that people in these negative mood

293
00:17:00.461 --> 00:17:03.310
states show and enhance negative attentional bias.

294
00:17:03.311 --> 00:17:07.450
They actually spend more time looking at negative emotional information if you

295
00:17:07.451 --> 00:17:10.600
present them with different types of images,
of emotional faces,

296
00:17:10.601 --> 00:17:14.020
some of the I ops photos we talked about earlier in course,
et cetera.

297
00:17:14.021 --> 00:17:17.560
So emotions also seem to shape the lens through which we view the world.

298
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.560
And there's a couple of different paradigms that people use to test this all

299
00:17:20.561 --> 00:17:25.100
briefly walk you through.
Now.
Um,
one of them is called,
uh,

300
00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.860
at edit.
Then one of them is called an eye tracking tasks.

301
00:17:32.861 --> 00:17:37.090
So I tracking tasks are really interesting in is what they enable you to do is

302
00:17:37.091 --> 00:17:41.050
look at attention related biases.
So using eye tracking technology,

303
00:17:41.051 --> 00:17:46.000
you can actually unobtrusively and continuously monitor an individual's point of

304
00:17:46.001 --> 00:17:50.910
gaze using an infrared light beam by looking at their eyes are orienting on a

305
00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:54.360
computer screen while they're viewing standardized positive,
negative,

306
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:59.160
or even neutral,
um,
picture stimuli,
word stimulate,
et cetera.

307
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.540
And another type of very popular paradigm here is what's called dot probe tasks.

308
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:04.321
So dot.

309
00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:08.070
Protests are also very helpful and that they enable you to more directly assess

310
00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.670
potential biases in patterns of attentional distribution,

311
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:16.500
often showing simultaneous images on a screen such as a sad and happy face,

312
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.710
and looking at where people attend to and respond to first.

313
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.920
So importantly,
when we think about a positive emotion and cognition,

314
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:30.060
it's vitally important to know Barbara Fredrickson's broaden and build theory of

315
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:31.110
positive emotions.

316
00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:35.430
So her theory suggests that positive emotions exist to build an individual's

317
00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:37.620
resources necessary for survival,

318
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.670
and she would say they do so by broadening one's thought processes and creating

319
00:18:41.671 --> 00:18:45.420
a wider than normal array of thoughts,
behaviors,
and perceptions.

320
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.020
And this cognitive broadening actually results in more creative,

321
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.560
integrative and future oriented and efficient thinking.

322
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.370
And she would say this facilitates the discovery of new knowledges and builds

323
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.790
vital social and cognitive resources.

324
00:18:59.791 --> 00:19:02.610
So the broaden and build theory has been monumental.

325
00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:07.611
And really explaining links between the ways that positive emotion can influence

326
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.070
directly creative thinking and efficient thinking.

327
00:19:11.071 --> 00:19:14.910
So this is something that's in your readings and I suggest reading further as we

328
00:19:14.911 --> 00:19:18.870
think about the ways in which positive emotions specifically can affect our

329
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:20.520
cognitive processes.

330
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:25.050
So what I want to conclude now with is the ways in which emotions influence

331
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:29.040
judgements or everyday types of decisions.
Here.

332
00:19:29.041 --> 00:19:32.700
One of the most influential theories is by doctor Gerald core at the University

333
00:19:32.701 --> 00:19:37.110
of Virginia who really put forward his theory that's been absolutely pioneering

334
00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:39.360
in this domain called aspect of information.

335
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.930
And really what it stipulates is that emotions are informative.

336
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:46.560
They give us information when we're making important judgments.
Um,

337
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.610
so we need to pay attention to them as cues of information in order to make

338
00:19:50.611 --> 00:19:55.050
everyday choices and decisions.
Why might emotions be so important in this way?

339
00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:55.831
Well first,

340
00:19:55.831 --> 00:19:59.130
he would argue that they provide us with a quick rapid signal about our

341
00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:00.810
environment.
And second,

342
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:06.000
many judgments in everyday life are often too complex to take in all
information.

343
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.020
So we often have to be quicker and rely on a more simple assessment of our

344
00:20:10.021 --> 00:20:13.800
current feelings in order to make quick judgments in the moment.

345
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:18.360
So in other words,
emotions can sort of serve as heuristics for us.

346
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:24.560
And he did a really landmark study here when he was really piloting,
uh,

347
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.050
or pioneering.
His affect is as information theory is follows.

348
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.300
So he had a study that went as follows.

349
00:20:30.301 --> 00:20:33.630
So in the first condition that you see on the left,
he asks people,

350
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.320
I'm calling them on a day that was either cloudy or sunny,

351
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.020
and asking them all things considered,

352
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.110
how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days?

353
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:47.620
And in the second condition,
he first asked them,
well,
how's the weather today?

354
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:52.030
Is it sunny?
Is it cloudy and rainy?
And then he asks them the same question,

355
00:20:52.031 --> 00:20:55.390
how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days?

356
00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.460
What he found is that,
um,
people,
um,
and this is what he predicted.

357
00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:03.760
It's really interesting that those who had not been asked about the weather and

358
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:08.530
condition one would use their current feelings as information to make complex

359
00:21:08.531 --> 00:21:12.100
judgments such as how satisfied they are with their life as a whole.

360
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.490
Whereas those in condition two who were first asked about the weather,

361
00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:19.870
he reasoned would no longer use their feelings and making these complex

362
00:21:19.871 --> 00:21:21.610
judgments.
So in sum,

363
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.260
what he found is that people use emotions as these heuristics or shortcuts and

364
00:21:26.261 --> 00:21:30.400
making judgments except when they attribute their feelings to a certain source

365
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:33.280
such as the weather.
So not surprisingly,

366
00:21:33.281 --> 00:21:37.000
you find that people in this condition or reporting feeling more satisfied with

367
00:21:37.001 --> 00:21:39.850
their life as a whole and the weather is sunny as opposed to cloudy,

368
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.510
but you see this effect sort of mitigate once they can attribute it to the

369
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:45.970
weather and you'd no longer see as pronounced,

370
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:50.260
have an effect on ratings of life satisfaction.
Um,

371
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.950
and here you can see this as some of the data that came from it that we just

372
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:55.600
talked about where again,

373
00:21:55.601 --> 00:21:59.320
what we're seeing in condition one that people are rating higher life

374
00:21:59.321 --> 00:22:03.250
satisfaction when the weather's sunny in white as compared to when it's overcast

375
00:22:03.251 --> 00:22:04.084
and gray.

376
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.350
But that once you sort of cue them in to attributing their emotions to the

377
00:22:08.351 --> 00:22:12.040
weather,
you no longer see differences in life satisfaction,
um,

378
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.140
as a result of the weather.
So again,

379
00:22:14.141 --> 00:22:19.141
people are using emotions as heuristics or shortcuts and making judgments except

380
00:22:19.301 --> 00:22:23.410
when they can attribute their feelings to a specific source.
So again,

381
00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:26.860
this is a really remarkable finding and let me just emphasize why.

382
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.270
So this perspective,

383
00:22:28.271 --> 00:22:32.620
so he says that what we are doing is using what we're feeling in the moment and

384
00:22:32.621 --> 00:22:35.560
attributing our feelings to some other source,
right?

385
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.890
And if our attention is drawn to something else that may be influencing our

386
00:22:38.891 --> 00:22:40.030
feelings,
like the weather,

387
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:44.860
we no longer use our feelings as information to help make judgments and really

388
00:22:44.861 --> 00:22:48.400
big judgments such as how satisfied are we with our life as a whole.

389
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:53.230
So it's a powerful effect.
It's been replicated in many labs and in fact,

390
00:22:53.231 --> 00:22:57.310
feelings do seem to influence our judgments until we attach those feelings to

391
00:22:57.311 --> 00:22:58.144
other things.

392
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.250
So what I want to do now is conclude with our takeaway questions and our expert

393
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:06.490
interview.
So for our takeaway questions today,

394
00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.790
this was our first introduction into the realm of emotion and cognition.

395
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:14.470
The first question really starts at the beginning of our lecture asking what are

396
00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:19.471
flashbulb memories and is there supportive empirical evidence to what is the

397
00:23:19.841 --> 00:23:23.950
broaden and build theory of positive emotion positive by Barbara Fredrickson?

398
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.030
And how does it explain the effect of positive emotion on cognition?

399
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:28.991
And importantly,

400
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:32.170
I want you to also think about the different processing styles we spoke about

401
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:36.040
that compare the way positive emotion affects cognition as compared to negative

402
00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:38.440
emotion.
Finally,

403
00:23:38.441 --> 00:23:42.220
what is the aspect is information theory that we just spoke about,
um,

404
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.770
put forth by Gerald core.
And how does it,

405
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:50.030
the ways in which emotion might influence every day judgments such as how

406
00:23:50.031 --> 00:23:52.910
satisfied are you feeling with your life as a whole today?

407
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:59.780
Now we'll turn to our expert interview and this is part of the experts in

408
00:23:59.781 --> 00:24:01.160
emotion interview series.

409
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:07.100
Today we'll be speaking with doctor Gerald core on emotion and cognition.

410
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.690
Dr Core is a Commonwealth professor of psychology at the University of Virginia

411
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.590
and formerly an alumni distinguished professor at the University of Illinois.

412
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:19.730
His research focuses on emotion and it's cognitive consequences.

413
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.640
He's coauthored the cognitive structure of emotions,

414
00:24:22.641 --> 00:24:27.290
a general theory of how psychological situations elicit emotions and make them

415
00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:31.820
intense.
It's chief application is in computer science as the emotion engine of

416
00:24:31.821 --> 00:24:35.840
intelligent agents and robots,
computer games and interactive training modules.

417
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:39.680
His research has been funded by both the NIH and NSF and concerns.

418
00:24:39.681 --> 00:24:41.840
The effect is information hypothesis,

419
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:47.140
which clarifies how emotional information about value and urgency help to shape

420
00:24:47.181 --> 00:24:50.450
or regulate cognition,
motivation,
and even memory.

421
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:55.250
Dr Clore has served as an associate editor of cognition and emotion as faculty

422
00:24:55.251 --> 00:24:59.690
in the Nih consortium on emotion and as a visiting professor at Harvard

423
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.450
University.
He's also been a visiting scholar at Harvard,

424
00:25:02.451 --> 00:25:06.170
Oxford and New York University and a fellow of the Centers for advanced study,

425
00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:09.410
Illinois,
Stanford,
and the Rockefeller Center in Italy.

426
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:13.490
In 2010 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

427
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.960
And in 2013 he received the William James Award for scientific achievement from

428
00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:20.090
the association for Psychological Science.

429
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.800
So I now turn to a very special experts in emotion interview with doctor Gerald

430
00:25:24.801 --> 00:25:25.220
core.
