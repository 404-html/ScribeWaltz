1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.980
Welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.730
So we've talked a lot about emotions and infancy and adolescence,

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.700
but what about the other part of the continuum in our lifespan?

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.810
What happens to emotions as we age and girls are like this man here in the

5
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:15.720
picture or this group of friends.

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.180
Do we grow into happier,

7
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:22.860
older people or more miserably for Lauren and depressed people as we reach the

8
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:24.210
very end of our life?

9
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.370
So here's a quote that I really liked when we think about aging and think about

10
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:34.230
the way that we respond to it emotionally.
So rabbi Joshua Liebman said,

11
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.950
I often feel that death is not the enemy of life,
but it's friend.

12
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.960
For it is the knowledge that our years are limited,
which makes them so precious.

13
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.160
So today we're going to conclude with our third series on emotion development by

14
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:50.880
looking at aging and now seeing ourselves is older,

15
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.360
really happier,
or can you be older and happier?

16
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.180
And we'll do this going through the following road map.

17
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.270
We'll start with one of the most pivotal theories in this area referred to as

18
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:02.580
the socioemotional selectivity theory.

19
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.600
Then we'll follow with some empirical evidence on emotion related changes in

20
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:10.590
aging.
And then we'll conclude with our takeaway questions and expert interview.

21
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.490
So let's start first with one of the most groundbreaking theories that's

22
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:18.270
informed how we think about the development of our emotional self and identity

23
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:19.104
as we age,

24
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.310
the socioemotional selectivity theory or s s t theory.

25
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.850
So this is a theory that was put forth,
um,

26
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.930
predominantly by doctor Laura Carstensen from Stanford University along with

27
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:33.210
colleagues,
Derek,
exactly what's,
and Susan Charles.

28
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.960
So nothing is more familiar and scary than human aging.

29
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:41.961
They would argue yet exactly how does the perception of time passing as humans

30
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.260
and the relationship to our really time limited existence on this planet

31
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.970
influence our emotions.

32
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.390
So Carson's and and colleagues argue that the approach of endings,

33
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.650
including our life is associated with the heightened emphasis on feelings and

34
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:59.700
emotion states.
So they would argue that we really ought to take time seriously.

35
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.750
And in particular in her theory,
the SST theory,

36
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:06.810
she said that humans are uniquely able to monitor time,

37
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.560
both consciously and subconsciously.
She says that we set,

38
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:13.680
these are emotional goals within these temporal context.

39
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:17.520
We're always thinking about how we want to feel and how we should feel with an

40
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:19.350
idea of what timeframe we're in.

41
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.530
So when we think of aging and older adults,

42
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.460
she's found that older adults actually become more selective about social

43
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:30.960
networks.
So they spend more time with individuals with whom they have rewarding

44
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:31.920
relationships.

45
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.000
They also spend more time pursuing emotional satisfaction.

46
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.890
So as we near the end of our lives,

47
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:41.400
our emotional gauche goals shift to become more selective socially.

48
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.490
And we try to spend our time more preferentially on things that are going to

49
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:46.500
bring meaning and satisfaction.

50
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.720
And so you can think of emotional goals along two different kinds of categories.

51
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.230
One is perhaps focusing on the presence.
So living in the moment,

52
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:58.140
knowing what's important,
investing in sure things,

53
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.120
deepening your relationships and really trying to save her life.

54
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.060
This is contrast it with a different kind of tomorrow focus,

55
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:07.600
which is more about preparing for the future,
expanding your horizons,

56
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:11.560
Acquiring College,
meeting New People,
and taking challenges.

57
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.480
So do we focus more on the present as we age or do we focus more on preparing

58
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:17.830
for the future?
Well,

59
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.530
Carson's and in colleagues would actually argue that as we age,

60
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.590
it's indeed associated with more of a focus on the present right.

61
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.510
And activities that are unpleasant or often not compelling to spend your time
on,

62
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.513
um,
when,

63
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.580
when you're nearing the end of your lifespan and interest in novel information

64
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:37.300
because it's so closely intertwined with future needs becomes reduced.

65
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.670
And instead when endings are primed,

66
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.670
people focus on the present over the future.

67
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.280
This leads indeed Ben to different values,

68
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:48.700
people place on emotion as well as life more generally.

69
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:52.510
So how would this change the kinds of emotions that were going to experience as

70
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:56.410
we age?
And we can be become more focused on the present more than ever before.

71
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.900
So here's some of the core,
uh,
postulates of the SST theory.

72
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.741
First,

73
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:06.490
the perception of time is going to influence our social and emotional goals.

74
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.510
Second,
our goals are going to influence then how we process information.

75
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.673
And third,

76
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.600
then pursuing emotional goals is going to be good for our emotion regulation.

77
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.910
So then how do emotions exactly change as we grow older?

78
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.140
So here we're going to turn to the empirical evidence on emotion and aging to

79
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:30.910
really answer this question of how and when do our emotions change as we grow

80
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.940
older.
So let's turn to emotion and aging.
Um,

81
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.800
this has been a really interesting topic and gain a lot of widespread media

82
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:43.150
attention.
So we see articles like this in time saying with age comes happiness,

83
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.200
right?
Um,
so they say wisdom may come with age,
but does happiness follow suit?

84
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.070
Some studies show that the elderly may be prone to depression and loneliness,

85
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:55.870
which can lead to higher rates of unhappiness,
not a surprise,
but dot,
dot,
dot.

86
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.501
Increasing.

87
00:04:56.501 --> 00:05:00.580
More and more studies suggest that happiness may actually rise after middle age.

88
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.000
So where is the data for this?
Um,
well,

89
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:08.200
you can see additional outlets like the New York tends also talking about this

90
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.190
really exciting empirical evidence that Happiness Matt actually come with age.

91
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.640
And finally,
uh,

92
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.310
in the BBC there's headlines such as people get happier as they age.

93
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.020
Most people get happier as they grow.

94
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:23.710
Older studies on people aged up to their mid ninety's suggests.

95
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.740
So what is going on here?

96
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.450
In what ways and why can becoming older actually make us happier?

97
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.190
So broken this up into three categories that can help answer this question of

98
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:39.520
how becoming older may actually lead to increase happiness.

99
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.820
And the three domains here are as follows,
we'll go through them each.

100
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.820
So we see an increased experience of positive emotion,

101
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.050
increased attention to positive stimuli and increase the ability to actually

102
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:52.240
regulate our emotions.
Right?

103
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.420
So this is work that's been largely carried out by a doctor Laura Carstensen,
um,

104
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.190
where she's looked at volunteers ranging in age from 18 all the way into the mid

105
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.190
nineties to come and take part in various experiments as well as keep diaries of

106
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:08.060
their emotional states.

107
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.810
So let's go through first starting with this empirical evidence that actually

108
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:16.730
suggest that as we get older we experience more positive emotions rather than

109
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:20.420
less.
And here's one of the landmark studies that was done by car since an in

110
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:24.860
colleagues titled Emotional Experience Improves With Age evidence based on over

111
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:26.960
10 years of experience sampling.

112
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.020
So here they use an experienced sampling procedure,

113
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.760
measuring emotions five times a day for approximately one week and they repeated

114
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:38.780
it again five years and 10 years later.
So let me show you what this looked like.

115
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:40.310
So participants came into the lab,

116
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.940
they complete an experience sampling protocol where they measured emotion in

117
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:45.860
their daily lives five times a day.

118
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.150
They reported both positive and negative emotion for over the course of a week.

119
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.490
Then they were brought back five years later and again,
10 years later and hear.

120
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:58.850
What they did is they conducted really sophisticated statistical analyses,

121
00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:01.340
both cross sectional as well as growth curve modeling,

122
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.380
which indicated that aging was associated with increased positive emotion

123
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:10.370
overall as well as that they found additionally greater emotional wellbeing.

124
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.380
So when people's everyday life emotion experience actually does seem to increase

125
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:15.950
with age,

126
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.610
both cross-sectionally comparing adults of different ages as well as following

127
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:23.480
individuals across their own lifespan five and 10 years later.

128
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.670
And here you can see a graph from her paper where she maps positive emotional

129
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:32.420
experience with increased numbers here reflect in greater positive emotional

130
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:35.600
experience.
And here's looking at age 20 all the way over,

131
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:37.280
down to 90 and as you can see here,

132
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.240
we see this increase rise and positive emotional experience across the lifespan.

133
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.170
Okay,
so we see increased experience of positive emotion.

134
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.200
What about the way people visually process are taken?

135
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:50.390
Emotional information from the world around them?

136
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.840
Do individuals who are older actually see the world through rosy colored

137
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:59.960
glasses?
Do they become another words older and Rosier?

138
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.830
So this is really interesting work that's looked at attentional biases.

139
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.060
And here if you see this graph here,
what you find is that when researchers,

140
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.520
researchers have compared younger to older adults,

141
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.800
they find an increased attentional bias.

142
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.920
So people's sort of visual attention is more drawn towards,

143
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:19.930
are captured by positive faces compared to negative faces.

144
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.540
So you see this effect pronounced an older adults and younger adults with the

145
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:27.710
positive face bias score significantly greater than the positive bias score and

146
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:29.210
yellow compared to younger adults.

147
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.770
So we also see that older adults actually attend to away from native faces as

148
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:35.150
well compared to younger adults.

149
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.290
So their attention is drawn towards positive stimuli and drawn away from

150
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:42.860
negative stimuli in older adults compared to younger adults.

151
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.610
We also see additional work by Derek,

152
00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:50.390
exactly within colleagues where they've recently compared two main methods of

153
00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:54.830
assessing how much people visually attend to and take in the world around them.

154
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.130
To answer the question is,

155
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.390
is there an age related positivity effect in visual attention?
So,

156
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:04.620
so including comparing what we refer to as eye tracking methodologies.

157
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.730
So these are technologies used to continuously monitor the point of gaze in

158
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:10.440
response to standard positive,

159
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.170
negative and neutral images as well as you can see here.

160
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:17.400
Dot Pro paradigms that allow enable researchers even more directly assess

161
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.390
potential biases and patterns of attentional distribution when they're
presented,

162
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:21.811
for example,

163
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:25.500
on a computer screen with competing emotional faces that maybe either positive

164
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.700
or negative.

165
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.750
And here indeed they find that there is suggestive results for what they've

166
00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:35.160
called this positivity effect in older adults that is older adults actually

167
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:36.810
preferentially attend.

168
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.430
That is their eyes sort of orient towards positive visual information in the

169
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:42.300
world around them.

170
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.290
So in some ways it seems that adults who are older not only experience more

171
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:47.220
positive emotion,

172
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.690
but they actually do sort of see the world through more positive rosy colored

173
00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:52.524
glasses.

174
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.970
So now we're going to look at the idea of emotion regulation.

175
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.760
Not only do older adults feel more positive,

176
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.680
they see the world in a more positive light,

177
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.070
but they actually have an increased ability to harness or regulate their

178
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:08.250
emotions.
So when we talked about adolescents having no breaks,

179
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.580
it seems as if older adults have supremely refined emotional breaks and having

180
00:10:12.581 --> 00:10:15.810
an increased ability to actually harness and regulate their emotions.

181
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:20.190
So this is work done by James Gross,
Laura Carstensen,

182
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:24.030
Jeannie sign and other colleagues looking at emotion and aging.
And here,

183
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:27.870
despite popular stereotypes that older people become less emotional.

184
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.080
First there's little evidence of that.
And second,

185
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.950
gross and colleagues decided to systematically examine across several samples

186
00:10:34.951 --> 00:10:39.030
from geographically and ethnically distinct backgrounds showing that compared to

187
00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:40.290
the younger participants,

188
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.210
older participants report fewer negative emotional experiences and greater

189
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:49.800
emotional control.
So indeed we see that as adults age,

190
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.200
they exhibit greater emotional control.
And this has led,
um,

191
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.800
early and gross to develop a model what they,

192
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.760
that they've called the soccer model.
So it's the selected selection,

193
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.480
optimization and compensation with emotion regulation model.

194
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.270
So I want you to look at this graph carefully.
I'm going to walk you through it.

195
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:11.570
So they argue that older adults select and optimize emotion regulation processes

196
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.930
that take advantage of resource games and compensate for resorts losses.

197
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.950
Specifically we see in this figure that older adults receive more encouragement

198
00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:24.951
from others to get involved in positive situations represented by a larger oval

199
00:11:25.981 --> 00:11:29.340
size that you can see on the top right because they have a smaller but closer

200
00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:33.260
social network.
So this represents what they would call a resource gain,
an older,

201
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.163
older age.

202
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.220
And since older adults may also have less cognitive control represented by a

203
00:11:38.221 --> 00:11:39.180
smaller oval,

204
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.170
you would expect younger adults to use more cognitive reappraisal indicated by a

205
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:47.130
relatively larger oval on the bottom left hand corner,
um,

206
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.300
compared to older adults.

207
00:11:48.301 --> 00:11:51.780
So this is a really interesting model that I highly encourage you to read more

208
00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:56.170
about that suggest in what ways older adults are really able to become more

209
00:11:56.171 --> 00:12:00.640
effective emotion regulators by really taking advantage of resource gains and

210
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:02.890
compensating for potential resource losses.

211
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:05.140
That is cognitive decline that we see,
you know,

212
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:09.430
decrease over age they make up for it by engaging in other kinds of situations

213
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:11.530
that really capitalize on their,
you know,

214
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.130
intimate and really selectively tuned social networks.

215
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.740
So in conclusion,

216
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.590
we've seen this evidence for what's called the positivity effect.

217
00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:23.460
When we think of emotion and aging,
which is the,

218
00:12:23.461 --> 00:12:28.270
the fact that as humans get older there is a relative preference for positive

219
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:29.620
over negative information.

220
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.520
So it's almost as if as we get older we sort of tune ourselves towards positive

221
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:37.570
information and sort of back away from negative emotional information.

222
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.850
And if you're interested in this,

223
00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:44.851
I highly encourage you to watch this talk by Dr Laura Carstensen called older

224
00:12:45.191 --> 00:12:46.360
people are happier.

225
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.410
She's a fantastic speaker and really reviews a lot of the evidence that we've

226
00:12:50.411 --> 00:12:54.880
discussed today for just how we can sort of reapproach the end of life.

227
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.350
Not think of it as a time of existential crisis and health related difficulties

228
00:12:59.351 --> 00:13:00.184
and frustration,

229
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.340
but actually as an opportunity to experience more positive emotion,

230
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.990
cherished times with other people who we intimately value and actually become

231
00:13:07.991 --> 00:13:11.680
wiser and happier as a result.
So with that,

232
00:13:11.681 --> 00:13:13.300
I'll turn to our takeaway questions.

233
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.080
The first question today,
ask,

234
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.530
what is the socioemotional selectivity theory and what are at central
postulates?

235
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:24.903
Second,

236
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.780
what is the supportive evidence that we discussed today indicating that we may

237
00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:32.770
actually become happier as we grow older?
And finally,

238
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:37.120
how does emotion regulation change as we age or grow older?

239
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.590
Now I'll turn to our expert interview as part of our experts in emotion

240
00:13:42.591 --> 00:13:43.580
interview series.

241
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:44.820
<v 1>Okay.</v>

242
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.740
<v 0>I have the pleasure today of speaking with doctor Laura Carstensen on emotion</v>

243
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.633
and aging.

244
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:55.970
Dr. Carson is a professor of psychology and the fairly Dixon junior professor in

245
00:13:56.221 --> 00:14:00.300
public policy at Stanford University where she's also the founding director of

246
00:14:00.301 --> 00:14:02.040
the Stanford Center on longevity,

247
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.480
which explores innovative ways to solve the problems of people over 50 and

248
00:14:06.481 --> 00:14:09.450
improve the wellbeing of people across all ages.

249
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.920
She received her bs from the University of Rochester and phd in clinical

250
00:14:13.921 --> 00:14:16.320
psychology from West Virginia University.

251
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.510
Dr. Carson is best known in academia for the socioemotional selectivity theory,

252
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.650
a lifespan theory of motivation and with her students and colleagues has

253
00:14:25.651 --> 00:14:30.420
published well over 125 articles on lifespan development.

254
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

255
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.500
<v 0>Her research has been supported by the national institute on Aging for more than</v>

256
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:40.501
20 years and in 2011 she authored along bright future happiness,

257
00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:44.740
health and financial security in an age of increased longevity.

258
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:48.130
She's a fellow of the association for Psychological Science,

259
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.060
the American Psychological Association and the Gerontological Society of
America.

260
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:57.710
She has chaired two studies for the National Academy of Sciences resulting in

261
00:14:57.711 --> 00:14:58.550
the aging mind,

262
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.440
and when I'm 64 she's a member of the Macarthur Foundation's research on an

263
00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:05.840
aging society.
Not Surprising.

264
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:08.630
Dr Carson's and has won numerous awards,

265
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:12.680
including a Guggenheim Fellowship and the distinguished career award from the

266
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:14.900
Gerontological Society of America.

267
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:19.370
So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Doctor Laura Carstensen

268
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.900
on emotion and aging.
