00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.400
Today we'll be speaking with Dr Kevin Ochsner,

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.020
who's a professor of psychology at Columbia University on emotion regulation and

3
00:00:08.021 --> 00:00:12.880
the brain doctor Ochsner received his phd in psychology from Harvard University

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.450
where he also received postdoctoral training and social psychology.

5
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.250
He later received additional training in functional neuroimaging at Stanford

6
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.250
University where he subsequently held the position of a research scientist.

7
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.360
He's currently a professor of Psychology at Columbia University and director of

8
00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:32.830
the social cognitive and affective neuroscience laboratory.
His lab studies,

9
00:00:32.831 --> 00:00:37.660
the psychological and neuro processes involved in emotion,
self regulation,

10
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.330
person perception and their interactions.

11
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.900
He's received various awards for his research and teaching,

12
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.590
including the American Psychological Association's division three new

13
00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:48.730
investigator award,

14
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.420
the cognitive neuroscience societies young investigator award,

15
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.530
and the Columbia University's Distinguished Faculty award.

16
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.460
So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Doctor Kevin Ochsner.

17
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.390
So welcome Kevin.
Thanks for speaking with us today.

18
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.570
<v 1>Thanks for inviting me to talk with you</v>

19
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.693
<v 0>anytime.</v>

20
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.500
What I'd like to ask you about saying what I think a lot of people would like to

21
00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:15.940
know is what got you first started,
uh,
studying emotion in the first place.

22
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.800
Can you tell us a bit about that journey?

23
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.100
<v 1>Sure.
Uh,
I guess for most people,
uh,
or at least in my case,</v>

24
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:25.320
it starts when I was,
uh,

25
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.060
just a grade school student and I started noticing that,

26
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.390
uh,
so many people's emotional reactions,
uh,

27
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.550
seem to be a product of their life history.

28
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.800
So whether it was in my family or even my friends in the neighborhood or in

29
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:41.634
classes,

30
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.270
and I found myself trying to figure out what their history was that led them to

31
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.660
have the experiences that they had today.
Uh,

32
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.080
and although that was in some sense,

33
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.140
the seed that grew into the career I have now a one twist is that I didn't

34
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:01.680
realize how much I was interested in this until I was in Grad school studying

35
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:05.280
something else entirely.
Uh,
well,
it's not something else entirely.

36
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:07.960
I was studying memory and attention on,

37
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.180
I was studying that because when I was in college,
um,

38
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.140
I was an engineering and English major and I took as an elective what now would

39
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:18.840
be called mind brain and behavior.
I loved it.

40
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.950
One of the professors got me working in her lab.
I thought that was really fun,

41
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.220
but she studied attention and I worked in a couple of other labs and studied

42
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:27.810
memory and I thought this is really cool.

43
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.870
But I think we realized that what I thought was really cool was working in those

44
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:35.820
labs,
not necessarily the content of the science.
And,

45
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.650
uh,
I went to Grad school to study memory and attention and not that those are

46
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.430
perfectly worthy topics to study.
They're wonderful.
They just worked for me.

47
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.290
And about two months into Grad school I realized I needed to study emotion.
Um,

48
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.820
but I hadn't until that point realize you could do that as a career.
Uh,

49
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.850
and from then I started slowly but surely changing my trajectory away from

50
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:03.080
straight cognitive phenomenon to studying emotion,
uh,

51
00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:04.660
and social behavior more broadly.

52
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.510
<v 0>Very interesting.</v>

53
00:03:06.511 --> 00:03:09.300
So that actually through to the next question I want to ask you,

54
00:03:09.301 --> 00:03:12.000
which is a bit about your word work now on emotion.

55
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.330
So your work has really pioneered this field that's looked at how can our brain

56
00:03:17.341 --> 00:03:19.150
play a role in either,
you know,

57
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.740
kind of harnessing are reigning in our emotions are really amplifying them.

58
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.580
And so I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you see as some of the most

59
00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:31.470
fundamental discoveries about neuroscience and as it relates to emotion

60
00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:35.820
regulation.
So how does our brain really play a role in harnessing our feelings?

61
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.160
<v 1>Well,
that's a great question.
Um,
and I wish it,</v>

62
00:03:40.161 --> 00:03:42.950
this one I could answer in three soundbites.

63
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.510
I'll do my best to sort of boil down two or three things that I think are

64
00:03:47.511 --> 00:03:51.740
particularly cool.
So,
uh,
one is,
uh,

65
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.240
has to do with a particular way of regulating your emotion that's captured by

66
00:03:56.241 --> 00:03:57.440
everyday aphorisms.

67
00:03:57.441 --> 00:04:01.640
Like every dark cloud has a silver lining or look on the bright side.

68
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.170
And so on these aphorisms capture the idea that by changing the way you think

69
00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:08.930
about the world,
you can change your emotional response to it.

70
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.410
And that particular skill that we seem to have a really captured my interest.

71
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.030
And I wanted to understand how did that happen in the brain so that we can

72
00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:24.010
understand not just behaviourally that it does work,
but,
uh,

73
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.930
at a slightly more mechanistic level,
how does it work?

74
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.020
What is actually going on inside the brain when we find the silver lining in a

75
00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:33.770
dark cloud.
Uh,

76
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.810
and we've used a functional magnetic resonance imaging as our primary tool here,

77
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.590
which allows us to look at what parts of the brain have more blood flow when

78
00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:47.540
you're having particular kinds of thoughts or feelings.
And what we've found,
uh,

79
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.860
in my laboratory and now dozens of other laboratories around the world is that

80
00:04:51.861 --> 00:04:53.720
when you elicit an emotional response,

81
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.690
you're activating parts of the brain that are often evolutionarily old.

82
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.310
And uh,

83
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.360
they in a kind of a bottom up driven by the world kind of way trigger an

84
00:05:05.361 --> 00:05:06.380
emotional response.

85
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.380
But then if you want to effortfully changed the way you think about it,

86
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.180
to find that silver lining,

87
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.770
you use evolutionarily newer parts of the brain up here in your frontal lobe.

88
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.030
It's the lobes of the brain behind the frontal bone of your skull,
which in me,

89
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.630
not the hairless wonder here is quite prominent.
Uh,

90
00:05:23.631 --> 00:05:27.260
and these areas of the frontal lobe are involved in generating a story,

91
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.340
creating a new narrative for the meaning of the situation that then kind of

92
00:05:31.341 --> 00:05:35.510
harnesses activation of the subcortical systems and shifts them around as a

93
00:05:35.511 --> 00:05:37.490
function of the way you're thinking about the world.

94
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.090
So if you think about a bad situation like visiting your sick uncle in the

95
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:44.090
hospital who just had a surgery,
you focus on the fact that,
oh,

96
00:05:44.091 --> 00:05:46.220
he could be getting better.
He could be getting well,

97
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.110
these frontal regions will come online and might diminish activity in a brain

98
00:05:51.111 --> 00:05:54.440
structure like you've made Dilla.
But if instead you think,
oh,

99
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.950
uncle Larry isn't a great deal of pain,
he might much worse.

100
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.330
It's going to be devastated.
I really stresses me out.

101
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.520
You'll be using these same frontal regions,

102
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:08.390
but now you're amping up activity in the system's important for triggering your

103
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:12.230
initial emotional response.
So it's not like there's any simple idea that,
oh,

104
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:15.200
you turn on the frontal lobe,
you turn off emotion.
It's not like that.

105
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.920
It's all about the meaning that you ascribe or the way in which classically in

106
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:22.790
psychology you'd say you a praise of the meeting of a situation that's
important.

107
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.150
So that's the first I think fundamental insight is that when you're cognitively

108
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:30.530
reframing the meaning of an emotional situation,

109
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.810
you're relying on parts of the frontal lobe that are important for all other

110
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.430
kinds of cock,
higher cognitive function in general language,

111
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.420
holding information in working memory,
controlling the focus of your attention.

112
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.600
It's really pretty much the same regions.
And in that sense,

113
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:49.190
these cognitive forms of emotion regulation are an instance of using cognitive

114
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:54.191
control over emotion instead of cognitive control over memory or cognitive

115
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:57.400
control over attention.
Um,

116
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.220
so that to me it was actually kind of profound because we really didn't know how

117
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:05.450
emotional regulation,
especially of this sort was going to be organized.
Um,

118
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.130
another thing that I thought was particularly interesting was that this ability

119
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:14.750
to cognitively reframe the meaning of a situation would work all the way down to

120
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:19.751
the level of very evolutionarily old brain structures that we might not have

121
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:24.470
thought our everyday thoughts and reasoning could penetrate.

122
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.910
So,
um,
for a while the received wisdom was that this brain structure,

123
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:31.550
the amygdala would lay down,
for example,

124
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:34.220
traces of a fear memory that were indelible.

125
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.320
Joseph Ledoux is famous at Nyu for doing the seminal studies in this regard.

126
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.770
So when we started waiting in here and doing these emotion regulation studies,

127
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.240
it was big news that you could just modify the image that was response simply by

128
00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:50.900
changing quickly the way that you think about something.
Because the idea was,

129
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:51.411
oh my gosh,

130
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:54.920
if the middle is going to respond to something that's gruesome or nasty,

131
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.460
that's almost an obligatory response will hijack your brain.
In fact,

132
00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:02.300
that was the popular term for science writers like Daniel Goleman,
they'd say,

133
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.690
you have an Amygdala hijacking.
Oh,
no,
read on your brain.
Um,

134
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.920
but it turned out it's not quite so simple as that as alluring and interesting

135
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:16.910
as those kinds of metaphors are,
as we all know,

136
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.110
they're useful up to a point.

137
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.150
The trends at the reality is a bit more complicated.

138
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.250
So that I think is the second thing that's really cool is that just by changing

139
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:30.251
your high level thoughts about the meaning of an emotional listening situation,

140
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.210
you can penetrate all the way down to even your brainstem and changed the way

141
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.680
really evolutionarily old primitive brain stem centers are encoding whether

142
00:08:39.681 --> 00:08:43.170
something's threatening or not interested.
To me that's with,

143
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.540
maybe that's a long winded answer.

144
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.300
<v 0>No,
not at all.
Not at all.
It doesn't make me think a lot about how,</v>

145
00:08:48.301 --> 00:08:50.850
I mean you're giving us really interesting examples about how people used to

146
00:08:50.851 --> 00:08:54.360
think about emotion and the way in which we would or would not be able to

147
00:08:54.361 --> 00:08:59.000
regulate and it just kind of draws back to this notion of well what is emotion

148
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.660
and emotion regulation in the first place?

149
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:02.760
We can relate to it in our everyday lives.

150
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:06.150
We have these beliefs about how emotions,
like you said,
hijack our brain,

151
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.920
but really trying to define these two terms is really thorny for a lot of

152
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:14.280
researchers and I wonder for you especially looking at this through lens of

153
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:15.114
neuroscience,

154
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.930
how do you really tease apart what emotion and emotion regulation is?

155
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:22.350
And can the brain actually support this distinction in your mind?

156
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.000
<v 1>Well,
I love how you asked some simple questions,
Jean,</v>

157
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:30.270
and they're just so easy to answer.
Um,
so I mean,

158
00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:34.680
of course that's another great question and this distinction between generating

159
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:38.470
an emotion on the one hand and then regulating it on the other,
um,

160
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.650
is of course,
uh,

161
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.900
it's really fundamental in many areas of psychology and it's,

162
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.660
it's extremely useful to make that distinction often,
uh,

163
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:53.690
in behavioral context where you're a clinician who wants to try and have a,

164
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.320
a working model of what's a good way to have a therapeutic intervention,

165
00:09:58.321 --> 00:10:00.480
whether it's a conduct behavioral intervention,

166
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.640
you don't talk therapy intervention,
uh,
uh,
psychopharmacological intervention.

167
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.010
You know,
if you can frame that in terms of they have some type of um,

168
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:16.220
perhaps maladaptive initial emotional response or then you modify their ability

169
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.710
to regulate that in some way.

170
00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:23.760
This distinction between generation or regulation can be very powerful and

171
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:27.270
useful.
But then when you start looking at the brain,

172
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.430
things get a little more blurry.

173
00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:34.431
It turns out because most of our everyday examples of emotion generation on the

174
00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:39.750
one hand and regulation on the other frame generation as a very automatic,

175
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:40.891
obligatory,

176
00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:45.360
reflexive process as if it never involves much higher order of thought.

177
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:51.110
And the other hand frame regulation as necessarily this consciously gold ribbon

178
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.350
effortful,
the liberate time consuming process,

179
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.400
it turns out that's not the complete picture.

180
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.880
And emotions can be generated through deliberative effort full top down thought.

181
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:11.180
If you've ever been sitting in an arm chair on a fall or winter's day as the

182
00:11:12.091 --> 00:11:14.400
light goes down earlier than you'd expect,

183
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.670
you're reading a book or You're surfing the web on your computer and suddenly

184
00:11:17.671 --> 00:11:20.190
you noticed it's gotten dark all around you.

185
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.760
Did you lock the front door?
Oh,

186
00:11:23.761 --> 00:11:26.220
what's that creek over there?

187
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.130
There's a strange sound in the other room and so on.

188
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:33.900
You start cognitively elaborating a scenario that from the top down we'll

189
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:37.530
generate an emotion and we've actually found that that will turn on the Amygdala

190
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.423
as well.

191
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:43.550
So there's a route by which controlled top down processes normally thought of as

192
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:48.930
part of regulation can actually be involved in the emotion generation process.

193
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.310
And then conversely,

194
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:55.430
there are forms of emotion regulation w that I don't require conscious,

195
00:11:55.571 --> 00:12:00.330
top down effort in order to change your emotional response.
So for example,
um,

196
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.760
if you've learned that,
uh,
and in say,
uh,

197
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.710
a classic context that's studied by animal researchers,

198
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:13.660
a rat learns that a light predicts a shock.
You know,
for us,

199
00:12:13.661 --> 00:12:17.560
you might learn that there's a particular street corner that predicts really

200
00:12:17.561 --> 00:12:19.720
scary traffic.
So as you approached the street corner,

201
00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:22.690
you start getting a little anxious because it's a little dodgy.
It's like,

202
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.051
you know,

203
00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:26.470
playing an old video game for the 1970s trying to get across the street.

204
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.740
And so you have a little anticipatory fear,
anxiety,
anxieties.

205
00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:32.500
You come up to the intersection.
Well,
uh,

206
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.600
it turns out that if over time you have no negative consequences in the face of

207
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.920
if you're a rat the light or if you're a person approaching that intersection

208
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:47.050
over time,
you'll extinguish what was previously this anticipatory anxiety,

209
00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:48.640
that sort of anxious,

210
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:52.030
fearful response because you've had no negative consequences follow from that

211
00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:52.864
expectation.

212
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.500
It turns out that involves completely different parts of the brain that are

213
00:12:56.501 --> 00:12:59.830
involved in this conscious effort,
full top down reappraisal.
In fact,

214
00:12:59.831 --> 00:13:03.370
it just involves the brain systems that are involved in initially learning or

215
00:13:03.371 --> 00:13:07.930
acquiring an emotional response in the first place.
And,
uh,
and in fact,

216
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:09.580
expressing that emotion.
So it says,

217
00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:13.570
if there are forms of regulation that just happened by dint of relearning,
oh,

218
00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:16.420
this isn't really such a bad,
scary thing anymore,

219
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.360
and that doesn't require this effort full top down control.

220
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.180
So is that just learning to generate a new emotion,

221
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.350
is that implicitly automatically learning to regulate it?

222
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.710
Right.
It depends.
Right?
It depends on what the purpose is of asking the question.

223
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.310
So,
uh,

224
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.800
I mean that's my long winded round about way of coming back to saying whether

225
00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:42.760
you want to call something generation or regulation really depends on your

226
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:46.510
purposes.
If it's really useful to make that distinction.
St and clinical context,

227
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:47.800
by all means make it.

228
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.920
If you're a neuroscientist who's trying to characterize the operation of a

229
00:13:50.921 --> 00:13:52.210
specific brain system,

230
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.570
it's not going to break down in terms of this is a regulation region where this

231
00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:59.410
is just a generation region.
Almost never does it break down that simply

232
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.990
<v 0>if only emotion regulation where simple.
Right?</v>

233
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.880
<v 1>Right.
It only,
anything we study about,
people were simple.</v>

234
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:09.340
I suppose neither of us would have jobs,

235
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.810
<v 0>so thank goodness it's complicated and we don't have,
you know,</v>

236
00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:15.120
short soundbite answers to everything.
Right.

237
00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:16.491
<v 1>I agree.</v>

238
00:14:16.491 --> 00:14:20.630
I mean I think there's such interest in the complexity and I think we should be

239
00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:25.780
unafraid as a scientist and just interested people to embrace the complexity of

240
00:14:26.121 --> 00:14:27.110
it and try to understand it.

241
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.821
<v 0>Well.</v>

242
00:14:27.821 --> 00:14:30.730
I think one of the really cool things you've done when you talk about embracing

243
00:14:30.731 --> 00:14:35.350
complexity as you've taken it to a next level of complexity by trying to look at

244
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:39.160
clinical populations,
right,
where we know that emotion regulation goes awry.

245
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.550
And I think that's one of the really interesting things that I've been reading

246
00:14:42.551 --> 00:14:46.510
about in your research.
I know a lot of people are excited about.
And so,
I mean,

247
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.990
one of the questions,
and this is the final question about your research,

248
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:54.860
I promise it's just sort of what your thoughts are about how emotion regulation

249
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:56.220
goes awry,
um,

250
00:14:56.221 --> 00:14:59.360
especially in the brain for individual suffering from emotional disorders.

251
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:02.780
And I know your work has looked at populations ranging from individuals with

252
00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:05.600
borderline personality disorder to substance abuse.

253
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.330
What's different in these individuals?

254
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.320
<v 1>That's another great question.
So,
um,</v>

255
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.740
let me start to answer that question or attempt to answer that question by

256
00:15:16.741 --> 00:15:18.020
talking about,
um,

257
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:22.980
our approach to taking the work we do in the laboratory with sort of typically

258
00:15:22.981 --> 00:15:27.540
developing adults,
uh,
and then applying it to these clinical contexts.

259
00:15:27.541 --> 00:15:29.590
So our idea,
uh,

260
00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:33.150
and I think this is a grow increasingly common one in the field,

261
00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:37.560
is that you first have to have a benchmark,
uh,
an understanding,

262
00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:42.540
a model of the basic ability as it works effectively for your typically

263
00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:45.000
developing individual.
And so in our case,

264
00:15:45.001 --> 00:15:49.530
we want to have these models of how different kinds of frontal systems maybe

265
00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:54.531
involved in influencing the activity and often some cortical systems that and

266
00:15:54.811 --> 00:15:59.610
that in that interaction you have regulation on the one hand and generation on

267
00:15:59.611 --> 00:16:01.680
the other and that allows you to ask,
okay,

268
00:16:01.681 --> 00:16:05.370
for a given patient population or clinical,
uh,
context,

269
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:11.120
is there a change in the way they initially trigger or generate a response to a

270
00:16:11.341 --> 00:16:12.030
stimulus?

271
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:16.110
So if I've got borderline personality disorder and I have fundamental aspect

272
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:21.130
instability and a tendency to anxiously expect and overreact to potential cues

273
00:16:21.691 --> 00:16:23.040
that someone's rejecting me,

274
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.510
then I might be particularly sensitive to social stimuli,
facial expressions,

275
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.090
any Q that might remind me of a time when I was lonely or rejected and so on.

276
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.390
You could ask,
am I just hyper sensitive to those kinds of queues?

277
00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.373
On the other hand,

278
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:42.180
do we have a problem marshaling cognitive resources to regulate or modify that

279
00:16:42.181 --> 00:16:47.040
response or even say psychologically distanced myself from that situation so I

280
00:16:47.041 --> 00:16:51.790
don't have to be a victim of an initial impulsive tendency to say,
oh,

281
00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:56.670
I really angry and anxious now because you seem to not be feeling too good about

282
00:16:56.671 --> 00:17:01.590
me.
Um,
and so in this way like framing things in this way,

283
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.020
we can go in there with our um,

284
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.410
experimental methods and our brain imaging techniques and then ask what's going

285
00:17:07.411 --> 00:17:08.940
on behavioral and in the brain.

286
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.130
And in the case of borderline personality disorder,

287
00:17:11.131 --> 00:17:16.131
one thing we found is that some of the control systems that should be signaling

288
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.430
that,
hey,

289
00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:25.090
I'm having an affect of response now I might not want to have those alarms.

290
00:17:25.091 --> 00:17:28.380
Systems don't seem to be operating normally and someone with borderline

291
00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:32.160
personality disorder and in fact when they try the turn down,

292
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.820
there are affective response.

293
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.700
They actually take the admit those response and Jack it up

294
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:39.723
<v 2>and</v>

295
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:43.860
<v 1>the alarm system that should be saying,
hey,
something wrong is happening here.</v>

296
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.230
It doesn't go off.
In fact,
its activity goes down.

297
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.910
It's as if they at we're not being told to do anything,

298
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.940
are trying to kind of keep themselves from thinking about the situation.

299
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:57.210
But as soon as you force them to think about a potentially stressful situation,

300
00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.520
even if it's already having a negative impact on them,

301
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.910
it only makes things worse for them.
And they seem to be,

302
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:08.430
the control system seems to be ineffective in signaling the need to regulate.

303
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:12.720
So that's one interesting insight we've had about worldwide using our model of

304
00:18:12.721 --> 00:18:17.490
emotion regulation that's really about characterizing the nature of disordered

305
00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:19.710
aspect of response in that population.

306
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.880
Another way you can apply are these kinds of basic models of emotion.

307
00:18:23.881 --> 00:18:28.881
Regulation is in a more of a treatment mode or a mode where you want to develop,

308
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.050
um,

309
00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:35.050
or apply your say methods for studying emotion regulation to a clinical context

310
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:40.160
where you could be helping a population and learn to cope more effectively with

311
00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:42.720
whatever their maladaptive aspect of responses.

312
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.670
And so here there's work that we've done on substance abuse with one of your

313
00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:51.000
colleagues there at Yale.
A former student in my lab had he Cobar,

314
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:56.490
she was the lead person on this work.
And here we studied smokers,
uh,

315
00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:01.350
where the interest wasn't understanding how on the one hand a smoker might have

316
00:19:01.351 --> 00:19:02.640
an initial,
uh,

317
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:08.030
differentially strong bottom up positive appetitive craving response to a cue

318
00:19:08.551 --> 00:19:09.840
that reminds them of a cigarette.

319
00:19:09.841 --> 00:19:14.270
So it can be a photograph of a burning cigarette and someone's hand,
um,

320
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.280
it could be a picture of someone smoking,
even just a pack of cigarettes.

321
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.080
All of those cues are known to elicit positive aspect of response that leads us

322
00:19:22.081 --> 00:19:27.060
smoker to crave smoking a cigarette at that moment.
So we can ask,

323
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.120
do the brain systems involved in generating a positive affect of response or

324
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:36.900
recognizing that's a potentially rewarding thing out there in the world to those

325
00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:39.480
respond more strongly on the one hand or on the other.

326
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.690
If you ask them to try and effortfully regulate that response,

327
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.890
is there a diminishment in their capacity to turn down that response?

328
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.520
And what was really intriguing that we found was while sure they have a stronger

329
00:19:53.701 --> 00:19:58.500
response to uh,
say cigarettes or cues that elicit creating for cigarettes,

330
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.970
then say a food cue that elicits a desire to eat that delicious chocolate Sundae

331
00:20:02.971 --> 00:20:04.950
or that chocolate chip cookie or you know,

332
00:20:04.951 --> 00:20:07.800
in this holiday season there's any number of temptations around.

333
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:11.370
Yeah,
they respond more strongly,

334
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.630
but they're able to effectively turn it off using kind of cognitive reappraisal

335
00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:19.950
like techniques from the top down and then involve this action from prefrontal

336
00:20:19.951 --> 00:20:22.020
regions turning off a region,

337
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.590
a supportable structure called the ventral striatum,
evolutionarily old,

338
00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:29.910
really important for encoding things that are rewarding and reinforcing and that

339
00:20:29.911 --> 00:20:32.400
in turn diminish their craving.

340
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.450
There's this nice three step pathway that heady described.

341
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:40.050
What was striking is that smokers were as effective at turning down their

342
00:20:40.051 --> 00:20:43.320
craving for cigarettes as they weren't turning down their cravings for food.

343
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.830
And what's exciting about that is that it seems to provide an initial insight

344
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:51.970
into the pathway by which treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy,

345
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:52.991
which are really,

346
00:20:52.991 --> 00:20:56.520
really similar to the ways we study reappraisal in the lab might be effective.

347
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.830
And we know that cognitive behavioral therapies can be very effective for

348
00:20:59.831 --> 00:21:02.350
smokers.
And so in this context,

349
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:07.380
what we might be doing is starting to describe the brain pathways that underlie

350
00:21:07.451 --> 00:21:11.800
effective forms of treatment for a substance abusing population.

351
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.620
And we can then potentially generalize that to other populations.

352
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:19.890
Ask How some individuals with substance abuse issues might effectively or

353
00:21:20.981 --> 00:21:25.150
ineffectively rely on those pathways.
Um,
and so on.

354
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.090
We're now taking this work,
uh,

355
00:21:27.091 --> 00:21:30.650
and extending it to the study of alcohol and alcohol abuse.
Uh,

356
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.380
and I know your colleague had,

357
00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:34.570
he has taken it and extended in other directions as well.

358
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:36.930
<v 0>So thanks for that.
I mean,</v>

359
00:21:36.931 --> 00:21:40.230
in your sort of thinking about now what is in store next,
right.

360
00:21:40.231 --> 00:21:44.160
So this leads me to ask you,
this is another easy question,

361
00:21:44.161 --> 00:21:48.240
but what do you see in store for the future study of emotion?

362
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.440
<v 1>Boy,
I think,
um,</v>

363
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.670
one of the exciting things about research is you never know what's next.

364
00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.140
Um,
one answer could be,
I just don't know because it's going to be,

365
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:04.800
there's so many different people working on different aspects of emotion that

366
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.100
it's hard to predict what new insights we're going to have.
A,

367
00:22:08.101 --> 00:22:09.960
another way to answer that question is to say,

368
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:14.460
certainly we're gonna try to deepen our understanding of the basic ways in
which,

369
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:15.450
um,

370
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.690
cortical and subcortical systems are involved in emotion generation on the one

371
00:22:18.691 --> 00:22:21.690
hand and regulation on the other with,

372
00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:27.440
I think in the next 10 years we're going to describe networks for everything

373
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:28.561
where it's going to be,

374
00:22:28.561 --> 00:22:33.561
not just parts of prefrontal cortex modulating brain systems for detecting

375
00:22:33.571 --> 00:22:36.450
threats are encoding,
uh,
rewards.

376
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.800
It's going to be each one of those things will be more of a network and then

377
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:45.420
there'll be an increasing recognition that we can't understand the brain basis

378
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:48.680
of any behavior,
let alone emotion.
Um,

379
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.890
in terms of us few bit part players on a stage,

380
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:57.210
it's really like an orchestra where every part of the brain is an instrument

381
00:22:57.211 --> 00:23:01.890
playing different kinds of nodes in synchrony or asynchronously with others.

382
00:23:01.891 --> 00:23:03.630
In the case of dysfunction potentially.

383
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:08.810
And there's something in the aggregate about the music that's made by the notes

384
00:23:08.821 --> 00:23:12.180
played by all these different instruments and that you can't understand the

385
00:23:12.181 --> 00:23:13.830
phenomenon in our case of motion,

386
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.610
unless you understand the way all the instruments play together as kind of a

387
00:23:17.611 --> 00:23:18.960
network or a group.

388
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:23.980
And I think that is a really exciting frontier for,
uh,

389
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.540
the interface between psychology and neuroscience is how to characterize the way

390
00:23:27.541 --> 00:23:29.190
in which this sort of orchestra,

391
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:34.350
all the instruments that play in your brain and your mind give rise to the

392
00:23:34.351 --> 00:23:35.580
phenomena that we care about.

393
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.480
<v 0>That's a really beautiful metaphor.</v>

394
00:23:37.481 --> 00:23:41.260
I think a lot of people will use that as a way to guide how they think about

395
00:23:41.261 --> 00:23:45.680
emotion and where to go with it.
Um,
and so the last question I want to ask you,

396
00:23:45.681 --> 00:23:47.090
Kevin,
is,
you know,

397
00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:50.510
what advice would you have for students or just people more generally who are

398
00:23:50.511 --> 00:23:53.750
interested in embarking in the study of this?
You know,

399
00:23:53.751 --> 00:23:57.650
sort of confusing but beautiful orchestra,
you know,
if emotion.

400
00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:02.630
<v 1>Uh,
that's a great question.
I guess.
I think two things.</v>

401
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.790
So one is,
uh,
read a lot,
you know,

402
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:11.090
read broadly,
read about emotion,
uh,

403
00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:16.070
but also read outside of emotion research,
uh,

404
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.830
because it might provide with insights into the way emotion works that if you

405
00:24:19.831 --> 00:24:23.000
are only reading research and emotion you might not otherwise have.

406
00:24:23.001 --> 00:24:24.800
So in my own example,

407
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:30.040
I had a pretty big base of knowledge just about cognitive neuroscience in

408
00:24:30.291 --> 00:24:33.260
general and the study of memory and attention in particular.

409
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.310
And so I used that as my foundation when I came into studying emotion and I

410
00:24:37.311 --> 00:24:40.820
wasn't sort of brought up in my,
uh,

411
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.430
academic adolescence,
if you will,

412
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:48.730
in a lab that had strong preexisting ideas and a long history about the way

413
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.710
emotion was supposed to be studied.
In some sense,

414
00:24:51.711 --> 00:24:56.000
that might've freed me up to have an outsider's perspective on it and say,
oh,

415
00:24:56.001 --> 00:24:56.834
okay,

416
00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:01.960
I can approach emotion the way a cognitive neuroscientist and I don't have to be

417
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.410
beholden to any prior views necessarily.
I mean,

418
00:25:06.411 --> 00:25:09.200
obviously that has its pluses and minuses.
Uh,
and I,

419
00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.090
once I started reading more broadly to emotion,

420
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.000
I felt like I could integrate things in a,
in a somewhat unique way.

421
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:18.860
And I think that's important for anyone interested in any phenomenon read not

422
00:25:18.861 --> 00:25:19.970
just about that phenomenon,

423
00:25:19.971 --> 00:25:22.880
but other allied things you don't know where inspiration will come from.

424
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:27.140
I think the other piece of advice I might get I might give is simply to get

425
00:25:27.141 --> 00:25:32.060
involved in doing research.
And if it weren't for the fact that I did that in my,

426
00:25:32.061 --> 00:25:34.040
uh,
my own college career,

427
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.460
I don't think I'd be where I am today even though I feel like this is absolutely

428
00:25:37.461 --> 00:25:38.450
the perfect career for me.

429
00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:42.560
I couldn't possibly imagine doing anything else if I hadn't got involved in

430
00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:46.850
research and being on the ground in the research trenches,
if you will,

431
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.890
collecting data,
running subjects,

432
00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:52.310
thinking hard about the phenomenon that I was studying and what it means and how

433
00:25:52.311 --> 00:25:56.090
do I develop methods and we'll have to study on what am I doing if I hadn't been

434
00:25:56.091 --> 00:25:59.120
doing that,
I don't think I would have had,
um,

435
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:04.490
the hands on experience to ground my highfalutin interests and high concept

436
00:26:04.491 --> 00:26:06.740
stuff,
you know,
otherwise,
it's kind of just,

437
00:26:06.741 --> 00:26:11.000
it's armchair philosophy if you don't kind of get in there and study it.

438
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:15.460
<v 0>So read more and get in the trenches.
Yes.
Well,</v>

439
00:26:15.461 --> 00:26:18.260
thank you so much for speaking with us today,
Kevin.
Um,

440
00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:22.810
this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Doctor Kevin Ochsner from

441
00:26:22.811 --> 00:26:24.100
Columbia University.
