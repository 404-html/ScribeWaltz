1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.300
Welcome back to human emotion here.

2
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:08.010
We're going to wonder whether early man actually had emotions or are they a more

3
00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:09.930
recent evolutionary phenomena?

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.350
That is are we evolved to be emotional,

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.710
our emotions evolutionarily evolved.

6
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.450
In this lecture today we're going to discuss to what extent emotions are

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.370
evolutionarily evolved here.

8
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:26.880
We're going to start with an introduction to some basic principles of evolution

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.140
and we'll move on to explain how those principles may be used to better

10
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:34.020
understand the origins of human emotion.

11
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.340
So here is our roadmap for today.

12
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.460
We're going to start with some origins of evolutionary theory,

13
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.220
talk about the EEA,
which I'll describe later.

14
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.880
Think about what an evolutionary approach is to emotion,

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.540
and we'll conclude with our takeaway questions and expert interview.

16
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.640
So let's start here with some of the Orrin origins or where evolutionary theory

17
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.623
came from.

18
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.190
So this might look familiar to you from one of our first lectures where we

19
00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:07.140
talked about this sort of chronological theories of emotion or our theories of

20
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:08.280
emotion timeline.

21
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.460
Here we're going to take a stop at Darwin as we try to trace the origins of

22
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:16.650
evolutionary theory here.

23
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:20.430
You might also remember from our earlier lecture that Darwin was really seen as

24
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:23.280
the founder of the evolutionary approach to emotions.

25
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.190
Here he saw or said that emotions,

26
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:29.640
we're evolutionarily evolved and that they were here to serve an important

27
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:32.250
survival purpose for man.
In other words,

28
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:37.251
he argued that emotions evolve via natural selection and serve this purpose for

29
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:37.891
humans.

30
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:42.340
Critical surface verse survival and helping aid and communication and bonds with

31
00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:47.070
feathers.
Darwin detailed these thoughts in his landmark book,

32
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.730
the expression of the emotions in man and animals here.

33
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.140
This book was immediately a bestseller of its time,
over 5,000 copies,

34
00:01:58.141 --> 00:01:59.640
which was a lot in those days.

35
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.240
And what was fascinating about it is it was really considered the first

36
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:07.380
scientific treatment of emotion.
It included survey data,

37
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.480
observations of both healthy and mentally ill individuals looking at healthy and

38
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:16.050
unhealthy emotion,
as well as Darwin's own personal anecdotes,

39
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.920
recounting grief expressions and his family after death,

40
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.820
as well as expressions of early emotion in his own infant son.

41
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.700
So when we think about Darwin and sort of how he approached the evolution of

42
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:30.534
emotion,

43
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.680
you can think of three principles that he talked about to help explain these

44
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:35.880
origins of emotion.

45
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.340
His first of the three principles was called the principle of serviceable or

46
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:42.660
quote,
useful habit.

47
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.070
And this first principle is very important for understanding how emotions

48
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:51.840
evolved.
He argued that useful habits become reinforced over time.

49
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.720
So for example,
think of the emotion of disgust.

50
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.250
So discuss is really useful in helping to turn us away from ingesting substances

51
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.900
or toxins that might actually make us feel ill.

52
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.550
And here we have discussed because it serves a useful or serviceable habit for

53
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:11.380
us.
So this is the first principle,
the principle of serviceable or useful habits.

54
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.550
We have emotions because they serve these useful functions for us.

55
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.430
Now we'll look at this second principle,

56
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.770
which he called the principle of antithesis.

57
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.560
So while some emotional habits are useful,

58
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.900
which we just talked about in the case of discussed,

59
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.410
other emotions are what he called emotional habits occur merely because they

60
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:35.620
are,
they're opposite,
he would say,
or antithesis.
So,
for example,

61
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.970
if you encounter some opposite situation in which you typically elicit a

62
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:42.940
habitual response,
for example,
maybe rotten food,

63
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.210
an opposite manner of the habit will occur,

64
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.350
such as the opposite of the emotion of disgust.
This principle,

65
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:53.910
the principle antithesis was the one that received perhaps the least attention

66
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.780
of all three.
The third,

67
00:03:55.781 --> 00:04:00.520
which will turn to is the principle of involuntariness or what he called
nervous,

68
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:01.390
a discharge.

69
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.220
So some he would say some evolve behaviors or habits are performed as the result

70
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:08.620
of built up energy in the nervous system.

71
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.840
And this would lead to a nervous discharge as he put it.
So think of an example.

72
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.070
When you're in an extreme situation of threat where you feel fear,
he would say,

73
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:22.120
well,
you have what's called a nervous,
just discharge of screaming.
Um,

74
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.661
other people.

75
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:25.960
We'll talk about more modern day situations where maybe you're sitting with a

76
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:29.820
boss or someone that you're very uncomfortable around and you're nervous just

77
00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:34.130
charged my just be even your leg shaking or your arms trembling.
Um,

78
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.440
so he would say that this is this third principle.
Um,

79
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.980
were some evolve behaviors or habits are performed as the result of this built

80
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:46.510
up energy in our nervous system.
So it was the first and third principle.

81
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:50.650
So the principle of serviceable habit and involuntariness that received the bulk

82
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:51.484
of attention.

83
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.720
<v 0>So let's think about what might be some supportive evidence for Darren's</v>

85
00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.980
overarching claim that emotions are evolved and transmitted across time.

86
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

87
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.870
<v 0>So some of the evidence that Darren talked about here,</v>

88
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.710
the first example is what he called the inheritance of expressions.

89
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.810
So he argued that emotions are largely inherited in us and learned and that most

90
00:05:14.811 --> 00:05:17.660
of our important expressions are in us from birth.

91
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.220
So he would use the example of newborn babies as you can see here who admit

92
00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:26.360
displays of distress and crying or screaming immediately on birth.

93
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.560
So he would say that we're just born with a lot of these emotional expressions.

94
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.880
And he would also talk about individuals who are born blind and nonetheless

95
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.080
exhibit similar emotion expressions as seeing individuals.
We've thus,

96
00:05:39.081 --> 00:05:39.561
he would say,

97
00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:44.561
inherited many of our most vital emotion expressions here.

98
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.340
He would talk about,
uh,
another instance,
our example,
um,

99
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.930
which he called instinctive recognition of emotion.
So here you might see a dog.

100
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.990
And if I asked you,
well,
what emotion is that dog feeling?
He would,

101
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.360
we should be immediately able to instinctively recognize that this dogs,

102
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.950
you know,
feeling some sort of threat.
Um,

103
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.080
or he would show an example of a cat here.

104
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:10.520
These are his original drawings in his book,
which is the cat terrified at a dog.

105
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.300
So what Darwin noticed in these drawings is that many emotions,
um,

106
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.630
what he referred to as expressive actions are actually apparent in other species

107
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:22.970
such as we saw this sort of,
uh,
you know,

108
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.240
angry dog or fearful countenance here of this kitty.

109
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.560
And he would say that we have this ability instinctively to recognize emotions,

110
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.110
not only in humans,
but even in animals.

111
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.660
Even if you've never seen this cat or dog before.

112
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:39.440
It sort of built in us to know what emotions are and see them in others.

113
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.210
He would also argue that we should be able to see emotions and recognize them

114
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.050
across humans of varying ages and backgrounds as well.

115
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.890
And here's some more of Darwin's original drawings in his book,
um,

116
00:06:52.891 --> 00:06:57.480
where we can see him depicting emotional expressions of fear and a grown man as

117
00:06:57.481 --> 00:07:01.560
well.
As you can see here on the right in this plate.
One is,
he called it,
um,

118
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.730
six different expressions of emotions even in young children and infants.
Um,

119
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.900
and that what we see here is not only similar morphological features across
time,

120
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.190
but that we're all able to pick up on what these young children are expressing,

121
00:07:14.191 --> 00:07:16.830
you know,
distress,
um,
sadness,

122
00:07:16.831 --> 00:07:20.470
perhaps frustration that were built to be able to,
uh,

123
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.770
recognize these expressions.

124
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.870
So in some Darwin would say most of our emotion expressions are an eight.

125
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.280
That emotions remained virtually static or constant throughout our life.

126
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.740
But he did argue that not all emotional expressions are a sort of instinctive,

127
00:07:38.741 --> 00:07:41.260
that there's some things he would say like kissing for example,

128
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.560
that are learn but are used to fulfill a more evolutionarily primal desire.

129
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.120
So most of our expressions,
our instinctive,

130
00:07:49.121 --> 00:07:52.960
but those that are not are things we learned to fulfill more evolutionarily or

131
00:07:52.961 --> 00:07:54.130
instinctive needs.

132
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.780
So now we're gonna move on to our second point in the roadmap where we're going

133
00:07:58.781 --> 00:08:03.160
to talk about the EEA and the EA stands for the environment of evolutionary

134
00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:04.090
adaptiveness.

135
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:05.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

136
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.540
<v 0>So you might wonder,
well,
what is the EA?
Well,</v>

137
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:13.541
the EA is the environment which forms a sort of the origin of human kind and

138
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:15.920
it's where emotions are thought to have first evolved.

139
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.010
So when we think of what is the EA,

140
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.090
what we're trying to get at is what is an accurate picture of the environment in

141
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:27.260
which human emotions sort of first developed or originated.

142
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.870
So what did this early evolutionary environment look like?
Um,

143
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.880
and so when people try to think about what the EEA is,

144
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.230
what they often do is sort of try to look into other preindustrial societies,

145
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:42.780
hunter gatherer societies,
as you can see here,
um,

146
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.460
to try to think about what might be close analogies or parallels.

147
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.560
And so one particular group that's been studied,
um,
is a new Guinea.
Um,

148
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.341
and for example,

149
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:56.580
here you look at people living in environments that may be similar to those that

150
00:08:56.581 --> 00:09:00.720
we lived in an earlier times and that might help explain some of our early

151
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:05.310
emotional heritage.
So when we think more specifically,

152
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.930
what are the EEA properties?

153
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:11.160
So what did this early environment of man look like that may have given rise to

154
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.690
and help explain some of our modern day,
uh,
emotional tendencies.

155
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.140
So interestingly,

156
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:24.090
the first sort of property of sort of early kind of human environments,

157
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.410
uh,
were what he called the vulnerability of offspring.

158
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.770
So in other words,
we know that as human beings,

159
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:36.771
our frontal cortex expands dramatically and over time the birth canal has

160
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.800
narrowed.
So that what we have now is children who are born.

161
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:45.210
What is thought of as prematurely in so far as after infants are born,

162
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.190
there are highly dependent on their caregiver for a long period of time before

163
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:53.460
they can function independently.
So,
because as humans,

164
00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:56.910
we're very dependent on our caregiver for many years.

165
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.280
It's really important that,
you know,

166
00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:04.281
we have emotions that are built into us that help us want to care for our young

167
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:06.990
and offspring.
So,
um,
in other words,

168
00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:11.991
emotions like compassion or prosocial feelings of nurturant love became really

169
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:17.841
important in our early history as a vital part of promoting this longterm care

170
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:21.870
of offspring in hunter gatherer societies.
Um,

171
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:25.410
so what it seems to be the cases that ea would be the kind of environment where

172
00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:28.980
compassion and love would be really important emotions.

173
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.010
The second property is what has been thought of as monogamous bonds.

174
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:40.310
So human society seems to have by and large a strong underlying tone of monogamy

175
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.460
or some sort of longterm commitment to a partner to help rear these vulnerable

176
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:51.810
offspring.
Uh,
this is in contrast to Banabos,
uh,
for example,

177
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.160
who are monkeys who like to have sex often and with many other monkeys.

178
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.980
And they often do this to resolve conflict.
Um,

179
00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:01.800
so I often joke with my students that it seems like everyone would love to be a

180
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:04.590
Bonobo.
They're often thought of as a hippie of monkeys,

181
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.500
but for humans that seems that's often less the case.

182
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.860
Maybe for the most part that at least for rearing offspring,

183
00:11:10.861 --> 00:11:13.020
these monogamous bonds are really important.

184
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:17.580
And so we want to have emotions built in us that enabled us to be connected in a

185
00:11:17.581 --> 00:11:22.440
longterm way to a partner to help care and sort of rear these offspring.

186
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:24.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

187
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.830
<v 0>The third property is what's thought of as the emergence of caring and</v>

188
00:11:27.831 --> 00:11:31.040
compassion.
So here,
uh,

189
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.810
jet diamond and others have written about the emergence of caring among humans.

190
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.550
So part of this is due to the fact that hominids,
uh,
began to live longer.

191
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.060
So there were older people who also required caring.

192
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.330
And this has been found among early cro-magnon records.

193
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.960
So it's both the existence of vulnerable offspring,

194
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.590
infants and young children as well as older people,
um,

195
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:59.260
who have led to societies where it's really important to take care of others who

196
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:01.630
are vulnerable.
And so these emotions,
again,

197
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:06.520
of caring for others and having compassion is a vital part of our early origins.

198
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.370
The fourth property is what's often referred to as the flattening of social

199
00:12:14.371 --> 00:12:16.170
hierarchies.
So here,

200
00:12:16.171 --> 00:12:20.010
it's really interesting because research is actually suggested that the social

201
00:12:20.011 --> 00:12:24.090
hierarchy in hunter gatherer societies are actually fairly egalitarian.

202
00:12:24.091 --> 00:12:29.091
So we see hominids you had groups of 75 to a hundred individuals within a given

203
00:12:29.911 --> 00:12:34.440
group.
And we're very,
uh,
sort of egalitarian in the sense.
So,
uh,
again,

204
00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:38.340
Jed diamond here has argued that it's not until more recently within the sort of

205
00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.450
advent of agriculture,
um,

206
00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:44.580
this sort of excess production of food we see in modern day society that has led

207
00:12:44.581 --> 00:12:48.990
us away from what he would say are more egalitarian roots and in these

208
00:12:48.991 --> 00:12:53.550
egalitarian roots,
as we'll talk about in our sort of last property here,

209
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.510
it's really important that we sort of act collectively or work together.

210
00:12:57.511 --> 00:13:00.690
There's this,
what it says here need for collective action.

211
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:06.210
So as a result of living in these large and egalitarianism groups,
uh,

212
00:13:06.211 --> 00:13:10.590
central and important part of society includes a need to cooperate with others.

213
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.020
Paul Ekman,
who we spoke about earlier,

214
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.030
noted that in his journeys to the preindustrial society of New Guinea,
um,

215
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.500
in this cultural tribe,

216
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:24.530
you constantly see individuals engage in collective behavior and sharing tasks.

217
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.620
So it seems to be an important part of our evolutionary roots.

218
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.160
So as you can see,

219
00:13:32.161 --> 00:13:37.161
the EA has many properties that seem to give rise to social emotions ranging

220
00:13:37.201 --> 00:13:41.430
from compassion and love to cooperative behaviors and feelings.

221
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.110
So at our core it seems that we're a highly social and cooperative society and

222
00:13:46.111 --> 00:13:50.050
have many emotions that help foster these kinds of feelings.
Um,

223
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.480
and in some the EEA also resulted in certain selection pressures that favorite

224
00:13:54.481 --> 00:13:55.980
certain genes more than others,

225
00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:01.220
and that these genes drive which emotions become adaptive and universal across

226
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:02.790
all human beings.

227
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.840
So now we're going to turn to an evolutionary approach.

228
00:14:07.841 --> 00:14:09.370
And here you might wonder,
well,

229
00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:12.790
what is an evolutionary approach in the first place to understanding human

230
00:14:12.791 --> 00:14:13.624
emotion?

231
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:19.050
What are the key concepts to grasp as we start to apply these theories of man

232
00:14:19.331 --> 00:14:23.710
and how he evolved over time to our present day emotions,

233
00:14:23.711 --> 00:14:26.890
these things that seems so intimate and so familiar to us.

234
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.450
What do we need to know?

235
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.533
<v 1>So</v>

236
00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.190
<v 0>here,
one of,
um,</v>

237
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:38.420
the kind of five big ideas behind an evolutionary approach to grasp is the first

238
00:14:39.301 --> 00:14:42.030
here you can see at the top gene replication.

239
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.930
So we're designed to replicate not ourselves as individuals,

240
00:14:45.931 --> 00:14:50.931
but our genes and our genes form us as biochemical and physiological processes

241
00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:54.320
underlying the basis of our behavior.

242
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:59.650
And evolution operates on jeans with the focus of seeing genes make it to the

243
00:15:00.321 --> 00:15:02.420
next generation over time.

244
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

245
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:10.550
<v 0>Second is this idea of selection pressures.</v>

246
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.280
So this is something that Darwin first articulated.

247
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.230
He said that natural selection focuses us,
um,

248
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.190
in a way on how certain environmental factors or events may either increase or

249
00:15:22.191 --> 00:15:25.760
decrease the likelihood of gene replication.
Right?

250
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.840
And so this is the idea of the selection pressures that either pushed towards or

251
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:34.310
pull away the likelihood of certain genes getting propagated over time.

252
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.130
And um,

253
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.970
what's interesting when you think about selection pressures as he talked about

254
00:15:40.971 --> 00:15:44.450
sort of three categories to understand.
As you can see here at the bottom,

255
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.040
natural selection pressures,

256
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.100
sexual selection pressures and group selection pressures.

257
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:53.150
So natural selection pressures are forces that increase or decrease the

258
00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:56.180
likelihood you're going to survive to an age where you could reproduce.

259
00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.840
So these include things like how well do you avoid predators and disease?

260
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:03.380
How well are you able to acquire adequate nutrition,

261
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:05.540
sexual selection pressures?

262
00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:09.860
I'm referred to this idea that our genes only make it to the next generation if

263
00:16:09.861 --> 00:16:14.150
they convinced the individual to reproduce.
So these include both intrasexual,

264
00:16:14.151 --> 00:16:17.480
an intersexual selection,
pressures in trust,

265
00:16:17.481 --> 00:16:21.230
sexual pressures are those that are within the same sex.
So for example,

266
00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:23.810
males may compete with each other to gain status,

267
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.500
which in turn makes it easier to find females to reproduce with.

268
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:32.320
In terms sexual pressures are first example,
the way in which,
um,

269
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.650
choices exercise in finding mates.
So between female and male mates.

270
00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:41.640
So for example,
males with more material resources,
um,

271
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:45.410
are often preferred by females.
So evolutionary theory with state.

272
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.160
And then finally at the bottom are these groups selection pressures.

273
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.210
So this category is more controversial.
So here,

274
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:57.650
researchers have found that mammals who are more effective group members,

275
00:16:57.651 --> 00:16:59.780
so they're more cooperative,
they're more likable,

276
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.000
are actually more able to produce.

277
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.900
So this is controversial because it says that nicer people who are more

278
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:10.190
cooperative are more likely to have their jeans transmitted through time.

279
00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:17.320
So,
um,
researchers you can see here,
Lita cosmetics and John Tooby,

280
00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:20.450
a from UC Santa Barbara really sort of,
um,

281
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:24.940
are the pioneers that you can think of and this evolutionary approach to motion.

282
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:30.240
So they focus on our a environment in order to better understand our emotional

283
00:17:30.671 --> 00:17:33.010
origins.
Um,
and as described earlier,

284
00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:38.011
the EA is a Savannah hunter gatherer society with a strong social hierarchy.

285
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:43.330
So here you,
these two researchers who will speak with in our expert interview,

286
00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.950
uh,
focused on an environment in which people evolved to understand emotional

287
00:17:47.951 --> 00:17:50.790
origins.
And they would say here,

288
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:56.300
emotion is the statistical composite of selection pressures that cause the genes

289
00:17:56.461 --> 00:18:01.080
underlying the design of an adaptation to increase in frequency until they

290
00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:04.530
became species typical or stable.
Persistent.

291
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.990
So another words,

292
00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:11.550
they really thought of emotions as these hardwired what they called programs or

293
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:12.384
modules.

294
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.490
So here the mind is supposed to be composed of a variety of these mini modules

295
00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:21.900
or programs which help us solve these recurring evolutionary issues.

296
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.650
And these programs that are built into our mind get either turned on or

297
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:30.210
triggered,
uh,
or turned off by certain solicitors in our environment.

298
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.600
So they often use the example of the snake,
as you can see here.

299
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.710
So the snake is really this kind of illicit or in the environment that sort of

300
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:42.150
switches on or turns on our fear program in our brain.

301
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.450
And from that comes a cascade of an experience of fear,

302
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.710
that behavior to sort of flee,
um,
and heightened physiological arousal.

303
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:53.190
So it's that we have this module in our mind and the snake just flips that

304
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:55.680
module on.
And that's our module of fear.

305
00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:57.930
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

306
00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.920
<v 0>So we're going to conclude today with our takeaway questions.
And here,</v>

307
00:19:01.921 --> 00:19:05.310
think about what are the key concepts to grasp when we think about an

308
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:09.390
evolutionary approach and begin to start to think about how it applies to

309
00:19:09.391 --> 00:19:10.224
emotion.

310
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:15.670
So our takeaway questions are three as usual,

311
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.360
and they go as follows.
So the first ass,

312
00:19:19.361 --> 00:19:24.250
what are Darwin's three principals on the origin of emotions?

313
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.750
<v 1>Okay,</v>

314
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:30.750
<v 0>what are the main properties of the EEA and how do they give rise to certain</v>

315
00:19:31.961 --> 00:19:35.320
human emotions?
Finally,

316
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:40.710
how would you summarize to be in cause NEIdeas evolutionary approach to emotion?

317
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:48.720
And we conclude with a very exciting expert interview as part of our experts in

318
00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:50.190
emotion interview series.

319
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:52.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

320
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.900
<v 0>Today,
uh,
for our experts in emotion interview,</v>

321
00:19:54.901 --> 00:19:56.850
we have the honor of speaking with doctors,

322
00:19:56.851 --> 00:20:01.320
Lita cosmetics and John tooby together who will help us answer the question of

323
00:20:01.321 --> 00:20:06.321
whether and how emotions are products of our evolutionary history or our

324
00:20:06.631 --> 00:20:08.940
emotions evolutionarily evolved.

325
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:13.680
So doctor [inaudible] and two B are well known for their work in pioneering the

326
00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:15.690
field of evolutionary psychology.

327
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:20.790
They're both professors of psychology and anthropology at Uc Santa Barbara where

328
00:20:20.791 --> 00:20:23.610
they code direct the center for evolutionary psychology.

329
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:27.750
They began their collaboration 29 years ago at Harvard University as

330
00:20:27.751 --> 00:20:31.260
undergraduates,
and have received since then,
numerous awards,

331
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.050
including the NIH director's pioneer award,

332
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.220
the American Association for the Advancement of Science Prize for Behavioral

333
00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.280
Research,
American psychological associations,
early career award,
um,

334
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.900
the national science science foundations,
presidential young investigator award,

335
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:46.883
and Guggenheim.

336
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:52.770
So I now turn to a very special one of a kind duo experts and emotion interview

337
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.280
together with Dr Lita Cosmetics and Dr John tooby.

338
00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

339
00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:01.310
<v 0>And so thank you for another great class.</v>

340
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:09.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>
