00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.720
Today we'll be speaking with doctor heady Cobar on craving and mindfulness,

2
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.110
Dr. Cobras and assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the Yale

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.100
University School of Medicine as well as the director of the clinical and

4
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:18.060
affective neuroscience lab and director of research at the Yale therapeutic

5
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:21.600
neuroscience clinic.
Doctor Cobras interest,
um,

6
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.920
are focused on using a multilevel approach to understand the use of cognitive

7
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:27.690
strategies to regulate emotion.

8
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.650
She's used both behavioral and neuro imaging tools to better understand the

9
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:35.790
psychological and biological mechanisms that underlie processes related to

10
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:37.350
emotion craving,

11
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.580
the cog cognitive regulation of emotion and craving in both healthy adults as

12
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:43.290
well as psychiatric populations.

13
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.210
Dr Cobra has received several honors including the National Institute of Drug

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.390
Abuse Women and Gender Travel Award,
the National Institute of Drug Abuse,

15
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:56.391
early career investigator travel award and the Yale Center for Clinical

16
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.080
Investigation Scholar Award.

17
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.450
Her work has also been mentioned in the popular media,

18
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:04.620
including outlets such as CNN,
ABC News,
La Times,

19
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.480
and US news and world report.

20
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.530
So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Doctor Heady Cobar.

21
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.710
So one of the things that I wanted to start out by asking you,

22
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:17.520
it's just a little bit about your journey into the world of emotion as it

23
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:19.650
relates to the craving and mindfulness.

24
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.360
Really kind of what got me interested in this in the first place.

25
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.063
Uh,

26
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.510
my graduate advisor at Columbia used to say that there's no such thing as

27
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:30.620
research.
It's all me search.

28
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:34.820
So everybody ends up starting their own kind of concerns and I certainly have

29
00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:37.910
emotions.
So that's definitely one good point of entry.
Um,

30
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.360
but I think more than that I'm,
I crave a lot of things.
And I think,
uh,

31
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.250
since when I was very little girl,
uh,

32
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.840
wanting more of stuff was a very prominent in my experience.
And,
uh,

33
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.350
that is certainly one part of the equation.

34
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.180
So having feelings and wanting things.
Yeah,
some of the basic blocks of human,

35
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.510
you know,
life.
Exactly.
And,
and,
and the fact that,
you know,

36
00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:01.130
to be a productive adult in society,

37
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:05.270
you need to know how to regulate all of these emotions and craving as they come

38
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:08.660
up.
You can't just make,
you know,
the rolling stones said it very,
very well.

39
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:13.460
You can't always get what you want to learn how to deal with it.
I mean,

40
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.020
what's really neat and I agree,
the research to me search,

41
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:18.890
I mean in many ways that makes so much sense and it's what gets us,

42
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.700
gets us inspired to study the things that we devote our life towards.
Right?

43
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.650
And so you had this early interest in craving and,
and feeling.
And since then,

44
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:31.250
I mean you've really established an amazing research program for the second all

45
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:34.820
of these things and very cone.
Yeah.

46
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.910
Well I want to ask you a little bit about,
cause I think it's really exciting.
Um,

47
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.290
and I think a lot of people out there,

48
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:41.120
I'd love to hear you share your thoughts on it.

49
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:45.830
So I mean you've really delved into the scientific study of craving,
right?

50
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.340
And you've really looked at this phenomena,
you know,
uh,

51
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.970
that we experience in everyday life and that can range from craving food to you

52
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:54.680
looked at craving for cigarettes.

53
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.640
And I wondered if you could first just say a bit about what you think craving is

54
00:02:58.641 --> 00:02:59.474
in the first,

55
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.820
and then does it differ when we're craving like a really awesome piece of,

56
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:07.120
you know,
cake versus like craving a cigarette if were a smoker?

57
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.160
That's a really good question.
So craving is,
first of all,

58
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:15.320
I certainly defined at least part of it as an emotion,
but I think,
uh,

59
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.260
in the world of the people who study craving,

60
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:20.410
people usually think about it as a construct that has a few different pieces to

61
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:22.780
it.
One part is definitely the affect,
the emotion,

62
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:26.170
that feeling of wanting that almost anybody can identify,
right?

63
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:27.700
Like late at night,
you're just like,
ah,

64
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:31.960
your body maybe gets a little contracted and you want something.
Um,

65
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.060
maybe when you see a commercial on TV,
right?

66
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:36.970
And there's like this really nice ice cream and you're just,
oh,

67
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:40.510
that looks so good.
So that's a part of feeling.
Uh,
but with that,

68
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:44.050
there's also a cognitive component.
So the thoughts that go along with it,

69
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:46.480
if I have this ice cream,
I'm gonna feel better.
If I don't have it,

70
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.550
I'm going to feel worse.
It's going to be really good.

71
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:50.530
So you have expectancies about it.
Um,

72
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.110
but I think one of the most important parts is the motivational part,

73
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.440
which is the impetus to kind of act on these thoughts and feelings and get up

74
00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:59.890
and actually go and do it.
And when we think about craving,
uh,

75
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.830
scientifically we need to understand all three parts,

76
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:05.980
although some of them might be easier to measure than others.
Um,

77
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.090
then you were sort of alluding to the fact that it may or may not be similar to

78
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:13.300
crave something like an awesome piece of cake relative to,
you know,

79
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:17.890
maybe a drug user who wants to,
um,
you know,
smoke crack.
Um,

80
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.990
and,
uh,
we've now run these kinds of experiments with,

81
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.430
um,
individuals who smoke cigarettes,
who,
you know,

82
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.860
normal individuals who eat food.

83
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:30.400
We're now working with individuals who are morbidly obese,
um,

84
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.220
showing them kind of pictures of food and measuring their craving.

85
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.330
We've worked with crack cocaine users,
uh,
who are also sometimes heroin users.

86
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.200
So there's really an individuals who abuse,
um,
methamphetamines or crystal meth.

87
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.940
And so we really are looking at it across different kinds of modalities and

88
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:49.810
different kinds of items that people might crave.
And we find two things.

89
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.360
The first is that to some degree,
uh,

90
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.270
even within the same individual craving for food,
for example,

91
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:58.410
for a cigarette smoker and craving cigarettes,
uh,

92
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.500
feels the same to them and typically the differences a matter of degree.

93
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:06.200
So they just crave the cigarettes and much more intensely typically.
Um,

94
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.020
the second thing is when we look at brain activity,
um,

95
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.330
it looks like both kinds of craving really tap into the same neural systems.

96
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:16.930
Are the same neural systems instantiate the same craving for food and the

97
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:20.380
craving for a cigarette?
And again,
maybe it's a matter of degree.
Um,

98
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.270
the thing that's also interesting is we recently tried to summarize all the data

99
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:29.020
across all the studies of craving,
uh,
specifically,
um,
imaging.

100
00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:33.700
So fmri studies of craving across this is now 50 something studies between let's

101
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:37.030
say 1996 and 2010.
And it looks like,

102
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:39.520
and this is for drugs and it looks like across all the different drugs,

103
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.890
there are some regions that are really common.

104
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.120
So some regions that craving for heroin and a heroin user craving for cigarettes

105
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:50.170
and a cigarette smoker craving for um,
uh,
you know,

106
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:53.290
cocaine and a cocaine user.
They all overlap.

107
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.190
We haven't done that study yet,
but maybe,
um,
so all of them,

108
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.120
they really recruit some shared set of,
of,
uh,
of regions in the brain.

109
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.010
But there are also some regions that are unique.

110
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:06.080
And I think that one of the challenges that we're going to have is try to

111
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:08.900
understand why is it that some regions are the same and those are probably

112
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:11.750
regions that are associated with learning and regions that are associated with,

113
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.600
uh,
kind of the experience of reward that people get from these things.
Um,

114
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.560
and then some regions that are distinct and what are those about and what,

115
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.030
what do they contribute to,

116
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.520
let's say cigarette craving separately from food craving.

117
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.070
And we don't know the answers to that yet.
See,
I mean,

118
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.490
what's really neat about this is you've not only taken kind of a qualitative

119
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:31.930
approach,
but you've really gone in and looked at the neural mechanisms.
Um,

120
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.830
you're talking about the work that you've done in this,
you know,

121
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:37.280
broader kind of Meta analysis across numerous studies and what,

122
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:40.940
what are these brand new agents that are common across different types of,

123
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:45.080
you know,
craved substances or foods or,
you know,
different,

124
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:48.710
different kinds of things.
Do we know at this point what those regions are?

125
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.120
So one region that seems to come up again and again across different studies of

126
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:53.481
craving,

127
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:56.660
both in our data in and this met analysis that really is kind of consistently

128
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:59.630
active during craving across many,
many different studies,
many,

129
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:03.230
many different kinds of drugs is the ventral striatum and the ventral striatum

130
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.970
is a region.
Um,
it's,
uh,
kind of in the inner part of the brain.

131
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:12.410
So it's not in the Cortex,
not in the kind of newer part of the brain.
Um,
so,

132
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.890
and it means that it's a part that's kind of fairly conserved from animals and

133
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:17.360
animals have it and we have it.

134
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.280
And we see it also in animal studies when they kind of pursue drugs.

135
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.360
Um,
and when they pursue food,
uh,
we see that it's also involved in that.

136
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:29.540
And we think that part of the reason why it's involved in craving is because it

137
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:33.840
expresses,
um,
that part of the learning.
Like,

138
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.780
we know that this is going to be good.

139
00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:38.670
We want that because we've had experience with before.
Uh,

140
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.510
you've probably noticed even in your own life that you rarely crave things that

141
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:44.120
you've never tried.
All right?
Like you might be curious about them,

142
00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:47.180
but typically the things that we really kind of come to want or things that we

143
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:51.100
had before and were really awesome.
And so the idea is that,
um,

144
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.380
with time we learned that these things are really good and that part of that

145
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:57.800
learning is expressed through some function in the ventral striatum and some we

146
00:07:57.801 --> 00:08:02.360
think,
uh,
through the action of a neurotransmitter called dopamine.
Um,

147
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.870
another region that is typically involved is the orbital frontal cortex.

148
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.870
And people have argued that what it does is really,
um,
compute maybe,
uh,

149
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.020
the value of this item to us.

150
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.440
The thing that's really interesting is that we see these regions and people

151
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.380
crave,
let's say chocolate or they crave drugs.

152
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.340
But the way that we get them to crave it as we show them pictures either of

153
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:23.360
let's say for cigarette smokers,

154
00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:26.580
we show them pictures of cigarettes or other people smoking.
Um,

155
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.800
and for food we do the same thing that is at the heart of food commercials,

156
00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:33.830
right?
It's like you see the picture of the ice cream and you go,
ah,
I want that.

157
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.800
I want to put that in my mouth right now.
And so this is how we do it.

158
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:38.360
And so would that suggest,

159
00:08:38.361 --> 00:08:41.840
is that craving really arises even at the prospect of having it?

160
00:08:41.841 --> 00:08:45.740
Like we learned that seeing ice cream is related to ice cream.
Um,

161
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.940
and that's again,
potentially a reason why some of these regions get activated.

162
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:51.140
I mean,

163
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.050
it's interesting and I know sometimes in some of the conversations that you'd

164
00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:55.440
have before,
you know,

165
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:58.950
you can think about sometimes how craving goes too far and we need to find ways

166
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:01.260
to sort of harness or,
or reign it in.

167
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.090
And so another line of Europe has really looked at the regulation of,
of craving,

168
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.950
um,
and the neural mechanisms that may underlie our ability to sort of reign in

169
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:14.910
those cravings and bring them to levels that are more sort of adaptive for us in

170
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:17.070
our everyday life.
And I'm just curious,

171
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:20.280
you could say a little bit about your work there and to what extent is trying to

172
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:23.430
regulate craving different from some of the work we know that's out there that

173
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:26.010
looks at how we try to control or you know,

174
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:30.210
harness just feeling states like feeling happy or sad or angry.

175
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.700
Is it something really different when it comes to cravings?

176
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:33.830
That's a really good question.

177
00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:38.300
So I think that in general I anchor thinking about regulation of craving and a

178
00:09:38.301 --> 00:09:42.890
greater construct of self control.
So being able to control your thoughts,

179
00:09:42.891 --> 00:09:45.870
your feelings,
your behavior,
all of these,
I think,
uh,

180
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:51.080
or probably part of a,
a larger ability that probably has maybe some parts.

181
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:55.040
Um,
and under regulating emotion there's negative emotion like sadness,
anger,

182
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.340
you know,
other disgust.

183
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.940
And then there's the appetitive are more positive emotions,

184
00:09:58.941 --> 00:10:01.240
like craving being one of them.
Um,

185
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.850
however often the intuitive sense that people have when they think about self

186
00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:07.310
control are regulating themselves and delaying gratification.

187
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.310
It's in the context of these things that we want that are not really good for
us.

188
00:10:10.311 --> 00:10:12.950
Right?
Like the classic examples are always,
you know,

189
00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:15.800
are you going to have the cookie now or two cookies later from the Walter

190
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.510
Michelle experiments?
Um,
right.
Um,

191
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.360
and uh,
and so I think that first of all,

192
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.630
it is important to anchor regulation of craving is one part of this,

193
00:10:26.631 --> 00:10:29.380
but it's almost like the canonical kind,
right?
Um,

194
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:33.620
the canonical kind of self control.
In my research,
what we've tried to,
to show,

195
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.630
uh,
well there are a few things,
but one thing that we tried to show is that,
um,

196
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.620
uh,

197
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.550
there are a kind of parts of the brain that we know are involved in self control

198
00:10:43.551 --> 00:10:44.910
more generally.
Um,

199
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.360
and one suggestion has been for people who are studying addiction,
uh,

200
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.660
that people who let's say are cigarette smokers,

201
00:10:50.661 --> 00:10:54.050
they're just unable to recruit these brain regions and regulate their craving,

202
00:10:54.051 --> 00:10:56.750
that it's just completely uncontrollable.
And cigarette smokers,

203
00:10:56.751 --> 00:10:58.820
there's just one example of people who say it's really,

204
00:10:58.821 --> 00:11:01.280
really hard for them to quit.
And the data actually suggests that it's very,

205
00:11:01.281 --> 00:11:05.150
very hard to quit.
But you know,
uh,
certainly there's a,
in the media,

206
00:11:05.151 --> 00:11:06.800
this idea of like,
um,

207
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.360
crystal meth users as being these crazy fans who can't stop.
And,
you know,

208
00:11:11.361 --> 00:11:15.170
certainly crack cocaine had its heyday of beating considered to be this crazy

209
00:11:15.171 --> 00:11:17.720
drug that people use.
Um,
and we really wanted to know,

210
00:11:17.721 --> 00:11:19.220
can they really regulate their craving?

211
00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:23.030
We had this clinical data that suggested that when they undergo,
um,
you know,

212
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.710
eight or six weeks of,
uh,
16 weeks of,
uh,
cognitive behavioral treatment,

213
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.160
more prolonged treatment that has a component on regulation of craving,

214
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:32.300
that something changes,

215
00:11:32.301 --> 00:11:35.870
that they learn some skills and then they're better able to stop their drug use.

216
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.920
And we also had this idea that this occurs to some kind of biological mechanism.

217
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:44.900
You know,
and um,
so we,
we looked at the brain and we,
we looked at,

218
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.990
we recruited first and our first set of studies,
a cigarette smokers.

219
00:11:47.991 --> 00:11:51.170
But we've now done this with,
um,
for example,
crack cocaine users.

220
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.820
And we trained them to use very simple strategies to regulate their craving.

221
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:59.410
And so I'm the kind of first and most basic strategy that we tried is to ask

222
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:00.610
them to look,

223
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:03.700
let's say it's someone else smoking when they feel craving or look at this kind

224
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:06.550
of luscious chocolate cake and just think to themselves,

225
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:10.120
what are all the reasons that I have not to eat this cake right now or not to

226
00:12:10.121 --> 00:12:10.954
smoke this cigarette?

227
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.960
What are the negative consequences that could arise if I actually engaged in

228
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:17.830
this behavior?
And what we found,
um,
first is that when people did this,

229
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.240
they reported much less craving.
So they were really able to,
um,
and,

230
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.400
and the same with crack cocaine.
Even when they were feeling the craving.

231
00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:26.840
They really want it to smoke their crack.
Um,

232
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:30.220
if they really thought about the longterm consequences in that moment,
whoa.

233
00:12:30.221 --> 00:12:33.370
They suddenly said,
you know what?
I actually,
you know,
I don't crave it a five.

234
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:34.970
I created a three.
Um,

235
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.200
the second thing that we were able to show is that they were able to recruit

236
00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:43.201
these brain regions and systems really that are involved in self control in

237
00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:45.160
general and an emotion regulation in general,

238
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.880
but in the context of regulating craving when they recruited,
uh,
when were,

239
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:51.460
they showed greater activity in these regions including let's say the

240
00:12:51.461 --> 00:12:52.630
Dorsolateral prefrontal Cortex,

241
00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:55.330
which is the parts of the brain that are right here.
Um,

242
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.390
they also showed reduced activity in these regions that we know are involved in

243
00:12:58.391 --> 00:13:02.350
craving.
So they were actually able to not only manipulate how they were feeling,

244
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.240
but also manipulate the way that their brain works so that it was,
um,
showing a,

245
00:13:06.241 --> 00:13:10.300
a reduced neural activity in these regions that give rise to craving.
Gosh,

246
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:11.290
that's so fascinating.

247
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:15.190
And I know you've taken this work to look at regulation of craving towards a

248
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:17.440
strategy that I know is something near and dear to your heart,

249
00:13:17.441 --> 00:13:18.610
which is mindfulness.

250
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.270
And it's really interesting to think about the powerful role of mindfulness that

251
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:26.620
it can play,
not just in sort of everyday life.
Um,
you know,
instances,

252
00:13:26.621 --> 00:13:30.970
people think about decreasing stress or worry that can also help us manage our

253
00:13:30.971 --> 00:13:31.804
craving.

254
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.290
And so I wonder if you could first maybe tell us a bit about what mindfulness is

255
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:36.880
for those who don't know.
Um,

256
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.180
and also some of the promise you think and your work is showing that it might

257
00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:43.420
actually help us manage cravings and you know,
Gosh,

258
00:13:43.421 --> 00:13:46.840
like our abuse of substances as well.
Something that,
like you said,

259
00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:51.130
is so hard to control.
So what is mindfulness?

260
00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:54.550
So mindfulness,
uh,
one of the classic ways to define it as,

261
00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:58.120
as a two component construct,
the first is a component of attention.

262
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.450
So your attention is directed as a state to the present moment.

263
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.320
Whatever is happening right now.
So,
um,
for example,

264
00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:08.300
to the feeling of your back on the chair,
your feeling of your,
uh,

265
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.980
kind of the weight coming down on the chair,
maybe your foot on the floor,

266
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:16.030
you can wiggle your toes and try to feel what that feels like.

267
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.970
So really an attention that's kind of concentrated on whatever the present

268
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:20.920
moment experience,
uh,
is.

269
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.890
And the second part is the attitude that you have as you're paying attention.

270
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.210
And that attitude is kind of curious and open and accepting.
Um,

271
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.420
and it's kind of like asking yourself the question,
can you be okay with this?

272
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.080
Whatever it is,
can you just be okay with us?
Can you let this be whatever it is?

273
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.260
And of course,
often people hear this and they say,
well,
you know,

274
00:14:38.261 --> 00:14:40.930
sometimes like horrible things happen in the world and it's true,

275
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:45.550
but the question is,
does it ever help to really get upset about it?
Right?
Um,

276
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.430
and so really it's just a,

277
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.530
an attitude that tries to be to let things be exactly as they are.
Um,

278
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.650
and the result of this is typically a reduced reactivity.

279
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:57.980
And some people think of this as like the third component of not reacting to

280
00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:00.560
whatever it is in the context of,
uh,
of craving.

281
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:03.620
The way that we've looked at this,
um,
is really in a few different directions.

282
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:07.490
One is in the context of regulating craving in the moment.
So,
uh,
again,

283
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:08.630
in these experiments we show people,

284
00:15:08.631 --> 00:15:11.960
let's say pictures of food or pictures of cigarettes.
We,
uh,
we,
you know,

285
00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:14.060
they feel craving for these things.
And then we say,

286
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.630
can you just let the feeling be,
can you notice that it's happening?

287
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.110
But just see if you can be okay with it exactly as it is.
Um,

288
00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:23.540
so they're not thinking about the longterm negative consequences are really

289
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:24.410
doing something different.

290
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:29.150
Almost like taking a step back and just seeing if it can,
uh,
let it be because,

291
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:29.901
uh,

292
00:15:29.901 --> 00:15:33.020
one of the findings that have already been out there is that craving and a lot

293
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:35.030
of emotions in general been like a wave.

294
00:15:35.031 --> 00:15:37.820
So they start and they rise and the reach some kind of peak.

295
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.970
But even if you don't really do anything,
they kind of calm down naturally.

296
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:45.170
And so one part is knowing that and just letting it be and maybe see if it kind

297
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:47.510
of comes down.
Actually.
Um,

298
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:53.060
what we found now in a few studies is that I'm doing this,

299
00:15:53.061 --> 00:15:56.120
assuming this kind of stance in the moment,
um,

300
00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.170
is really associated with reduced craving.

301
00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.470
So it doesn't work exactly the same for everybody.

302
00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:03.650
Some people really need much more training than just the short training that we

303
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:05.030
give him that given these experiments.

304
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.570
But for a lot of people just knowing that they can just be okay with it and not

305
00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:10.880
really engage and not really a kind of,

306
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.730
not really go into the craving and not really push it away.

307
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:18.470
Just being with it actually helps them feel less craving.
Um,
in a,
in a study,

308
00:16:18.471 --> 00:16:19.830
in a collaboration with,
um,

309
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.790
some of my colleagues at University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon,

310
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.790
we've also shown that when individuals do this,
again in a,

311
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:27.260
in a context of an FMRI experiment,

312
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.530
they all show also show reduced activity in these brain regions that we know are

313
00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:35.170
associated with craving.
So just kind of assuming that,
um,
attitude,
uh,

314
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.750
in the moment is really associated with both reduced reports and reduced brain

315
00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:40.280
activity that's associated with craving.

316
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.090
But what we've also done by now is that we've looked at treatment studies for

317
00:16:44.091 --> 00:16:48.460
individuals who are cigarette smokers and,
um,
uh,
in the,

318
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.340
in this treatment study,

319
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:52.720
and this is in collaboration with some people here at Yale,
uh,
individuals,
uh,

320
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.880
were either assigned to randomly assigned to a treatment that was based on

321
00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:58.880
mindfulness or a treatment that was based on kind of cognitive behavioral

322
00:16:58.881 --> 00:17:02.560
principles.
And they learn to do this over eight,
eight,
eight,

323
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.280
eight meetings over four weeks.

324
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.940
And what we found is that individuals who learned how to kind of use these

325
00:17:07.941 --> 00:17:11.240
mindful space strategies in the context of quitting smoking,

326
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.480
we're actually a really quite successful,
even more successful,
uh,

327
00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:19.430
in our hands at least then the other,
um,
treatment,
uh,
in reducing their smoking.

328
00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.020
Well,
we also showed when we looked at their brain activity,
um,

329
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.100
after the treatment and we stress them out in the scanner.

330
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.170
So one of the things that are amazing about my cluster,

331
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.010
other people have shown is that,
um,
training in mindfulness over time,

332
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:34.640
so not just in the moment but really over time,
over sometimes for eight weeks,

333
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:39.500
uh,
is associated with reduced stress,
reduced anxiety,
um,
reduced depression.

334
00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:42.560
There's now studies that show that it's good for chronic pain.

335
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:43.940
So it helps people with a lot of,

336
00:17:43.941 --> 00:17:46.780
kind of both psychological and physical conditions.
Um,

337
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.950
in our study we stress people out.
We really want it to,

338
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.810
if they were less stressed after learning a mindfulness meditation,
um,

339
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.970
and it turned out that yes,

340
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.090
they were less stressed and they showed reduced brain activity in a region we

341
00:17:57.091 --> 00:18:00.930
call Amygdala,
which is,
um,
well people argue about what it might mean,

342
00:18:00.931 --> 00:18:04.260
but it certainly is associated with kind of tagging things in your environment

343
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:06.870
as potentially dangerous or,
um,

344
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.200
as requiring kind of extra tension being salient and important.

345
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.800
And these individuals,
even during stress showed reduced activity in that region.

346
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.340
And what was more is that those individuals who showed the least activity in

347
00:18:17.341 --> 00:18:20.830
that region,
we're the ones who were best at quitting or kind of smoke the,

348
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.150
the least amount of cigarettes even,
uh,
two months out.

349
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.410
And so that suggests that one of the things that,
um,

350
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.200
that it does except for reducing cravings,

351
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.750
also reducing people's individual experiences of stress and because stress,

352
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.290
sometimes it induces craving.
All of these things come together.

353
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.440
Beautiful Data and exciting directions you're going in right now.
Thank you.

354
00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.910
And as you think about some of these directions that your work is headed in and

355
00:18:44.911 --> 00:18:47.850
you sort of broadened the scope out to think about,
you know,
sort of the,

356
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.160
the future as a whole,
sort of,
where do you see it headed?
Kind of where,

357
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.080
where is this work going?
The emotion in general or my work or

358
00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:01.680
wherever you want to go.
Well,
I think for emotion,
one of the things that are,
um,

359
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.370
I'm excited about the kind of unfolding debate of,
uh,

360
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.970
our emotions constructed.
What are they,
how are they constructed,

361
00:19:08.971 --> 00:19:11.400
both in terms of experience and in the brain.
Um,

362
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.370
some people are still arguing that there is such things as basic emotions that

363
00:19:14.371 --> 00:19:18.900
everybody experiences.
And,
uh,
uh,
I certainly have an,

364
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:19.650
uh,

365
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:23.370
an educated opinion and this discussion and I'm looking forward to see where it

366
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:27.150
unfolds.
I think in the context of craving,
um,
we're really,
uh,

367
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.320
the challenges to face kind of some of the most serious,
uh,

368
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:35.880
public health problems that we have using this kind of knowledge.
So,
um,

369
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.570
substance use disorders are some of the most prevalent,
um,

370
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.310
psychiatric disorders that we have,
right?
And so,
um,

371
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:46.340
I think now it's 37% of people will at some point in their lives qualify for

372
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:50.940
this kind of diagnosis,
um,
in America.
And it's,
it's really quite serious.

373
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.740
And so first of all,
um,
using the insight that we have to do a few things.

374
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.311
First of all,

375
00:19:56.311 --> 00:19:59.520
with the knowledge that there is a biological way that kind of our psychological

376
00:19:59.521 --> 00:20:03.930
stance can reduce craving.
Um,
we can convince,
um,
uh,

377
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.300
people like the institute,
uh,

378
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.930
the National Institute of drug abuse to give us money to study these,
um,

379
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.440
biological mechanisms of psychological treatments for substance use disorders.

380
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:17.730
Another way that I,
that I think about it is that we can kind of ahead of time,

381
00:20:17.731 --> 00:20:21.630
use both the um,
uh,
both parts,

382
00:20:21.631 --> 00:20:25.680
both the people self report of how good strategies are for them and their brain

383
00:20:25.681 --> 00:20:29.190
data to maybe predict,
uh,
which treatment is better for them.

384
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.400
So one of the things that we're trying to see is if I bring you into my lab and

385
00:20:32.401 --> 00:20:36.660
I teach you let's say three strategies to control your craving for chocolate

386
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.980
and a,
and let's say what you're really,
really easily,
uh,

387
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.870
managing with one strategy and the other one,
it's not so effective for you.

388
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.480
If I really train you on this strategy that works for you really,
really well,

389
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.280
is that going to help you quit your chocolate habit that much more?
Um,

390
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.580
and so really try to see if we can kind of diagnose people ahead of time and

391
00:20:57.581 --> 00:21:01.370
then help them out,
uh,
to get better treatment using that knowledge.
Um,

392
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.640
and also of course to understand with treatment,

393
00:21:03.641 --> 00:21:06.070
and we have some pilot data on this already.
Um,

394
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.170
how much training do they really need?

395
00:21:08.171 --> 00:21:11.260
So we have now data that suggests that even half an hour of training just in

396
00:21:11.261 --> 00:21:13.960
regulation of craving helps people quit smoking,
smoking.

397
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.140
So people are even two weeks after they come to our lab,

398
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:20.590
they're smoking last if we train them in a,
in a,
in one of these strategies.

399
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.760
And so,
uh,

400
00:21:21.761 --> 00:21:25.030
now we're trying to kind of vary the dose can be really just give them,
you know,

401
00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:28.060
let's say a few days of training and really help them quit smoking and how much

402
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.470
more training do you need?
Um,

403
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:31.660
and this is a little bit different than putting them through,
you know,

404
00:21:31.661 --> 00:21:35.110
like one of those really much longer treatments.
Um,

405
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:40.240
another way to think about it is that we are trying to understand when people

406
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:44.200
undergo this training or undergo even kind of longer treatments and they get

407
00:21:44.201 --> 00:21:46.120
better at the end and they actually succeed,

408
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.950
what is it about their brain that changes?
Um,

409
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.940
and we have some data that suggests already that people who undergo cognitive

410
00:21:51.941 --> 00:21:55.330
behavioral treatment for this study was with cocaine users.

411
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.660
They actually show that the parts of their brain,

412
00:21:58.661 --> 00:22:01.420
like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex becomes more efficient.

413
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.320
So it actually becomes less active during a cracking of control task at the end

414
00:22:05.321 --> 00:22:06.730
of treatment compared to before.

415
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.450
And so how much more efficient can we make the brain and in kind of enacting

416
00:22:10.451 --> 00:22:11.290
these acts of control,

417
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:14.770
those are some of the questions that I'd like to continue asking in this context

418
00:22:14.771 --> 00:22:18.640
at least.
And so when you think about continuing to ask these questions,

419
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.330
and a lot of these questions will be answered by you,
but also students,
you know,

420
00:22:22.331 --> 00:22:25.570
we're going to be a big part of the future of where this field is headed.

421
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:26.871
You know,
what,

422
00:22:26.871 --> 00:22:30.070
what kinds of advice do you usually give to students are asking you,
you know,

423
00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:34.510
should I embark in this field of emotion?
What about craving?
What do you,

424
00:22:34.511 --> 00:22:36.850
what do you tell them?
Oh,
wow.
Um,

425
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.630
so I don't think anybody's ever asked me that quite so directly.
Um,

426
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.650
but if anybody did,

427
00:22:41.651 --> 00:22:44.680
I would certainly say that they need to study what they care about.

428
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:49.450
I find that for me,
um,
I think in academia in general,

429
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:53.740
people work very hard,
maybe here at Yale even extra more.
But,
um,

430
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:59.050
but I think that part of what fuels it for me is my personal curiosity and my

431
00:22:59.051 --> 00:23:02.560
commitment to making the world a better place and helping people who are

432
00:23:02.561 --> 00:23:05.000
suffering and people who have substance use disorders are suffering and,

433
00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:06.880
and even people who eat too much.
Right?

434
00:23:06.881 --> 00:23:10.750
So one of the other epidemics that are plaguing our society is obesity.

435
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:14.230
And if we can use some of the insights that we are garnering from learning about

436
00:23:14.231 --> 00:23:15.310
regulation of craving,
uh,

437
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.520
in the context of drug users to help individuals who are obese,

438
00:23:18.521 --> 00:23:20.440
who potentially have overeating issues,
um,

439
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.960
and even maybe people who are not obese,
who have over eating issues.

440
00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:25.990
And that's most people I know.
Um,
I think that would be exciting.

441
00:23:25.991 --> 00:23:30.670
And so trying to,
um,
follow your heart and do you care about,

442
00:23:30.671 --> 00:23:33.430
because answering the questions that you think need answering is usually what

443
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:38.590
gets you out of bed in the morning.
All excited.
Um,
and,
uh,

444
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.580
and I think that in general,
I read a paper recently by James Gross,
who I love,

445
00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:46.970
um,
and he specifically was talking the future of research on emotion regulation.

446
00:23:46.971 --> 00:23:50.600
He said,
the future is so bright,
you have to wear shades.
I think that's a,

447
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:55.130
that's a good,
a good note.
Well,
thank you so much for speaking today.

448
00:23:55.131 --> 00:23:57.350
Heddy thank you,
Jean,
for having me.

449
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:02.420
So this concludes our experts and emotion interview with Doctor Heady Cobra from

450
00:24:02.421 --> 00:24:04.790
Yale University.
Thanks again,
Heidi.
