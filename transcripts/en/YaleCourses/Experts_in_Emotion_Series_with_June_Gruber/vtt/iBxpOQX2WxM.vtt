00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.660
Our experts and emotion interview will be with Dr. Margaret Clark on emotions

2
00:00:04.661 --> 00:00:05.800
and relationships.

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.580
So Dr. Clark is a world renowned expert in close relationships,

4
00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:12.850
both friendships and romantic relationships and emotions,

5
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.840
and in particular the ways people experience and express emotions within

6
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:19.780
relationships among her various distinctions.

7
00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:23.470
Dr. Clark is one of the founders and former presidents of the society for

8
00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:25.510
personality and social psychologists.

9
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.130
She has countless books and publications and has received numerous awards and

10
00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:31.930
recognition of her accomplishments.

11
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.880
So I now turn to a very special experts in emotion interview with Dr. Margaret

12
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.830
Clark on emotions and relationships.

13
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.310
<v 1>So what I'd love to start out speaking with you a bit is just what got you</v>

14
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:48.450
interested in emotion in the first place?
Sort of how did it all start for you?

15
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.180
I can't say I was interested in emotion per se in the first place.

16
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.070
I think what I'm going to say is probably typical of a lot of researchers or

17
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.160
what happened was my first mentor research mentor happened to be interested in

18
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:06.990
emotions.
It was Alice Isen.
Um,
and so she invited me to get involved in research.

19
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.220
She was the one that decided it was on emotions.
I just went along for the ride.

20
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.350
Um,
so that had to do with how people's moods influenced their social behavior.

21
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.060
Um,
and then in reading the literature I got interested in it myself.

22
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.040
So kind of came across it serendipitously and Olay.
Absolutely.
Excellent.

23
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.181
And since then,

24
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:30.720
I mean you've really just pioneered a whole field of work trying to better

25
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:34.560
understand social relationships and the role that emotions might play.

26
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.340
So I'd love to just ask you a few questions about that.
Um,

27
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.580
so your current research has explored social emotions and I'd love for you to

28
00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:48.280
say just a little bit about what is the social function of emotions and what,

29
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.630
what our social emotions really?
Well,

30
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.670
I think all emotions are social.

31
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.700
So sometimes people call emotions like guilt and gratitude and hurt,

32
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.960
um,
social emotions.
But in fact,
I think all emotions serve social functions.

33
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:08.550
So I got interested in this because after my initial work on mood,

34
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.360
I got involved in doing research independently on relationships.

35
00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:17.280
And at some point I brought those interests together.
Um,
it's still the case,

36
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:21.570
I think in emotion research that people largely studied on an individual level.

37
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.620
They look at what causes emotion and a particular person,

38
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:30.120
how a particular person in isolation regulates their own emotions.

39
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.880
But emotions show on our face,

40
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.470
in our voices and in our postures for a reason.
I mean,

41
00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:41.120
if it was all individual,
they wouldn't have to show.
Um,

42
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.910
but they do show and I think they show because they serve an important social

43
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:46.320
functions.
And the,

44
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.600
the most obvious one to me is that they convey information about our needs to

45
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:54.990
other people.
Um,
so if we're fearful,

46
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.980
we need someone to comfort us or get rid of the fear producing,
uh,
thing.
Um,

47
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.190
even happiness I think conveys something about needs.

48
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.610
It conveys sometimes that we don't have a need or sometimes that whatever it is

49
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:13.210
our partner is doing is that's making us happy,
should be continued.

50
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.051
Um,

51
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:18.220
the absence of happiness and that situation can suggest that maybe they ought to

52
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:23.080
stop whatever they're doing.
Um,
sometimes it's,
it's,

53
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:27.190
it's actual negative emotion,
but it can be just the absence of happiness.
Um,

54
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:32.191
so I think they serve the function of conveying our needs and desires to other

55
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:33.920
people.
Um,

56
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.090
but there's a problem with that and that's the all so conveyor vulnerabilities.

57
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.440
So what I'm particularly interested in is the fact that people are selective,

58
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.980
um,
and to whom they'll express emotions.

59
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:51.550
You want to express emotions to someone that actually cares about your needs and

60
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:52.740
desires.
Um,

61
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.700
and you don't want to express emotion to someone who's going to take advantage

62
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.750
of that knowledge.
Someone who doesn't care about your needs and desires.

63
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.170
<v 0>It's that can be really sensitive,
like you're saying,</v>

64
00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:07.710
expressing emotions to other people.
Uh,
on the one hand,

65
00:04:07.711 --> 00:04:12.510
and then measuring that in the laboratory on the other.
So,

66
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.580
so how do we really get people to express these vulnerable emotions in a way

67
00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:19.740
that we can study it as scientists?
Sort of.

68
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.580
What are some of the challenges doing this as a researcher who studies social

69
00:04:23.581 --> 00:04:24.600
relationships?

70
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.550
<v 1>I actually think it's not so hard to get people to express emotion in the lab,</v>

71
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.270
but perhaps it should be.
Perhaps people would be wiser not to express it.

72
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.660
But if you want to look,
you know,

73
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.370
if you want to induce an emotion and get people to express it or you have to do

74
00:04:41.371 --> 00:04:45.870
is ask them to give an impromptu speech,
uh,
they'll express some emotion.

75
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:48.030
You'll see the nervousness.
Um,

76
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.410
people have done things like ask people to sing a silly song.
It,

77
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.710
it will make them embarrassed in no time and they'll blush.

78
00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.510
So it's not so hard to get people to express it in the lab.
Um,

79
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.990
and then you can look at,
uh,

80
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.190
differences in the degree to which they express it and differences in how people

81
00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:09.024
respond to them.

82
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.393
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

83
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.080
And it's interesting because you've really looked at relationships in the lab

84
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:18.130
and these fascinating ways and through this uncovered what seemed to be two

85
00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:20.110
different kinds of relationships,
right?

86
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.220
Which you referred to as exchange versus communal relationships.

87
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.790
And I wonder if you could just tell us a little bit about what some of the most

88
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:29.750
exciting discoveries have been,
you know,

89
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.440
in trying to tease apart these two relationship types.

90
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.880
<v 1>Well,
I've been studying for a long them for a long time.
And honestly,</v>

91
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:41.881
it was most interesting in the beginning when people didn't really believe in

92
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.050
communal relationships.

93
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:48.051
So I've always thought the communal relationships exist in their relationships

94
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:52.840
in which people feel responsible for one another's needs.
Um,

95
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.510
and they,
uh,

96
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.330
act in such ways as to support the welfare of one another.
Um,

97
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.460
they don't keep track of benefits.

98
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.030
And at the time I began the work,

99
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.230
the view was that people were fundamentally selfish.

100
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:13.940
They kept track of things,
they were very economically oriented.
Um,

101
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.650
and so initially finding evidence that not everybody behaved that way was

102
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:22.670
exciting.
Now I think that view is,
you know,
much more widely accepted.

103
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:26.210
It's a little less excited now.
So,
um,

104
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.810
but what I'm interested in now is a,

105
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.200
one of the implications of communal relationships for expressing and even

106
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:34.520
experiencing emotion.

107
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.900
So I said just a bit ago that you will,

108
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.910
emotions conveyed needs.

109
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:45.911
So it makes a lot of sense to convey them to people who actually care about your

110
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:47.720
needs.
And so you should,

111
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.210
you should have more emotion expressed in that those kinds of circumstances.

112
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:57.440
You actually want us naturally suppress it when you're around people who don't

113
00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:59.470
care about your needs.
Um,

114
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.840
and then includes people in what I,

115
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.390
I called exchange relationships where people feel no particular responsibility

116
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:09.980
for your needs,

117
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.300
but it's especially important when the person is actually your enemy or on the

118
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:19.301
other side of a negotiation or the person that you're playing poker with.

119
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:23.090
There's a reason why people talk about poker faces.

120
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:28.091
You're not supposed to express emotion in situations where other people can use

121
00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:31.910
that information to your detriment.

122
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.620
So it's almost as if these different kinds of social relationships determine how

123
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:38.930
much we're going to express our,
like you said,

124
00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:41.180
hold back and suppress slower feeling.

125
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.340
I think the evidence is very clear on that.
They do.
Um,

126
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.800
people express more emotion and communal relationships.
Um,
and uh,

127
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.560
I would argue that they also experience more emotion in communal relationships

128
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:55.790
for a number of reasons.

129
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.750
But one is that we know that expressing emotion,

130
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:01.640
talking about an emotional experience,

131
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:06.530
expressing it on your face and your posture,
uh,
elicits the emotion in you.

132
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.950
So I think it's not just that we express more emotion and communal.

133
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:15.580
I think that that also leads us to experience more emotionally communal

134
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.620
relationships.
And it also sounds like these relationships,

135
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:20.330
we might express emotions differently,

136
00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:24.290
experienced them differently and also we'll be differentially attuned to the

137
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:28.460
welfare of other people depending on whether in one of these two kinds of

138
00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:32.440
relationships.
Is that right?
That is right.
Um,

139
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.380
it's also the case that when people are willing to express emotion,

140
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.420
it appears to build these relationships.

141
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:43.870
So if I don't know you at all and I start to get to know you and I never express

142
00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:47.240
emotion,
um,

143
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:52.100
what I'm doing is not providing you with an opportunity to take care of my
needs.

144
00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:54.350
So I have to take a risk.
Um,

145
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.420
and it is a risk because you might be horrified when,
you know,

146
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:02.190
I express my sadness to you and you had no interest in responding to me and you

147
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:03.830
might run the other way.
Um,

148
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.580
but I think we do have to express emotion to find out who will be responsive to

149
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:12.300
our needs.
And we also have pretty good evidence that when you do that,

150
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.070
it builds relationships,
uh,
that expressing negative emotions,
nervousness,

151
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:18.640
anxiety,
uh,

152
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:24.080
in one study predicted how many friendships a college students formed in their

153
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:29.800
first semester at college and how much there,

154
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.580
how close they became to those people,

155
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:37.830
how much intimacy in terms of understanding,
validation and care,

156
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.460
um,
characterize those relationships.

157
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:44.550
And it also predicted how much support they're roommates gave them.

158
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.950
So if they express more negative emotion,
they got more help,
they became friends.

159
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:50.641
<v 0>Interesting.</v>

160
00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:54.930
So it sounds like it's really especially important to show negative emotions.

161
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:57.270
It's less about showing positive emotions,
right?

162
00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:01.080
In terms of getting people to feel close to you and want to support you.

163
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:03.720
Does that sound right?
Um,
no.

164
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.390
<v 1>Yeah,
completely.</v>

165
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.710
So you might think that it's all about negative emotion if you want to get

166
00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:12.880
someone to support you.
But I actually believe that pause,

167
00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.530
expressing positive motion is equally important.

168
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:20.480
So if I express happiness to another person,

169
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:25.730
um,
it does lots of things.
So if upon meeting you,
I express happiness,

170
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.620
that's probably the most common factor.

171
00:10:30.621 --> 00:10:32.360
Determining whether,
you know,
I like you,

172
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.290
if I'm happy to see you as opposed to looking the other way,

173
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.460
which sometimes happens in our,
in our interaction.
It does.

174
00:10:40.461 --> 00:10:44.270
So I think happiness is a queue.
You can take it as a cue that I like you.

175
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:48.950
I'm an established relationship is very important.
Um,

176
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.180
Q two when you should celebrate for the other person,

177
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.950
something great happens to me.
Um,
and I'm really enthusiastic.

178
00:10:57.951 --> 00:11:01.000
I just got the perfect job that I always wanted.
Um,

179
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.050
if I express it to you,

180
00:11:03.051 --> 00:11:08.000
you can engage in something Harry Reese called and also Shelly gable called

181
00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:12.860
capitalization.
You can celebrate for me.
How do you know when you should do it?

182
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.590
You would know you should do it.
If I'm happy,

183
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.000
you should be happy for me if you're happy for me.
That bill's relationships.

184
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:24.510
So I don't think it's just expressing negative mood that uh,

185
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.290
negative moods or fear or sadness,
anxiety,

186
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.930
that's important for you to provide support.

187
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:35.600
But expressing happiness is equally,
if not more important for you,

188
00:11:35.601 --> 00:11:36.470
providing support.

189
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.330
<v 0>So it's that balance of expressing sort of all facets of our emotional being.</v>

190
00:11:41.331 --> 00:11:43.640
In a way,
both the positive and the negative.

191
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:48.390
<v 1>Yes.
All facets.
Save a couple where you have to be careful.
Um,</v>

192
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:52.850
so to that you have to be very careful about our anger and disgust.

193
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.670
So if,
um,
something about you is,

194
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.540
is disgusting to me,
but I still want a relationship with you,

195
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:04.900
I probably should suppress that one.
Um,
Eh,

196
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.930
I probably should be able to control my anger.

197
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.170
In some recent research I did with Ed Lemay and Nicola overall,

198
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.850
we found that it's much better if you do something dreadful to me.

199
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:16.870
Um,

200
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.870
for relationship it's better to express hurt and anger hurts suggests that I

201
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:27.430
still have hope that you'll,
uh,
I'm unhappy with what you did,

202
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:31.720
but I still have hope you'll fix it.
Um,
if I'm angry,

203
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.210
that's more of a distancing emotion.

204
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:39.570
So I think the same things can produce hurt and anger in a person,

205
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.000
uh,
but expressing,

206
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.500
feeling and expressing curt is more constructive for a relationship.

207
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.970
Feeling and expressing anger is more likely to distance us from one another.

208
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:57.100
And do you ever think that one can express too much emotion,

209
00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:58.720
whether it's some of these more,

210
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.420
perhaps a socially bonding emotions or,

211
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:07.420
or anger and disgust as well?
Can you ever express too much?
Oh,
absolutely.

212
00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.380
Um,
so there are number of different circumstances.

213
00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:15.280
So one time I shouldn't be expressing too much sadness,
fear,

214
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.640
or whatever is when you have pressing needs.

215
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.120
So there's sometimes when I ought to suppress it,

216
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.160
not because you don't care about me,

217
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:26.310
not because I shouldn't turn to you for your help,
but,

218
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.700
but you have more pressing needs.
Um,

219
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.980
and then I should be paying attention to your emotions and perhaps suppressing

220
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:40.150
mine.
Uh,
another time you can express too much emotion,

221
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.110
um,
is,
uh,
if,

222
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.830
if you persist in expressing the s say sadness.

223
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:53.100
So you're trying like crazy to make me feel less sad and nothing you do can make

224
00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:57.310
me less sad at some point you're going to give up.

225
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.240
And so some people do that.
They,

226
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.720
they express a lot of hurt or a lot of sadness or a lot of anger and their

227
00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:11.630
partner,
nothing.
The partner does changes it and then it's bad.
Um,

228
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.400
there's also another case where you can express too much emotion.

229
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.700
And I think it's something people don't think about.
It's,

230
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:23.500
it's a special case of what I would call exploitation in communal relationships.

231
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:29.460
So it involves exaggerating how much I feel amplifying my emotion,

232
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:35.910
um,
to get you to take care of me when I really ought not be doing that.
I'm,

233
00:14:35.911 --> 00:14:37.240
I'm exaggerating it.

234
00:14:37.241 --> 00:14:42.241
And I think people do that very commonly in communal relationships and it's not

235
00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:48.760
good.
So I am so sad and down,

236
00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:53.690
I can't possibly wash those dishes.
You should do it.
Um,

237
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.140
partners sometimes fall for that.
Um,

238
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.080
but they also sometimes pick up on that and resent it.

239
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.610
So that's another case.
Where are you going to express too much emotion?

240
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.410
<v 0>In that case,
it sounds almost like it's inauthentic emotion,
right?</v>

241
00:15:08.411 --> 00:15:12.880
You're sort of overexaggerating it to extent that it could annoy your partner,

242
00:15:12.881 --> 00:15:15.340
upset then they might feel you're being manipulative.

243
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.680
<v 1>Right?
That's exactly what it is.</v>

244
00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.270
It's not uncommon and it's unique,
not unique,

245
00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:27.010
but it's much more common in communal relationships and the exchange because an

246
00:15:27.011 --> 00:15:30.370
exchange relationship,
if I'm said you're not responsible for it,

247
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:35.170
so it's not a good technique to manipulate you,
but in a communal relationship,

248
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.210
you're responsible for my sadness.
So I can take advantage of that.
I shouldn't,

249
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:41.860
it's bad for relationships,

250
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:46.960
but it's a uniquely communal kind of manipulation.

251
00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:48.243
<v 0>Fascinating.</v>

252
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.420
One of the thing that's always interested me in your work too is that in some

253
00:15:52.421 --> 00:15:56.980
relationships we keep track or tally certain favors or inputs.

254
00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:00.250
And I,
you know,
I'm sure people out there wonder,
you know,

255
00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:04.450
under what circumstances are and what relationships is that actually a good

256
00:16:04.451 --> 00:16:07.720
thing versus something that could really hurt the relationship to be keeping

257
00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:08.980
track of these things.

258
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.310
<v 1>There was one of the first things I looked at in relationships and it's a good</v>

259
00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:16.100
thing to do,
uh,
in business relationships.

260
00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:18.770
You really should keep track of your bills and you should pay them.

261
00:16:18.771 --> 00:16:21.470
And if you don't keep track of the other person will.

262
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:26.490
But in communal relationships,
it's suggests that,
um,
it's,

263
00:16:26.491 --> 00:16:28.130
it's bad for a number of reasons.

264
00:16:28.131 --> 00:16:33.131
One is that it suggests that the reason you're providing support for a partner

265
00:16:34.451 --> 00:16:36.760
is that you want something back.
Um,

266
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.790
and while that's fine in lots of kinds of relationships with partners,

267
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:45.230
really want and close relationships is for the reason you're giving them support

268
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:47.630
is that you actually care about them.
Um,

269
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:52.690
the other reason is it really bad is that it makes the QT giving a benefit is

270
00:16:54.171 --> 00:16:58.310
either that you've received one in the past and you need to repay it or you want

271
00:16:58.311 --> 00:17:02.740
something from the person in the future.
And,
uh,

272
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:07.160
that's interesting because,
uh,
if you're doing that,

273
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:12.200
the cue to providing support is not the other person's need or desire.

274
00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:17.270
Um,
and it's important that the cue to giving support is the other person's need.

275
00:17:17.271 --> 00:17:21.560
Desire.
Welfare doesn't mean these relationships are unselfish.

276
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.390
So I may form a relationship with you because I want a friend.

277
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.840
I want someone who'll be responsive to my needs.
That's pretty selfish.
Um,

278
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.980
but to get that kind of relationship,
there's a deal.

279
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.270
I have to be responsive to your needs,
watch out for your welfare.

280
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:43.330
And I can hope I can't require,
but I can hope that you'll,
uh,

281
00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.550
feel the same.
Um,
and that you'll respond to my needs.

282
00:17:46.551 --> 00:17:49.890
It may not all even out in the end.
Um,

283
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.880
but overall I think these kinds of relationships are beneficial to people.

284
00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:55.383
<v 0>Fascinating.</v>

285
00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:00.540
So when you think about relationships and how they play an important role in our

286
00:18:00.941 --> 00:18:04.990
emotional wellbeing and how emotions influenced the social relationships,

287
00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:10.030
where do you see the next steps or where do you see the future of this research

288
00:18:10.031 --> 00:18:10.864
headed?

289
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.143
<v 1>Well,</v>

290
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:17.330
every researcher is course by us to think the future should capture what they're

291
00:18:17.731 --> 00:18:19.740
interested in.
And I'm no exception to that.

292
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:25.260
So I think that we do need to study relationship emotions,
not just emotions,

293
00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:30.180
all kinds of phenomenon.
I think we need to study in relational context that,

294
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.220
um,
right now we're doing.
A good example would be say,
emotion regulation.

295
00:18:35.221 --> 00:18:39.600
We do now know thanks to a lot of work by James Gross a lot about how

296
00:18:39.601 --> 00:18:43.170
individuals,
uh,
regulate their emotions and it's important work.

297
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.650
But we also need to know,
uh,

298
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.720
when we do that for ourselves and when we rely on partners to do it for us.

299
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:54.270
And I think we often do rely on partners to regulate our emotions.

300
00:18:54.271 --> 00:18:57.730
We're exhausted,
we're sad.
And uh,

301
00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.640
sometimes the partner takes over.

302
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.940
They're the ones who distract us from our emotion.

303
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.530
They're the ones who reappraise it.

304
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:09.180
Tell us it's not so bad and explain exactly why it's not so bad.

305
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:14.660
We don't know a lot about how partners regulate one another's emotions.

306
00:19:14.701 --> 00:19:17.160
I'm confident that they do.
Um,

307
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.560
we don't know a lot about how relational context influences the,
the,

308
00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.270
the very nature of the emotion you express,
the amount of the emotion,

309
00:19:25.271 --> 00:19:27.990
new express.
So I would say,
uh,

310
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.750
one important direction to go in.

311
00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:35.930
The one I'm particularly interested in is putting our understanding of emotions

312
00:19:36.811 --> 00:19:38.740
in relational context.
Hmm.

313
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.280
<v 0>And so when you think about putting our emotions in a relational context and</v>

314
00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.450
you're talking to students who are interested in embarking in studying emotion

315
00:19:47.451 --> 00:19:51.350
or relationships more generally,
what kind of advice do you give them?

316
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.420
<v 1>Well,
I think you need to,
uh,</v>

317
00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.590
whenever you're looking at the intersection of two fields and now it is the case

318
00:19:58.591 --> 00:20:02.280
that emotion research is largely separate still from relationship research

319
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.010
conferences get held on the two things and they don't have a membership of the,

320
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:10.390
of the groups that go to those conferences don't overlap.
Um,

321
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.970
but what's important to as a student is probably to study both areas and that,

322
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.140
um,

323
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:21.140
and then think for yourself about how they intersect and bring the two fields

324
00:20:21.931 --> 00:20:25.530
together.
There'll be insights from each one that will,

325
00:20:25.531 --> 00:20:26.880
you can apply to the other one.

326
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.360
So that can be done by intentionally reading both literatures,

327
00:20:32.641 --> 00:20:37.560
by having mentors in both fields,
by going to both kinds of conferences.

328
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:38.970
There's lots of ways to do it,

329
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:43.500
but whenever you study two different areas of research,
um,

330
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:48.190
and you're thinking about them close in time,
you'll see connections.

331
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.740
And I think you can build on those connections.
That's,

332
00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.660
that's a great thing to think about connecting different fields to really answer

333
00:20:55.661 --> 00:20:59.080
the questions that are most important to you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

334
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.190
another thing you can do,
I think,
um,
is if you're studying emotion,

335
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.890
you can ask yourself a very simple question,
which is,

336
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:11.250
are there any situations in which whatever effect was observed would not be

337
00:21:12.251 --> 00:21:13.480
observed?
Um,

338
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.810
and you can ask that question specifically about relational contexts,

339
00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:19.150
but you can ask it in other ways as well.

340
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.710
I think that's often a way you can think of new ideas to do research on,

341
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:24.790
is just to say,

342
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:29.530
do I believe this always occurs for everybody in every context?

343
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:34.450
And almost certainly the answer's gonna be no.
Well,

344
00:21:34.451 --> 00:21:36.960
thank you so much for being with us today,
Peggy.
Um,

345
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:42.220
this concludes our experts in immersion interview with Doctor Peggy Clark from

346
