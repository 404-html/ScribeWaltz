00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.100
Our expert interview today will be with Dr. John Allen who will share his

2
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:07.260
perspective on emotion elicitation.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.350
Dr. Allen received his phd from the University of Minnesota and is currently a

4
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:15.420
distinguished professor of psychology,

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.500
cognitive science and neuroscience at the University of Arizona.

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.130
Dr. Allen is a renowned expert in emotional elicitation and he's co edited a

7
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:27.000
handbook on this very topic.

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.830
He's well known for research involving psychophysiological tools to understand

9
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:35.820
the origin and treatment of mood and anxiety disorders.

10
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.450
He's published over 120 scientific papers,

11
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.800
received numerous grants and awards for his research that include the early

12
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:48.801
career award from the Society for psychophysiological research and importantly

13
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:51.810
has a deeply embedded passion for teaching.

14
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.650
This has been reflected in the graduate college and Professional Education,

15
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:59.940
teaching and mentoring award and designation as a university distinguished

16
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:04.941
professor and in addition to his expertise in emotion and emotional visitation,

17
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.490
he's also an avid mountain biker and Munis cyclist.

18
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.260
So I'd like to welcome Dr. John Allen who will be speaking with today on

19
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:14.460
emotional elicitation.

20
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.780
So I'd like to begin with what first got you interested in this study of
emotion.

21
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.530
So could you tell us a bit about what first sparked your interest in the field?

22
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.750
<v 1>Sure.
You know,
as far back as I can remember,</v>

23
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:29.880
I was interested in people's emotions.
Uh,

24
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:32.970
and one of the things I remember thinking often as a,
you know,

25
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:37.230
an adolescent was I'd watch people make decisions that they seem to have reasons

26
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:41.010
for that didn't correspond to what I saw the reasons were for the decision they

27
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:44.820
made.
You know,
in my mind I thought this looks like an emotional decision to me.

28
00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:47.820
And they'd come up with all kinds of reasons for the reasons that they thought

29
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:48.654
that they did it.

30
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.010
And it kind of got me interested in how decision making is driven in large part

31
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:55.650
by emotion and emotions that we may or may not be aware of.

32
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:58.890
And you may or may not be aware of their influence on the kinds of decisions

33
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:03.720
that we make.
And so when I was in college,
I took a few courses on emotion.

34
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.150
At this point I didn't know that this would be a field of study for me.

35
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:08.100
It's just something of interest.
And a,

36
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:12.300
the first course was of course on the philosophy of emotions where I guess

37
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:15.960
ironically we spend a lot of time thinking about emotions.

38
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.430
And then I took a course from a Howard Leventhal.
Uh,

39
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:22.980
it was a course on the psychology of emotion,
you know,

40
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:26.640
a large 300 or 400 level course.
It was amazing that it was offered.

41
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.420
And he would walk through study after study on professor specters of emotion.

42
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.930
And then finally I was fortunate that while at the University of Wisconsin

43
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:34.990
Madison,
um,

44
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.100
to take my first psychophysiology course from Richie Davidson who had just

45
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:40.770
arrived.
And so those three courses,
you know,

46
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:43.700
really got me interested in emotion and multiple perspectives on emotion.

47
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:46.740
And you know,
I realize this was a topic,
it was important.

48
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.220
It's a topic that was complex and it was a topic that was far from fully

49
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:53.940
understood.
And so aside from the intrinsic interest that's certainly suggested,

50
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.980
that kind of topic that might lead to job security.

51
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.130
<v 0>Excellent.
And I mean,
since then,</v>

52
00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:00.910
you've just seen so much research in the field of emotion.

53
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:05.390
So I'd love to just ask you a few questions now about your research.
Um,

54
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.090
so I mean,
you've co-edited one of the most widely read handbooks in our field,

55
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.380
the handbook of emotional incitation.
So I'd love to hear in your opinion,

56
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:17.950
what you think are some of the most effective or powerful tools were really

57
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:19.600
triggering these,
you know,

58
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.730
really a fascinating and intense feelings of emotion that we experience.

59
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.590
<v 1>Sure.
Well,</v>

60
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.400
there are a lot of good elicitation techniques for use in the laboratory and

61
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:31.360
studies of emotion.

62
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.510
And I think those that are the most potent are those that involve some form of

63
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:35.770
social interactions.

64
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.520
I think they have the greatest resemblance to the majority of our real world

65
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.810
emotional experiences.

66
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:45.811
But I think really the big challenge is trying to increase the intensity and the

67
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:50.770
realism and the ecological validity of the elicitation of emotion.

68
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.610
So,
you know,
I think about even the best that we do in the laboratory,

69
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.910
it really doesn't compare to what we see.
You know,

70
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.610
just quotidian life we have in instances of road rage and you know,
um,

71
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.030
romantic jealousy,
um,

72
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.390
interpersonal conflict or even just the kind of intense emotion you see at a

73
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:11.260
major sporting event.
Um,
these are the kinds of emotions that I really think,

74
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.820
you know,
we need to try to study when possible and it's so far,
you know,

75
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.470
that's difficult to do in the laboratory,

76
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:21.220
but clearly those kinds of manipulations that involve interactions with other

77
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:25.810
people or those,
I think they get the closest to that.
Um,
you know,

78
00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:28.700
this kind of,
as I was thinking about this,
um,

79
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.950
it leads me to a provocative and maybe a hyperbolic proposition that is what we

80
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:37.951
really study in the laboratory is mild motion or we studied the inhibition of a

81
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:42.610
regulation of anything that gets a little stronger than mild emotion.
And so,

82
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:46.720
you know,
I'm surely overstating the case,
but I think the disentangling,

83
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.950
whether we're looking at the experience of emotion or are we looking at the

84
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:55.180
regulation of that experience of emotion is very difficult.
Right?

85
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.540
Are we looking at emotion or regulation or inhibition of emotion?

86
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.040
And that's probably surprisingly

87
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.893
<v 0>tricky.</v>

88
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.530
It sounds like that might be an important next step is to really try to develop

89
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:08.610
tools that can elicit and try to disentangle these two constructs

90
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.210
<v 1>an important step.
Yes,
definitely.
And then there's a large re,
you know,</v>

91
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:17.350
there's a large program of research going on on emotion regulation.
Um,

92
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.290
but that doesn't really get at this question either.
Yeah.

93
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.030
<v 0>So what do you see then as some of the critical next steps and we think about</v>

94
00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:27.120
developing tools for emotional elicitation going forward?

95
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.180
<v 1>Um,
you know,
I think probably,
uh,</v>

96
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.370
this is going to be to increase,

97
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.430
increase the realism that we have and move this into real world context.

98
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.103
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

99
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.350
So kind of increasing ecological validity using like the social dynamic tasks

100
00:05:47.351 --> 00:05:49.630
you're talking about interacting with another person,

101
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.580
maybe getting into the car when someone's experiencing road.

102
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.850
<v 1>Yeah.
With the,</v>

103
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.730
with the increased availability of ambulatory tools psychophysiological or

104
00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:00.540
otherwise.
I think a lot of this would,
you know,

105
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.530
be within our grasp within a few years.

106
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.830
So there's been a lot of work improving ambulatory psychophysiological

107
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:10.820
monitoring systems,
for example,
um,
other forms of ambulatory assessment.

108
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:15.821
There's now a society for ambulatory assessment that involves psychophysiology

109
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.970
and,
and other kinds of methods.
Um,
you know,
in this,
in this domain.

110
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:21.910
And I'd like to also give a shout out to Scott Mccain.

111
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.940
He's got something that he calls Moby the modal mobile brain body imaging.

112
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.690
And although he doesn't study emotion,
um,

113
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.030
he has a system where people can walk around,

114
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:36.980
he can record 64 or 128 channels of EEG while they freely Roman environment.

115
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.420
And you can keep track of what they're looking at,
where,
how they're moving,

116
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:44.720
where they are,
what's going on in the scene.
And all of the data stream is mark.

117
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.010
<v 0>Wow,
that's fascinating.
And so thinking more about emotional citation tools,</v>

118
00:06:50.011 --> 00:06:50.251
I mean,

119
00:06:50.251 --> 00:06:55.080
you've specialized in using really complex and very cool psychophysiological

120
00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.910
tools in studying emotion.

121
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.380
So what would your thoughts be on some of the most powerful or provocative tools

122
00:07:01.381 --> 00:07:02.910
you've used in your own research?

123
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.350
<v 1>Well,
you know what?
Psychophysiological research,</v>

124
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:09.330
a lot of this depends on tight temporal control over the stimuli.

125
00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:13.190
And so there's this tension between,
on the one hand,
um,

126
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.050
the need for such experimental control.

127
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:17.600
And on the other hand presenting the kind of complex,

128
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:22.160
intense emotional visitors' that probably unfold over time.
Um,

129
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.670
so if we try to focus on more discreet elicits of emotion,

130
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:28.880
I think films can really serve that purpose pretty well.
It's a,

131
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.040
so that's something which people are generally familiar.
Um,

132
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.730
it's possible to generate some pretty intense emotion,

133
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:38.330
but we're still talking about a timescale of course that spans seconds to

134
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.980
minutes.
So if we're looking for really discreet responses to kind of a transient

135
00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:44.390
effective response,
then you know,

136
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:47.960
something like international ethic picture series,
the picture system,

137
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:52.730
the I ops is certainly well suited it's industry standard.
Um,
but you know,

138
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:54.620
if I were on the motion picture rating committee,

139
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:58.310
I'd give the I ops a PG 13 and I'd really like to see us come out with an r

140
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:01.550
rated or an NC 17 rated version of the iops.

141
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:06.560
And we'd have to be thoughtful and sensitive about the people to whom we expose

142
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.570
to those stimuli.
But you know,

143
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.870
I certainly think that the average college student has seen things that make the

144
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:14.460
iops seem rather tame.
Um,

145
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.750
in another way you can get around the timing issue and get back to having a

146
00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:21.680
potent emotional elicit her is to use some kind of complex and realistic

147
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:25.820
emotional elicitations strategy that then creates an effect of state that

148
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:27.140
endorsed for some time.

149
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.700
And then you can assess what you're interested in during that time interval,
um,

150
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.560
or when you know,
when the person is or is not experiencing emotions.

151
00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:40.200
So for example,
we've used as social evaluative threat manipulation.
Um,

152
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:45.110
in this kind of manipulation,
people experience an uncontrollable situation,

153
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:49.670
the experiment or provides a vert feedback that there's failure going on.
Um,

154
00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:51.740
we leave the door to the sacrifice chamber open,

155
00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:54.680
we sit there with our white coats.
It's a little bit like a tree or experience,

156
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:58.060
but instead them giving a speech,
they're performing the task on the computer.

157
00:08:58.061 --> 00:09:01.750
And we've done this in the context of basic performance monitoring tasks and

158
00:09:01.751 --> 00:09:05.350
reinforcement learning tasks and looking how emotional stress impacts peoples

159
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.370
ability to monitor their own performance and make decisions.
Um,

160
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.570
and another example of that,

161
00:09:10.571 --> 00:09:13.670
of creating an effective state they might endure for awhile,
um,

162
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:18.610
I think is really nicely exemplified by work that Eddie Harmon Jones does.
So he,

163
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.040
and one of his paradigmatic ways,
he makes people angry.

164
00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:25.180
And I have to say that he's really good at making people angry in the
laboratory.

165
00:09:25.181 --> 00:09:28.690
So he has like a good experimental confederate come in and the confederate says

166
00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:32.500
something that's insulting to the subject about some aspect of their performance

167
00:09:32.501 --> 00:09:33.334
or their beliefs.

168
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.430
And then you assess this physiology and the interval that follows during which

169
00:09:36.431 --> 00:09:38.890
the person is presumably continuing to feel something

170
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.350
<v 0>kind of emotion.
Fantastic.
So,
I mean,</v>

171
00:09:42.351 --> 00:09:44.150
I'm thinking a bit too about your own work here,

172
00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:46.970
where you really use these complex psychophysical yeah.
