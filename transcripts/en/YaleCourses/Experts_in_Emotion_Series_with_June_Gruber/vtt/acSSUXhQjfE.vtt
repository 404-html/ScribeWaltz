00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.040
Welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.640
So we know that emotions are inherently social,

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.720
but what do we actually know about emotions in a social world?

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.880
How do emotions look in our everyday social exchanges and how do they underlie,

5
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:19.170
shape and change some of our most vital social bonds with other people?

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.770
So these are some of the questions that we're going to continue to really probe

7
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:23.940
and examined today.

8
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.770
And then today we'll be focusing on emotions in a social world,
part three,

9
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.740
and in particular delving into the realm of relationships.

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.490
And I'm particularly excited today to have a very special guest lecture on this

11
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:39.720
topic,
Professor Margaret Clark.
So as we get into this topic today,

12
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:43.470
we'll start with our special guest lecture followed by our takeaway questions

13
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:46.200
and expert interview.
So I'm very,

14
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:49.680
very delighted to now we starting with our guests lecture today.

15
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:53.730
We'll be having Dr. Margaret Clark and professor of psychology at Yale

16
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.540
University speaking with us today on how the relational context shapes our

17
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:01.410
emotional lives.
So welcome,
Margaret.
Thank you for being here today.
Okay.

18
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:05.610
What I want to talk about is how relational context shapes or our emotional

19
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:10.410
lives.
Um,
from my point of view as someone who studies relationships,

20
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.510
I'm often struck by how often we focus on emotions as individual affairs.

21
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.920
We know a lot about how people express emotion on their face.
Um,

22
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.070
what the physiological can competence of emotion or we know a lot about how

23
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.010
individuals try to regulate their own emotions.

24
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.280
And we actually less often than I think is ideal think about emotions in social

25
00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:38.130
context.
But emotions aren't entirely internal affairs.

26
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:42.510
We feel our emotions and we used that information to regulate our behavior.

27
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.550
But emotion show on our faces bay,
you can hear them in our voices.

28
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.750
They show in our postures and in fact we often express what we're feeling to

29
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:55.940
other people.
We tell other people that were sad or happy or angry.
Um,

30
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.130
they communicate something about us to other people.

31
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.230
And the fact that emotion show allows them to serve several social functions.

32
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:08.340
I'm going to mention just a few,
um,
and but talk primarily about one.

33
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.640
So one function that emotion serve socially is called social referencing.

34
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.490
Um,

35
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.490
people often look at other people in social situations to determine how they

36
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:21.960
should feel in that social situation.

37
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.980
If we walk into a room and someone looks scared to death,
um,

38
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.580
we may use that to think about what we should feel.

39
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.040
If they're scared that something's going on,

40
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:34.930
maybe we should be scared to death to.
Um,

41
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.520
so social referencing is one function that emotion serve.

42
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.230
Another is social protection.
If someone comes toward us,

43
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:45.120
they're walking toward us and they're smiling,

44
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.280
that's a pretty good sign that the situation is safe,
they're friendly,
it's,

45
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.970
we can interact with them.
It's probably a good idea to interact with them.

46
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:57.490
If on the other hand,
they're very angry and they're coming at us,
um,

47
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.190
it might be a good idea to get out of the situation.

48
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.830
So those are two kinds of social functions,

49
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:05.260
but they're not the ones I'm going to really focus on today.

50
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.550
A third function they serve is actually,
um,

51
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.970
to help us take care of other people's needs.

52
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.240
Emotions very often convey information about the person's needs,

53
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.500
um,
who's expressing that emotion.
So if a person is fearful,
they may need help.

54
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.420
In getting out of a situation or taking care of getting rid of whatever's

55
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:30.790
causing them fear.
If they're happy,

56
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.560
that actually also a signal,
some information about them that's important.

57
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:36.850
If they're happy,

58
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.230
that signals to us that maybe they're enjoying how we're interacting with them.

59
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:44.110
Maybe they like being with us.
We should continue.
Um,

60
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.110
if they're happy and sitting alone doing something,

61
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.130
maybe we shouldn't bother them at all.
They're perfectly fine all by themselves.

62
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.490
So I'm particularly interested in how emotions signal our needs to other people.

63
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.010
And that's what I want to talk about today.

64
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.370
So our relational context shapes how we react to other people's emotions,

65
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:11.500
whether we respond to them with support or whether we'd rather not give them

66
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:16.300
support when they express emotion.
I think we all intuitively know this.
Um,

67
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.280
although there's very few studies on them.

68
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.730
So consider a parent interacting with the child.

69
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:26.731
This is actually a picture of my nephew interacting with his two year old child.

70
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.310
So it's fine for a two year old to express any emotion he feels like to his

71
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:36.850
parent.
In fact,
it's very important that the child does this,

72
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:41.350
especially before they're able to talk.
If a,
if a baby cries,
for instance,

73
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.730
the parent figures out,

74
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.850
that's a cue that the parents should figure out what's wrong and do something

75
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:48.190
about it.
They should take care of that child's needs.

76
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.870
If a child giggles and laughs when the parent is reading a book to them,

77
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.940
that is a pretty powerful fit.
A signal that whatever he's reading,

78
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.340
the is pos to the child and he should keep reading.

79
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.770
So in a pair of child relationship,

80
00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:05.680
the child should be expressing emotion to the parent.

81
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.270
The parents should be responding to that emotion.
But what about the parent?

82
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.480
Um,
the situation is entirely different to the parent.

83
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:18.040
What if the parent happened to lose his job and is very upset?

84
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.550
Um,
that period should not express,
I think we all know this.

85
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:25.060
This parents should not express that emotion to the child.
Why?

86
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:29.980
Because that child can't assume responsibility for taking care of the parent.

87
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:33.880
And so it's actually inappropriate for the parent to express emotion to the

88
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:38.840
child.
What about friends?
Here's a picture of me sitting with some of my friends.

89
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.100
Um,
friends have a more equal relationship.

90
00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:46.390
They're often responsive to one another's needs and it's totally appropriate for

91
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:50.500
friends to express emotion to each other and they often do it.
Um,
and,

92
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.450
and the person to whom you express the emotion often responds with care.
Um,

93
00:05:55.451 --> 00:06:00.110
so we don't have to suppress our emotion with friends.
On the other hand,

94
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.980
what if we're in a business setting and we're with business partners here?

95
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:08.960
I think we all intuitively know that it's not terribly appropriate to express

96
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.370
lots of emotion.
Why is that?
I think we don't think about it much,

97
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.580
but I think the reason is the business partners are not responsible for the

98
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:22.010
other person's needs they're doing,

99
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:25.400
they're engaging in business because they care about their own needs.

100
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.300
They have what we call an exchange relationships with one another.

101
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.060
And you really don't want someone with whom you're be,

102
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.040
you're doing business expressing like lots of sadness about what happened at

103
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:39.320
home because you're really not responsible for that.

104
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.670
So I think we intuitively know relationships make a lot of difference.
Now,

105
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:45.950
long ago,
along with Judson Mills,

106
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:49.190
I distinguished between two types of relationships.
Um,

107
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.750
and more recently I've emphasized a quantitative dimension of one of them.

108
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.610
So the two types of relationships we talked about where exchange relationships

109
00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:02.150
and communal relationships.
In exchange relationships,

110
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.230
you don't feel any special responsibility for the other person's needs.

111
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.300
You do exchange benefits,

112
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.020
but you give benefits to the other person with the expectation of receiving

113
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:15.110
something in return.
Um,
and when you accept a benefit,

114
00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:16.910
you expect to repay the other person.

115
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.470
You have no special responsibility for their needs.
On the other hand,

116
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.730
in communal relationships,
you do feel a special responsibility for partners.

117
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.630
A communal relationships are often exemplified by friendships,
uh,
parent,

118
00:07:30.631 --> 00:07:33.560
child relationships,
romantic relationships,

119
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.190
and these relationships you give benefits,
um,
to,

120
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.190
to support the other person's a welfare to,

121
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.540
to promote the other person's welfare and you do it non contingently.

122
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.440
Now unimportant,

123
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.170
a point about communal relationships is that there is a quantitative dimension

124
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.400
to them.

125
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.400
We don't assume an equal degree of responsibility for all our communal partner's

126
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:02.030
needs.
And I'm going to show that on the next slide.
Um,

127
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.090
what I have here,
what,
um,

128
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.140
actually I'm going to switch perspectives a little bit and I want you to

129
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:13.490
consider the responsibility that others assume for our welfare first.

130
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.180
So what I have here is something called communal strength.

131
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.470
And this is communal strength in terms of what we expect from a partner.

132
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.940
We don't expect much from an infant.
An infant has very little ability,

133
00:08:25.941 --> 00:08:28.460
no ability really to take care of our needs.

134
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.330
And so we don't expect much communal behavior from an infant.
Um,

135
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.520
we actually expected a little bit more from an adult stranger who has some

136
00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:41.060
capability in a stranger could give us directions or tell us a time.

137
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:44.060
And we expect most strangers will do that.

138
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.270
We assume more responsibility or for a friend.
Um,

139
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:51.380
we assume responsibility for ourselves.
Um,
and we also,

140
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:54.650
we may assume a great deal of responsibility for a romantic partner.

141
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.560
I don't want to suggest that everybody orders relationships in this way.

142
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:03.561
This is just one person's a set of relationships and the way one person might

143
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:08.980
order them.
Um,
the point is more that we do order our relationships,
uh,

144
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.930
in terms of how much responsiveness we expect from the other person.

145
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.060
So over on the y axis,

146
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:18.420
I have your perception of the other person's care.

147
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:24.050
So you could draw a line through this figure that depicts how much you expect

148
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:28.920
the other person to care for your needs.
You don't expect an infant to care much.

149
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.310
You expect to read a real romantic partner to care a lot.

150
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:37.910
So beneath the line we expect care from the other person and above the line we

151
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:42.180
do not expect a care.
So I haven't talked about emotions yet.

152
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.290
What does all this have to do with emotions?
Well,
um,

153
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.570
I think below the line,
you,
they,

154
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:52.090
they're supposed to provide care and our emotions suggest,
uh,

155
00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:55.680
what they need to do above the line.
We don't expect care.

156
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.640
And if we express our emotions,
they might even exploit those.

157
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:05.180
So I would say you should express emotions indicative of needs beneath the line.

158
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:09.690
Not all emotions express needs.
So things like fear,

159
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.520
sadness,
and happiness,
you should express,
uh,

160
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.450
in this domain.
Um,
and above the line actually you should suppress the emotion.

161
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:22.220
You should suppress the emotion for couple of different reasons.
Um,

162
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.010
one is that the other,
it'll be annoying to other people.

163
00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:31.011
They don't want to assume responsibility for your emotions and for taking care

164
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:35.130
of you.
And the other reason is they could use that information against you.

165
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.350
They could actually exploit you.
So,
um,

166
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.600
consider looking for a house and relater is showing you around and you find the

167
00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:45.920
house you love.

168
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.940
You don't want to express too much happiness because the realtor's not

169
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:55.170
responsible for your needs and they could use that happiness against you.

170
00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:59.490
They could use that as a signal that they could suggest the higher price to you.

171
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:04.170
So you might want to suppress emotion and that case.
So,
um,

172
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:08.550
here's the first proposition I have.
People should express more emotion,

173
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.270
the greater the perceived strength of their communal relationship.

174
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.380
And I'm going to show you a couple simple studies that tests this proposition.

175
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:17.663
Um,

176
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
the first one was one that I did with Julie Fitness and Ian percent and it was a

177
00:11:24.511 --> 00:11:27.960
simple self report study.
Um,

178
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:32.990
we ask people to consider a number of different relationships and we asked them

179
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.480
how communal their relationship was,
how strong it was,

180
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.880
and we asked them also in a separate set of [inaudible] to tell us the extent to

181
00:11:41.881 --> 00:11:46.590
which they express each have a number of emotions to that particular partner.

182
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.300
Would you express anger,
disgust,
fear,
hurt,
sadness,
contentment and happiness.

183
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:57.070
Um,
these are the 42 people,
um,
that we have,
I shouldn't say that.

184
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.240
42 people rated the communal strength of their relationships with a number of

185
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:06.010
different people,
a stranger,
their mother,
a casual friend and so forth.

186
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:06.940
A fellow employee,

187
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.510
we did not assume that everybody had every kind of relationship.

188
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.330
If you weren't an employee,
uh,

189
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.600
you wouldn't answer about a fellow employee you just answered for every

190
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:21.400
relationship you had.
And this is how we measured communal strength.

191
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.440
There's a standard scale to measure how much responsibility,
um,

192
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.570
you feel for another person or them for you.

193
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.450
Here it's how much responsibility you feel for another person.
Um,

194
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.270
but in this case,
we flip these items to be how much you think they,

195
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:42.400
uh,
responsibility they assume for you.
And then,
um,

196
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.230
people rated the extent to which they would suppress or express different

197
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:51.640
emotions to each person from definitely they would suppress it to definitely

198
00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:54.910
they would express it.
And here are the results.
These are,

199
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.540
these are just the average correlations between communal strength and

200
00:12:58.541 --> 00:12:59.900
willingness to express them all.

201
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.850
Each of these emotions for the individuals in the study.

202
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.090
And what you can see is they're all positive correlations.

203
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.630
The more communal the relationship,
the more you expected,

204
00:13:10.631 --> 00:13:13.420
the other person felt responsibility for you.

205
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:18.690
The more you expressed each of the emotions we ask about negative and positive

206
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.270
and all those correlations are significant.
Now this was at we,

207
00:13:23.271 --> 00:13:26.230
we ask,
there's another part to this study I need to explain.

208
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:31.420
We ask about expressing it when the cause of the emotion was your partner and

209
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:33.620
you express it.
We also ask,
uh,

210
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.790
about what happens when it was caused by someone else,

211
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.480
something or someone else.
Um,

212
00:13:39.481 --> 00:13:43.310
and you also see that the correlations are positive.
Um,

213
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.000
so the overall takeaway from this,

214
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:51.090
a simple study is that just that a more communal a relationship is the more of

215
00:13:52.421 --> 00:13:55.300
the communal strength,
the more you'll express emotion.

216
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.570
Now I want to focus on something else here.

217
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.980
There's one odd thing you might have noticed and that's that for anger and

218
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:03.461
disgust,

219
00:14:03.461 --> 00:14:07.390
the correlations are lower than for the other emotions when they're caused by

220
00:14:07.391 --> 00:14:08.224
your partner.

221
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.320
And that I think is understandable because these two emotions do convey

222
00:14:14.151 --> 00:14:17.950
something about your needs.
If,
if I'm angry at you,

223
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.720
you should do something to decrease my anger.
I want you to do something.

224
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.070
On the other hand,
if I express anger to you,
it hurts you.

225
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.910
It might hurt you if you did something disgusting and I say you just did

226
00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:33.180
something disgusting.
Um,
it,

227
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:37.570
I might want you to stop eating with your mouth open.
I'm,
on the other hand,

228
00:14:37.571 --> 00:14:41.860
I might hurt your feelings by expressing it.
So because these two,

229
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.970
if you express it might hurt your partner.
I think it's stamped down a bit,

230
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:51.420
but you have no problem if someone else made you angry or someone you found

231
00:14:51.861 --> 00:14:55.550
disgusting expressing it to your partner.
And that's cause I think it,

232
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.100
it doesn't hurt the person you're expressing it too.

233
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.630
But it is striking that all the correlations are positive.

234
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.140
Now let me tell you about another study.
The tests,
the same idea.

235
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.830
This is a study of marriages involving both husbands and wives.

236
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.150
We had 108 married couples,
uh,
and we,

237
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:19.510
we ask them in self reports to tell us the extent to which their spouse followed

238
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:20.991
the communal norms.

239
00:15:20.991 --> 00:15:25.220
So now how responsible is your spouse for your welfare?

240
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:29.360
They're all marriages.
So there's an important point to make about this,

241
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.620
that even within one type of relationship and this case marriage,

242
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:38.810
a communal strength varies.
So marriage is or ordinarily communal in nature,

243
00:15:38.811 --> 00:15:43.610
but they vary in communal strength.
We also asked the extent to which these,
um,

244
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:48.680
each of the spouses expressed fear,
sadness,
and happiness to each other.
Um,

245
00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:51.890
and the extent to which they express these emotions to other.

246
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.800
Now we're asking about the marriage.
Um,

247
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:59.801
so we expect that to correlate with how much you express emotion to your spouse.

248
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.870
Um,
because it's about the marriage per se.

249
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.860
We don't think it will have anything to do with whether you express the emotions

250
00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:07.700
to other people.

251
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:13.060
So it's not that they are very communal people who express emotion to everybody.

252
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.490
It's the,
that matters.
It's,

253
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.880
it's that their communal relationships,
um,
that matters.

254
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:25.150
So here's what we got for predicting emotion expression from perception of one

255
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:29.960
spouse following communal norms.
So you see that the,
um,

256
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.260
the more communal the relationship,
the stronger it is.

257
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.620
The more people expressed fear,
sadness,
and happiness,

258
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:41.210
but it didn't have any impact on how much they expressed to other people.

259
00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:43.700
Okay.

260
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:48.700
So what if talked about so far is how believing that other people care about

261
00:16:50.391 --> 00:16:54.860
your welfare influences your tendency to express emotion to them.

262
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.720
But there's another side of the picture.
Um,

263
00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:01.130
and I tried to capture that in the second proposition.
Uh,

264
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.660
we think that people should react more positively to partner expressions of

265
00:17:05.661 --> 00:17:08.930
emotion.
The greater the perceived strength of the community relationship.

266
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:14.000
So here what we're concerned about is your care for the other,

267
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:18.140
that we're now flipping the perspective and we're saying the more you care for

268
00:17:18.141 --> 00:17:22.640
the other,
um,
the more emotion you should express.
Again,

269
00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:26.480
you can draw the line.
I'm here.
Notice something about this graph.

270
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:31.630
I've moved the infant from the low end to the high end because we tend to care a

271
00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:35.240
lot about infants and feel responsible for them.

272
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.970
We think it's fine for them to express emotion.

273
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.910
So some relationships,

274
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.210
community relationships are symmetrical like friends and romantic partners,

275
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.170
but some are asymmetrical like infants.
So,
um,

276
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.760
we feel a great deal of responsibility for them,

277
00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:53.400
but don't expect them to feel responsible for us.

278
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:58.140
That's why I think it's appropriate for infants to express their emotion to us,

279
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:02.400
but it's not appropriate for us to express too much emotion to the infants.

280
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.750
So,
um,
this is just looking at others care for you.
Um,

281
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.520
underneath the line you should prepare,

282
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:12.960
provide care for the other person above the line.
No care is required.

283
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.730
You should respond positively to express emotion indicative of needs.

284
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.610
I don't want to say it's every possible emotion,

285
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.630
but emotions a indicative of need,
like fear and sadness.

286
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.750
You should respond positively to and above the line.

287
00:18:27.751 --> 00:18:31.050
No responsiveness is required from you.
Indeed.

288
00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:34.680
You may be annoyed if the other person express their emotion.

289
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.080
So if you employ,
say,
um,
uh,

290
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.510
administrative assistant in your office and that person expresses,

291
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.900
you know,
every emotion they feel in their life,

292
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.120
it's not going to make the relationship good.

293
00:18:48.121 --> 00:18:51.570
It's going to hurt the relationship.
People will be annoyed.
Okay.

294
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.830
So now I'm going to continue talking about my marriage study and tell you about

295
00:18:55.831 --> 00:18:59.490
another thing that emerged from it that has to do with perceiving,

296
00:18:59.491 --> 00:19:03.210
I think perceiving other people's emotions and how you react to it.

297
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.890
So it's the same study with the same 108 couples.

298
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:12.840
Um,
and I want to,
these are the things I already told you about,
uh,
measuring,

299
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.850
but we also measured how satisfied people were with their marriage.
So,

300
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.773
um,

301
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:24.470
what we found that I think is pretty interesting is that males reports of

302
00:19:24.481 --> 00:19:26.760
expressing emotion.
So what the male said,

303
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.120
did they express sadness that they express happiness,

304
00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.850
they express fear is with,
um,

305
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.120
was related to their wives,

306
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:40.050
independent reports of marital satisfaction.
Um,

307
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.530
the more the male's expressed emotion,

308
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.800
the more satisfied their wives.
Where would the relationship,

309
00:19:46.801 --> 00:19:51.120
and what I think this is about is they're willing to tell their wives about

310
00:19:51.121 --> 00:19:54.690
their vulnerabilities.
They're willing to ask for support from their wives,

311
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.380
their wives,
they're able to get it and the wives end up more satisfied.

312
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:03.650
So here's a positive reaction to another person's expression of emotion.

313
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.700
Um,
let me go back a bit.
I'm going ahead too quickly.
Um,

314
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.600
I should say that we did not get the parallel effect for wives,

315
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:17.160
but I don't think that's because the same effect doesn't apply to wives.
Instead,

316
00:20:17.161 --> 00:20:21.840
what we found,
which was interesting is that the wives all expressed emotion.

317
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:27.240
And so there was very little variability in weather wives expressed emotion.

318
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.870
And because of that,
we couldn't observe a correlation between,
um,

319
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.250
wives expression of emotion and their husbands satisfaction.

320
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.220
So I don't think it doesn't apply to wives,
it's just that uh,

321
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.560
women express more emotion than do men.

322
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.520
And now let me tell you about another study that looks at how we react to other

323
00:20:46.531 --> 00:20:50.170
people's emotions depending upon our relationship with them.

324
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.320
This is a truly experimental study and what we did was we looked at,

325
00:20:55.661 --> 00:21:00.661
we brought people into the lab and instead of looking at existing relationships,

326
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.070
what we did was we looked at,

327
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:07.750
we manipulated desire for communal or an exchange relationship with the other

328
00:21:07.751 --> 00:21:10.120
person.
And we did it in a very simple way.

329
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.640
We had college students participate in the study.

330
00:21:12.641 --> 00:21:16.870
It was supposedly on impression formation.
They expected to meet another person,

331
00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:19.660
but before they met the person,
they were going to exchange questionnaires,

332
00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.580
a form,
a first impression,

333
00:21:21.581 --> 00:21:23.950
and then they expect it to actually talk with the other person.

334
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.750
And we did something very simple.

335
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:31.030
We thought most new freshman college students are anxious to meet new people,

336
00:21:31.031 --> 00:21:34.240
maybe to form friendships,
maybe to form a romantic relationship.

337
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.140
And so if the other person is attractive and friendly and we made the other

338
00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:39.610
person attractive and friendly,

339
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.790
we thought they'd naturally be open to a communal relationship.

340
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.250
But then we wanted to do that in.
And the other,
uh,

341
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.660
in the other condition we had the same attractive,
friendly person,

342
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.760
but this other person said that they'd signed up for the experiment because they

343
00:21:54.761 --> 00:21:56.620
were very busy,
uh,

344
00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:00.340
and their husband or wife had to pick them up afterwards.
Um,

345
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:05.430
what this communicates immediately is that this is probably not a candidate for

346
00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.560
a friendship or romantic relationship.

347
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.970
This person is different from the average college student and we expected they'd

348
00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:16.990
prefer an exchange relationship.
Simple manipulation.
Um,

349
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.610
now in the study,

350
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.900
what happened was they filled out questionnaires and one of the question you

351
00:22:21.901 --> 00:22:25.600
were asked how they were feeling right then and the other person says,

352
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:30.660
I'm not feeling any particular emotion or I'm feeling happy or I'm feeling mad

353
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.380
or I'm feeling fearful or anxious.
I forget exactly what it is actually.

354
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:42.760
Um,
let me first show you what happens when they express no emotion.

355
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.000
Here's liking over here.
Um,

356
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:50.170
communal relationships are depicted in blue exchange and red.
Um,

357
00:22:50.171 --> 00:22:52.090
and they liked the two people equally.
Well.

358
00:22:52.091 --> 00:22:54.940
There's nothing wrong with the married,
busy person.

359
00:22:54.941 --> 00:22:58.660
You don't expect a communal relationship.
Um,
but there's nothing wrong with them.

360
00:22:58.661 --> 00:23:01.750
They're perfectly likable as he is the available person.

361
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:06.580
That was actually luck,
uh,
in the study that they came out exactly the same.

362
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.370
Um,
now I'm gonna switch this graph.

363
00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:12.100
So this is going to be the baseline now.

364
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.990
And what I'm going to do is show the deviations caused by sadness,
anger,

365
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:21.700
and happiness.
And I said that was,
um,
maybe anxiety.
It was happiness.

366
00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:26.660
So,
um,
here's what happens with sadness.
Here's the baseline.

367
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.110
They like each other.
God are the same.
Uh,

368
00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:33.610
and what you see is when someone expresses sadness in the communal condition,

369
00:23:33.611 --> 00:23:36.340
it actually increases liking a bit.
Why would that be?

370
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.970
I think it provides an opportunity to be responsive to the other person.

371
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.360
It's actually kind of Nice when someone's willing to express their sadness to

372
00:23:43.361 --> 00:23:46.250
you.
But look what happens in the exchange,
uh,

373
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.670
condition you really liking for the other person drops.

374
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.970
You don't want to be responsible for that knee,
that person's need.

375
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.230
And now we're going to look at anger.
So one lesson,

376
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:00.380
there's a main effect here and we don't like angry people,

377
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.910
but it actually doesn't significantly decreased liking for the community and the

378
00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:06.650
communal condition.
It doesn't exchange.

379
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.430
We don't want to be around angry people are not.

380
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:14.570
Everything is explained by whether a relationship is communal or not.

381
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.820
It's unpleasant to be around angry people,

382
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:21.230
but it's more appropriate I think to express it and communal and it decreases,

383
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:26.390
um,
liking less there.
And finally,

384
00:24:26.391 --> 00:24:30.650
let's look at happiness.
There's another main effect here.
We like happy people.

385
00:24:30.651 --> 00:24:33.210
I think that's not surprising at all.
Um,

386
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.850
but it increases our liking for a communal partner much more than an exchange

387
00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:38.570
partner.

388
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:43.570
And the overall lesson from this study I think is it's more appropriate to

389
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:48.200
express emotion in communal than an exchange relationships.
Um,

390
00:24:48.201 --> 00:24:53.090
and we like,
it affects liking,
um,
more in a communal,

391
00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.610
whoa.
Not more,
but it affects,

392
00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:00.110
it affects liking in different ways in these two relationships.
Um,

393
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.130
it's,
it just,
you know,
more appropriate.

394
00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:07.060
We'd like people more who express emotion.
Um,

395
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:11.930
if we have a commute we expect to communal and an exchange relationship.
Okay.

396
00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:16.520
And now what about behavior?
How do we behave toward people who express emotion?

397
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.650
So we looked at this and yet another study.
It's a fairly old study.

398
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:22.550
Um,

399
00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:27.410
but we made a simple prediction that will respond to people with whom we expect

400
00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:30.260
a communal relationship.
And we manipulated it in the same way.

401
00:25:30.261 --> 00:25:35.020
And this study will respond to uh,
a communal partners.

402
00:25:35.021 --> 00:25:36.140
Sadness with increased,

403
00:25:36.141 --> 00:25:39.440
helping well help a communal partner more than an exchange partner in the first

404
00:25:39.441 --> 00:25:41.930
place.
But then we'll respond to sadness more positively.

405
00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.590
But what if an exchange partner expresses sadness?

406
00:25:45.591 --> 00:25:50.240
We predicted that we wouldn't react positively to their expression of emotion.

407
00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:55.310
It was fairly elaborate study.
Um,
and I won't go into all the details,

408
00:25:55.311 --> 00:25:58.790
but we brought people into the lab to people participating at the same time.

409
00:25:58.791 --> 00:26:01.430
One was a confederate.
They had to do an art project.

410
00:26:01.431 --> 00:26:03.110
One person had to paint a painting,

411
00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:06.410
the other person had to make a balloon sculpture.
And we said,

412
00:26:06.411 --> 00:26:08.510
we were interested in the effects of mood.

413
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:13.610
On performance on these artistic tests.
So they rated their mood,
um,

414
00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:18.740
and the,
the confederate actually did it,
um,
after,
um,

415
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:23.660
the actual participant and then the confederate said they had to leave the room

416
00:26:23.661 --> 00:26:24.840
for a little bit.
Um,

417
00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.340
so that left the real participant alone with the confederates questionnaire and

418
00:26:28.341 --> 00:26:30.380
everybody did exactly what we hoped,

419
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:34.670
which they looked at it and they could see that the other person was sad or not.

420
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.880
The experimenter comes in and looks around and says,
well,

421
00:26:37.881 --> 00:26:41.360
you can just paint you're painting if you want,
or,
you know,

422
00:26:41.361 --> 00:26:45.570
I forgot to blow up the person's balloons for the balloon sculpture and I don't

423
00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:50.080
have time to do it.
The experimenter was great and terribly disorganized,
um,

424
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.280
and said,
you can help them blow up the balloons if you want.
You don't have to.

425
00:26:53.281 --> 00:26:54.500
You could just do your painting.
And the,

426
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.180
and then the experimenter leaves and we looked,

427
00:26:57.181 --> 00:27:00.960
we wanted to count how many balloons they blew up for the other person.

428
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.910
But we had unfortunately purchase balloons that were impossible to blow up.

429
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.500
So we changed our manager to how long they tried to blow up the balloons.

430
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:15.810
Um,
and I want to show you the results,
um,
which are here.

431
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.950
So this is how many seconds say spent trying to blow up the balloons.

432
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.230
This is the other person's mood.

433
00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.800
They were either sad or they were in a neutral mood.
Um,

434
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.550
and what you can see immediately is in the communal condition,
they help more.

435
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.580
So that's not a surprise.
Uh,
lots of,

436
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.820
I think people help to form relationships lots of time.

437
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.210
What's important here is that sadness increased,

438
00:27:39.211 --> 00:27:42.030
helping in the communal condition,
um,

439
00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:44.610
and it had no effect and the exchange condition.

440
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:49.740
Now I actually think if we weren't at rock bottom and helping here that we might

441
00:27:49.741 --> 00:27:53.490
have found that sadness decreased helping that you want to get out of there.

442
00:27:53.491 --> 00:27:58.320
You don't want to help the sad person,
but in fact,
um,

443
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:03.000
we had a floor effect so we couldn't observe that.
Okay,

444
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.300
here's the proposition three,
and this is the last one I'll talk about.

445
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:11.250
We think that expressing emotions should help us to build close communal

446
00:28:11.251 --> 00:28:15.540
relationships.
And,
uh,
this,

447
00:28:15.541 --> 00:28:16.560
we did study five,

448
00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:20.280
I didn't put the reference up and I should say that this was a study done by

449
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:24.750
Steve Graham,
um,
at Carnegie Mellon University.

450
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:29.520
And what we did is we contacted freshmen before they came to college and we

451
00:28:29.521 --> 00:28:32.310
asked them if they'd participate in this study.

452
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:37.340
We measured their willingness to express for emotions and then we collected some

453
00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:40.200
demographic measure itself self as a measure of self esteem.

454
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.170
Here's how we measured willingness to express emotion.

455
00:28:43.171 --> 00:28:47.670
We just ask how willing are you to express fears,
annoyance,
anger,

456
00:28:47.671 --> 00:28:51.240
sadness,
and anxieties to other people?
And they answered that.

457
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:52.710
Now it's important,

458
00:28:52.711 --> 00:28:57.120
I think that implicit in this is how willing are you to do this when it's

459
00:28:57.121 --> 00:29:01.590
appropriate?
So we asked that,
uh,

460
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:05.370
and we predicted that students willing to express the four emotions,

461
00:29:05.371 --> 00:29:08.150
negative emotions would be more able than others to form.

462
00:29:08.151 --> 00:29:12.960
Many friendships are establishing intimacy in the closest of those relationships

463
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.920
and have partners who were responsive to them.
So this is interesting.
Uh,

464
00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:21.540
the papers actually called the positives of negative emotion because we think

465
00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:26.040
that expressing negative emotion gives your partner an opportunity to be

466
00:29:26.041 --> 00:29:30.150
responsive.
Um,
so they filled out our emotion majors,

467
00:29:30.151 --> 00:29:34.050
a ride to school and all we did was wait until the end of the first semester to

468
00:29:34.051 --> 00:29:37.620
collect our measures.
At the end of the semester,

469
00:29:37.621 --> 00:29:41.010
we ask how many friendships they had.
We measured that in two.

470
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:42.310
We just outright ask them,

471
00:29:42.311 --> 00:29:46.260
how many friends do you have but you didn't have before you started college?
Um,

472
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.870
we also,
because we thought people might not be honest about that,

473
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.850
we asked them to give us the initials of people that they ate breakfast with

474
00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:58.210
lunch with and dinner with.
So they had to think in concrete terms.

475
00:29:58.211 --> 00:30:02.170
Who do I actually spend time with?
Both those measures showed the same thing.

476
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.070
We measured intimacy and the two closest friendships.

477
00:30:05.071 --> 00:30:09.540
So how do we measure intimacy?
Are we ask if the,
if the person's,

478
00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:13.810
um,
seem to understand that?
I think if you express your emotions,

479
00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:17.050
they're going to understand you better.
Um,
does the person,

480
00:30:17.051 --> 00:30:19.270
except you were optimistic.

481
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:23.920
We think that people respond to other people's negative emotions positively when

482
00:30:23.921 --> 00:30:25.030
they're forming friendships.

483
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:30.300
And we ask is the person caring because we thought if in fact you express

484
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.460
negative emotion,
you're giving the person a chance to care.

485
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:39.130
And what we found was that willingness to express negative emotion,

486
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:44.490
what one's negative motions were the significant and positive predictors of the

487
00:30:45.371 --> 00:30:50.140
number of friends they reported having and the intimacy in the two closest

488
00:30:50.141 --> 00:30:53.020
friendships.
But then we had a fortunate thing happen.

489
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:58.150
There was another researcher at the same university studying these same freshmen

490
00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.420
and she happened to have,
this was Vicki Helgeson.

491
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.790
She happened to have majors from,

492
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:09.210
we had 38 people for whom she had measures from their roommates of how much

493
00:31:10.901 --> 00:31:13.990
support they had given to the roommates.
She was interested in social support.

494
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:19.470
So we could combine those data sets and look at whether the are people who said

495
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:23.620
they were willing to express negative emotion,

496
00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:28.420
got support from their roommates.
And what we found was that,

497
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:33.340
um,
willingness to express negative emotion was a significant predictor of

498
00:31:33.341 --> 00:31:33.760
roommates,

499
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.230
independent reports of having given them help collected by an entirely different

500
00:31:38.231 --> 00:31:41.880
researcher doing an entirely different study.
So,

501
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:47.100
so we think that expressing emotions does help you to build,
um,

502
00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:51.820
communal relationships.
So,
um,
let me sum up now in,

503
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.420
I,

504
00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:57.420
I strongly feel that relationship context shapes are expressions of emotion and

505
00:31:58.271 --> 00:31:59.250
they also another,

506
00:31:59.251 --> 00:32:04.210
our expression of emotion in turn shapes our relationships and allows us to grow

507
00:32:04.211 --> 00:32:05.670
relationships.
Um,

508
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:09.880
and it leads to a somewhat surprising prediction that expressing negative

509
00:32:09.881 --> 00:32:13.570
emotions is a positive thing and helps you to grow relationships.

510
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:17.920
Although I've emphasized,
um,
expressing emotion.

511
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:21.880
I want to make a couple more comments about how relational context and

512
00:32:21.881 --> 00:32:25.990
particularly communal relational context shapes people's emotional lives.

513
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:31.230
I suspect it's not all about expressing emotion or receiving support because,

514
00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.193
um,

515
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:40.190
when you express emotion that also influences your of emotion.

516
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:45.430
So we know from lots of studies of emotion that facial feedback,
um,

517
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.370
influences our emotions.
We know that when,
um,

518
00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:50.810
we,

519
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:54.950
we actually sometimes I'm in manipulating emotions by telling people to recall

520
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:58.280
cases where they experienced a particular emotion.

521
00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.300
So if you were in fact doing this with our partners,

522
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:06.860
I think we're influencing not only expressions of emotion and receiving help,

523
00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.810
we going floating our experience of emotion as well.
Now,

524
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:15.830
I'm not sure exactly how that works out across,
um,

525
00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:18.950
situations where we're suppressing emotion versus expressing it.

526
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:22.160
But I think it's an interesting direction in which to go.

527
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.260
And the other point I'd like to make is that I think this work strongly suggests

528
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.370
that regulation of emotion,

529
00:33:31.371 --> 00:33:35.180
which is normally studied as an individual thing.
Um,

530
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.980
there are lots of studies on regulation and emotion.

531
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.800
It's normally studied in a single person and how they're regulating their own

532
00:33:42.801 --> 00:33:43.580
emotions.

533
00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:48.580
But I strongly feel that emotion regulation is often a social affair.

534
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:51.470
We often cheer up our friends.

535
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.730
We often empathize with our friends.
Um,

536
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:59.510
we distract our friends and we sometimes reappraise our,

537
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:03.620
uh,
partners state,
uh,
for their benefit.

538
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.650
So they think it's the worst thing that happened,

539
00:34:06.651 --> 00:34:07.910
is the worst thing in the world.

540
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.950
And we may as their partner reframe that for it for them.

541
00:34:12.951 --> 00:34:16.230
I think that happens a lot.
So another interesting direction,
um,

542
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:21.580
that we're going in is to look at how relational context shapes regulation of

543
00:34:22.641 --> 00:34:23.270
emotion.

544
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:28.270
So although today I've emphasized expression of emotion and being responsive to

545
00:34:28.671 --> 00:34:32.240
other people,
I also think this has a lot to do.

546
00:34:32.241 --> 00:34:36.650
Relational context has a lot to do with experience of emotion and also with

547
00:34:36.651 --> 00:34:40.590
emotional regulation.
So I thank you.
Yeah.

548
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:44.570
<v 1>So thank you very much,
Margaret Clark for a fantastic guest lecture.</v>

549
00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:48.410
I'd now like to turn to our takeaway questions to sort of glean what were the

550
00:34:48.411 --> 00:34:51.680
main important themes for the guest lecture you heard today.

551
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:56.000
So our takeaway questions today will go as follows.
First,

552
00:34:56.150 --> 00:35:00.650
why is it important to consider emotional lives in a relational context?

553
00:35:00.651 --> 00:35:03.770
In the lecture you heard today?
Second,

554
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:07.970
what are the differences between felt emotions on the one hand and expressed

555
00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:10.670
emotions on the other?
And finally,

556
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.420
how do relationships vary in the extent to which a partner assumes

557
00:35:14.421 --> 00:35:16.910
responsibility for another as welfare?

558
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:22.490
And now I'd like to turn to our expert interview as part of the experts in

559
00:35:22.491 --> 00:35:23.960
emotion interview series

560
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:29.390
are experts and emotion interview will be with Dr. Margaret Clark on emotions

561
00:35:29.391 --> 00:35:30.500
and relationships.

562
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:34.310
So Dr. Clark is a world renowned expert in close relationships,

563
00:35:34.311 --> 00:35:37.560
both friendships and romantic relationships and emotions,

564
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:41.550
and in particular the ways people experience and express emotions within

565
00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:44.490
relationships among her various distinctions.

566
00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:48.210
Dr. Clark is one of the founders and former presidents of the society for

567
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:50.220
personality and social psychologist.

568
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:54.840
She has countless books and publications and has received numerous awards and

569
00:35:54.841 --> 00:35:56.640
recognition of her accomplishments.

570
00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:01.620
So I now turn to a very special experts and emotion interview with Dr. Margaret

571
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.570
Clark on emotions and relationships.
