00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.740
Hi,
welcome to human emotion.
So today we're going to be talking about sleep.

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.290
So we know sleep is essential.
In fact,

3
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:10.800
we spend almost a third of our entire lives sleeping.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.850
We know it's an essential kind of biologically motivated behavior,

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.680
and that adequate amounts of sleep are necessary,
not for our normal motor,

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.550
cognitive and physical functioning,
even just for survival.

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.810
Yet in what way is sleep essential for emotion?

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.280
I want to read this quote to you here that says,

9
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.470
if sleep does not serve an absolutely vital function than it is the biggest

10
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.770
mistake the evolutionary process has ever made.

11
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.310
So today we're going to be looking at the question of in what way to sleep

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.060
actually serve as a form of overnight emotional therapy,

13
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.190
so to sleep place some important role in restoring our emotional wellbeing,

14
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.800
and what happens when we are deprived of sleep?

15
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.710
How does it change the way we feel,
our emotions,

16
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.750
the way we recognize emotions in others,

17
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:06.630
and the way we try to regulate and control our emotions?

18
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.610
And how could simply sleeping,

19
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.260
laying in bed and resting so profoundly affect all of these three critical

20
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:17.010
domains of emotional wellbeing that we've talked about in the course up to this

21
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:21.480
point.
So today we're going to be starting our first of three segments looking at

22
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:24.450
emotion and how it relates to different types of health outcomes.

23
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.260
Today we're going to start with sleep and answer this question of his sleep.

24
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:30.960
Really a type of overnight therapy.

25
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.300
Our roadmap today will go as follows for someone to start with a brief

26
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.100
introduction into sleep.

27
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.180
Then we'll think about what good is sleep for our emotions.
Anyhow,

28
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.330
we'll conclude with our takeaway questions and expert interview.

29
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.640
So let's get started into our basic journey into sleep or what I call sleep one

30
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:50.474
on one.

31
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.070
So here we have a normal sleep overview and if you look at sleep you can see on

32
00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:59.730
the left hand column it's broken up into different stages,
right?

33
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.860
You have wakefulness,
rem sleep and non rem sleep,
which are stages one two,

34
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:05.694
three and four.

35
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.590
So it starts again with a wakefulness rem and then non ribs rem stages of one,

36
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:11.424
two,
three,
four.

37
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.670
And our deepest stages of sleep are actually down here at the bottom of what we

38
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:19.480
call stage three and four.
So we know that rems,
this really fascinating,
uh,

39
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.230
portion of sleep because it's when we dream,
right?

40
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.070
So we have about five or more episodes of rem throughout the night.

41
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.980
If you look here,
you can see,
you know,
this is an early adulthood.

42
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:30.210
You see maybe three,

43
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:34.470
four and often people have up to five of these really intense rem episodes.

44
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.420
And as we'll talk about in just a minute,

45
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:40.200
rem actually plays one of the most critical functions when it comes to helping

46
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:44.610
consolidate our emotional experiences and help us awake feeling emotionally

47
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:49.220
refreshed.
So why don't we now take a journey into sleep?

48
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.060
Am I starting with,
how do we measure sleep?
So sleep is really interesting.

49
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:58.470
So it's measured using what's called EEG or electroencephalography.

50
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.800
So is a system for measuring electrical activity of neurons in the brain.

51
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.120
So you can see here is you attach a larger ray of electrodes to the scalp.

52
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.350
And by doing so,

53
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:12.760
you can measure what's these large regions of electrical activity
simultaneously.

54
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.340
And the electrodes are usually placed on the scalp.

55
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:19.840
Usually you have at least four more the eyes,
nose,
jaw and lower limbs.

56
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.980
And what's really fascinating is what you can get from these electrodes are

57
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:28.330
different patterns or different,
what they call waves,
Delta waves,
theta waves,

58
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:32.920
etc. That can tell you exactly which of these stages of sleep a person is in.

59
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.400
Is it rem,
is it stage one,
two,
three,
or four.

60
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.920
So here's an example of what a typical EEG set up can look like.
Secure.

61
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:43.660
You see it both in an adult,

62
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.050
you can see the different electrodes placed all over his scalp and you can also

63
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:49.690
see a modified version on a young child as well.

64
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.110
So here you're not only trying to get parameters of electrical activity in the

65
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:57.100
scalp,
but you'll notice in the small child especially,
you also see,
um,

66
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:58.370
electrodes near his eyes.

67
00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:02.170
So you can look at eye blinks that occur during rum as well as patterns of

68
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:06.820
breathing and respiration and job movement that also occur along with different

69
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:08.050
stages of rem as well.

70
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.530
So now that we know a little bit about the different stages of sleep in a little

71
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:15.970
bit about how it's measured using Eeg,

72
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.360
I want to take us into a journey through the different stages of sleep.

73
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.920
And each of these stages that we're going to walk through really provides these

74
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:28.720
vital functions for our biology as human beings as well as we're going to see

75
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.670
for our emotional wellbeing as well.

76
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.930
So if we start with our journey through sleep,
I want to start with stage one.

77
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.180
So you can see it highlighted here.

78
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.100
It's highlighting what they're called theta waves.

79
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:41.860
And these are again the patterns of electrical brain activity.

80
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.970
Better attain using an EEG measurement,
a hookup that we saw earlier,

81
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.390
stage ones really interesting.
It's often called the gateway to sleep.

82
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.500
So this is at the very beginning of your sleep cycle.

83
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.620
And here most people,
if you awakened them,

84
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.680
they'll actually report that they've been awake the entire time.

85
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.570
So it's this gateway where people,
if they're aroused,

86
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.560
they don't actually quite recognize or realize that they were asleep in the

87
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:08.470
first place.
So it's kind of an entryway into sleep.

88
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.990
We then move to stage two,

89
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:14.860
and here is where we really think of sleep beginning,
right?

90
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.790
So here what you see is that what are called k complexes.

91
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.210
So these are large brainwaves in response to environmental stimuli.

92
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.440
So in other words,

93
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.400
our brain is really still responding to things going on in the environment.

94
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.150
You can see these little spindles here in k complexes as well.

95
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.900
And what's really interesting about the k complexities is that the name actually

96
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:39.730
came from a time when a person was in stage two sleep and someone was knocking

97
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:43.960
at the door and you would see these large brainwave responses in response to

98
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:44.800
hearing the knock.

99
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.340
So it just shows that our brain is still responsive and still aware of the

100
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:50.800
environment around it,
even when it's in this,
uh,

101
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.680
initial kind of where sleep begin.
Stage two,

102
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.010
you also see what are called sleep spindles as well.

103
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.250
So sleep spindles are really important for consolidating what we call procedural

104
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:04.670
memory,
such as riding a bike.
And interestingly,

105
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:09.170
the greatest part of sleep spindles is actually in the last part of the night.

106
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.630
So when we wake up too early,

107
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.870
sort of setting our alarm clock before we actually ought to get out of bed,

108
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.340
we lose out on this important consolidation of different kinds of procedural

109
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:24.020
memories.
So here's stage two,
let's now move on to stages three and four,

110
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:28.790
what we call Delta sleep,
right?
And these are the deep sleep stages.

111
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.480
So here you can see the pattern of brain waves.
They look really different.

112
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:36.620
So you're seeing these big brainwave amplitudes,
right?
Um,

113
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:40.790
so what's happening here is all your neurons are firing in synchrony and it's

114
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:42.440
not that you have more activity per se,

115
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:45.260
but they're just all kind of lining up and firing together.

116
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.940
So these stages of deep sleep are vitally important for muscle growth,

117
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.010
repair and sort of general body regenesis.
Um,

118
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.910
and you see here that athletes and young kids actually experience a greater

119
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.500
frequency and percentage of these critical deep stages of sleep.

120
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.330
And then we turned to rem at the very bottom here,

121
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.490
and I put it in red font here because what we know to date is that a lot of when

122
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:14.510
we think of emotion,

123
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.190
it seems that a big portion of our emotion processing occurs during rem sleep in

124
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:21.620
particular.
So if you see a bottom,
the,

125
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:23.930
the waves look really different for rem sleep,
right?

126
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.370
What you're seeing here are these kind of low,
low amplitude waves,

127
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:32.720
really jagged and you have random bursts of eye movement during rem as well.

128
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.950
So hence we place electrodes around the eyes as well as you put electrodes on

129
00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:38.970
the job because you see,
um,

130
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.370
muscle movement that becomes completely unsuppressed during this phase,
right?

131
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.361
And so again,

132
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:48.320
we know that rem is not only important for cognitive functioning such as memory

133
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:49.190
consolidation,

134
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.460
but it seems vitally important for emotional processing and consolidation.

135
00:07:53.461 --> 00:07:56.750
So we'll think about this further as we go through our journey through sleep.

136
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.580
But really focus on rem is perhaps the most critical of all these phases when it

137
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:03.230
comes to emotion processing.

138
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.470
Another really important component of sleep is that it has a timing or a or a

139
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:12.020
clock,
right?
We call it a circadian rhythm.

140
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:16.220
So we know that humans and many other animals have this what we call internal

141
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:17.480
biological clock.

142
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.780
And this clock operates on a cycle of just over 24 hours and environmental cues

143
00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:28.100
such as light especially serve to help us reset our clock and keeping it in time

144
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:30.590
with the natural kind of day and night cycles.

145
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.880
This clock helps direct things like the rhythmic secretion of hormones like

146
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:35.540
Melatonin,

147
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.040
which many of you have probably heard in association with sleep and Melatonin as

148
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:42.680
we know,
importantly influences our sleep cycle.

149
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.370
So if this biological clock gets out of phase with the environment,

150
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.920
various types of sleep problems can result.

151
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:51.260
So we see things called delayed phase syndrome.

152
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.350
These are people who maybe can't fall asleep until three or 4:00 AM and really

153
00:08:55.351 --> 00:08:59.460
naturally don't wake up until maybe 12 1:00 PM in the afternoon.

154
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.550
And for them that's their sleep cycle.
But you know,

155
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:06.270
when it comes to having them sort of integrate with the natural kind of nine to

156
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:09.750
five schedule that many of us have in the world,
that can be very difficult.

157
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:13.560
But it just goes to show that we have these internal biological clocks and that

158
00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:15.480
sleep has a very particular timing.

159
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.840
There's a timing that's associated with your natural synchrony,

160
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:23.520
your biological clock,
um,
as well as external cues like day and night.

161
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:29.250
So we've done a brief intro into sleep and now I want to turn to what?
Good.

162
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:32.160
Asleep for emotion.
So let's,
let's look at this here.

163
00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:36.060
What is the evidence that really tells us that something about sleep can play an

164
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:39.120
incredibly vital role in our emotional health and wellbeing?

165
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.130
So here I have this little circle here to suggest that emotion and sleep have

166
00:09:44.131 --> 00:09:47.690
this really intricate,
you know,
by directional relationships.

167
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.900
So while we know that emotional intensity affects how well we're able to go to

168
00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:54.000
sleep,
so for emotionally aroused or upset,

169
00:09:54.001 --> 00:09:55.890
we have a more difficult time falling asleep,

170
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.760
but we also know it's a two way street,
right?
And that sleep also,
you know,

171
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.040
causally influences emotion as well.

172
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.720
But only until recently did we really understand how sleep and emotion were

173
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:08.010
interrelated.
Right?

174
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:13.230
So let's look into this here and see to what extent do emotion and sleep

175
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.670
bi-directionally influenced one another.
So what good asleep,

176
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.620
I'm going to start with the first example.
So one way in which,
uh,

177
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:26.160
sleep is good for us emotionally is that sleep helps us encode emotional

178
00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:26.994
memories.

179
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:32.450
So what we see here is a really interesting model that was proposed by Matt

180
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.920
Walker,
what he called the sleep to forget model.

181
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:39.090
So Matt Walker is a professor of psychology at UC Berkeley who was suggested

182
00:10:39.091 --> 00:10:43.320
that rem sleep actually allows us to maintain what he called an emotional

183
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:48.210
homeostasis.
So in his sleep to forget model of emotion memories,

184
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.380
he has you think about a time,
for example,
recalling when you know,

185
00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:55.680
there was an emotional memory and it didn't feel as intense as when you first

186
00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:57.150
experienced it,
right?

187
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:01.440
And he suggests that what rem sleep does is it actually activates brain

188
00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:04.080
structures associated with emotion,

189
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.640
but does so in a way that kind of deactivates the charge or takes that emotional

190
00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:11.460
sting off of the memory that occurred during daytime.

191
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.870
So this is how we suggest that sleep is almost like a form of overnight therapy.

192
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:21.230
So in a way we almost sleep to kind of decrease or forget the emotional tone of

193
00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:23.820
a memory that occurred prior to sleep.

194
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.230
So you sleep to forget the emotional sting of a memory he would say.

195
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.710
And here this is another interesting study that looks at the effect of sleep,

196
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.730
um,
on different kinds of memory.
Um,
so what you're going to see here,

197
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:43.230
if you look at the graph,
is that we have both sleep and sleep deprived groups.

198
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:47.040
So the sleep deprive groups are here in white and what you see is that sleep

199
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:51.090
deprived groups actually do more poorly at and coding or remembering emotional

200
00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:55.660
memories,
especially positive ones.
Then those who are not sleep deprived.

201
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.600
So if you look here on the graph on the left,

202
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.130
what you see here is that are sleep deprived group and white actually does much

203
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:06.070
poorer in recalling different kinds of emotional memories.

204
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:10.180
And in particular for positive memories as you see here on the right hand side

205
00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:12.800
of the left graph under B,
um,

206
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.390
we also see similar types of effects for negative and neutral memories.

207
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:19.990
But it really seems to be the case that when you undergo sleep deprivation,

208
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.840
you performed much more poorly at remembering the content of emotional memories

209
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.180
compared to a control group in pink that was not sleep deprived.

210
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:29.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

211
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:34.730
<v 0>So what in what other ways can sleep be good or what will go to sleep again for</v>

212
00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.350
emotion.
So here's a second example,

213
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:42.630
and here we see that sleep also promotes and facilitates our ability to harness

214
00:12:42.631 --> 00:12:46.820
or regulate our emotions.
So here

215
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.600
what I want you to pay attention to,

216
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.110
this is a study that was done that looked at,
um,
uh,

217
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:57.970
one week experiment in lab sleep restriction.
So what you had yours,

218
00:12:57.971 --> 00:13:01.750
participants who were restricted to sleeping only four to five hours each night

219
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:06.550
across the one week period.
Right.
Um,
and what you see here,
um,

220
00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:10.010
really interesting is that participants who underwent this,
um,

221
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.250
sort of what they call partial sleep restriction,
um,

222
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:17.140
that they actually listed more cognitive and emotional complaints,

223
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.410
sort of more emotional instability or a lability,
um,

224
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:25.430
compared to control partisans who did not undergo the partial sleep restriction.

225
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.830
So you can see here,

226
00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:29.890
and we're looking across time at the partial sleep restriction,

227
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.870
you have baseline one and two.

228
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.290
And then the part that's highlighted here in rectangle is when they underwent

229
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:37.630
partial sleep deprivation for a one week period,

230
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.050
you're actually seeing a significant decrease in their emotional wellbeing that

231
00:13:41.051 --> 00:13:45.070
was associated with,
you know,
endorsing cognitive and emotional complaints.

232
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.610
And then our one and two is a recovery phase after they left the lab and they

233
00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:52.480
were able to increase their amount of sleep.
Right.
So asleep goes down,

234
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.780
as you can see in the graph,
what we're seeing is increases in emotion,

235
00:13:55.781 --> 00:13:57.580
self reported emotional disturbance.

236
00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:58.910
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

237
00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:03.620
<v 0>Okay.
We also see interesting studies looking at emotional reactivity,</v>

238
00:14:03.621 --> 00:14:07.430
falling sleep deprivation.
And this is work by Matt Walker's group.

239
00:14:07.431 --> 00:14:12.140
So here this was a neuroimaging study and here he had individuals who underwent

240
00:14:12.141 --> 00:14:14.180
sleep deprivation as well as those who,

241
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.640
what he called a normal sleep comparison group.

242
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:20.900
And he had people come into the lab and undergo a neuro imaging tasks using that

243
00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:21.770
from rice scanner.

244
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.460
And during this task they are asked to view a series of a hundred pictures

245
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.190
ranging from very neutral to very negative.

246
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:35.620
What he found very interesting here is actual brain changes in the context of

247
00:14:35.631 --> 00:14:38.840
viewing emotional images as a function of sleep deprivation.

248
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.680
So here you can see that there was greater emotional reactivity in the brain,

249
00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:44.000
especially in the Amygdala.

250
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.150
So this is again as we talked about earlier in the course of the brain region

251
00:14:47.151 --> 00:14:50.930
that's been associated with both emotional salience as well as negative

252
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.190
responsivity.

253
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.090
And we're seeing greater activation in these subcortical Mig amygdala structures

254
00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:58.830
and sleep deprived compared to a normal sleeper group.

255
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.530
We're also seeing the individuals who've been sleep deprived show less control

256
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.740
over regulating their emotional reactivity in the brain.

257
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:11.030
So it's almost as if we see a loss of connectivity between the Amygdala and the

258
00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:12.590
medial prefrontal Cortex,

259
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:15.980
which as we've talked about earlier in the course is associated with the

260
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:20.900
prefrontal cognitive control associated with successful regulation of emotional

261
00:15:20.901 --> 00:15:21.734
responses.

262
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.660
And here you can see some of his graphs that are depicted here.

263
00:15:27.661 --> 00:15:30.990
We just talked about looking at peak amygdala response and we're seeing

264
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.010
increased the macdill response in our sleep deprived group and read relative to

265
00:15:35.011 --> 00:15:39.480
our normal sleepers in green,
both in the left and right amygdala regions.

266
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:41.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

267
00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.180
<v 0>Um,
and here again is the summary of the findings.
Greater Amygdala reactivity,</v>

268
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.590
decreased connectivity between the Amygdala and medial prefrontal cognitive

269
00:15:49.591 --> 00:15:53.940
control regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex.
Okay.

270
00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:58.320
Um,
and here is just another graph just to show you a little bit about this

271
00:15:58.321 --> 00:16:01.950
disconnect that we've talked about between the Amygdala and the medial

272
00:16:01.951 --> 00:16:05.010
prefrontal cortex in the work by Matt Walker.

273
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.930
And this graph in this slide,
what you see here is that with normal sleep,

274
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:13.830
the medial prefrontal cortex is strongly connected to the Amygdala helping

275
00:16:13.831 --> 00:16:17.280
control and regulate it with inhibitory sorts of processes.

276
00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:18.900
Whereas in without sleep,

277
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:23.130
the medial prefrontal cortex connection seems to be somewhat severed resulting

278
00:16:23.131 --> 00:16:25.860
in what they think of as an overactive emotional brain.

279
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.530
I he all gas and no breaks.

280
00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:29.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

281
00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.520
<v 0>So let's think about what other ways sleep might be good for us.</v>

282
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.120
We've talked about consolidating emotional memories,

283
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.180
emotional reactivity,
emotion regulation,

284
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.750
and finally we'll look at the way in which sleep also influences emotion

285
00:16:43.751 --> 00:16:47.560
recognition.
So again,
this is a study done by Matt Walker,

286
00:16:47.561 --> 00:16:52.360
which is a study looking at the ability to recognize emotional expressions in

287
00:16:52.361 --> 00:16:54.220
the face.
So here,

288
00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:57.850
the bottom kind of take home point from this graph where he looked at people's

289
00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:02.610
ability to accurately recognize emotional faces is that he found that

290
00:17:02.611 --> 00:17:05.710
individuals,
it's called a nap and no nap group.

291
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.540
So he looked at people who didn't,

292
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:11.140
did not sort of engage in these types of napping related behaviors.

293
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.130
So what we see as the no nap group is more sensitive to negative emotional

294
00:17:15.131 --> 00:17:15.964
expressions,

295
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:21.060
including both scared and angry faces in the brown and red columns.

296
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:22.121
However,

297
00:17:22.121 --> 00:17:25.840
what we see here is that the nap group is actually more sensitive to perceiving

298
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.630
happy faces.
So it Matt Walker and college.

299
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.670
<v 1>Yeah.
Okay.
Yep.</v>

300
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.823
Yeah,
yeah.

301
00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.700
<v 0>So here we look at some work on emotional face recognition by Matt Walker.</v>

302
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:47.290
And the bottom line of this graph that you're going to see here is that compare

303
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:52.230
comparing individuals who a nap condition versus those who did not undergo a nap

304
00:17:52.231 --> 00:17:55.410
condition.
We see the following.
So when they no nap group,

305
00:17:55.411 --> 00:17:58.950
what we see is that they're more sensitive to negative emotional face

306
00:17:58.951 --> 00:17:59.730
recognition.

307
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:03.990
So this is evident in both the fearful faces and Brown and the angry faces and

308
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:06.060
red.
Um,
by contrast,

309
00:18:06.061 --> 00:18:10.650
the nab group actually seems more sensitive to perceiving happy faces on the far

310
00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:11.790
right here in the green.

311
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:16.080
So what Matt Walker and colleagues have argued is that sleep seems to reset what

312
00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:19.980
he'd call the magnetic north of our emotional brain compass.

313
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:24.343
<v 1>Okay.</v>

314
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:29.290
<v 0>So in sum,
what we see is that emotion and sleep have an intricate and intimate</v>

315
00:18:29.291 --> 00:18:31.570
relationship with one another.
And in fact,

316
00:18:31.571 --> 00:18:35.650
sleep affects our emotional life in many different ways.

317
00:18:35.651 --> 00:18:40.090
And we've talked about three broad domains today.
So we see that sleep effects,

318
00:18:40.091 --> 00:18:44.830
emotion reactivity as well as regulation,
emotion recognition,

319
00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:49.000
as well as the ability to consolidate vital emotional memories.

320
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.600
So if we conclude with our takeaway questions from today,
there is follows.

321
00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.850
What were the different stages of sleep discussed and which stages were most

322
00:19:00.851 --> 00:19:04.720
critical for emotion processing?
Second,

323
00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.140
how does sleep influence emotional memory processing?

324
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:09.933
And finally,

325
00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:14.830
how does sleep influence emotion regulation and emotion recognition?

326
00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:16.530
<v 1>Okay,</v>

327
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:20.610
<v 0>we now turn from this to our experts and emotion interview series.</v>

328
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

329
00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.640
<v 0>Today for our experts and emotion interview,</v>

330
00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:29.350
we'll be speaking with Dr Ronald Dahl on emotion and sleep in adolescents.

331
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:34.710
Dr Doll is a professor in the school of Public Health and the director of the

332
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.670
Institute of Human Development at the University of California Berkeley.

333
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.750
He obtained his MD and fellowship training and sleep and neuroendocrinology at

334
00:19:40.751 --> 00:19:45.340
the University of Pittsburgh and completed a pediatric residency at Duke

335
00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.320
University at the University of Pittsburgh.

336
00:19:47.321 --> 00:19:51.070
He led a program of clinical research at the interface of child psychiatry,

337
00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.230
pediatrics and psychology,

338
00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:57.610
focusing on the development of sleep and arousal as well as affect regulation

339
00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.100
and the relevance to behavioral and emotional health.

340
00:20:00.101 --> 00:20:03.160
And children and adolescents at UC Berkeley.

341
00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:07.360
His current work is now extending these lines of investigation to bridge from

342
00:20:07.361 --> 00:20:08.500
developmental,
social,

343
00:20:08.501 --> 00:20:12.070
and affect of neuroscience to address a broader range of clinical,

344
00:20:12.071 --> 00:20:16.690
educational and social policy issues with a primary focus on adolescence.

345
00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.950
So I now turn to a very special experts in emotion interview together with Dr

346
00:20:20.951 --> 00:20:21.640
Ronald Dahl.
