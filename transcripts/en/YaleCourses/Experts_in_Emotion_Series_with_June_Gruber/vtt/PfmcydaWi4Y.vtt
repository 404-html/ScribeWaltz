00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.400
Today we'll be speaking with doctor Sherry Johnson,

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.700
a professor of psychology at the University of California Berkeley and the

3
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:08.220
director of the cow mania or comm program.

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.750
Dr. Johnson has conducted research on psychological facets of bipolar disorder

5
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:14.340
over the past 20 years.

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.030
Her work has been funded by the National Alliance for research on schizophrenia

7
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:20.490
and depression,
the National Institute of Mental Health,

8
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.880
the National Science Foundation and the National Cancer Institute.

9
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.620
She has published over 150 manuscripts including publications in leading

10
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:32.910
journals such as the Journal of Abnormal Psychology and the American Journal of

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.270
Psychiatry.

12
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.250
Dr. Johnson is also the co editor or coauthor of five books including emotion,

13
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:41.880
psychopathology,
and a best selling textbook on abnormal psychology.

14
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.200
She's also a fellow of the Association for Behavioral Medicine Research and the

15
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:47.880
American psychological society.

16
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.070
So now turn to a very special experts in emotion interview on emotion and

17
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.510
bipolar disorder with Doctor Sherry Johnson.

18
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.430
So welcome Sherry.
Thanks for speaking with us today.
Thanks for having me,
Dan.

19
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.580
Well,
thank you.

20
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.410
So I thought what we could first start off is asking a bit about what got you

21
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.870
hooked or interested in emotion in the first place,

22
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:10.760
sort of where did it all begin for you?

23
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.170
<v 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.170
well it started with a fascination was bipolar disorder and for me,

25
00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:22.420
watching people as they went from there kind of baseline states into manic

26
00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:24.610
states,
there's um,

27
00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:27.570
so much emotionality about the manic states that it,

28
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.240
you can't help them be fast dated when you watch it.
Um,

29
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.640
and similarly as they go through the depression,

30
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.810
there's a lot of questions about what's happening with emotions during that

31
00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:38.261
phase.

32
00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:43.261
And so it really was just kind of one of those clinical experiences that drove

33
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:48.010
the question of,
okay,
how do we understand this from a research perspective?

34
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.820
<v 0>Excellent.
So speaking of a research perspective than,</v>

35
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:54.150
I wanted to ask you a few questions about your research in this domain.

36
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:55.380
So I mean,

37
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.640
you are widely known as this leading figure and trying to understand the nature

38
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:02.040
of emotional disturbance in bipolar disorder.

39
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.180
And I wonder if you could describe a little bit about your work that's looked
at,

40
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.830
um,
associations between heightened sensitivity to rewards and heightened goal

41
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.820
setting in this population?
Sure.
Um,

42
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.590
<v 1>so I think that,
um,</v>

43
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.460
what we've seen over the last 15 or so years is pretty consistent evidence that

44
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:26.480
people with bipolar disorder,
even when they're well,

45
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.810
um,
have this,
um,

46
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.590
greater response rate or reactivity to the idea of an approaching reward or

47
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:37.940
having just received a reward.
Um,

48
00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:40.820
so we think of that as elevated reward sensitivity.

49
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.620
You can see it even in people who haven't yet developed the diagnosis who just

50
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:50.621
have kind of minor symptoms and Lauren l his work has taken that further to say

51
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:52.100
it predicts onset.

52
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.510
So we think reward sensitivity is really related to the disorder.

53
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.940
The new,
I'm kind of,

54
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.280
I'm on is this idea that reward sensitivity is too broad.
It's just,

55
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:06.430
it's a huge part of your motivational system in the brain.

56
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:11.380
And I don't think all parts of broken in bipolar disorder.
So the question is,

57
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:13.240
what's really broken about this system?

58
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.540
Where is it disrupted in bipolar disorder and us?
So far?

59
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:19.330
I'm going to put my money on three pieces.
Um,

60
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.610
and that's not to say this is the whole kit and caboodle,

61
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:23.830
like we're still really trying to figure this out.

62
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:27.160
But three themes we've seen again and again.
Um,

63
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.670
the first is that people with bipolar disorder set much,

64
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:34.990
much more difficult goals for themselves and they'll pursue their goals even as

65
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:39.550
the going gets tough.
Um,
so one is high goal setting,

66
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.910
the other is and the,
and I'll say about a high goal setting,

67
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:47.080
it seems to be kind of there at baseline in the background.

68
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.110
It's not just a feature of the manic episodes.

69
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.790
Then there are other things that sort of seem to change in this state dependent

70
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:59.560
way as people are going through six s's and happy periods in their lives that

71
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:01.290
people with bipolar disorder,
we're relaxed,

72
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.300
spawn more intensively for a small shift and success are positive mood and two

73
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:09.520
areas where we see a lot of that kind of reactivity.

74
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.470
One is confidence.

75
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.360
So given us a small success that kind of leap upward into the million things
you,

76
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:19.750
they feel like they could conquer.
Um,
so that's really,

77
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:24.130
I think an important part of the puzzle because people then will take risks.
Um,

78
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.110
and then so related to confidence,

79
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:28.930
that upper bubble we're studying and you and I are studying this together.

80
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.080
So impulsivity,
um,

81
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.180
so becoming less guarded,
less careful about what you would do,

82
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.280
um,
being a little less cautious in the way you would think about situations.

83
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.690
And I think that's a big part we're seeing of kind of what happens with the

84
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:51.691
losses that people go through with them as they begin to get a little higher and

85
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:56.350
higher or doing things that later they really,
really regret.

86
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.150
So to recap,

87
00:04:58.151 --> 00:05:01.180
the three parts of rewards setting that we're putting our money on right now,

88
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:05.800
it would be high goal setting confidence and impulsivity.
I mean,

89
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:09.250
it's so fascinating when you think of these three facets and it makes me wonder,

90
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:09.491
you know,

91
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:13.540
to what extent do you think they were late to predicting clinical course over

92
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:18.460
time?
I do in very different ways.

93
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:23.461
So high goal setting looks like it's got good sides and bad sides.

94
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.510
And that's probably true for all of us when we,
you know,

95
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.310
kind of have our interim questions,
right?
Our big dreams.

96
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:35.311
So being ambitious can spur great things.

97
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.040
People get mobilized to do things they wouldn't otherwise do.

98
00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:43.630
They go after the big dreams that make a difference in life and in the world.
Um,

99
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.400
and so one of the things that we're excited about is we have some data we are

100
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.460
just writing up that says that those ambitions are a big part of the creativity

101
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:57.980
we see in bipolar disorder wanting more.
You know,
and more,
it's a,

102
00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:02.140
it's a helpful thing,
but on the other hand it's also a predictor of,
um,

103
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.200
more severe course of mania over time.
Um,
so that's troubling.

104
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.010
The confidence and the impulsivity.

105
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.460
Those seem to relate a lot to the functional impairments we see in bipolar

106
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:13.851
disorder.

107
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:17.690
So I don't think that they have so much drive the symptoms as they do the kind

108
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:19.650
of,
um,

109
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.960
the mistakes people make when they get symptomatic that they later then feel

110
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:27.780
like,
oh,
I just lost this money,
or I just had trouble in relationship.
Right.

111
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.690
Just did something I really,
really regret.

112
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.940
So different strands taking us different directions,
um,

113
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.970
figuring it out.
Yeah.

114
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.240
<v 0>And,</v>

115
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.600
and what's really cool about what you're doing is you're not only documenting

116
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:43.610
these phenomena are these different facets.

117
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:46.370
You're also relating it to clinical course as you just spoke about.

118
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.400
And you've developed this really elegant and empirically validated treatment to

119
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:54.050
help individuals with bipolar disorder,
you know,

120
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:59.051
assisting them in managing and DNA intensifying these kind of overly positive

121
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.050
goal seeking states,
um,

122
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.630
which you focused on in your lab at UC Berkeley as part of the cow mania or comm

123
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:08.270
program.
And I wondered,
you know,
in this vein,

124
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:12.290
if you could tell us a little bit more about what are the essential therapeutic

125
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:15.350
ingredients of this intervention?
Because I think for many people,

126
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:19.790
the idea of trying to deintensify or calm down seems a bit counterintuitive,

127
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:21.230
right?
At first glance.

128
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.810
<v 1>Yeah.
As in are we the killed Julie Team?
Yeah.
Um,</v>

129
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.820
yeah.
Um,

130
00:07:27.821 --> 00:07:32.290
so we're early on in gathering empirical data and I think that's going to be a

131
00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:35.050
big part of the next 10 years.
Um,

132
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.370
but what we try to do as a multistep process,

133
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:43.600
first we try and just share what we know from research with people with bipolar

134
00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:48.430
disorder.
Um,
and we don't assume that our model fits for everybody.

135
00:07:48.431 --> 00:07:52.540
So we'll give measures and we'll do interviews to find out if if the person

136
00:07:52.541 --> 00:07:56.230
we're working with has high goal setting or goes through spurts of confidence or

137
00:07:56.231 --> 00:08:01.120
has these periods of impulsivity or get so really involved and kind of gold for

138
00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:01.541
suits.

139
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:06.220
So we figure out which of these components they go through and they believe are

140
00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:07.510
relevant for them.

141
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.890
The other thing we've learned over time is you can't just kind of wipe these
out.

142
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.120
These are often really valued parts of a person's identity.

143
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:17.290
Um,

144
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.430
and so we embed everything in a motivational interviewing perspective of helping

145
00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:22.270
the person look at,
okay,

146
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:25.540
what's great about having those big dreams and goals for you,

147
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.350
but also where it is,
whereas it hurts you and what's the balance?

148
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.680
And only after looking at that balance,
do we think about,

149
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.000
is this something you want to moderate?
So far,

150
00:08:37.001 --> 00:08:39.700
everyone we've taken through that process and sort of saying yes,

151
00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:40.930
but it's not as linear.

152
00:08:40.931 --> 00:08:44.440
She would think they're awesome parts of those dreams and ambitions and hopes

153
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:48.610
they really want to preserve and other parts they want to down regulate.
Mm.

154
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.090
Um,
so for any given module,

155
00:08:52.091 --> 00:08:56.250
once we kind of have an agreement on is this an honored we want to try and

156
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:59.970
tackle,
then we'll come into behavioral strategies.
Um,

157
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.990
and what's fascinating is that a lot of times the person was bipolar disorder

158
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:05.960
will have some strategies that your sleeves,

159
00:09:05.961 --> 00:09:10.500
so we start by gathering data on how well and when those work and then look for,

160
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:13.560
okay,
how do we need to supplement this or how do we need to add to this?

161
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.940
And what's happened for us is I feel like what we are as a kind of compendium of

162
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:22.680
all these great tools we're hearing from the people with bipolar disorder,
um,

163
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.950
because people develop their own idiosyncratic strategies for kind of down

164
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:30.930
regulating and we get to hear more and more and more of those.

165
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:34.050
And we're getting a longer and longer list of what people might do.

166
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.140
And try and how it works.
Um,

167
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.450
so it's again,

168
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.220
very driven by clinical observations against the kind of research.

169
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.220
<v 0>I mean it's lovely.
It's like the perfect clinical science model,
right?</v>

170
00:09:48.221 --> 00:09:52.090
That by directional relationship between the science and the patient's right in

171
00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:52.924
front of you.

172
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.720
<v 1>We hope.
Yeah,
hope.</v>

173
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.770
I mean at its best it's really fun to try and straddle between those two worlds.

174
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.000
Um,
for me,

175
00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:05.720
I think a lot of the motivation for doing research is always kind of coming back

176
00:10:05.721 --> 00:10:09.710
to this question of okay,
does it look like it's going to be helpful someday?
Um,

177
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.880
and when it is the referral,
when it isn't,

178
00:10:12.881 --> 00:10:16.270
then we get to go back in and study a little harder and think a little harder.
So

179
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.700
<v 0>do you think it's possible that these kinds of techniques could be applied to</v>

180
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:23.370
individuals without a history of bipolar disorder?

181
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.170
<v 1>Um,
that's a really fascinating question.
You and I,</v>

182
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:33.190
I'm the academic communities are surrounded by hyper ambitious people who've

183
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:36.190
done well for being hyper ambitious,
um,

184
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.000
but often then also pay a cost.

185
00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:43.680
And I think I'm kind of fascinated by go regulation in the general population.

186
00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:47.850
I would love to study that more.
We're starting up a new study of intrapreneurs.

187
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.630
Um,
another place where,
you know,
startups in California,

188
00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:55.590
it makes a huge difference to kind of have a big dream and a hope and an

189
00:10:55.591 --> 00:10:59.230
ambition.
Um,
we don't,

190
00:10:59.231 --> 00:11:03.130
we haven't been injured as far into that area in our research as I would like
to,

191
00:11:03.131 --> 00:11:05.140
but I certainly think it's fascinating.

192
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.551
<v 0>That's so interesting.</v>

193
00:11:06.551 --> 00:11:09.700
You'll have to keep us posted on what happens with the entrepreneurs.

194
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:14.120
<v 1>Yeah.
I don't think many of us,
uh,
I don't think,
you know,
I mean,</v>

195
00:11:14.121 --> 00:11:15.830
it's a great example of for many of them,

196
00:11:15.831 --> 00:11:19.800
they're not going to get one to downregulate.
Right,
right.
Um,

197
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.180
there are these adaptive qualities to reaching for the stars.
So,

198
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:26.810
<v 0>no.</v>

199
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.410
So the last thing I wanted to ask you is perhaps one of my most favorite things

200
00:11:30.411 --> 00:11:31.101
to talk with you about,

201
00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:34.340
which is some of the work we've done together since you've been such an amazing

202
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:35.930
mentor to me in this area.

203
00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:38.390
And I've loved the work that we've gotten to do together.

204
00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.650
And in the years that we've been trying to understand positive emotion and

205
00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:44.310
bipolar disorder,
I mean,

206
00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:46.820
when we've looked at the broad landscape of positive emotion,

207
00:11:46.821 --> 00:11:49.130
that seems that not all positive emotions are elevated,

208
00:11:49.131 --> 00:11:51.650
but it's a kind of a more nuanced profile,
right?

209
00:11:51.651 --> 00:11:54.580
Like we're seeing heightened emotions are focused on the south,

210
00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:58.060
like pride or reward,
you know,
like joy and enthusiasm.

211
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.070
And I just wondered,
you know,

212
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.180
how do you think that seeing that not all positive emotions are elevated,

213
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:08.080
but it's some and not others?
Um,
how does this change,

214
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:12.250
like the landscape of how we think about what bipolar disorder really is?

215
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:18.070
<v 1>I think it's a fascinating question and I've loved the work.
I mean,</v>

216
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.790
I really think you've spearheaded,
um,
uh,

217
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.460
kind of understanding of emotion and landscape more than,
than anybody has.

218
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:29.461
And the answers are really fun and interesting is this sense that it's,

219
00:12:29.801 --> 00:12:30.310
um,

220
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:35.310
the joy they're experiencing is very tethered to making progress on a goal and

221
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:38.770
feeling like they're doing well in something.

222
00:12:38.771 --> 00:12:42.880
So this sense of pride and euphoria,
but very,

223
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.740
I'm so focused.
And what's missing in that profile?
What's not as heightened,

224
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:49.150
um,

225
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:54.150
is the sense of other kinds of positive emotions versus like love and

226
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:55.880
connectedness.
Um,

227
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.780
I been fascinated by that because I think we might have tools at our disposal in

228
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.940
basic science to do something about that.

229
00:13:03.941 --> 00:13:07.820
So to help people refocus on these other experiences of happiness.

230
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.480
So thinking about it,

231
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:15.580
your work and your kind of understanding this emotion to mean helps us think,

232
00:13:15.581 --> 00:13:20.290
how do we help people gain better control in a way that's not about being a

233
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:24.190
killjoy?
It's not about taking away all forms of happiness,

234
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.660
it's about deemphasizing the happiness that's about your own self

235
00:13:28.661 --> 00:13:33.661
accomplishments and appreciating more of the happy as that might be about the

236
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:35.290
small good moments in life.

237
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:39.400
I kind of mindful approach to appreciate and interpersonal connectedness,

238
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.580
nature,
other small calm.

239
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.330
I'm good moments.
Um,
so we,

240
00:13:46.331 --> 00:13:49.900
I'm part of the collaborative team now that's looking at what could we do on

241
00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:53.260
that front to help people with bipolar disorder rebalance.

242
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.600
So your collaborator in mind Juni Moscow.

243
00:13:56.601 --> 00:14:00.610
It's is really spearheading a lot of this and I'm very excited to see how it

244
00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:01.444
goes.

245
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:01.891
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

246
00:14:01.891 --> 00:14:04.950
It makes me think too about some of these interventions we see that are focused

247
00:14:04.951 --> 00:14:08.610
on promoting gratitude's.
So sort of these other focus,
positive feelings.

248
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.510
Might this be the kind of positivity you want to build while you're sort of,

249
00:14:12.511 --> 00:14:13.400
you know,
you know,

250
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.820
calming or soothing at Vino attenuating other kinds of more self focused,

251
00:14:17.821 --> 00:14:20.120
high arousal kinds of states.

252
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.310
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,</v>

253
00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:28.060
I wonder about with all of this is how much is the issue,
you know,

254
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.380
can we help people frame the issue is not about being happy or joyful.

255
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:36.200
The issue is about being kind of hyper aroused and sell focused.
Um,

256
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.640
so right now,
um,
you know,

257
00:14:40.641 --> 00:14:43.940
I'm working with this team of people to try and think.
How do you,

258
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.300
how do you develop the words and language to share that with the person who's

259
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.710
bipolar disorder to give them tools?
Um,

260
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.390
yeah,
I think there are clinical implications for open.

261
00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.360
<v 0>So I mean,
thinking about all the work you've done in bipolar disorder,
um,</v>

262
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.020
both experimental work.
The clinical work and the intervention work.

263
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:08.850
When you look into the future horizon,
sort of,
where do you see the field headed?

264
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.560
<v 1>Oh,
that's a great question.
I mean,</v>

265
00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:17.561
I think that you're a good example of future directions in that what you've done

266
00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:21.380
is taken basic theory of what we're seeing at the surface and said,

267
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.280
how do we bring in more basic research tools to test this?

268
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.920
And that's what I think all of us need to be doing.

269
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.560
So how do we integrate this with neuroscience,

270
00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:34.180
how we integrate this with psychophysiology,
um,

271
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.550
how do we bring it together with the work that's going on in kind of

272
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.540
neuroscience and psychiatry.
At the other end of the spectrum though,

273
00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:45.200
I think that it raises a million questions about broader social context and the

274
00:15:45.201 --> 00:15:46.730
culture.
And I mean,

275
00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.760
isn't that kind of part of the fun thing about emotion science,

276
00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:52.820
FX or science is that you get to spin and all those directions.

277
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:56.780
It's this great way branching from culture to subjective experience to

278
00:15:56.781 --> 00:15:58.100
neuroscience.
Um,

279
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:03.130
and I think all of those paradigms need to be applied and considered for us to

280
00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:05.780
really understand bipolar disorder.

281
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.670
<v 0>So then when you have students approach you who are thinking about embarking in</v>

282
00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:12.370
this field,
the right emotion and mood disorders,

283
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.530
what advice do you have for them,

284
00:16:14.531 --> 00:16:18.070
sort of where do you think they should set their sights as they look forward?

285
00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.460
<v 1>Well,
first I think they should come on in.</v>

286
00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:24.200
There's still a lot of questions and um,

287
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:28.630
I think it's an exciting area to be in with a lot of new discoveries and

288
00:16:28.631 --> 00:16:30.400
technologies on the horizon.

289
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.850
I always think that for somebody entering the field,

290
00:16:33.851 --> 00:16:38.851
perhaps the biggest goal is to find a question that they are in love with.

291
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:39.581
You know,

292
00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:42.910
the kind of question that you wake up in the morning thinking I wonder if that

293
00:16:42.911 --> 00:16:43.960
works like this.

294
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:48.990
And not to count on that coming from anywhere but sort of inside of them.

295
00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:53.770
Um,
and that's hard.
It takes a certain amount of patients.

296
00:16:53.771 --> 00:16:58.771
Like you might read things for a year or two that bore you don't say never.

297
00:16:59.711 --> 00:17:04.690
Never.
I,
I've had those moments.
Um,
and so,

298
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:05.200
um,

299
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.200
having the patience to find something that just really makes your mind want to

300
00:17:10.211 --> 00:17:12.650
tackle a question.
And then,
um,

301
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:17.560
not being afraid to find the collaborators and mentors they need to get the

302
00:17:17.561 --> 00:17:20.530
skills to learn whatever technologies it's going to take.

303
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.920
Because I think our science is increasingly complex,
um,

304
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:28.450
and having kind of a hub of people that you count on together to brainstorm and

305
00:17:28.451 --> 00:17:32.590
problem solve,
um,
is going to be,
I think,
the strategy of the future.

306
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:37.240
So that would be my advice.
But thank you so much,
Sherri,

307
00:17:37.241 --> 00:17:42.130
for speaking with us today.
It's,
it's delightful to talk to you as always,

308
00:17:42.131 --> 00:17:42.964
and good luck

309
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.320
<v 0>series.
Thank you.</v>

310
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.190
So this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Doctor Sherry Johnson

311
00:17:48.191 --> 00:17:50.340
from the university,
California at Berkeley.
