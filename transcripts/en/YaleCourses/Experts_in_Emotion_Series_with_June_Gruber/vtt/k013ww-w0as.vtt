1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.330
Welcome to human emotion.
Um,

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.930
today we're going to continue our discussion about this really mysterious and

3
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:11.931
exciting kind of emotion that really seems to be about ourselves.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.480
So here we're gonna to have a journey into this idea of what our emotions that

5
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:22.500
are about the self.
What are these things we call self conscious emotions.

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.660
And today we'll focus in particular,

7
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:28.770
as you can see here on pride and embarrassment.

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.200
So I,
you'll think about,

9
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.890
and I'll have you think a little bit later about examples in your own lives and

10
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:38.970
where you can remember feeling really proud or perhaps tragically embarrassed.

11
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.850
And what was it that was about the self here?

12
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:45.270
In what way did our self awareness play a role in these emotions?

13
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.010
And what kinds of social consequences did it have for us to feel proud or to

14
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:54.480
feel embarrassed?
So again,
what we're going to do here,

15
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:59.010
this is part of a two module series where today we're going to focus on pride

16
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:03.180
and embarrassment.
And after that we'll turn our attention to shame and guilt.

17
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.201
So again,

18
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:09.180
let's start here today by delving into the nature of exactly what is pride and

19
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:13.260
what is embarrassment.
So I want to start first with pride.

20
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.310
So we think of pride.

21
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.560
What I'd like to have you do is to draw an experience from your own daily life.

22
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.780
So I want you to take a moment and take out a piece of paper and a pen and think

23
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:32.610
about a time that you remember feeling particularly proud.
Perhaps you,

24
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.350
you know,
um,
you know,

25
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:39.351
won an award or gained admission to college or did something that you felt

26
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:40.650
really good about.

27
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.250
So identify one moment in your life that really stood out to you where you

28
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:47.310
remember feeling proud.
And while you're thinking about this,

29
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:51.960
what I'd like you to do is to think a bit about sort of what were the contexts

30
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.340
in which you felt proud.

31
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.610
What kind of thoughts were going through your mind as you were feeling proud?

32
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.820
How did you feel about your relationship within your immediate social circle and

33
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:07.060
what consequences did it have for you at the end?
After feeling proud?
What,

34
00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:11.880
what changed in your social circle?
So take a moment,
just a couple minutes,

35
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.440
you can pause this video,

36
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.650
write down your own sort of memoir of a time you remember feeling proud and when

37
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:22.200
you're done you can pick up with the video and we'll go through some of the

38
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:27.201
scientific discoveries about what pride really is and what it looks like and why

39
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:31.140
we have it in the first place.
Okay.

40
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.740
So we talked in the last module about briefly the characteristics of pride that

41
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:41.610
it's elicited by a personal sense of achievement or accomplishment.

42
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.020
That the behavior is really focused on advertising.
You're elevated status,

43
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:50.490
sort of showing other people you've done something important.
And as a result,

44
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.150
um,

45
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.410
the idea or consequence that can often emerge as sort of gaining respect within

46
00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:59.950
your social hierarchy or maybe sort of gaining some sort of elevated social

47
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:03.310
status.
So these are the characteristics of pride.

48
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.110
Now when we think about pride,
we want to ask ourselves,
what does it look like?

49
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:12.010
So these are a couple images we started out with in the last lecture where we

50
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:15.460
looked at this,
you know,
human body builder as well as a chimpanzee.

51
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.720
And if we look at other examples,
um,
of people who have won,
you know,

52
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:22.600
metals or achieve different kinds of accomplishments,

53
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.200
we start to see some similarities across these pictures.

54
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.590
And you have to start to ask yourself,
you know,
well,

55
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.650
what does pride look like?
Um,

56
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:35.440
if it doesn't have a certain sort of signature on the face,

57
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.610
doesn't seem to have some unique displays of its own.
Right?

58
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:41.200
So if you look at these pictures here,

59
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.920
what is it that you're noticing all three have in common,

60
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.600
very different circumstances,

61
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:50.680
very different people or species in the case of the chimpanzee.

62
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.880
But yet there seems to be some common themes across these three pictures.

63
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.800
So this was a question that Dr Jessica Tracy first began to examine when she

64
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:03.550
wanted to understand this question of what does pride look like?

65
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.080
Does it have a unique signature?
And so in her research,

66
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:12.700
she systematically documented the nature of what pride looks like.

67
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.680
And here as you can see,
she identified three core features of the pride display.

68
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.570
So the first component of what pride looks like is that you see the head and

69
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:26.590
neck tilted slightly back as this woman in the photos demonstrating.

70
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.490
And the function of this is to sort of look above other people,

71
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.520
to let them know that you've done something important.

72
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.590
The second is the sense of making the self look a bigger than life.

73
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:41.080
So you're trying to expand your posture,

74
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.180
sort of increase your sense of body mass.
So you're drawing your shoulders back.

75
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.770
Um,
and this is supposed to signal a sense of social dominance and also draw

76
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:52.120
attention to the self.

77
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.980
And then finally what you see is a very slight smile.
Um,

78
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.000
so this is supposed to indicate that you're not just being dominant in some sort

79
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:04.090
of aggressive way,
but you want to draw attention to others.

80
00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:05.440
You want to signal dominance,

81
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:09.070
but in a way that is prosocial by showing the slight smile,

82
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.260
you want to let people know that you're friendly,

83
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:15.220
that you're still part of their group,
and that you want to be socially cohesive.

84
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.600
So it's an interesting balance between showing someone you know that you've done

85
00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:22.390
something important and you're sort of elevating yourself.

86
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.860
But while still maintaining that subtle smile that lets them know you're still

87
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:29.830
friendly and you still want to be part of their group,

88
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:31.360
you still want to be their friend.

89
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.440
So these are kind of the three kind of core features of what pride looks like.

90
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.740
Um,
Dr Jessica,

91
00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:43.210
Tracy wanted to ask this question though is when we document these features of

92
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:47.650
what pride looks like,
can we actually recognize pride and other people?

93
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.430
So you might remember the pictures we showed you earlier of the bodybuilder,

94
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.380
the chimpanzee,
you know,

95
00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:57.980
the Olympic athletes and as well as the pictures here that used in her own

96
00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:02.510
research where she tried to ask this question of are we able to recognize pride?

97
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.030
So here in her study she had participants,

98
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.740
you photos just like these and she was asked,
um,
you know,

99
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.970
in an open ended way,
simply when people saw these pictures,

100
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.360
they were supposed to,
um,
you know,

101
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.450
provide an answer to the question of which emotion is being expressed in this

102
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:23.960
photo.
Right?
So they could just answer this in an open ended format.

103
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.310
And what she found is that 89% said that these were demonstrations of pride

104
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.400
should they showed this remarkably high recognition rate of 89% of people for

105
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:41.900
this open ended question would note that they recognize that the display of

106
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:45.890
pride in these photos,
um,
and this was consistent across different genders.

107
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:49.790
As you can see here,
these are the actual photo she used in her own research.

108
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.470
Um,
and if you want to see a bit more about some of the work that she's done,
um,

109
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.060
I'm going to show you a brief clip here.
It lasts about two minutes.
Um,

110
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.260
that has an interview with Doctor Jess Tracy showing not only are people able to

111
00:07:03.261 --> 00:07:04.400
recognize pride,

112
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.720
but that this seems to be something that we may almost be born with.
Um,

113
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.130
their studies of individuals who have been blind from birth.
And nonetheless,

114
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:13.461
when they,

115
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:16.970
when a particular accomplishment or they feel the sense of achievement,

116
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.740
they will show this same universally recognized display of pride.

117
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.960
So it seems in some ways that pride,

118
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.650
even though it's more cognitively complex in the realm of self conscious

119
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:30.170
emotions,
and even though it emerges later in life,

120
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.800
seems to be something that we may all be built with and that we can all

121
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:38.030
recognize in an instant.
So I want you to take a look at this video right now

122
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.260
<v 1>and now we turn to the thrill of victory and the way we celebrate it,</v>

123
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:45.530
we're seeing it over and over again in Beijing Olympic medal winners erupting in

124
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:47.150
those displays of pride and joy.

125
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.740
But it turns out that victory dance has science behind it as explored by ABC's

126
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:52.574
John Berman

127
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.580
<v 2>Middle Swimmer Michael Films in 1997</v>

128
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.150
<v 1>spelling bee champ,
Rebecca Sealfon have in common,
who knows it?</v>

129
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:04.280
Phelps can spell or Sealfon can swim,

130
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.000
but they both can celebrate their victory.

131
00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:11.990
Dances the scene eerily similar orange stretch,
chest out,

132
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.250
screaming with joy.

133
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.480
<v 2>Tiger Woods did it at the u s open,</v>

134
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.990
Rady Chast Dayne when she won the World Cup in 1999

135
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.700
<v 1>coincidence did failed sealfon wards and Chaz Dean all have the same celebration</v>

136
00:08:24.701 --> 00:08:27.400
teacher.
No,
they were born with it.

137
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.330
A study out this week in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

138
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.590
suggest these types of celebrations are inherited traits.

139
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.450
In the course of evolutionary history.

140
00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:40.990
It's been adaptive for humans to respond to successes in this way.

141
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:46.050
They studied blind judo athletes from the 2004 Paralympics people who never had

142
00:08:46.481 --> 00:08:50.920
sight,
who could not have learned this dance by watching others and found they

143
00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:54.760
celebrated the same way as people with sight.
What's more,

144
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.780
some our relatives in the primate world look like Dave won a game or two.

145
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.610
<v 0>It's a quick signal telling others,
Hey,
look at me.
I'm successful.</v>

146
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.930
<v 1>These displays of dominance from chimps and gorillas are very similar to the</v>

147
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:10.650
displays of pride you see in humans.
Couldn't the Red Sox,

148
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:14.250
Johnathan Papelbon winning the world series pass for a jumping chimp?

149
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.370
Of course not everything can be explained this way.

150
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.450
Chimps don't wear shirts and of course there are few other mammals that can

151
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.440
<v 0>home off icky shuffle.</v>

152
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.420
I hope from seeing this video,

153
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:32.421
you have a sense of just how prevalent pride is and how you know across

154
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:33.601
different people.

155
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:36.960
Both people who have been congenitally congenitally blind and those who haven't

156
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.390
across humans and even non human primates,

157
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:43.770
we seem to have this display of pride that as doctor Jess Tracy says says,
Hey,

158
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.210
look at me.
I'm important.

159
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.750
I've done something accomplishable and that you should pay attention to me.

160
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.230
So that those were some insights into the nature of pride.

161
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.150
Now one of the questions that Dr Jess Tracy and her colleague Richard Robbins

162
00:09:57.151 --> 00:10:01.260
wanted to know though is his pride universal across cultures.

163
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.140
So here they traveled to a country in west Africa.
Um,

164
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:10.430
this was a pre industrialized society with subsistence farmers and individuals

165
00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:14.670
who were literate and had very minimal education and wanting to know even in

166
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:19.671
this very nonwestern I society would they be able to recognize pride displays,

167
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.760
especially given that we know that they're more cognitively complex.

168
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.260
So these are actual images from Doctor Jess Tracy's travels to this country.

169
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.280
I'm studying the Burkina Faso people and um,

170
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.140
some of the field work they did,

171
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.100
trying to take the methods from the lab studies you've seen earlier and

172
00:10:38.101 --> 00:10:40.350
translate them to this particular group.

173
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.730
So here what they did is it's pretty much like the other recognition studies we

174
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:46.830
saw earlier except that the questionnaire,

175
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:51.540
it was in French and it was read aloud by the interviewer who was able to speak

176
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:54.710
both French and their native dialect in the area.

177
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.890
The interview then read these questions aloud and participants responded,

178
00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:01.590
allowed an interviewer's recorded their responses.

179
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.130
So here essentially what it's asking is to what extent,
um,

180
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.030
sort of what emotion do they see this woman in the photo displaying and have a

181
00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:11.790
series of different emotion terms that they can select from.

182
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.280
And what they found in this study,
um,

183
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:19.310
with the Burkina Faso people is that they all showed pride,

184
00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:21.750
recognition levels that are above chance,

185
00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:23.910
which you can see down here with the red line.

186
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:28.050
So they were able just by using a photo,
um,
to,

187
00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:31.700
to pick out that this was a display of pride.
Um,

188
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.820
and so what's interesting here is to think about how universal pride is,

189
00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:39.390
how we all can recognize it.
We all know what function it serves.

190
00:11:39.391 --> 00:11:43.230
We all experienced it and express it at times in which we've achieved something

191
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:47.760
important.
But if we return to our sort of Kanye west example at the beginning,

192
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:52.380
um,
you might want to ask,
well it's pride always a good thing for us.
Um,

193
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.620
is it always good to be sort of letting other people know of our accomplishments

194
00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:57.580
and successes?

195
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.050
So we'll be returning to this later when we discuss emotional disorders,

196
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.520
but some people have suggested when studying emotional disorders that too much

197
00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:11.380
pride may actually be manifested in disorders like narcissism or also in the

198
00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:16.060
component of bipolar disorder referred to with mania where there's a overly

199
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:19.330
enhance sense of self almost to the point of grandiosity.

200
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.200
So although pride can be adaptive for us when we all know it and we recognize it

201
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:24.730
and it's part of what makes us human,

202
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.270
there can be points in which we have perhaps too much pride.

203
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:31.750
So we need to sort of kind of carefully keep it in moderation.

204
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.660
Importantly,
also there's findings that suggest that in the case of pride,

205
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.270
in addition to the examples we talked about with narcissism,

206
00:12:42.271 --> 00:12:46.170
that you can see at the bottom that those who experienced too much pride,

207
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.970
especially those that experience it in the absence of sort of adequate merits,

208
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.650
um,
that this can be associated as well with aggressive behavior and antisocial

209
00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:58.590
behavior in addition to narcissism.
Um,

210
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.860
so you want to just be really careful to think about the nature of pride,

211
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.960
what contexts it's experienced in,
in,

212
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.350
and sort of at what level you're displaying it to others.

213
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.420
<v 2>Okay.</v>

214
00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.040
<v 0>So now that we've talked about pride,</v>

215
00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.320
I want to turn to one of my most favorite emotions,

216
00:13:12.321 --> 00:13:15.170
which is the emotion of embarrassment.
Um,

217
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.920
and I think this is a really fun emotion because it's something that we can all

218
00:13:18.921 --> 00:13:21.320
laugh about upon recollection,
recollection,

219
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.400
but sort of in the moment it feels like one of the most painful experiences you

220
00:13:25.401 --> 00:13:27.830
could have,
you almost want to shrivel up and disappear.

221
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:32.180
And so what I want you to do now,
similar to what we did with pride earlier,

222
00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.970
is to engage in a thought exercise with me,

223
00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.230
where I want you to spend a couple minutes thinking about a time in your life

224
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.220
that you can remember feeling extremely embarrassed.

225
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.510
So I'm sure we can all think of one of these moments that come to our mind.

226
00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.670
So I want you to pick out one for you.

227
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:55.070
And what I want you to do again is take a pen and piece of paper and write down

228
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.300
some notes about this experience.
So first,
what was the context?

229
00:13:59.301 --> 00:14:03.770
So what was going on when you felt embarrassed?
What happened?
Second,

230
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.960
what sort of feelings to ha,
you know,

231
00:14:05.961 --> 00:14:07.730
went through your mind as you were feeling embarrassed.

232
00:14:07.731 --> 00:14:09.200
What thoughts were running through your mind?

233
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.540
Did you notice any change in your physiology?
Um,

234
00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.610
did you notice your heart racing?
Did you notice your cheeks?
Reddening um,

235
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.910
and what kind of behaviors did you engage in when you were feeling embarrassed?

236
00:14:19.911 --> 00:14:22.280
Did you say things to other people?

237
00:14:22.281 --> 00:14:26.210
Did you do particular actions around others when that event happened?

238
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:31.620
And as a result,
if you were around other people,
how did they react to you?
Um,

239
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:35.390
when you displayed embarrassment or when you were experiencing it.

240
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.020
So just take a moment and sort of go back to this time you felt embarrassed,

241
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.490
no matter how painful it might be,
and write down some of these experiences.

242
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:47.900
Um,
I suggest you pause the video now and when you've had a moment to do this,

243
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.250
you can hit play again and we'll go through what scientists discovered about the

244
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:56.390
nature of embarrassment and see to what extent it sort of matches with your own

245
00:14:56.391 --> 00:15:01.040
personal,
uh,
experience,
um,
or memoir of embarrassment.

246
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.353
So

247
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.540
when we think about the characteristics of embarrassment,

248
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.630
we went through this earlier,
but again,
just as a reminder,

249
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.710
embarrassment is something that is elicited when you sort of violate social

250
00:15:13.711 --> 00:15:16.380
norms or rules.
Um,
as a result,

251
00:15:16.381 --> 00:15:19.920
you often engage in behaviors that are trying to repair relationships.

252
00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.490
You're acknowledging that you've remedied or you acknowledged that you made a

253
00:15:23.491 --> 00:15:28.410
mistake and you're trying to remedy or fix that social [inaudible] and others

254
00:15:28.411 --> 00:15:32.640
around you will often respond to you by forgiving.
You may be laughing,

255
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:37.260
they end actually tend to like you more.
Um,
and they trust you.
Right?

256
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.400
So again,

257
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.420
there's been studies where researchers examined participants' reactions to

258
00:15:42.421 --> 00:15:44.100
various embarrassing situations,

259
00:15:44.101 --> 00:15:48.510
knocking things over or tripping and people find that they like others better

260
00:15:48.511 --> 00:15:53.430
when they display embarrassment in these situations then when they don't.
Um,

261
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.820
and we also find some interesting studies say we're parents will actually punish

262
00:15:56.821 --> 00:16:01.320
their children less if they display embarrassment when they've done certain

263
00:16:01.321 --> 00:16:05.940
behaviors,
you know,
sort of spilling things or behaving inappropriately.

264
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:09.090
So it's a way that it almost forms a social glue of our,

265
00:16:09.091 --> 00:16:13.290
of our everyday life gives us some leverage to make mistakes.

266
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:15.310
<v 2>Okay.</v>

267
00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:19.300
<v 0>So what does embarrassment look like?
Um,
so embarrassment.</v>

268
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:23.110
This is something that we really didn't know until quite recently and this is

269
00:16:23.111 --> 00:16:27.280
work that was pioneered by Dacher Keltner at UC Berkeley where he did a

270
00:16:27.281 --> 00:16:32.281
systematic study of people looking embarrassed and found that when he videotaped

271
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.230
people,
um,
who were responding to a loud noise bursts,

272
00:16:36.231 --> 00:16:38.200
where they kind of got shocked and screamed,

273
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.710
they all almost sort of later felt embarrassed about their reaction.

274
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.180
And he took those videos.

275
00:16:43.181 --> 00:16:46.690
And sort of watch them second by second to see what happened,

276
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.910
what did that embarrassment reaction look like?

277
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:53.560
And here he identified this really sort of elegant sequence of embarrassment

278
00:16:53.561 --> 00:16:57.970
across time.
So he found that the embarrassment sequence kind of goes as follows.

279
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.600
First what you find when people are displaying embarrassment is they sort of

280
00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:02.620
shifted their gaze.

281
00:17:02.621 --> 00:17:07.060
They sort of look away like this after that they show this sort of inhibited

282
00:17:07.061 --> 00:17:11.890
smile.
So they'll look away and sort of almost like bash really smile,
right?

283
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.850
Kind of smiling to the side.
And the smile importantly is non Duchenne.

284
00:17:15.851 --> 00:17:19.860
So this is not an authentic smile.
It's almost sort of a social,
um,

285
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.140
polite smile to others to let them know that you're,

286
00:17:23.141 --> 00:17:26.890
you've done something wrong and you're aware of it.
So you look away,
you smile,

287
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.670
you shift your gaze and you hit tilt your head as he would say,

288
00:17:30.671 --> 00:17:32.710
oh way down into the left.

289
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.980
So you can see some of the sequence here at the gay shift aversion,

290
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.360
that kind of inhibited smile and even tilting your head down into the left.

291
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.350
So these the sweat embarrassing,

292
00:17:43.351 --> 00:17:46.840
it looks like we do this ritual and sometimes we'll even touch our face as we're

293
00:17:46.841 --> 00:17:51.620
looking away down and sort of showing inhibited smile.
Um,

294
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.680
his work did some really interesting research where you can see he actually

295
00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:59.400
looked at these displays of gaze down,
smile control,

296
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:03.150
a non Duchenne smile.
The shifting of the is tilting the head away.

297
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:07.950
He actually mapped people across time in seconds.
So you can see one,
two,
three,

298
00:18:07.951 --> 00:18:09.800
four,
five,
six seconds,
um,

299
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:14.250
with his colleague Cameron Anderson to really look at how this really

300
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:18.270
interesting display unfolds just within a matter of seconds,
right?

301
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.110
So what you wanna do when you see a diagram like this is just to pay careful

302
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:26.400
attention to the fact that a lot of behaviors are occurring simultaneously and

303
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:29.640
that many of these behaviors can overlap and time.
So for example,

304
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:34.380
you can have the gaze aversion continue throughout the entire experience as you

305
00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:35.460
see at the top here.

306
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.710
Now when we think about embarrassment,

307
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.420
the same kind of questions come up for embarrassment as they come up for a pride

308
00:18:45.421 --> 00:18:47.670
that we saw earlier.
And this is the question of,

309
00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:51.840
is this display of embarrassment and universal.
So as you see here in this graph,

310
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:56.550
researchers presented photos showing this embarrassment display to college

311
00:18:56.551 --> 00:19:01.551
students both in India and in the u s and first they were asked to describe the

312
00:19:01.981 --> 00:19:03.600
display in their own words.

313
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.770
And what you can see here in the graph is that participants reliably identified

314
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:09.900
a bear snit above chance levels.

315
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.470
So this is the graph here on the left where you see both college students in

316
00:19:13.471 --> 00:19:17.700
India and the u s identify them roughly at the same rate,
around 50%,

317
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.770
which is significantly above chance levels.
Um,

318
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.320
and they also provided similar descriptions of situations that would illicit

319
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.340
embarrassment displays.
Um,

320
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:29.430
what's interesting though is you see here on the right with his tongue bite

321
00:19:29.431 --> 00:19:30.180
gesture.

322
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:34.390
So this is a gesture in Southeast Asia that's often also judged as embarrassment

323
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.240
India.
But as you can see here,

324
00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:40.590
not in the u s so that suggests that even though this prototypical display of

325
00:19:40.591 --> 00:19:44.400
embarrassment that we saw earlier is recognized universally across cultures,

326
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.840
that there's also some cultural variation and other kinds of displays that may

327
00:19:48.841 --> 00:19:51.240
signal embarrassment in one country like India,

328
00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.540
but not be universally recognized as,
um,
you know,

329
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.250
sort of displaying embarrassment in other cultures like the u s so there's

330
00:19:59.251 --> 00:20:00.840
universal displays,
an embarrassment,

331
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:04.840
but also potential culture specific displays like the tongue bite,
uh,

332
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:05.910
in Southeast Asia.

333
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:14.510
So you might wonder then how do we study or try to trigger embarrassment in the

334
00:20:14.511 --> 00:20:18.050
lab?
So this is something we talked a bit about earlier on in the course,

335
00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:21.980
but I'll remind us when we're trying to study embarrassment as emotion

336
00:20:21.981 --> 00:20:26.360
researchers,
we have to find subtle ways to elicit this emotion.

337
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.090
I'm in an ecologically valid and reliable manner.

338
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.250
So in our lab we've used what's called the karaoke task.

339
00:20:32.251 --> 00:20:36.800
And this was originally developed by Virginia Sturm and Robert Levinson at UC

340
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.510
Berkeley.
And we've adapted in our lab,
um,
to,
uh,
be used as follows.

341
00:20:41.511 --> 00:20:43.700
So participants who will come into the lab,

342
00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:47.800
we'll be told that they're playing a part in a study where we want to people's

343
00:20:47.801 --> 00:20:49.870
physiological reactions to music.

344
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.500
So they come into the lab and they remain seated quietly at baseline.

345
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:59.110
Then they're told to play along in a karaoke task where we have them sing along

346
00:20:59.111 --> 00:21:01.890
to the Beatle Song,
twist and shout.
Um,

347
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.950
and so they're singing along playing part in this study.
And little do they know,

348
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:10.120
but later in the study they're actually presented with a video tape of

349
00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:14.140
themselves while they were in the lab singing this karaoke song.
Um,

350
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.950
little did they know that this was going to be a surprise coming up later and at

351
00:21:17.951 --> 00:21:20.860
the end we have them self report their emotion experience.

352
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.180
So I'll show you a brief video of one of my colleagues who came into the lab,

353
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:28.900
Laurie Santos,
um,
engaging in this task,

354
00:21:28.901 --> 00:21:31.600
singing along to the Beatle song,
twist and shout.

355
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.590
<v 3>Well shake it again.</v>

356
00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.360
<v 2>Okay,</v>

357
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.370
<v 3>so that,
come on mom.</v>

358
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.590
Come on.
I'm working on now.

359
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:09.160
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

360
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:13.190
<v 3>Well
yeah,
no,</v>

361
00:22:13.191 --> 00:22:15.050
you look so good.

362
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:16.550
<v 2>Okay.</v>

363
00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:19.350
<v 3>Yeah,
no,
y'all got a Nah.</v>

364
00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.160
Just and I got to know your what

365
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.600
<v 0>experienced more embarrassment than others.
Um,</v>

366
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:32.630
and so one of the questions is can you ever experience too much embarrassment?

367
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.950
So we'll return to this question later on in our section on emotional disorders

368
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.850
where we suggest that maybe although embarrassment has these really important

369
00:22:41.851 --> 00:22:46.050
and adapt is social functions that wouldn't experience to an excess,

370
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:50.490
it can actually play a critical part in disorders such as social anxiety.

371
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.910
So return again to this question of can you have too much of any of the

372
00:22:53.911 --> 00:22:57.870
subconscious emotions like pride or embarrassment for example.

373
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.280
So with this I want to now conclude with our takeaway questions that are focused

374
00:23:02.281 --> 00:23:04.590
on the nature of pride and embarrassment today.

375
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.880
So for today our first question asks,

376
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:12.150
what are the key features?
So this is the solicitor,

377
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:16.950
the behavior and the consequence that we talked about today for pride and

378
00:23:16.951 --> 00:23:21.060
embarrassment as a review from our last module.
Second,

379
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.140
what are the key features we discussed today of pride displays?

380
00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:28.020
Sort of what does pride look like?
Um,

381
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:33.080
and his pride recognized universally both within the United States and cross

382
00:23:33.211 --> 00:23:34.800
culturally.
And if so,

383
00:23:34.801 --> 00:23:39.630
what was the supportive evidence to suggest that was the case?
And then finally,

384
00:23:39.631 --> 00:23:44.040
what are the key features of this sort of elegant and complex sequence of

385
00:23:44.041 --> 00:23:44.641
embarrassment,

386
00:23:44.641 --> 00:23:49.190
display behavior and what is the supportive evidence that would suggest that

387
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:53.170
embarrassment might be recognized again within the United States and cross

388
00:23:53.171 --> 00:23:54.004
culturally.

389
00:23:55.610 --> 00:24:00.230
We're now going to conclude with an expert interview as part of our experts in

390
00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:05.090
emotion interview series and today for our experts in emotion interview.

391
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.840
Um,
we have the honor of speaking with Dr Dacher Keltner.

392
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.980
I'm a former mentor of mine,
um,

393
00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:15.080
on the nature of embarrassment and what function it serves for the greater good

394
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.010
of humanity.

395
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.930
So doctor Keltner received his phd from Stanford University and completed his

396
00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:25.130
NMH postdoctoral training with Paul Ekman at the University of California San

397
00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:25.964
Francisco.

398
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.630
He's currently a professor of psychology at the University of California,

399
00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:30.464
Berkeley,

400
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:34.610
as well as the director for the greater good science center that is focused on

401
00:24:34.611 --> 00:24:39.590
translating the theories,
insights,
findings,
and practices of social psychology,

402
00:24:39.591 --> 00:24:44.480
of compassion and cooperation for a broader audience of educators,

403
00:24:44.481 --> 00:24:49.250
policy makers,
healthcare providers,
and just generally interested citizens.

404
00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:49.910
Um,

405
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:54.590
doctor Keltner is the author of more than 80 scholarly articles and several

406
00:24:54.591 --> 00:24:57.950
books which include books such as born to be good,

407
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.940
the science of a meaningful life,
as well as two textbooks,

408
00:25:01.941 --> 00:25:06.941
one titled Social Psychology and the other focused and co on understanding

409
00:25:07.611 --> 00:25:12.200
emotions.
Um,
he's also authored the compassionate instinct as well.

410
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:16.250
Doctor Keltner,
not surprisingly,
has received many awards,

411
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:20.660
including the Templeton positive psychology,
excellence and Research Prize,

412
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:26.020
outstanding mentor and Teacher Awards from a UC Berkeley and was also named as

413
00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:30.770
one of the 50 visionaries for 2008 by the attorney reader.

414
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:36.130
So I now turn with special excitement to our experts and emotion interview with

415
00:25:37.551 --> 00:25:39.080
doctor Dacher Keltner.
