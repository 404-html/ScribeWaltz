1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.220
Welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.390
So what we know about emotion so far is that it's a common ingredient of really

3
00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:07.710
what makes us human.

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.870
It enables us to adaptively respond in the face of stress and enables us to

5
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:15.780
pursue some of our most important life goals.

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.380
So in all these ways we know emotions are not only good for us,

7
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:23.640
but they help us function.
They help us survive in our everyday life.

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.780
But what happens when emotions go awry?

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.600
Can they go awry?
And when they do,

10
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:34.470
what does it look like and how can we understand it?

11
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.280
So here what we're thinking about is delving into the realm of emotional

12
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:42.900
disorders to look at all the different themes we've talked about so far in terms

13
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:44.190
of what an emotion is,

14
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.930
the way that it's measured across subjective behavioral and physiological

15
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:49.740
channels,

16
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.090
and looking at the ways in which things may break down and what exactly it looks

17
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:56.880
like when they do so.

18
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.830
It's no surprise in many ways that we see emotion intimately involved in many of

19
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:06.210
our most prominent and well known clinical disorders.
And in fact,

20
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:06.991
as you can see here,

21
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:11.760
we have an entire field that's devoted to the study of emotion and mental

22
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:13.740
illness or emotion in psychopathology.

23
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.300
We see entire volumes here dedicated to understanding emotions like pathology,

24
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.940
looking at emotion regulation and psychopathology,

25
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.560
and even handbooks of emotion regulation with specific chapters devoted

26
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:29.100
exclusively to a variety of different disorders.

27
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.230
So it's clear that this concept of emotion regulation and emotion gone awry is

28
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:37.980
gaining increasing momentum.
Indeed,
if you look here,

29
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.020
what we see if we go across a host of different common mental disorders is that

30
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:46.530
one of the core features of each of them is emotion.

31
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.790
So let me show you what I mean.
So here you can see a variety of disorders,

32
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:54.870
many of them common to you or that you may have heard about in your other

33
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:56.190
courses or in the news.

34
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.510
And what you see on the right is that the core feature associated with many of

35
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:02.790
these disorders are emotions at heart.

36
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.440
So we have sadness and guilt that feature and major depressive disorder fear

37
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:11.430
that feature centrally in specific phobia,
panic disorder,

38
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.140
and even social phobia,
which also includes feelings of excessive embarrassment.

39
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.350
Um,
if we think about bipolar disorder here at the bottom,

40
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.130
we see that it's associated with feelings of anger and recent accounts that

41
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:27.720
discuss it in terms of also potentially being associated with too much
happiness.

42
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.510
So what's really important as we think about this idea of emotion gone awry is

43
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:37.890
to be very careful to not necessarily assume that in any of these emotional

44
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:41.310
disorders,
that means that their emotional makeup is inferior.

45
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.490
And I love this quote here by Hans Asperger,

46
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:49.200
who was a pediatrician from the Ena who first notice the early signs of autism

47
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:53.460
spectrum disorders who made this point where he said that not everything that

48
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:58.461
steps out of line and thus abnormal must necessarily be inferior.

49
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.670
And this is a theme I want to take through this journey into understanding how

50
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:07.810
emotion goes awry,
to try to understand the ways in which it may be different,

51
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.500
but to not assume that different necessarily means inferior.

52
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.930
So we're going to start our first section today of our three modules looking at

53
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:18.160
emotional disorders.

54
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.020
And we'll start today by looking at the nature of sadness and fear.

55
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.800
And in particular today we're really going to hone in on this concept of fear

56
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:31.150
and anxiety and think about the ways in which perhaps someone could experience

57
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:35.560
too much fear and what does that mean and what does it look like and which

58
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:40.240
disorders do we know might be associated with heightened or excessive fear?

59
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.200
So the themes that we're going to follow today are as follows.

60
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.650
So I'm going to start out with some of the three key themes that really

61
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:52.270
characterize the ways in which emotion can go awry in psychological disorders.

62
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.040
Next we're going to compare what is the distinction between fear versus anxiety.

63
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.010
Then we're going to delve into,
um,

64
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.040
a variety of different anxiety disorders and try to precisely pinpoint how,

65
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.570
when and where has emotion gone awry.

66
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.470
Then we'll conclude with our takeaway questions and our expert interview.

67
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.550
So let's first start with some of these key themes.
And again,

68
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:20.200
these are the themes that we take from a basic aspect of science perspective and

69
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:22.150
apply to the study of psychopathology.

70
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.560
To characterize broadly what are the different ways that emotion can go awry.

71
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.610
So this is a framework that I developed with a colleague of mine,
Dacher Keltner,

72
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.610
and we outlined three major central themes.

73
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.080
So the first theme when we think of emotion and psychopathology is this theme of

74
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:39.100
extremes.

75
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.200
So here you can see it's defined as a greater intensity of emotional displays

76
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:47.290
and a greater amplitude of emotional reactivity.

77
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.990
Essentially what we're seeing here is that in some instances what might be going

78
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:57.400
on is that individuals are experiencing too much of a given emotion,

79
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.660
that the intensity is at a heightened level that's causing them difficulty.

80
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.920
So we'll delve into this later today when we talk about maybe the idea of having

81
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:10.120
too much fear and anxiety disorders.
The second thing,

82
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:13.180
which was sort of complimentary is this idea of absences.

83
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.080
So you can see here this is defined as having a lower intensity of emotional

84
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:20.230
displays,
or maybe they're even absent altogether,

85
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.370
and a decreased amplitude of emotional activity that also may be absent.

86
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.900
So here by contrast,

87
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:29.320
what we're looking at is whether or not there are key disorders that actually

88
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:32.620
involve less of an emotion that you then you'd want to see,

89
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:35.710
or perhaps the emotion is all together,
gone,
are absent.

90
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.930
And then finally,

91
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:42.910
the third key theme of how emotion can go Orion psychopathology is this notion

92
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:43.930
of disjunction.

93
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.800
So we talked about earlier in the course how emotions have multiple components,

94
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:48.340
right?

95
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.630
They have an experiential component and outward expressive behavioral display

96
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.110
and a physiological response component.
And ideally,

97
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:59.990
as we talked about in this course,
these channels really cohere together.

98
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.460
They're bound together,

99
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.020
and a given emotion should have some flavor manifested in all these channels.

100
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.600
However,
in some clinical disorders,

101
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:13.310
what we're going to see is a disjunction where these channels don't line up

102
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:16.910
anymore,
they're sort of mismatched,
are at odds with one another.

103
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.100
And that this can give rise to many of the difficulties we see in major and

104
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:24.200
severe psychological disorders.

105
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.860
So I want you to keep these three themes in mind as we delve through a variety

106
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:31.190
of different emotional disorders to think about exactly how,

107
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:33.290
when and why emotion goes awry.

108
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.380
So let's start first by differentiating what is fear from anxiety.

109
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.610
Now many of you may think of these things as synonyms or you know,

110
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.510
perhaps use them interchangeably.

111
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.440
What I want to show you now is actually the important ways in which fear and

112
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:50.930
anxiety are actually two related,

113
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:53.840
but really fundamentally distinct kinds of phenomena.

114
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.610
So when we think about fear to begin,
what is the function of fear?

115
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.690
And here what we're going to do is take our traditional sort of evolutionary

116
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:07.400
account to think about what is the adaptation that fear confers?

117
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:10.460
What good is it for us?
Why do we have it in the first place?

118
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.750
So this is very familiar with what we spoke about at the beginning of the term

119
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.110
when we talked about what is an emotion and went through some of the six basic

120
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:21.680
emotions,
including fear.
So just as a reminder,
I mean fear.

121
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:25.400
What we see here in this slide is that it's in response to a recurrent

122
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:29.240
evolutionary situation.
So we have some sort of signal of threat,

123
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.160
maybe it's hearing the Q associated with a Predator associated with this.

124
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:36.860
We see automatic shifts in perception and attention.

125
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:40.820
We become more attentive to potentially threat related sounds and we're much

126
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:43.280
more like the perceived threats within our environment.

127
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:49.010
The goal of fears ultimately to preserve safety and keep us very present,

128
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:52.490
focused in the moments that we can immediately,
you know,

129
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.940
divert from potential threat related cues and remain safe.

130
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.490
So this triggers a fight or flight response.

131
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.880
We see increased blood flow to the periphery,
increased oxygen volume,

132
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:06.200
and all of this is really geared towards helping us defend ourselves against

133
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.950
potential threats and escape potential predators.
Okay,

134
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:14.060
so this is the function of fear.
Now,
how is fear different from anxiety?

135
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.810
So here's,
we just talked about fear.
On the left,
it's present focused.

136
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.150
It's proximal to an eliciting stimulus,

137
00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:24.920
meaning it's really in response to an immediate threat in a given moment,
right?

138
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.940
So it triggers your sympathetic nervous system fight or flight response.
Um,

139
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.840
and it can often happen automatically or subconsciously and associated with

140
00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:34.580
things like the Amygdala,
right?

141
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:38.090
This sort of what people often used to think of is the fear center of the brain

142
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.910
or something that's really about salience in the environment.

143
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.700
Now this is actually really different from anxiety.

144
00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:45.050
So if you look here on the right,

145
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.610
what you see with anxiety is that anxiety is actually not about the present at

146
00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:52.880
all.
It's really your future oriented state.

147
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.120
You're thinking about things that may be or could happen or you're worrying

148
00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:00.720
about happening some place off in the future,
right?

149
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.530
So it doesn't have this sort of immediate or proximal stimulants.

150
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:06.570
It's actually about some future threat.

151
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.830
And what it does is it increases this sort of sense of getting prepared and

152
00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:15.060
mobilizing for some aversive outcome.
That's about to happen,

153
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.260
but it has not yet happened.
Um,
and by contrast,

154
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:22.740
it's usually not always subconsciously activated.

155
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:26.790
These are often kinds of feelings and cognitions we're having quite consciously

156
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:30.870
as we think about what might be happening in the future.
So,
for example,

157
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:33.770
you may be thinking about,
um,
if you,
you know,

158
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.440
live here in new haven about a storm that we knew that was coming right and sort

159
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:41.280
of getting mobilized for that of all the things you can do to be prepared for a

160
00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:44.280
potential threat that's about to happen.
Um,

161
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:49.980
so what I want to think about now as we've compared fear and anxiety is when are

162
00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:52.650
these emotions actually useful for us?
Right?

163
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:54.780
We talked about a functional account of fear.

164
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.530
What about anxiety when his anxiety actually helpful?

165
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.540
So there's four things here.

166
00:10:00.541 --> 00:10:04.320
You can see that sort of detail the ways in which anxiety can actually be good

167
00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:06.840
for us,
right?
It's not always bad.

168
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.680
So first anxiety facilitates planning for the future.

169
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.080
So it helps people do things like,
you know,

170
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:17.820
put in the energy needed to apply for med school,
for example.
Um,
second,

171
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.760
it also helps recruit help from other people.

172
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.730
So when you express or exhibit anxiety,

173
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.080
what this does is it elicits a prosocial response from other people.

174
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.620
You can probably readily imagine a time you told a friend you were worried about

175
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:36.510
something.
And often that will bring in comfort from other people.
Third,

176
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.050
it is associated with a vigilance to threat.

177
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:44.460
So this helps increase your attention to potential dangers in the environment.

178
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.870
So if you're in sort of an anxious mind state,

179
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.790
you're going to be more likely to be attentive to cues of potential threats to

180
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:54.300
your safety,
such as maybe watching for pedestrians when you're driving,

181
00:10:54.301 --> 00:10:56.190
for example.
And finally,

182
00:10:56.191 --> 00:11:00.180
the fourth point here is that it enhances a up to a certain level,

183
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.450
physical and intellectual performance.
So again,

184
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.840
when we have some anxiety actually mobilizes us to approach goals and give us

185
00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:10.950
the energy we need to overcome them.

186
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.970
So those are some ways in which anxiety can actually be helpful.
Now,

187
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.030
when his anxiety harmful by contrast,

188
00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:22.980
so there's many ways in which too much anxiety or experienced in the wrong

189
00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:25.440
context may actually be harmful for us.

190
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:30.060
So first we can see here that sometimes when anxiety's experienced to an
extreme,

191
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:34.440
it can hinder social functioning.
So having an extreme fear of public speaking,

192
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:34.951
for example,

193
00:11:34.951 --> 00:11:39.770
can get in the way of many domains of life from class presentations to um,

194
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:43.020
particular jobs,
which really require you to speak,
uh,

195
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.670
and interact in front of crowds.
Second,
it impedes basic tasks of living.

196
00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:51.180
So people who may have anxiety or fear of flying,
for example,

197
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:55.870
might not be able to take vacations they need to do or go to conferences or just

198
00:11:55.871 --> 00:12:00.130
travel the world,
you know,
fulfill some of their life dreams.
Third,

199
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.990
it can also cause physical harm.

200
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:06.850
So we'll talk about OCD or obsessive compulsive disorder where an extreme

201
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:11.650
anxiety over contamination actually leads people to wash their hands up to the

202
00:12:11.651 --> 00:12:15.610
point that their hands actually start bleeding from being sort of overexposure

203
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:18.880
alleviated.
Um,
it can lead even to death.

204
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:22.360
So in the case of eating disorders like Anorexia Nervosa,

205
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:25.030
this anxiety or fear of becoming fat,

206
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.680
I can actually lead people to restrict their caloric intake to the point of

207
00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:31.990
starvation.
And then finally,

208
00:12:31.991 --> 00:12:36.991
it increases risks for other Comorbid or coal company emotional disorders.

209
00:12:37.031 --> 00:12:40.420
So,
um,
we see anxiety,
often coker with heart disease,

210
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.470
substance abuse and even suicidal ideation and behaviors that can be very

211
00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:49.240
harmful,
um,
when experience too in Tennessee or in the wrong context.

212
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.520
So what I want to turn now to is what I think of as the broad umbrella of

213
00:12:54.521 --> 00:12:58.060
anxiety disorders.
So when we think about this umbrella,

214
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.510
we can start at a certain point and sort of diverged out.

215
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.630
And what we see here and we'll walk through a few of these today,

216
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.840
is that anxiety disorders come in many different flavors,

217
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.160
ranging from phobias to panic disorder,
two generalized anxiety disorder,

218
00:13:12.161 --> 00:13:14.020
obsessive compulsive disorder,

219
00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.680
post traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder.

220
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:22.150
And importantly in what you can see at the bottom of the slide here is that

221
00:13:22.151 --> 00:13:23.710
they're extremely common.

222
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.990
So they're the most common psychiatric disorder and have a prevalence in the

223
00:13:28.991 --> 00:13:31.120
general population of 25%.

224
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.470
So one out of four people at some point in their life has had one of these

225
00:13:35.471 --> 00:13:39.790
anxiety disorders.
So perhaps you,
yourself or someone you know,

226
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:44.470
has experienced one of these,
um,
umbrella anxiety disorders.

227
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:49.090
So what I want to do then is walk through this umbrella with a couple key

228
00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:53.560
examples of anxiety disorders and how we might think of this from a basic

229
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:56.890
emotion perspective.
We're an aspect of science perspective.

230
00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:01.930
So let's start first on the left here with specific phobias.

231
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.430
Um,
in fact,
these are the most common of all psychiatric disorders.

232
00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.320
There's hundreds of them potentially,

233
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:12.040
and they have a high prevalence and they can be extremely debilitating.

234
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:16.840
So what we see here is what's called the Dsm or diagnostic and statistical

235
00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:20.650
manual of mental disorders criteria for specific phobia.

236
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:25.900
So what it involves is a marked and persistent fear of some specific object or

237
00:14:25.901 --> 00:14:29.650
situation.
And importantly,
if you have a phobia,

238
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:33.730
you are always anxious when you're presented with that particular stimulus.

239
00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:38.650
So let's say you have a fear of flying.
You always feel anxious when you're,

240
00:14:38.651 --> 00:14:39.041
you know,

241
00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:41.830
seeing pictures of planes where you're thinking about taking a flight or you're

242
00:14:41.831 --> 00:14:46.810
actually on a plane.
Importantly,
and this is a really unique part of the phobias,

243
00:14:46.811 --> 00:14:51.770
is having some degree of insight of recognizing that the fear that you have is

244
00:14:51.771 --> 00:14:53.480
excessive.
In other words,

245
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:56.960
it's more fear than most people would have in that situation.

246
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.090
Maybe we're all a little nervous about flying.

247
00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:01.730
Maybe we all feel a little uncomfortable around snakes.

248
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.270
But the idea here is that the kind of fear that you would have if you had a

249
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:10.100
phobia of these things would be much at a much greater degree and excessive.

250
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.190
Um,
fourth,
you can see here as this idea of avoidance.

251
00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:17.930
So you try to avoid these situations.
You try to avoid flying,
avoid snakes,

252
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:22.640
or if you have to encounter it,
you endure it with severe distress.

253
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.540
Um,
and importantly with all clinical disorders,
um,

254
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.030
they must cause impairment in your life.

255
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.990
They must get in the way of achieving your personal goals,
um,

256
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.520
or daily life tasks.

257
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.810
That's a critical part of phobias is that they get in the way of us achieving

258
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:43.940
our functional goals.
Um,
so there's all different kinds of phobias.

259
00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:47.240
You could probably name a phobia for everything in the world.
Um,

260
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:52.230
but these are sort of the kind of five most common categories of phobias.
Um,

261
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.690
so there's animal phobias.
Often you see snakes,
spiders,
dogs,

262
00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:01.340
there's what's called natural environment phobias.
So these are phobias of fear,

263
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.760
fear of heights,
fear of storms,
fear of water.

264
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:10.220
A really common one is blood injection,
injury phobia.
So,
um,

265
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.700
many people can relate to feeling extremely uncomfortable and they have to get a

266
00:16:13.701 --> 00:16:17.690
shot,
get blood drawn or undergo different medical procedures.

267
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.880
And this is not a joke in any way.

268
00:16:19.881 --> 00:16:24.710
This can actually really impede with persons ability to seek much needed medical

269
00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:25.540
treatment,
um,

270
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.360
that they need because they're so afraid of encountering needles are seeing

271
00:16:29.361 --> 00:16:32.930
blood.
Um,
then there's situational phobias.
And again,

272
00:16:32.931 --> 00:16:37.790
these are just some examples.
Fear of tunnels,
bridges,
elevators.

273
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.640
Um,
so my background is a clinical psychologist.

274
00:16:40.641 --> 00:16:44.360
I have actually worked with patients who had phobias of elevators and worked

275
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:48.380
with them to sort of encounter elevators to try to overcome their fears.

276
00:16:48.381 --> 00:16:50.570
But it's actually a quite common phobia,

277
00:16:50.571 --> 00:16:54.020
is feeling afraid of elevators of being contained in a close space.

278
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.730
We also see flying,

279
00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.440
driving close spaces and then there's this general kind of fifth category of

280
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.740
other phobias.
So this really does mean other,

281
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.060
so choking illness,
loud sounds.
Um,

282
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.270
but importantly there can be a phobia of pretty much anything you can think of.

283
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.340
Um,
and importantly,
what I want to show you here is that,

284
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:18.200
and it's something I highlighted earlier,

285
00:17:18.201 --> 00:17:22.160
is that phobias are incredibly common,
right?

286
00:17:22.161 --> 00:17:27.161
So if you look at just generally across the population at any one given time

287
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.190
point,

288
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:33.190
you have 11% of people who are reporting some kind of specific phobia and you

289
00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:36.530
can then see here that it goes down from animals,
heights,

290
00:17:36.531 --> 00:17:38.540
blood all the way down to storms.

291
00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.750
So this is something that I think is really interesting because it's something

292
00:17:41.751 --> 00:17:45.950
that many of us have experienced of having an excessive fear of something that

293
00:17:45.951 --> 00:17:49.340
by itself actually would make many people uncomfortable.

294
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:54.420
But there's this degree of extreme responsivity in some people to certain

295
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:58.140
objects or situations.
Um,
and like I said,
you know,

296
00:17:58.141 --> 00:18:01.620
I just gave some examples earlier,
phobias,
but you can find,

297
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:04.560
there's actually some websites that list all different kinds of phobias you

298
00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:07.510
could think of.
And these are some that come up.
So,
um,

299
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.780
some of these that I think are quite interesting,
RM,

300
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.210
Gina Phobia or access,
fear of knees.
Um,

301
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.110
you also have,
I think that's a less common one.
Um,
there's a,

302
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.620
I can never say this on Sam.
Hina phobia,
a fear of Halloween.

303
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.560
You have metro phobia,
fear of poetry.
Um,
and then you have,
um,

304
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.450
Zam the phobia,
the color yellow.

305
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.300
So I'm wearing yellow today and we have yellow slides.

306
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:37.350
Hopefully none of you have that particular phobia in the audience right now.
Um,

307
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.620
but the point is like,
really you can find a phobia for anything out there.

308
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:45.280
There's no limitation to what can or can not be a phobia.
Um,

309
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.250
now how do you treat phobias?

310
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:51.600
How do you get someone who has this excessive fear of a particular object?

311
00:18:51.601 --> 00:18:53.880
Maybe it's the color yellow or maybe it's Halloween.

312
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.320
How do you get them to sort of,
kind of bring down that level of fear?
So there's,

313
00:18:58.321 --> 00:19:00.870
um,
kind of different ways that people will go about it.

314
00:19:00.871 --> 00:19:04.300
Who are psychotherapists often they're called cognitive behavioral therapists.

315
00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:08.610
Um,
and what the essential ingredient is,
is to expose people.

316
00:19:08.611 --> 00:19:11.640
As you can see here to the feared situation of the object.

317
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.060
Essentially what you're putting them through is probably the most uncomfortable

318
00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:19.110
kind of therapy one could imagine because you're having them encounter the very

319
00:19:19.111 --> 00:19:23.220
thing that makes them feel the most fearful of anything else.

320
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.830
So there's different ways of exposing people.

321
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.140
You can have the mentally visualize it.

322
00:19:28.141 --> 00:19:31.830
So may be thinking of an image of a snake or thinking of the color yellow.

323
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.940
You can do these virtual reality exposures that you can see in the bottom left

324
00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:40.440
photo there where they actually have devised these amazing simulated um,

325
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.180
computerized,
um,

326
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:46.290
exposures to spiders where the person will put on a camera mass just like that

327
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.870
young man there.
And you'll actually be able to see,

328
00:19:48.871 --> 00:19:51.570
spiders have actually reached out as if you were touching one.

329
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.600
And then in vivo exposure is really the real deal.

330
00:19:54.601 --> 00:19:56.550
So if it were a spider or snake,

331
00:19:56.551 --> 00:20:01.290
actually going in and touching a spider or snake live,
um,

332
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.470
and you can do this in different ways.
You can just do it all at once.

333
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:08.910
Sort of flood the person with the most fearful object in that category.

334
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.030
They can think of,
or you can do what's called the gradual hierarchy,

335
00:20:12.031 --> 00:20:14.880
sort of taking baby steps,
one at a time at a time,

336
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.530
a picture of a snake to movie of the snake to virtual reality,
to Nvivo.

337
00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:24.150
Um,
interestingly,
the more you expose yourself to something you're afraid of,

338
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.090
the less afraid you become.
So as difficult as it is,

339
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.650
it's an incredibly effective short term treatment for curing phobia's.

340
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:38.220
Um,
the next one we'll briefly talk about is panic disorder.
So panic disorders.

341
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.920
Interesting.
So if we peek into the DSM again,

342
00:20:40.921 --> 00:20:44.370
so looking at what is the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder,

343
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.590
you'll see very similar,
um,
uh,

344
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.980
criteria for phobias at the bottom and so far as it causes impairment.

345
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.270
But what you're seeing for panic disorder here is that first you have to first

346
00:20:55.271 --> 00:20:57.100
have had a history of a panic attack.

347
00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:00.820
So panic attack is this discrete period of intense fear.

348
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.540
So out of nowhere,
people often report feeling out of the blue,

349
00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.520
this intense feeling of fear,

350
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:10.630
almost a fight or flight response that'll hit right away and peak within 10

351
00:21:10.631 --> 00:21:11.350
minutes.

352
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.370
So essentially what's happening is your body is physiologically telling you that

353
00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:18.930
there's something in the environment that you need to either fight or flight or,

354
00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:23.380
or would they call,
flee or,
or sort of,
um,
you know,
fight against.

355
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.040
So suddenly your body's just gearing up your heart's racing,
you're sweating,

356
00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:27.874
you're dizzy.

357
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:32.320
And what's important is that not all people who have panic attacks develop panic

358
00:21:32.321 --> 00:21:36.100
disorder.
So it's only those people who have panic attacks,

359
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.000
but then develop a fear of having future panic attacks.

360
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.810
Almost a fear of these physiological sensations right here.

361
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.340
Those are the individuals who we talk about as having panic disorder.

362
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.630
And I often think of this in terms of an equation.
So what is panic disorder?

363
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.290
So first you have had the first ingredient,
which is a panic attack,
right?

364
00:21:56.291 --> 00:22:00.130
Which has all these physiological symptoms right here,
heart racing,
dizziness,

365
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.200
feeling like you're feigning nausea,

366
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.850
plus a fear of future panic attacks,

367
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.430
which then equates to panic disorder.

368
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:15.190
So the way that I often think of panic disorders as this quote by Franklin d

369
00:22:15.191 --> 00:22:16.270
Roosevelt who said,

370
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.260
the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

371
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.460
And I think really this is the heart of what panic disorder is.

372
00:22:24.461 --> 00:22:29.410
Cause in the sense what is happening is there's a fear of fear,
right?

373
00:22:29.411 --> 00:22:34.411
So it's this idea that you become afraid of your body's natural signals that

374
00:22:34.841 --> 00:22:39.760
correspond to feeling fearful.
So I broke this up into three parts here.

375
00:22:39.761 --> 00:22:42.460
So this is called the fear of fear hypothesis.

376
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:46.210
So part one is that you have this overly aroused,
kind of physiological,

377
00:22:46.211 --> 00:22:49.630
autonomic nervous system response that we talked about earlier in class.

378
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:54.940
Second is that you have a tendency to become distressed or uncomfortable by

379
00:22:54.941 --> 00:22:59.500
physical sensations in your body.
Your heart racing makes you feel really,
uh,

380
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.510
you know,
not at ease.

381
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.170
And then part three is what starts to be the vicious cycle that leads to panic

382
00:23:05.171 --> 00:23:08.320
disorder.
You worry about having future panic attacks.

383
00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.100
This worry then heightens and even gets your heart racing even faster.

384
00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:16.120
And it actually makes it more likely that you're going to have a future panic

385
00:23:16.121 --> 00:23:20.680
attack.
The more you get revved up and tuned into your body's own sensations.

386
00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:25.900
Now,
panic disorder interestingly can also coker with something called the Gore

387
00:23:25.901 --> 00:23:29.410
phobia.
So you can have panic disorder with or without this thing called the Gore

388
00:23:29.411 --> 00:23:30.244
phobia.

389
00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:35.520
Now what a Gore for via really refers to is it gets at this idea of behavioral

390
00:23:35.891 --> 00:23:36.724
avoidance.

391
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:41.380
So people often worry about having panic attacks and things like crowds.

392
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.690
So in lines,
buses,
trains,

393
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:48.080
or situations essentially that a resent representing to them that they have no

394
00:23:48.081 --> 00:23:51.620
escape,
no way to get out should they have a panic attack.

395
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:55.730
And when you have that put together,
you have what's called the Gore phobia.

396
00:23:55.731 --> 00:23:59.330
So this is often called fear of the marketplace.

397
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:01.040
It's where the term originates from.

398
00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.000
And what it refers to is people who are often in closing themselves in their

399
00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:10.001
houses because they're so afraid of going outside to be in some place where they

400
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:13.520
might have a panic attack and they might not be able to escape or get out of

401
00:24:13.521 --> 00:24:16.970
that situation.
So this is the Gore phobia.

402
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.660
And as you might imagine,
it's an incredibly debilitating,

403
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.590
a psychiatric disorder for many who suffer.
Okay.

404
00:24:24.591 --> 00:24:28.270
We're going to quickly now turned to generalized anxiety disorder,
Gad,

405
00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.470
followed by obsessive compulsive disorder.
So for Ga di,

406
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.980
when we peek into the DSM,

407
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.420
what we're seeing here is a kind of anxiety that's more generalized,

408
00:24:38.421 --> 00:24:39.560
more widespread.

409
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:44.770
So you see chronic and persistent warrior tension that lasts at least six months

410
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:48.770
and people have extreme trouble controlling their worry.

411
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.650
It's very hard to stop it or decrease it.

412
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.190
And you have a lot of associated symptoms like trouble concentrating,

413
00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:56.510
fatigue intention.

414
00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.320
So really what we're seeing is people who are in a constant state of sort of

415
00:25:00.321 --> 00:25:01.940
hypervigilance and worry,

416
00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:07.360
we see a two to one female to male ratio and Gad and often has a very chronic

417
00:25:07.461 --> 00:25:09.770
course with very low rates of remission.

418
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:13.550
So an example you might see here as a woman with JD who would say,

419
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.560
I always thought I was just a worrier.
I'd feel keyed up and unable to relax.

420
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:22.100
At times it would come and go and at times it would be constant.

421
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:25.910
It could go on for days I'd worry about what I was going to fix for a dinner

422
00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:30.770
party or what would be a great present for somebody.
I just couldn't let go.

423
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:36.140
So the idea that people have talked about when they think about JD is that

424
00:25:36.141 --> 00:25:40.190
they're engaging in worry as a way to avoid feelings of anxiety,
right?

425
00:25:40.191 --> 00:25:45.010
So this is a avoidance perspective on worry.
So in some ways,
um,

426
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:45.771
what they,

427
00:25:45.771 --> 00:25:50.150
what people like Bork Avec would hypothesize is that you have more thoughts than

428
00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:54.920
images when you worry and worry actually restricts your ability to become

429
00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:59.210
physiologically aroused and even distances you from an emotional state.

430
00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:04.420
So in some ways this chronic worrying and gid may actually help decrease the

431
00:26:04.731 --> 00:26:08.000
physical and emotional intensity in the short term,

432
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:09.860
but that worrying,

433
00:26:09.861 --> 00:26:14.510
even though you're distancing from your emotions causes long term difficulties.

434
00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:18.860
Um,
Doug Mennin,
a colleague of mine who used to be at,
yeah,

435
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:24.230
developed an emotion regulation model of GED where he posited four main features

436
00:26:24.591 --> 00:26:26.720
of emotion dysregulation.
And this disorder,

437
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.420
the first is heightened intensity of emotions.

438
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:34.210
So people with JD or have very quick emotional reactions there,

439
00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:36.890
they're quick,
they come on easy and they're intense.

440
00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.680
They also have a poor understanding of their own emotions.

441
00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:42.200
So they have trouble identifying emotions like anger,

442
00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:46.080
discuss joy and emotions to them.
Feel very confusing,

443
00:26:46.081 --> 00:26:47.660
kind of very diffused.

444
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:52.050
They can't make sense of them as easily and they also have third a negative

445
00:26:52.051 --> 00:26:56.100
reactivity to their own feelings.
So they feel when they experience emotions,

446
00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:00.030
the emotions they experience our immersive and they have trouble accepting them

447
00:27:00.031 --> 00:27:02.220
when they occur.
And finally,

448
00:27:02.221 --> 00:27:06.000
I'm Doug men and would say that there's a maladaptive management of emotions.

449
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:10.560
They either under regulate their emotions or they try to overregulate them and

450
00:27:10.561 --> 00:27:11.820
control or suppress,

451
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.330
so they're really having trouble making sense of their emotions and effectively

452
00:27:15.331 --> 00:27:19.260
managing or regulating them,
which we talked about earlier in class.

453
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.910
Finally,
I'm just going to turn to obsessive compulsive disorder for today,

454
00:27:23.911 --> 00:27:28.380
but I recommend you also check out PTSD and social anxiety and think about the

455
00:27:28.381 --> 00:27:31.470
ways they also may represent excessive or heightened fear.

456
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.760
So for OCD,
if we peek into the DSM again,

457
00:27:35.761 --> 00:27:40.710
what we see the core criteria as having two parts.
One part our obsessions,

458
00:27:40.711 --> 00:27:44.610
so these are intrusive,
unwanted,
uncontrollable thoughts and images.

459
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.040
They're thoughts that people see as irrational,

460
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:51.600
but yet they can't control them and they can often include sort of sexual
themes,

461
00:27:51.601 --> 00:27:54.420
themes of aggression or contamination.

462
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.390
Then there's the behavioral component on the,
on the right.

463
00:27:57.391 --> 00:27:58.650
So these are compulsion's.

464
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.030
So these are the repetitive behaviors and rituals that people can't stop doing.

465
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.220
So this is washing your hands again and again,

466
00:28:05.221 --> 00:28:08.880
this is counting up to a certain number.
This is cleaning,
checking,

467
00:28:08.881 --> 00:28:12.510
double checking,
locking doors,
you know,
checking the oven.

468
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.860
And these compulsions are really interesting because in the moment they

469
00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:18.600
temporarily relieve fear.

470
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.140
They cause people to feel better just for a brief moment,

471
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.150
but they don't last very long.

472
00:28:24.151 --> 00:28:28.260
So they're unsuccessful emotion regulation strategies and the compulsion will

473
00:28:28.261 --> 00:28:30.780
come up again even just seconds later.

474
00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:35.490
So people are kind of caught in this recursive repetitive loop trying to assuage

475
00:28:35.491 --> 00:28:40.320
their anxiety with these unusual compulsive behaviors and not having a very

476
00:28:40.321 --> 00:28:43.980
successful experience doing so in the long term.
Um,

477
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:48.600
many of you may have seen OCD in the media and movies like the aviator or as

478
00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:49.530
good as it gets.

479
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.490
I'm depicting some of these ritualistic behaviors that people are doing as a way

480
00:28:53.491 --> 00:28:55.620
to try to ease their anxiety,

481
00:28:55.621 --> 00:28:58.680
but they're ultimately unsuccessful and caused them a lot of impairments

482
00:28:58.681 --> 00:28:59.490
socially.

483
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.550
And even to the point that people can physically isolate themselves from the

484
00:29:02.551 --> 00:29:07.050
world.
So this is the umbrella we talked about today.

485
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.010
And if we think about what are the most common treatments for anxiety disorders,

486
00:29:11.011 --> 00:29:15.720
they can include medication.
Often antidepressants are benzodiazepines.

487
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.480
There's behavioral treatments that we talked about,
um,

488
00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:22.080
as well as cognitive behavioral treatments that help people work on some of that

489
00:29:22.081 --> 00:29:24.280
maladaptive behaviors or some of the,
um,

490
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.450
excessive negative thinking that may trigger anxiety.

491
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.830
We also talked about this idea of exposing people are systematically

492
00:29:31.831 --> 00:29:35.070
desensitizing them to the very thing they're afraid of.

493
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:38.820
So having them go in and confront what it is that makes them feel the most

494
00:29:38.821 --> 00:29:42.610
anxious.
There's also therapies that are called panic control therapy.

495
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.631
And at the bottom,

496
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:47.290
what's gained a lot of attention recently is this idea of mindfulness and

497
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:48.124
acceptance.

498
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:52.360
So this is one example of a workbook that I've used with my own clients and the

499
00:29:52.361 --> 00:29:54.550
mindfulness and acceptance workbook for anxiety,

500
00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:58.420
which is really teaching you not to fight against your anxiety,

501
00:29:58.421 --> 00:30:02.680
to sort of let go of the struggle and simply accept what you're feeling.

502
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:07.000
And through acceptance,
it may actually decrease the anxiety altogether.
Um,

503
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.990
so this has gained a lot of increasing momentum in terms of a way to treat

504
00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:15.910
really chronic,
really severe anxiety difficulties.
So with that,

505
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:17.920
we'll conclude with our takeaway questions.

506
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:22.210
So the first question for today says,
well,

507
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:25.150
what were the three broad themes that we discussed that describe the

508
00:30:25.151 --> 00:30:29.320
relationship between emotion and psychopathology?
Second,

509
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:33.460
what were the key distinctions that we discussed between fear and anxiety?

510
00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:34.721
And last,

511
00:30:34.721 --> 00:30:39.721
can you describe the core emotion related difficulties in the four key anxiety

512
00:30:40.031 --> 00:30:41.680
disorders that we reviewed today?

513
00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.370
As well as think about how these might apply to other anxiety disorders we

514
00:30:45.371 --> 00:30:49.630
didn't touch on today,
such as PTSD or social anxiety disorder.

515
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.740
And finally,
I'll conclude with our expert interview.
And again,

516
00:30:53.741 --> 00:30:57.160
this is part of the experts in emotion interview series at Yale University.

517
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.670
So today for our expert interview,
um,

518
00:31:00.671 --> 00:31:04.120
we have the pleasure of speaking with Dr Doug men and who's going to share his

519
00:31:04.121 --> 00:31:06.220
thoughts on anxiety and emotion.

520
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:10.690
So doctor men and received his phd from Temple University and after nine years

521
00:31:10.691 --> 00:31:12.400
on the faculty at Yale University,

522
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.190
he joined the Department of Psychology at Cuny.

523
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.320
Hunter College is an associate professor,

524
00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:21.970
Dr men and has focused on treating chronic bouts of anxiety and mood disorders

525
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:26.620
and his work examines first the experimental and ecological delineation of

526
00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:31.210
behavioral and biological processes that contribute both to emotion reactivity

527
00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:36.100
and dysregulation and chronic anxiety as well as co-occurring depression.
Second,

528
00:31:36.101 --> 00:31:40.540
he looks at the development of an integrative mechanism based emotion regulation

529
00:31:40.541 --> 00:31:44.170
treatment,
which has demonstrated considerable efficacy thus far,

530
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.100
especially in the realm of generalized anxiety disorder.
And finally,

531
00:31:48.101 --> 00:31:52.510
he also examines biobehavioral mechanisms of reactivity and dysregulation,

532
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:57.660
who's changes mediate longterm symptomatic and functional outcome as a result of

533
00:31:57.731 --> 00:31:59.680
this intervention in his work,

534
00:31:59.681 --> 00:32:03.580
Dr men and utilizes experimental paradigms centered on presenting emotional

535
00:32:03.581 --> 00:32:08.530
stimuli in context to individuals with pathological chronic anxiety and

536
00:32:08.531 --> 00:32:13.030
depression.
Has Research has been funded by several organizations and institutes,

537
00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:17.020
including the National Institute of Mental Health and he's published over 60

538
00:32:17.021 --> 00:32:21.310
peer reviewed empirical articles and book chapter,
as well as editing two books.

539
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.190
His work has been recognized by numerous awards,

540
00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:29.340
including the president's Fund for Faculty Advancement Award and the George and

541
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.900
Shuster Faculty Fellowship Fund from Cuny Hunter College,

542
00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:36.430
as well as the senior faculty fellowship and the Social Sciences from Yale

543
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:37.540
University doctor Ben,

544
00:32:37.541 --> 00:32:41.390
and currently serves on the editorial board of several major journals and on the

545
00:32:41.391 --> 00:32:46.190
executive board of the APA division of clinical psychology and the society for a

546
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:50.300
science of clinical psychology and as a member of the Scientific Council of the

547
00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:52.580
Anxiety Disorders Association of America.

548
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:57.650
So I now turn to a very special experts and emotion interview with Doctor Doug

549
00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:58.483
Mennin.

550
00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:01.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>
