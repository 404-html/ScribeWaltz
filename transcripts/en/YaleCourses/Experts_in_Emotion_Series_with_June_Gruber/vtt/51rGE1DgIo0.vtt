00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.480
Today for our experts in emotion interview.

2
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.220
We have the honor of speaking with Dr. Kent Berridge on pleasure and reward in

3
00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:08.054
the brain.

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.310
Kent Berridge is the James Old collegiate professor of psychology and

5
00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:17.210
neuroscience and the Department of Psychology at the University of Michigan.

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.280
Bear just current research focuses on answering questions such as how is

7
00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:23.930
pleasure generated in the brain,

8
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.430
is happiness on the brain and how do wanting and liking interact?

9
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.880
He also answers questions such as what causes addiction.

10
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.240
Does fear share anything with desire and can an emotion ever be unconscious?

11
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.480
Um,

12
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.410
Doctor Berridge serves on editorial boards for several scientific journals and

13
00:00:42.411 --> 00:00:47.300
he's Co edited the book pleasures of the brain and among many honors,

14
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.770
um,
beverage has been a Guggenheim fellow and a Fulbright senior scholar.

15
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.780
So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Dr. Kent Berridge on

16
00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:01.730
pleasure and reward in the human brain.
Welcome,

17
00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:03.290
Ken.
Thanks for speaking with us.

18
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.350
<v 1>Well,
thank you Jen,
for including me in your series.</v>

19
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.670
<v 0>Oh,
it's a pleasure.</v>

20
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.120
I know that one of the things that many people out there would want to know

21
00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:15.950
about you is what first got you started or interested in the study of emotion

22
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:17.510
and pleasure in the first place?

23
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.180
<v 1>Well,
I've always thought that emotion,
pleasure an asset.</v>

24
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.180
I sort of essential qualities of psychological experience,
you know,

25
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.530
something that we'd love to be able to launch a steam and there were

26
00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:32.440
opportunities to appropriate a bit and it's been fun.

27
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.760
<v 0>Excellent.
And so I want to move now just to a few questions about your research,</v>

28
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.470
which is very,
very exciting and I,

29
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.170
I feel honored to be able to speak with you about it today.

30
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.100
So the first question I wanted to ask you is just a bit about your work that's

31
00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:47.030
really,
you know,

32
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.040
paved the way for understanding distinctions between anticipation or wanting of

33
00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:56.810
rewards on the one hand from the conservatory experience or liking of rewards.

34
00:01:56.811 --> 00:01:57.650
On the other hand,

35
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.310
and I wondered if you could elaborate on this really interesting distinction

36
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.530
between wanting versus liking.

37
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.000
<v 1>Well,
it's a distinction that we sort of stumbled upon.</v>

38
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.860
We weren't ever expecting it,

39
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.610
but it turns out that the brain seems to make a big distinction between its

40
00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:16.270
mechanisms of liking something and its mechanisms of wanting that same thing.

41
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.710
We actually started many years ago looking at dopamine thinking it was going to

42
00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:22.090
be a mechanism of liking.

43
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.290
There is so much reason to think that don't mean wasn't pleasure mechanism in

44
00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:31.291
the brain that was causing her liking and in our hands it seemed not to do that.

45
00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:34.090
And that led us to puzzle.

46
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.030
How could dopamine look like wanting and look sorry,

47
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:39.970
I look like liking but yet not be liking.

48
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.290
And that led us to the possibility that wanting with something don't mean could

49
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:47.380
do that would sort of go along with like unusual.

50
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.300
<v 0>So in what way have the tools of neuroscience that you've used heavily in your</v>

51
00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:56.590
work supported this distinction between liking versus wanting?

52
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.930
<v 1>Well,
they've helped us these tools to tease apart the brain mechanisms of like</v>

53
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.140
conversion,
loyalty.
But you know what?

54
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.260
We really want to stress that the tools are really sort of a,

55
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.890
they give you an opportunity for an open ended question.

56
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.100
The answer could have been that there was no difference.
You know,

57
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:18.710
that dopamine was liking or that the mechanisms of liking and wants to do

58
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.730
whatever they are are always bound in separately together.

59
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.130
The answer was not that the answer was that they came apart and that was a

60
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:29.650
product of the tools.
But the tools of course,

61
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.700
they just need you to wherever the truth is and the truth is out there
somewhere.

62
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.950
<v 0>That's a lovely way to think about it.
As you know,
being a scientist,</v>

63
00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:41.400
you're really trying to discover the truth that's already there and you just

64
00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:43.710
sort of stumble upon whatever it's going to tell you.

65
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.800
<v 1>Well I think it helps to have an open mind.
Yes,
we do these things,
you know,</v>

66
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.700
I mean we all get attached to our theories and our hypotheses and we all get a

67
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:55.010
little bit disappointed when the results turn out not to be [inaudible].

68
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.830
I was disappointed actually at first when don't put wasn't pleasure like you

69
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.880
really thought that we were going to help confirm that.
Um,

70
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.340
but often what turns out to be actually true is more interesting in the end.

71
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.080
Then what we saw was true in the beginning.

72
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.070
So I think if we start with an open mind,
we end up in a good place.

73
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.440
<v 0>Excellent.
I mean in your work,
you know,</v>

74
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:18.610
on trying to understand pleasure and reward and teasing apart wanting and liking

75
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:22.360
has not only had these kind of basic science implications but it's really

76
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:26.800
generated important sites into disorders that involve dysregulated reward

77
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:27.634
functioning,
you know,

78
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.370
such as addiction for example in some of the work you're doing.

79
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.490
And I wonder if you could share what you see as some of the most exciting

80
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:37.570
discoveries in this sort of clinical or translational realm of your work.

81
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.731
<v 1>Well,</v>

82
00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:42.540
addiction was our first application with my colleague Terry Robinson here at the

83
00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:43.590
University of Michigan.

84
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.380
When we discovered the difference between liking and wanting systems.

85
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.330
And the reason for the addiction application was because it was a known almost

86
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:54.990
forever that does drugs of abuse.
Not only activate,
don't mean systems,

87
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.020
but they can actually permanently change them in some ways,

88
00:04:58.021 --> 00:05:02.400
including one way call sensitization that makes those dumping mean systems

89
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.960
hyperreactive to drugs in the future and to drug we need to queue.

90
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.560
And an addict,

91
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.120
if a person was undergoing sensitization of their dope mean systems,

92
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.160
this could create a form of addiction where they want rewards even if they

93
00:05:17.161 --> 00:05:18.900
didn't like those rewards anymore.

94
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.990
And some addicts might fit this sort of characterization.

95
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.980
Addiction was the first application and that was as far as I thought we could

96
00:05:25.981 --> 00:05:30.630
ever go.
Um,
no,
I'm not actually a number of years ago,
about 10 years ago,

97
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.060
another colleague here in social psychology,

98
00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:37.950
Robert Science suggest it to me at the time that wanting versus liking would

99
00:05:37.951 --> 00:05:41.700
have wider psychological applications beyond addiction.
And I thought,

100
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.470
well that's interesting,

101
00:05:43.471 --> 00:05:47.910
but you only had a mechanism for nowcan means sensitization and I just couldn't

102
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:50.370
go there.
But in the last 10 years or so,

103
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:54.450
a number of other people have gone to other applications from eating disorders

104
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.120
to things that can happen even in schizophrenia and some other forms of

105
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:01.250
psychological pursuits,

106
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.630
sometimes of of ideas and things that can become very intense.

107
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.870
And it may actually be that the distinction between wanting versus liking plays

108
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:12.890
out in a number of clinical conditions.

109
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.900
So it might have more general applications.

110
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:18.050
That's something that's kind of exciting.
This is just getting to emerge.
Okay.

111
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.160
<v 0>Well I was going to say,
you know,</v>

112
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:23.060
your work has really been a model for some of the findings that we've been

113
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:27.260
discovering in our lab.
Applying it to disorders like bipolar disorder,
right?

114
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:30.050
That seemed to involve dysfunction both and liking and wanting.

115
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.150
<v 1>That's a marvelous application that you're doing and I think it's really</v>

116
00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:34.984
fascinating.

117
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.760
<v 0>Yeah,
well we owe it all to your work here as do many other,
you know,</v>

118
00:06:38.761 --> 00:06:41.910
clinical psychology researchers trying to understand the nature of reward

119
00:06:41.911 --> 00:06:46.320
dysfunction.
Uh,
so we have to thank you for those discoveries.
Um,

120
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.310
but on this note,
you know,

121
00:06:47.311 --> 00:06:51.210
I wonder sort of how do you think we can apply these models,
you know,

122
00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:52.110
of dysregulated,

123
00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:57.111
either liking andwe are wanting ultimately towards aiding in differential

124
00:06:57.511 --> 00:07:02.250
diagnosis or developing really,
you know,
process driven,
uh,

125
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.720
you know,
interventions for disorders ranging from addiction to schizophrenia,

126
00:07:06.721 --> 00:07:09.950
perhaps even to mood disorders like bipolar disorder or depression.

127
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.500
<v 1>Well,
I love your emphasis on process based explanation.</v>

128
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.100
I think that's exactly what you want to do.

129
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.420
And we don't have a roadmap in the beginning for how it's gonna play out for how

130
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.020
the wanting liking distinction will apply to these things with any other process

131
00:07:25.021 --> 00:07:25.854
distinction.

132
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.870
But I think if we're sensitive to processes and if people like you who are

133
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.960
actually looking at the clinical disorders teasing apart the processes,

134
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.680
that's really marvelous and that's going to give a better signature to what

135
00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:39.870
these disorders really hard.
And at the same time,

136
00:07:39.871 --> 00:07:43.650
people like me who are sort of just exploring the basic mechanisms of

137
00:07:43.651 --> 00:07:45.060
psychological processes,

138
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.270
what the nature of the basic psychological processes are.
Um,

139
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.180
there may be further developments that have just from is.

140
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.280
So I think it's marvelous to kind of meet in the middle and we don't know where

141
00:07:57.781 --> 00:08:01.620
we're going to end up.
But by playing a lot of attention to the processes,

142
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.980
we will probably end up in a bedroom.

143
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.460
<v 0>That's a lovely note to think about.</v>

144
00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:10.180
And I think many people will take those kernels of wisdom as they try to move

145
00:08:10.181 --> 00:08:13.240
forward and develop these models of understanding,
you know,

146
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.450
basic mechanisms of reward as well as when it goes awry.
Um,

147
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.530
I wanted to ask you about another area of your research,

148
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.450
which is investigating how conscious as well as unconscious emotions can be

149
00:08:25.451 --> 00:08:27.970
involved in everyday pleasures and desires.

150
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.240
I know this is a topic that probably interests a lot of people out there

151
00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:32.140
listening to this.

152
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.800
So I wondered if you could stay a little bit about the neuro basis of these

153
00:08:35.801 --> 00:08:39.220
conscious and unconscious feelings.

154
00:08:39.221 --> 00:08:40.900
Like pleasure for example.

155
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.030
<v 1>Well,
I wish I could say something reasonable about the neural basis of conscious</v>

156
00:08:46.031 --> 00:08:49.840
versus unconscious distinction and I think that's a major challenge for us all.

157
00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:51.370
It's very hard to do that.

158
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.880
But the basic distinction between conscious pleasure and unconscious pleasure,

159
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.970
which is still very much up in the air.

160
00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.530
It was sort of started with people like Bob Science or social psychologists who

161
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:05.910
was interested in sort of immediate unconscious emotional reactions that

162
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:09.160
happened before there was the opportunity for much thinking and people who

163
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.330
started in the 1970s eighties advancing that idea.

164
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:17.700
People like John Kill strong morning almost in the psychological side and people

165
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:18.720
like Joe [inaudible],

166
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.930
Tonio Demassio on sort of the neuroscience side have been entertaining for many

167
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.080
years that the essence of pleasure and displeasure,
the essence of emotion,

168
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.800
like not being conscious and whether it's conscious or not,

169
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.270
that goes way back for he'd had an opinion and he actually wrote that there was

170
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:38.670
no such thing as unconscious emotion.
Very,

171
00:09:38.671 --> 00:09:42.300
very surprising since he thought so much.
What else could be unconscious?

172
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.940
The arguments going back and forth over the agents,

173
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.400
there is evidence now I think habitancy leaks that there might be unconscious

174
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:53.640
emotional reactions and my colleague Gilder Winkleman is valid.

175
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.910
You CSD has contributed some of that evidence.

176
00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.900
I believe that there can be unconscious emotional processes,

177
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.870
but the story still playing out,
right?
So the evidence is still coming in.

178
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:09.300
We need a lot now on the neuroscience side,
you know,

179
00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:14.301
in one sense we have a very sensible story for many years that um,

180
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.230
prefrontal cortex,

181
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:20.920
so special in humans might be the basis for our conscious emotion and some

182
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:25.050
subcortical mechanisms of emotion might be sort of the basis of unconscious

183
00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:29.460
emotional processing sustains.
Yes.
And I think that story is plausible.

184
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.000
I've said it myself and written it myself with colleagues,

185
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.680
but probably in the end there isn't much evidence for it.

186
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.280
And there's actually more and more evidence against that particular distinction.

187
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.940
Prefrontal cortex is going to be the seat of consciousness.

188
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.750
Subcortical structures would be neat with the office unconscious,

189
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.020
what the real truth is.
That's harder to say,

190
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.800
but it's a great topic for anybody interested in brain mechanisms of

191
00:10:55.801 --> 00:10:58.500
consciousness.
And hopefully in the next year,

192
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.660
new psychologists and neuroscientists we'll find out.

193
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.660
<v 0>Excellent.
I mean,
do you think,</v>

194
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:07.110
I know it sounds like this is a really wide open field with a lot of room for

195
00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:11.340
discovery.
Do we have a sense of what might be the implications?

196
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.650
The more we learn about unconscious and conscious pleasure,
you know,
uh,

197
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.900
for decision making for example,
or you know,

198
00:11:18.901 --> 00:11:22.380
what kind of implications with these different levels of pleasure have in our

199
00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:23.640
everyday behaviors.

200
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:29.000
<v 1>I think that's such a great question.
June.
And there's bound to be implications.</v>

201
00:11:29.001 --> 00:11:32.810
If there really is a distinction between unconscious emotions and conscious
ones,

202
00:11:32.811 --> 00:11:35.360
there's bound to be,
um,
applications,

203
00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:38.330
implications of that for the basis of decision making,

204
00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.300
what it's going to turn out to be.
Of course,
that's an open question.

205
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.680
But what's marvelous now is that I think the psychology and neuroscience,

206
00:11:45.681 --> 00:11:46.250
neurosciences,

207
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:51.250
pleasure is making great bounds motion can make great bounds like colleague

208
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:52.101
Morton,

209
00:11:52.101 --> 00:11:56.500
crinkle pocket Oxford University and sort of helped lead the way in the last 10

210
00:11:56.501 --> 00:12:00.520
years on sort of of neuroscience and pleasure developing them and trying to put

211
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:02.760
that on the table in the morning formula.

212
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.380
And the psychology and neuroscience of conscious versus unconscious processes is

213
00:12:07.381 --> 00:12:09.700
something which kind of moves in fits and starts.

214
00:12:09.701 --> 00:12:13.990
But it's made a lot of progress at moments in the last decade or so.
Um,

215
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:15.910
so I think,
you know,
these could come together.

216
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.140
There's so much room for more progress on both of those types of things.

217
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:25.150
So it's really,
it's for the future people who watch these videos,
um,
it's,

218
00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.230
it's really in their hands.

219
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.030
<v 0>When you mentioned the future and sort of,
you know,
where it may go.</v>

220
00:12:30.031 --> 00:12:33.390
And so that leads me to the question I wanted to ask you,
which just sort of,

221
00:12:33.391 --> 00:12:35.280
where do you see kind of the,

222
00:12:35.281 --> 00:12:38.670
the face of the future headed and emotion research?

223
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:39.640
<v 1>Well,</v>

224
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:44.640
like I think that emotion research and motion neuroscience is right for a lot

225
00:12:45.621 --> 00:12:46.850
more progress.
You,

226
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:50.660
even though emotion and an asset to pleasure displeasure have been topics in

227
00:12:50.661 --> 00:12:52.880
psychology for a hundred years,
a hundred years,

228
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:57.560
they've been relatively new to collect compared to the amount of detention and

229
00:12:57.561 --> 00:13:01.370
progress has been made in cognition and learning in your brand perception it,

230
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.270
social interactions with other psychological upon assistance.

231
00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.110
But progress can be made into motion.
Yeah.

232
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.490
Pleasure assets in neuroscience.

233
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:14.960
So it's something which I think if we're willing to engage the processes,

234
00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:16.220
take an open mind,

235
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:21.760
be willing to encounter answers that at this moment we can't even conceive,

236
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:27.400
then people will find really interesting new answers in a lot of progress to be

237
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.370
made.
It's yet to be cracked open this topic,
but it can.

238
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:37.050
<v 0>So when you give advice to students who are thinking about maybe toying with the</v>

239
00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:41.220
idea of embarking in this mysterious and wide open field of emotion,

240
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.650
what kind of advice do you usually give them?

241
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:45.830
<v 1>Well,
I'd say,
you know,</v>

242
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.800
for anybody considering a career in psychology or neuroscience,

243
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:53.250
we want to follow your deepest interests.
Do you want to find something,

244
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:58.670
a phenomenon of question that really excites you is this is the question basis

245
00:13:58.681 --> 00:14:03.681
of pleasured motion psychologically great relation of dogs to conscious versus

246
00:14:05.191 --> 00:14:09.240
unconscious processing.
If this was the question that really excites you,

247
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.620
we just want to go with that and you want to find a phenomenal,

248
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.000
I mean in the end we need to question and we all need something to study,

249
00:14:18.001 --> 00:14:22.560
some sort of aspect of emotion,
some something that's happening.

250
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.550
It has to kind of wrap our question around this phenomenon that we can actually,

251
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:30.570
so look for phenomenon and interesting and if you find one,

252
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.660
jump on it and then just study it,
study it,

253
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.160
look for the processes involved,
and he may sign something.

254
00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.530
<v 0>Well,
thank you so much for speaking with us today.
Can,
um,</v>

255
00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.920
it was terrific hearing your thoughts to these provocative questions about what

256
00:14:45.921 --> 00:14:47.330
got you here in the first place,

257
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:51.020
the kinds of projects you've been doing and where you see the future headed
from.

258
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.730
Well,
it's been great to talk with you,
Julian.
Thank you so much.
Good luck.

259
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:56.893
Thank you.

260
00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.070
So this concludes our experts and emotion interview with Dr. Kent Berridge from

261
00:15:01.071 --> 00:15:02.420
the University of Michigan.
