00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.190
Today we'll be speaking with doctor Jamil Zaki on empathy and emotion doctors.

2
00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:10.600
Aki is an assistant professor of psychology at Stanford University.

3
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.920
His research examines the neural bases of social cognition and behavior.

4
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.001
In other words,

5
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:20.380
how do people come to understand each other and decide to behave towards each

6
00:00:20.381 --> 00:00:25.120
other?
So this work spans a number of domains including empathy,
theory of mind,

7
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.970
social influence,
and prosocial behavior.
Doctors oc,

8
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.760
he received his BA in cognitive neuroscience from Boston University and his phd

9
00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:38.320
in psychology from Columbia University after which she conducted postdoctoral

10
00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:43.090
research on altruism and prosocial behavior at the Harvard Center for Brain

11
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.600
Science.

12
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.400
He's received research and teaching awards from Society for Personality and

13
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.410
Social Psychology,
the cognitive neuroscience society,

14
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.370
the Society for neuroscience,
the American psychological association,

15
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.890
the association for Psychological Science,

16
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.650
autism speaks as well as Harvard University.

17
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.730
So I now turn to a very special experts in emotion interview with one of the

18
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:06.640
most empathic people that I know,

19
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.140
which is doctor Jamil Zaki speaking with us on empathy and emotion.

20
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.310
So welcome Jamil.
Thanks for being with us today.

21
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:16.563
<v 1>Thanks a lot for having me.</v>

22
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.050
<v 0>So I'd love to start out just by asking you a little bit about what got you</v>

23
00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:24.500
first interested in emotion,
sort of where did it all start for you?

24
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.610
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean,
um,
so for me,
uh,</v>

25
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.630
I guess it's a little bit of a personal story actually because I got interested

26
00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:34.750
in empathy,
uh,
through my grandmother,
my mother's mother.

27
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.720
My mom was born and raised in Peru.
Um,

28
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.530
and my grandmother lived there for most of her life,
but lived with,
uh,

29
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.820
with me while I was growing up.

30
00:01:42.821 --> 00:01:47.290
And of course there are lots of very empathic people in the u s but Peru is a

31
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.040
collectivistic culture.
And,
um,
and my grandmother,

32
00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:53.890
it was an incredibly collective is the person.

33
00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:58.891
And I was always struck by how her emotional life seem to center not around what

34
00:01:58.901 --> 00:02:02.980
happened to her,
but around the,
uh,
failures,
successes,
um,

35
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.370
happiness and pain of those around her.
And she's a,

36
00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:08.560
she was the most empathetic person I ever knew.
Um,

37
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.260
so she got me interested in this subject and it was only many years later that,

38
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.470
uh,

39
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.590
that I discovered you could study empathy through psychology and neuroscience.

40
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.420
<v 0>Well that's a beautiful story.
And from what I hear and what I know about you to,</v>

41
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:24.210
you're one of the most empathic people out there as well.

42
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.083
<v 1>Well thank you.</v>

43
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.300
<v 0>So I want to ask you some questions then about your work on empathy.</v>

44
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:32.940
So we can all relate to these feelings of empathy,

45
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:35.010
those maybe we have for other people like,

46
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.400
like our grandmas or even animals for those us who have pets.

47
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.850
But defining what empathy is seems to be a bit tricky.

48
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.710
So as an expert in empathy,

49
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:46.980
I was wondering if you could tell us a bit about what do you see as the sort of

50
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:49.890
key or essential ingredients that make up empathy?

51
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.260
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean,
that's a great question and I think that empathy is such a complex,</v>

52
00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.030
multifaceted phenomenon at over the years.
Uh,
it's come up,
it's,

53
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.120
it's been described,

54
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:05.180
there are many different definition by many different scientists.
And so,
um,

55
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.190
in my work,
instead of trying to stump for one definition or another,

56
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:13.570
I've tried to put a bunch of them together and I see they're really being three

57
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.570
key ingredients to what I would consider the experience of empathy.
Um,

58
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.610
so one is what you could consider a very emotional response to someone sort of

59
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:25.780
sharing their joy or pain,
uh,
uh,
or the experience,

60
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.330
I would call this something like a Bill Clinton effect,
right?

61
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:32.170
Because Clinton is famous for saying that he felt the pain of other people

62
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.610
around him.
Uh,

63
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:36.910
another piece to empathy might be something that's very much more cognitive.

64
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:41.290
So understanding what other people are feeling and where those feelings come

65
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:45.850
from.
This is sometimes been called a what's in this theory of mind.
Uh,

66
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.540
and then a third might be considered a motivational piece.

67
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.350
So given that I understand what you're feeling and share what you're feeling,

68
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.730
do I have a motivation or desire to change?
What's your feeling?
Uh,

69
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:58.610
and make it better,

70
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.100
sort of alleviate your suffering or increase the positive ethic that you're

71
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.963
experiencing.

72
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.320
And what's interesting is that these different pieces of empathy can sometimes

73
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:10.860
split apart,
right?
So for instance,
um,

74
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.830
if you see someone else who's experienced this in lots of pain,

75
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:16.030
let's say it has had an accident,

76
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.330
you might share that pain through something that we would call it emotional

77
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:21.790
contagion.
You might feel very distressed yourself,

78
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.940
but your response to that distress might not be to help that person.

79
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.420
It might be to get out of there as soon as you can because you really don't

80
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:32.860
enjoy that feeling of distress that you have because of that person.
Similarly,

81
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:37.620
psychopaths for instance,
are sometimes great at understanding other people,
uh,

82
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.650
but far from using that understanding to share other people's aspect or help

83
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:45.170
them,
they off use it to manipulate and even harm others.

84
00:04:45.171 --> 00:04:49.000
So I think this really suggests that these key ingredients to empathy,

85
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.580
although they're related,
can also be distinct.

86
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.351
<v 0>That's just,</v>

87
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:56.340
it's really interesting to just realize how multifaceted empathy really is.

88
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.340
I mean,
that then begs the question of,
well,

89
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.090
how is empathy different from these other kind of ideas that we have in our

90
00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:08.040
minds of sympathy or pity?
Is it a,
is it distinct from those,
would you say?

91
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.740
<v 1>I think that,
um,
I think that sympathy and pity,
uh,
and,
and you know,
uh,</v>

92
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.760
sharing people's pain,
um,

93
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.900
all of these kind of words capture that.

94
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.380
There's this sort of different descriptions of what I would think of as pieces

95
00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:25.380
of but be right.
The experience of pity for instance,

96
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.420
is one where you see someone else's suffering you might feel for them,

97
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.000
but you don't share their,
their emotions.
It's,
it's,

98
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.540
it's very easy to kind of pity someone without really kind of,
uh,

99
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.970
entering into the emotion that they're experiencing.
And I think critically,

100
00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:45.090
a lot of the emotions can variably,
uh,

101
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:47.790
affect the way that we actually choose to help others.
Right?

102
00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:52.230
So a sense of pity might not be the most useful feeling if you really want,

103
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.800
I want to encourage people to go out and help others.

104
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.460
<v 0>That's really helpful.
Jamil.</v>

105
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.241
<v 1>And what's,</v>

106
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:02.030
what's neat about you've done an empathy is not just sort of unpack the

107
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:05.220
different component parts of empathy,
but you've also,
you know,

108
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.750
shed some really exciting discoveries into the neural basis of empathy.

109
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.490
And I was just wondering,

110
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.580
what do you think are some of the most exciting discoveries that we know right

111
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:18.530
now about the brain and its ability to help kind of give rise to this capacity

112
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:21.150
for empathy?
Yeah,
I mean,
I think,
uh,

113
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.540
the science and the neuro science of empathy in particular has exploded over the

114
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:30.440
last 10 or 15 years.
It's a really exciting time to be in the field.
I mean,

115
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:35.441
a lot of the great work in this area has really started out by confirming that

116
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:39.890
these different pieces of empathy are in fact separate.
So for instance,

117
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.710
there's very famous work that,
that,
uh,
you and,

118
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:47.030
and many of your viewers will probably have heard of on so called mirror
neurons,

119
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:51.470
right?
These are neurons that,
uh,
that sort of come online and,
and in,
in,

120
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:55.820
in human's brain areas that come online,
both when you,
uh,
uh,

121
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.930
perform an action and when you view someone else performing that same action and

122
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.480
they're similarly,
uh,

123
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.360
regions in the brain that respond both when you experience pain and see someone

124
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:06.194
else in pain,

125
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.880
when you experienced reward and see someone else experienced reward.
Uh,

126
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.940
and so forth.
And these,
I think really this kind of quality of the brain,

127
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:17.540
which I could call it neuro residents for instance,
um,
uh,

128
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.620
suggest that this vicarious components,

129
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.820
empathy is really strongly rooted in,

130
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.140
in that particular system of brain regions.
By contrast,

131
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.020
a neuroimaging studies of theory of mind,
for instance.
Sure,

132
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.890
totally different pattern of brain activity,
right?

133
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.920
These are regions of the brain that such as the medial prefrontal cortex and

134
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:41.780
posterior singular,
without getting into too much detail,

135
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.860
these are all some of the brain that are most active when we're at rest,

136
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.000
they seem to be involved in kind of figuring out what it is that other people

137
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:51.620
are feeling.
Uh,
and,

138
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:55.490
and the really interesting thing about these two systems is that not only are

139
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:58.790
they different in space right there in different parts of your brain,

140
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.740
but in fact,
uh,
for instance,

141
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:05.660
damage to one of these systems can affect an affective empathy or emotional

142
00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:09.650
empathy without changing cognitive empathy and vice a versa.
Right?

143
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:14.240
So there's some real evidence here that these components of empathy are

144
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:18.620
distinct,
not only at the psychological level,
but also at the level of the brain.

145
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.570
Um,
I think that for me,

146
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:25.571
some of the most exciting work that's happening now focuses not on separating

147
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:28.520
these two systems,
but rather on seeing how they come together.

148
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.430
So oftentimes when we empathize with someone,

149
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.860
it's not on the basis of something simple,

150
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.450
like just seeing them in pain or knowing what it is that they're feeling.

151
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:43.160
It's a complex combination of cues.
I was think of a,
for instance,

152
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:47.000
gold medal winners,
right?
So you see someone who just won the gold medal,

153
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.520
and if you didn't know that they had won the gold medal,

154
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.530
you think that they were totally miserable,
right?

155
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:56.310
These people are often crying hysterically.
They seem really upset if anything,

156
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.540
but you know,

157
00:08:57.541 --> 00:09:01.860
based on context that in fact you should interpret their facial expressions.

158
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.120
They're crying is tears of joy,
not of sorrow.
And,

159
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:08.720
and so I think that that now it is,
uh,

160
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.660
researchers have started to focus on how the neural systems that are involved in

161
00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:17.661
processing cues like facial expressions combined with the neuro systems that

162
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.240
focus on understanding complex contextual information to come up to kind of put

163
00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:28.260
the pieces together and come up with our full empathic response to these

164
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.270
complicated social situations.

165
00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.300
<v 0>And that's really interesting because you're talking about just how these</v>

166
00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:37.850
complicated social systems require this sort of advanced understanding of key

167
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.100
contextual cues.
And when you think about the work,

168
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:45.270
both neuro neuroscience work as well as maybe if you want to speak to behavioral

169
00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:45.840
work,

170
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.890
do you think this kind of work really suggests that empathy is a uniquely human

171
00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:50.724
capacity?

172
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:56.040
<v 1>Oh,
that's a great question.
Yeah,
I mean,
I think that over over the last,
well,</v>

173
00:09:56.041 --> 00:09:58.830
I mean at least probably 30 years,

174
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.210
scientists have debated sort of how much do a other animals,

175
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:08.190
especially nonhuman primates,
uh,
feel empathy and understand,

176
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.790
uh,
what other members of their species are experiencing.

177
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:16.320
And I think that this work has sort of taken on two different,
uh,

178
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:21.090
two different dimensions.
One is really impressing us with how,
uh,

179
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.750
how,

180
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:26.750
how much of the pieces of empathy other animals appear capable of experiencing.

181
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.330
And the second is to suggest that even though,
uh,

182
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.550
other animals can experience some of these qualities,

183
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:37.240
they probably don't reach the level of,
uh,
of what we would consider sort of the,

184
00:10:37.241 --> 00:10:42.000
the full fledged complexity of,
of human empathy.
So for instance,

185
00:10:42.001 --> 00:10:45.640
on the one hand,
there's lots of evidence that chimpanzees,
um,

186
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.980
can do a really impressive job of understanding what other members of their

187
00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:54.300
species and humans can,
can see what they,
what they know,

188
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.310
what they believe,
how they intend to act,
and so forth.
Uh,
and,
and,

189
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:02.160
uh,
on,
on the kind of line of emotional empathy,

190
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:06.000
there's been really impressive work over the last five years or so demonstrating

191
00:11:06.001 --> 00:11:06.880
that,
um,

192
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.950
that even mice appeared to feel or share the pain of other members of their

193
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:13.330
species.
Uh,

194
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:18.350
one of my favorite studies in this direction been last year at the University of

195
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.880
Chicago.
And research has found that rats,

196
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:25.910
we're not only motivated to help a fellow rat who is trapped by some kind of

197
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:28.230
cage like apparatus,

198
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.700
they even gave up chocolate in order to help the other at.

199
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.420
And then after helping the wrath,

200
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.810
they gave up some of the chocolate to share with that other member of their

201
00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:40.170
species.
I mean this is sort of,
it's,
it's cute,
but it's also a,

202
00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:43.970
it's also really interesting because it suggests that these animals,

203
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:45.360
not even nonhuman primates,

204
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:49.950
but even rodents experience empathy at levels that probably,
uh,

205
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.710
people might not suspect.
On the other hand,

206
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:57.070
there's very little evidence that rats actually understand the states of,

207
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.470
of their,
uh,
of their conspecifics.

208
00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:03.320
And in fact there's no clear kind of a homologous or,

209
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:07.200
or analogous brain region,
uh,
in,
in rats and mice,
uh,

210
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:11.560
that would map onto the brain regions that we use to understand each other.
Uh,

211
00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.120
and,
and even non human primates,

212
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.720
although they might be able to understand at some of what,
uh,

213
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.670
what other members of their species in 10,
they certainly not,

214
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.220
they don't appear as motivated to help other members of their species as we do.

215
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.180
<v 0>Do you think this suggests something about there being different shades or</v>

216
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.000
levels of empathy across different species?

217
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:36.720
<v 1>Yeah,
I do.
Uh,
I do think,
um,
I basically think again,
if you,</v>

218
00:12:36.721 --> 00:12:39.410
if you think of empathy as sort of this,
uh,

219
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.310
rich construct and you only call something empathy when it involves all three of

220
00:12:44.311 --> 00:12:46.080
the pieces about which we've been talking.

221
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:51.410
I think that what this works suggests is that nonhuman animals have the capacity

222
00:12:52.381 --> 00:12:56.850
to feel one piece or another piece or sometimes even two of these pieces,

223
00:12:56.851 --> 00:12:59.080
but rarely if ever.
Uh,
and,

224
00:12:59.081 --> 00:13:01.070
and I would say that there was no real evidence that they,

225
00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.730
that they experience is kind of what I would again called full fledged,
uh,

226
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.850
empathy in terms of this rich multifaceted constructs.

227
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.090
<v 0>No,
that's helpful.</v>

228
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.600
So if we kind of take a step back and sort of think about what might be the

229
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:18.740
broad or kind of public health consequences of trying to understand and foster

230
00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:23.140
greater empathy,
would we,
what would that have,
you know,
towards the building?

231
00:13:23.141 --> 00:13:25.420
Maybe a more compassionate society?

232
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:30.240
<v 1>Hmm.
Yeah.
I mean,
uh,
if,
if I could just put in a plug,
uh,
if,</v>

233
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.960
if,
uh,
your viewers have,

234
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.470
have not seen the book that they probably have a by Steve Pinker,

235
00:13:35.471 --> 00:13:39.550
the better angels of our nature.
It's,
it's just,
it's a fantastic book,
uh,

236
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.250
about really a profound but simple point,

237
00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:44.870
which is that over the centuries I have,

238
00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.070
society has become reliably more violent or less violent.

239
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.570
We think of ourselves as maybe living in this really violent,
destructive time.

240
00:13:55.571 --> 00:14:00.090
But in fact,
pinker really clearly lays out the idea that,

241
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.720
that we live in an incredibly peaceful circumstances compared to any other

242
00:14:04.721 --> 00:14:09.550
moment in,
in,
in our species' history.
Uh,
and our society's history.
And,

243
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.310
and he suggests,
and,
and I'm,
I'm on board with this,

244
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:17.020
that maybe this has to do with an expansion or where an expansion in our

245
00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:17.800
empathy,

246
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.820
a change in the way that we think of and relate to other people's suffering,

247
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:22.211
right?
I mean,

248
00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:27.211
we might be much more averse to human suffering now than we were centuries ago.

249
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:27.670
I mean,

250
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.690
and I think that what makes this profound to me as an empathy researcher is when

251
00:14:31.691 --> 00:14:33.730
you get into this field,
the,

252
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.330
one of the first questions that you ask yourself and the other people ask you,

253
00:14:37.331 --> 00:14:40.660
is,
is empathy a fixed quality?
Is it,

254
00:14:40.661 --> 00:14:43.750
is it something that you're born with a certain level of empathy and that's all

255
00:14:43.751 --> 00:14:46.840
you're going to have for your entire life at a broader level.

256
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.740
Does our society have a fixed level of empathy that can never change?

257
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:55.640
I think increasingly is evidence that empathy can be changed,
right?
So,
um,

258
00:14:55.641 --> 00:14:59.180
it can be changed in the short term by things like perspective taking

259
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:03.890
interventions,
right?
Having people really,
uh,
walk a mile in someone else's shoes,

260
00:15:03.891 --> 00:15:04.611
for instance.
Right?

261
00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:08.330
And there are all sorts of psychological interventions that get people to

262
00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:11.750
seriously consider the points of view of others,
uh,

263
00:15:11.751 --> 00:15:16.751
and demonstrate that this helps not only helps people feel motivated to act more

264
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.390
altruistically,
for instance,
towards members of their own group,

265
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:24.950
but can even sort of help to dissolve some of the boundaries between groups,

266
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:28.790
for instance,
between political parties or different nations.
Right.

267
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.030
And this is sort of a work this on the cusp of being more applicable.
Um,

268
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.990
similarly in the medium term,

269
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:40.010
there are lots of compassion meditation interventions that people are using now.

270
00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.350
Uh,
and there's great evidence just emerging,
uh,

271
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.870
over the last few years that these types of meditation can alter people's

272
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.430
prosocial behavior,

273
00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:53.570
their preferences for helping other people as well as some of the brain activity

274
00:15:53.571 --> 00:15:55.910
that underlies certain forms of empathy.

275
00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:59.420
So I hope that researchers in the coming year is,
uh,

276
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.770
take a hard look at how we can really expand these interventions,

277
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.420
both to make them broader.

278
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:10.460
So I like the idea of transits online interventions that can reach thousands of

279
00:16:10.461 --> 00:16:14.000
people as opposed to just a few people and also more long term.

280
00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:17.900
Are there things that we can do to change people's levels of empathy,

281
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:22.010
not just over the course of hours,
but over the course of months or even years.

282
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.860
I think that this could have huge policy implications both in helping,
uh,

283
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:27.351
again,

284
00:16:27.351 --> 00:16:32.060
dissolve the boundaries between groups of people that really harm us as a

285
00:16:32.061 --> 00:16:35.500
society and also helping to strengthen the relationships,
uh,

286
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.160
that keep us healthy as individuals.

287
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.780
<v 0>Yeah.
So you talked about sort of your hopes and visions for the coming years.</v>

288
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.100
Where do you see this field,
uh,
headed in the years to come,

289
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.980
sort of what would you see as being on the horizon?

290
00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.920
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean,
I think,
um,
you know,</v>

291
00:16:51.921 --> 00:16:56.810
the future of empathy research and emotion research more broadly to me,
um,
is,

292
00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.820
is interesting because I see the field going in two really different directions.

293
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:05.950
One is towards a very fine grained assessment of emotion and empathy.

294
00:17:06.051 --> 00:17:10.580
So sort of a,
there were lots of new computational and math models of,

295
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:15.410
of emotion.
And there are a lot of great tools from Matt from,
ah,
please,

296
00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:20.270
like computer science and economics that are allowing us to really assess how

297
00:17:20.271 --> 00:17:23.740
events affect our emotional experiences,
um,

298
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.880
in ways that we never could before.

299
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.770
And then the second direction is actually the opposite one towards the study of

300
00:17:30.771 --> 00:17:33.890
more complex and naturalistic emotions,
right?

301
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:38.150
A lot of emotion research and especially empathy research has focused on things

302
00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:42.620
like looking at other people's faces.
Um,
but really like,

303
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.800
like with the gold medal winner that we were talking about earlier,

304
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.340
oftentimes empathy and emotion in general,
um,

305
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.680
takes place in much more complex situations.

306
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:57.660
And I think that now research has a focusing on studying how emotion and empathy

307
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.190
unfold,
uh,
in more kind of,
if you will,
real life circumstances.

308
00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.620
<v 0>So what would you say then for students who are thinking of embarking in this</v>

309
00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:12.440
study of emotion generally and maybe empathy specifically,

310
00:18:12.441 --> 00:18:14.570
what advice would you have for students?

311
00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:19.280
<v 1>Yeah.
You know,
I think it's,
it's just,
it's got to be the old Wayne Gretzky quote,</v>

312
00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.510
uh,
that you've got to skate not to where the puck is,

313
00:18:23.511 --> 00:18:28.410
but where it's going to be.
Right.
Um,
emotion research is relatively young.
Uh,

314
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.780
it changes all the time.
Uh,
and I think that for students of,
of emotion,

315
00:18:32.781 --> 00:18:36.730
it's important not just to really enjoy and,
and,

316
00:18:36.731 --> 00:18:40.130
and sort of think about the work that people are doing now and have done,

317
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:44.830
but really look for the gaps that I think about,
uh,
what the next steps are,
uh,

318
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.500
that have yet to be taken,
sort of the undiscovered country,
if you will.

319
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:53.220
<v 0>Undiscovered country of,
of emotion.
That's right.</v>

320
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.190
Well,
thanks for speaking with us today to meal.
Um,

321
00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:01.970
this concludes our experts in emotion interview series with Doctor Jamil Zaki

322
00:19:01.971 --> 00:19:03.410
from Stanford University.
