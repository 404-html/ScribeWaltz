1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.560
Welcome back to human emotion.
Um,

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.570
today we're going to discuss the continuing question of individual differences

3
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:10.680
in emotion.
Today we're going to focus on gender here.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.710
I want to ask the question with you and have you think through our men and women

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.210
really that different emotionally.

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.620
So do they experience entirely different emotional worlds?

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.780
Indeed our men and women from different,
you know,
emotional planets.
Um,

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.840
how is it possible that we could see such great differences between men and

9
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:37.590
women emotionally given that for the most part we're all made up of the same

10
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:41.130
kind of genetic stuff or material.
So again,

11
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.190
our men and women really that different when it comes to emotion.

12
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.170
Conventional wisdom seems to suggest that men and women are different and that

13
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:51.510
women must be somehow more emotional and men.

14
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:56.370
And we see characatures of this in the news and even comics.
So I mean,

15
00:00:56.371 --> 00:01:01.371
what you're seeing here is just this kind of depiction over and over again of

16
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:06.561
women being really hyper emotional and men being sort of relatively emotionally

17
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:10.230
sedated.
So how true are these kind of,
you know,

18
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.670
characatures and this conventional wisdom where we talk about men and women

19
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:18.180
really being these different emotional beings.
Um,

20
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.240
and this is what I want to talk with you about today.
So here,

21
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.950
let's answer the question together.

22
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:27.030
Our men and women really from different emotional planets.

23
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.060
We're going to go through the roadmap today.

24
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.440
First walking through this socialization of emotion from an early age,

25
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.430
some experimental findings,
looking at emotion between men and women,

26
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.180
and wrap up with takeaway questions and our expert interview.

27
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.150
So let's start with the socialization of emotion.

28
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.130
So this here is the idea that our emotions get socialized in us from a very

29
00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:51.930
early age through culture.

30
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.000
So it teaches us sort of what emotions are appropriate to experience,
um,

31
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.580
and sort of what context they're appropriate to express.

32
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:04.581
And so to what extent might gender differences in emotion actually be

33
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:09.480
socialized?
So let me give you a few examples.

34
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.380
The first example is through gender stereotypes.

35
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.480
What do I mean by this?

36
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.740
So there was a study done that looked at infants who were being startled.

37
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.240
So you might remember from our earlier lectures on methods to elicit emotion.

38
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.040
The startle response is where you just present a loud noise blast and look at

39
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:33.360
how different people respond,

40
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.010
kind of getting startled and how much they get startled.
So they studied infants,

41
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.480
uh,
from a very young age and looked at how they responded to being startled and

42
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:46.570
they videotaped the infants and then showed these videos back to parents who

43
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:50.580
were asked to rate the emotions of these poor little infants being startled by a

44
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:51.810
loud noise blast.

45
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.160
What's really interesting here was not so much how the infants actually
deferred,

46
00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:59.040
but how the parents rated the emotions of these infants.

47
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.690
So young infant girls were rated as more fearful.
Um,

48
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.990
and young infant boys,

49
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:09.460
we're actually rated as more angry and determined.
So,

50
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.450
and this was just them being told what gender the infant was drastically shaped

51
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:17.320
the way parents perceive the emotions of these infants in response to the same

52
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.390
startled queue.
We also see many gender stereotypes,
you know,

53
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:25.270
not only in books like men are from Mars,
women are from Venus,

54
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.130
but also from different,
you know,

55
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.080
random romantic comedies out there such as the swan.
I'm the ugly truth,

56
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.220
right?
So we see these depicted in our readings and in the media as well.

57
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.630
Okay.
Example too,
of how emotions may be socialized.

58
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.860
So there's a study here that actually looks at the early conversations that

59
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:49.060
occur between young children and their parents here.

60
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.420
This is really interesting.
So,
um,

61
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.140
there was a study that looked at conversations between moms and their children's

62
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:58.090
about important emotional events.

63
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.310
And what they actually found is that mothers really talk quite differently to

64
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:07.480
their sons and their daughters.
So with their sons,
um,

65
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.340
mothers often talk about anger and that seems to be the primary emotion that

66
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:15.460
gets discussed with young boys.
By contrast,

67
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:18.430
the way moms talk with their young daughters is quite different.

68
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:21.940
It's more than just one kind of emotion that's really focused on,

69
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.160
they share this rich emotional vocabulary with young girls talking about a

70
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:29.830
variety of many different emotions states.

71
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.620
So what we're seeing is from an early age,

72
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.800
girls are socialized to develop this rich emotion vocabulary while boys are

73
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:41.740
narrowly concentrated just to this one emotion of anger.

74
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.530
The third example are actually from child rearing manuals.

75
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.000
So one of the famous examples is this book,
um,
by Benjamin Spock,

76
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:56.790
the pocket book of baby and childcare.
And in this particular book,
um,

77
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.320
when it gives parent advice that says for girls,

78
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.670
you really should try to encourage girls to cry and be emotional.

79
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.900
Whereas with boys and doctor Spock's book,
he says you want to encourage anger,

80
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.080
you know,
and sort of out of control behavior,
right?

81
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.020
So you want to encourage them to express these emotions,
um,

82
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.940
and that these emotions are encouraged differentially between girls and boys.

83
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.360
Um,

84
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.170
and so what's really interesting here is not whether this is terrible advice to

85
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:26.920
be encouraging your children to be,
you know,
uh,
excessively emotional,

86
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.990
but more sort of what are the kinds of emotions that you are focusing on between

87
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:33.400
girls and boys.

88
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.450
Here we're seeing an emphasis with emotionality and crying with girls.
And again,

89
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:37.931
with boys,

90
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:42.350
it's really about this emotion of anger that seems to be discussed and,

91
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.020
and sort of,
um,
you know,
uh,
emphasized in these child rearing manuals.

92
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.950
Okay.
But what does the data actually suggests?

93
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:55.951
So given the strong socialization differences between young boys and girls,

94
00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.250
how might men and women actually then differ in their emotional responses when

95
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:05.810
you take them into the lab and use some of the same methods or tools of

96
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:08.600
emotional elicitation that we've talked about earlier in the course?

97
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.580
Do we actually see differences emerge?
And so here,
um,

98
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.510
I just want to acknowledge that a lot of this work was done by,
um,

99
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.310
Mazda Irene Banaji at Harvard University and our own Marion the France here at

100
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:24.050
Yale University.
Um,

101
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:28.010
so they have been some of the pioneers behind looking and providing a

102
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:32.900
comprehensive review of the literature on this topic.
Um,

103
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.530
and when we look at what people have found,

104
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:40.880
I want to remind ourselves that what we want to do is when looking at emotional

105
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:42.500
differences between men and women,

106
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.980
we want to keep this same framework that we've talked about from the beginning

107
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:46.814
of the course.

108
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.260
So looking at emotion as a multi componential response with subjective reports

109
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:53.030
of internal emotion experience,

110
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.530
looking at outward displays of behavior or expressions in the face as well as

111
00:06:57.531 --> 00:07:01.850
physiological responses both in the autonomic nervous system and at the neural

112
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:06.740
level in the brain.
So what do we see first with subjective emotion?

113
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.890
Here's what's interesting.
So for subjective emotion differences,
um,

114
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.410
we do see Jen gender differences emerge but only under certain conditions.

115
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.630
And so I've highlighted these here in purple.

116
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.610
So we see gender differences in the self reports of emotion emerge when they're

117
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:25.190
asked to rate their emotion directly.

118
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.420
So there's just supposed to rate their own emotion state.
You see,

119
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.090
men and women differ.
So men will report,
or sorry,

120
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:35.960
women will report greater intensity of emotion.
You don't see differences.

121
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:39.680
However,
when they look at self reports of emotion indirectly.

122
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:44.150
So ask people to sort of write about a story of an emotional experience and

123
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:44.984
describe it.

124
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.700
The second row here looks at on this idea of public display.

125
00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:54.140
So when you ask people to report about sort of how they display their emotions,

126
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.520
um,
there's gender differences emerging when you include items such as asking

127
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:00.100
people,
uh,
you know,

128
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.680
to rate the extent to which they agree with the statement that most people can

129
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:05.720
tell what I'm feeling.
Um,

130
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.680
you see gender differences emerge here where women more often rate,
uh,

131
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.070
or highly endorsed this item,

132
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.200
but you don't see gender differences emerge when they're reporting about their

133
00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:18.580
own private or internal experience.
Um,

134
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.680
third row here is looking at this interview versus um,
uh,

135
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.420
intra personal,
which it should say here on the right and,
uh,
instead.

136
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:31.130
So we see gender differences emerge and people report their emotions when

137
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:32.810
they're around other people,

138
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.850
but you don't see differences emerge when they're talking more interpersonally

139
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.170
or being alone.
And then finally at the bottom,
um,

140
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.610
when you ask people to report how they feel globally,
um,

141
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.240
you do see gender differences emerge.
Um,

142
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.360
but you don't see them emerge when you're reporting really specific or discrete

143
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:53.750
emotions like happiness or sadness.
So again,

144
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:57.570
when we think about the subjective of emotion,
there are differences that emerge.

145
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:58.650
But not always.

146
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:03.651
So it's really under specific conditions when emotions are being rated directly,

147
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:07.080
when they're related to reports of public displays of emotion,

148
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.810
when they're referring to interpersonal emotions.

149
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.110
And when emotions are rated globally across these domains,

150
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:17.580
what you generally see is women reporting greater emotion experience than men.

151
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.100
Okay?
Now,
so what if we look at behavior,
right?

152
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:26.490
So you can see the woman in the top left showing behavioral display a fear.

153
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.720
What do we generally see?
So we do see that women,
uh,

154
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.160
generally express more behavioral expressions of emotion of men.

155
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:40.230
And we see this across a variety of measures.
So we see this across EMG,

156
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:44.370
which is applying electrodes to the face that measure different contractions of

157
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:48.110
muscles.
And we also see it across,
um,

158
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.480
self reported measures of how much people think they smile.

159
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.180
And also looking at sort of nonverbal gesturing.

160
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.660
Women seem to be more expressive across these measures.

161
00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.910
When we look at emotional behavior,

162
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.110
we also see it evident across a variety of different emotional displays as well.

163
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:08.880
Sadness,
disgust,
fear,
surprise and happiness.

164
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:11.760
And this is a review that was done by crying.
And Gordon,

165
00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:13.050
as you can see here on the bottom.

166
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:17.580
So it seems to be the case that women are more emotionally expressive in their

167
00:10:17.581 --> 00:10:21.420
behavior than men.
However,

168
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:23.730
when we look at the level of physiological responding,

169
00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:27.180
we're not seeing strong evidence suggesting gender differences.

170
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:31.860
So we don't see robust evidence suggesting differences in neuro responding in

171
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:32.670
the brain,

172
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.420
looking at things like the Amygdala or the prefrontal cortex that is related to

173
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:38.100
the cognitive control of emotion.

174
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.610
And we also don't see differences at the level of the autonomic nervous system.

175
00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:45.780
So looking at skin conductance,
heart rate,
cardiac vagal tone,

176
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.460
we do not see robust physiological differences between men and women and

177
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:55.230
response to emotionally evocative stimuli.
So to summarize these differences,

178
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:58.080
what we're seeing is when we look at subjective emotion,

179
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.800
women generally report more emotion than men,
but only in certain contexts.

180
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:07.140
Um,
when it comes to behavior,
women are generally more expressive than men,

181
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.850
but when it comes to the physiological responding,
we see few,
if,

182
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:16.020
if no biological differences that seem to emerge whatsoever.

183
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.780
Um,
the caveat here to keep in mind that,

184
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:23.190
that these are general tendencies between men and women across large groups.

185
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.470
So there's lots of room here for individual variation and these are just kind of

186
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:31.750
general broad strokes of,
of men and women,
uh,

187
00:11:31.751 --> 00:11:35.520
and how they differ in their emotions.
Okay.

188
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:40.970
So we've talked a bit about today the socialization of emotion and how it really

189
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:43.470
seems to be the case that even from a young age,

190
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.740
men and women are socialized to experience different emotions and to express

191
00:11:49.561 --> 00:11:51.420
them at higher degrees or intensities.

192
00:11:51.421 --> 00:11:55.870
So even young girls are taught to think and talk more about their emotions and

193
00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:58.720
are more encouraged to express their emotions.
Then young boys,

194
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:03.700
we've also reviewed experimental findings where we see that women sometimes

195
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:05.260
report more emotion than men.

196
00:12:05.261 --> 00:12:08.860
Under certain contexts they express more emotion.
Um,

197
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:13.630
but we don't see any sort of more biological or physiological differences in

198
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:14.464
emotion.

199
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.730
So what I want to turn now to our is our takeaway questions that summarize the

200
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.810
main,
main,
kind of take home points from what we've reviewed today.

201
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:27.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

202
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.830
<v 0>So the first question asks,</v>

203
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:34.720
what are the key pieces of evidence for the socialization of emotion?

204
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:39.280
What is the evidence that suggest that socialization of emotion actually occurs?

205
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.253
Second,

206
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:46.350
what are the different domains or components of gender differences that seem to

207
00:12:46.721 --> 00:12:48.340
emerge an emotional responding?

208
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.390
So when you look at subjective behavioral and physiological domains,

209
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.860
where are the gender differences actually occurring in emotion responsivity?

210
00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.600
And then finally,
um,

211
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.490
what are the domains of gender similarities where there seemed to be no

212
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:07.810
differences in emotional responding across,
again,
these three domains,
subjective,

213
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.790
behavioral,
and physiological.

214
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.340
And so now we will move to our expert interview.
Um,

215
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.300
and for our experts and emotion interview.
Uh,

216
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.070
we have the honor speaking with Dr Marion,
the France,

217
00:13:21.071 --> 00:13:25.660
to consider the question of whether men and women emotionally differ.

218
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.820
So doctor the France is a professor of psychology and of women in gender studies

219
00:13:30.821 --> 00:13:35.500
at Yale University where she teaches courses in social psychology and gender

220
00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:39.190
psychology,
as well as nonverbal communication.

221
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.520
So her research focuses on how emotion and power are transmitted in these subtle

222
00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:49.300
emotional communication cues.
Some of her recent work has focused,

223
00:13:49.301 --> 00:13:53.290
in particular on the human smile examining questions such as,

224
00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:56.050
why do when men smile less than women?

225
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.350
Why do women smile when being sexually harassed?

226
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.330
And to whom do babies show a coy smile?
Um,

227
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.290
this work has received widespread attention and various media outlets,

228
00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:12.520
including NPR,
BBC,
NBC,
The New York Times,

229
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:13.870
among many others.

230
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.680
So I will now turn to an interview with my local Yo colleague,
uh,

231
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.500
Dr Marion La France.

232
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

233
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.580
<v 0>As part of our experts in emotion series.
Thanks for a great course.</v>

234
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:31.670
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
