1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.950
Welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.520
So this is our final and third segment.

3
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:09.450
Looking at the ways in which emotion can go awry and trying to understand how

4
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:14.451
the basic processes and functions of emotion may sometimes literally unravel and

5
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:15.774
fall apart.

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.640
So today what we're going to be talking about is psychosis as well as

7
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:24.690
personality disorders and the way in which they represent,
um,

8
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.600
the ways emotion can go awry or unravel.

9
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.060
So our roadmap today will go as follows.

10
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.080
We'll start by looking at schizophrenia as a window into understanding psychosis

11
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:34.914
and emotion.

12
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.240
Next we'll turn turn to borderline personality disorder is a key candidate

13
00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:43.380
personality disorder that really exemplifies difficulties in both emotional

14
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:46.950
reactivity on the one hand and emotion regulation on the other.

15
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.430
Then we'll conclude with our takeaway questions and expert interview.

16
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.960
So let's begin first with schizophrenia,
perhaps one of the most mysterious,

17
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.820
the most elusive,
and yet the most complex and difficult to treat,

18
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:02.310
perhaps of all emotional disorders.

19
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.650
So when we think of schizophrenia and we turned to our three themes of emotion

20
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:08.700
and psychopathology,

21
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.900
the theme that's really gained prominence is not extremes or absences.

22
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.400
But as this notion at the bottom,
as you can see in yellow of disjunctions,

23
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.930
so this is this notion that we have this multi componential emotion response

24
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:26.100
system was subjective behavioral and physiological response components,

25
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.930
and that is schizophrenia.

26
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.980
What might be going on is that these channels are not aligning or they're not

27
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:33.360
matching up correctly,

28
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.230
so we're going to delve into precisely what way these emotion channels aren't

29
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:42.090
mapping up and what this tells us about the emotional nature inner life of

30
00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:46.170
individuals with this severe and costly psychiatric disorder,

31
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.900
schizophrenia.
If we delve into the DSM and we look at the diagnostic criteria,

32
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.200
what we see on the left is a broad category that really encapsulates wide

33
00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:02.670
sweeping disruptions in thought and behavior and in emotion.

34
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.030
And in particular when we look at these three categories,

35
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:10.230
we see things that are really broken down into three symptom clusters,

36
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.030
positive symptoms including delusions,
hallucinations and disorganized speech,

37
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.020
negative symptoms including flat affect,
a lack of pleasure,

38
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:22.380
lack of motivation and disorganize symptoms secure.

39
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:26.580
We get into the sort of really kind of dark or mysterious realm of thought

40
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:31.110
disorder and derailment.
Importantly,
schizophrenia is chronic or long term.

41
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:35.520
So it has to have a duration of at least six months minimum in order to warrant

42
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.140
a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

43
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.920
And like all emotional disorders we've talked about so far,

44
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.800
it causes severe and chronic impairment.

45
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.700
So I want to walk through some of these categories of symptoms that were just

46
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:50.640
alluded to in the Dsm to flesh them out a bit more.

47
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.790
So first is the category of disorganized symptoms.

48
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:57.630
So this is disorganization or incoherence of cognition and behavior.

49
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.160
So this is thought of on the one hand,

50
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:04.360
in terms of disorganized speech or what's been called formal thought disorder.

51
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.390
So this can be manifested in terms of incoherence.

52
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:11.170
So inability to try to organize ideas,
um,

53
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.670
loose associations.

54
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:16.480
So kind of grabbing it ideas and bringing them together in a way that may not

55
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:21.460
make logical sense to the rest of the world as well as a very kind of fragmented

56
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:24.850
or nonlinear progression of thinking.
Importantly,

57
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:26.650
you also see disorganized behavior.

58
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:31.651
So you see odd or unusual kinds of peculiar behaviors that don't necessarily map

59
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:36.040
onto the kinds of behaviors you see amongst the rest of the general population.

60
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.580
Second are what are called positive symptoms.

61
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:44.480
So John Nash in a beautiful mind really exemplified some of these symptoms.
Um,

62
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.860
so the positive though importantly is a misnomer.

63
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.840
So by positive what these mean or an excess or distortion of normal functioning.

64
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.630
And there's different types of positive symptoms.

65
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:59.200
There's three that you can see here.
One are delusions,

66
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.460
so these are erroneous beliefs so you can have beliefs of persecutory.

67
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:06.270
So believing that people are out to get you.
Um,

68
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.480
these are very common in schizophrenia.
Referential thoughts,
grandiosity,

69
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.740
unusual religious thinking as well as sematic things.

70
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:18.310
So people may think for referentiality that things that are arranged in a room

71
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:22.150
or coming from the TV or newspaper are especially targeted towards them

72
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:22.984
personally.

73
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.590
They may also have ideas of grandiosity where they think they have special

74
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:31.340
powers to do things that no one else can do or have special religious,
um,

75
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.950
you know,
insights,
our relationships with God that no one else has.
Um,

76
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:38.410
second positive symptom are hallucinations.

77
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:42.580
So these are perceiving things visually,
auditorily,

78
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:44.200
olfactory,
gustatory,

79
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.410
any of your major senses you're picking up on something that isn't necessarily

80
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:52.640
there or that other people do not perceive to be there.
Um,

81
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.620
so you're perceiving them in the absence of external sensory stimulation or

82
00:04:56.621 --> 00:05:00.340
input.
And then finally is disorganized speech and behavior.

83
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:02.890
So here we get into thought,
thought disorder.

84
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.180
So not being able to coherently organize your thoughts or your behaviors,

85
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:11.160
they're kind of in a very confusing,
perhaps a jumbled mishmash.

86
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.990
Um,
and then the third category is negative symptoms.

87
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:18.700
And again,
negatives,
really a misnomer.

88
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:23.701
So what we're talking about here is a deficit or lack of or dimunition of normal

89
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:28.240
functioning.
So types of negative symptoms can include poverty of speech,

90
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.460
a lack of motivation or goal directed activity,
a lack of pleasure,
Anhedonia.

91
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.650
And importantly,
what I've started at the bottom,

92
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:38.500
because it's most relevant to emotion research,

93
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.010
is what's called flat affect or a sort of lack of outward expressions.

94
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.180
You can see the picture of this young woman who showing what we would think of

95
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:49.990
as flat AFX.
So showing minimal emotion,
expressive in her face.

96
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.180
Now what I want to do is just show you a very brief three minute video and think

97
00:05:55.181 --> 00:05:57.560
about which symptoms that you might see this video.

98
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:01.910
Are you seeing positive symptoms,
negative symptoms,
or disorganized symptoms?

99
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.990
So take a look here,

100
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:06.170
take some notes and think about what you're seeing and also think about the

101
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:10.370
nature of emotional symptoms that might be emerging in this particular video.

102
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.340
<v 1>Fantastic,
expensive equipment.</v>

103
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.150
They said to me,
hey,

104
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.420
we can,
uh,
we can check your

105
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.520
security from that injury or on its own

106
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.593
kind of thing.

107
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.853
And

108
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.490
they put the needle in the last one.

109
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.800
They put it like this.
So when they did it,

110
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.590
I had a thought.
And when they pulled him out,
they pull them up.
Burn.

111
00:07:28.591 --> 00:07:31.800
But they left a little teeny little Barb and all,

112
00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:35.940
every one of the places they put me and they recorded it.

113
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.730
And one person who wanted it,
didn't someone else sold it to someone else.

114
00:07:41.731 --> 00:07:46.300
I don't know who,
but they're able to give a response back because of the,

115
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.270
the how thick the dental is in my teeth.
I take the Dowel is,

116
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.670
and,
uh,
the needles,
they're easy to focus,

117
00:07:56.671 --> 00:08:01.671
a heavier field of pickup reception because of all the feelings I got.

118
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:04.980
And so I am,

119
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:17.250
I think it's people like at Stanford
and,
uh,

120
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.500
technicians,
a wealthy technicians,

121
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:24.721
technicians,

122
00:08:24.721 --> 00:08:29.721
and people that do stuff like Nasa Ames institute.

123
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.430
I came right up to them and tried to sell them that last little,

124
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.020
but for the amount of money they didn't have,
I have just gave it to him.

125
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:55.310
I like watching a doctor,
you Mr. Rogers,

126
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.940
and they like my family.

127
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.110
And I know it was a problem with my dad would just say she didn't just go leave

128
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:08.940
him alone because this way the situation was,
he never had too many arrests.

129
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:13.410
So I'm the one that's gotta go a little,
I had a rough ups.
Yeah.

130
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.250
Yeah.
Hey,
what'd you do that for?
Why did he go like this?

131
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:23.080
First I wanted to make it green.

132
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.850
Right?
Oh,
oh.

133
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.490
And then they can all agree the spot there,
you know?
Ah,
full.
You know.
But uh,

134
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.790
uh,
that's just so adorable.
We were okay.

135
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.883
Okay.

136
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.980
<v 0>So early observations of flat aspect discussing schizophrenia.</v>

137
00:09:50.981 --> 00:09:55.690
We're really pioneered by boiler who said that even in the less severe forms of

138
00:09:55.691 --> 00:09:56.524
the illness,

139
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.360
there seem to be an observable indifference that seemed to be the external sign

140
00:10:01.361 --> 00:10:03.670
of their state and indifference to everything,

141
00:10:03.671 --> 00:10:08.671
to friends and relations to vocation and enjoyment to duties or rights or two

142
00:10:09.101 --> 00:10:09.940
good fortune.

143
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.610
So there was an early observation about the emotional life of individuals,

144
00:10:13.611 --> 00:10:17.620
the schizophrenia that assumed that patients with schizophrenia must have

145
00:10:17.621 --> 00:10:21.640
diminished internal experience because they weren't showing anything on their

146
00:10:21.641 --> 00:10:22.061
face.

147
00:10:22.061 --> 00:10:26.500
It must mean that they had a really diminished internal emotional life as well.

148
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:31.630
Now,
this had been the assumption for most of the 19 hundreds until a pioneering

149
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:35.320
researcher came in and creating from the University of California at Berkeley

150
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.720
who really thought of emotions,
schizophrenia.

151
00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:42.310
She called it as an old mystery and pioneered a very new understanding of the

152
00:10:42.311 --> 00:10:44.320
emotional life of people with schizophrenia.

153
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.180
So she talked about this notion of flat affect and schizophrenia.

154
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.900
So in other words,
that in their emotional behavior,
indeed,

155
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.370
when she took the tools of emotion science,

156
00:10:54.371 --> 00:10:57.760
brought patients with schizophrenia into lab.
Indeed she shot,

157
00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.480
she saw that they show fewer facial expressions of emotions to films and

158
00:11:01.481 --> 00:11:03.400
pictures compared to controls.
But,

159
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.160
and this is the really critical part of her discoveries.

160
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:11.580
They reported similar or even more intense internal emotion experience.

161
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.770
So even though they weren't showing anything on their face,

162
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.970
they actually reporting a very vivid and rich internal emotional life.

163
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.720
So this what and cream pioneered is this really fascinating disjunction between

164
00:11:25.871 --> 00:11:28.180
emotion experience.
On the lefthand side,

165
00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:33.100
we're individuals with schizophrenia do report comparable internal emotion,
uh,

166
00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.210
two controls

167
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.120
from their outward emotional behavior where they seem to be expressing very

168
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:41.940
little or very subtle signs of emotionality.

169
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:47.300
And she called this a disjunction right between these two response components.

170
00:11:47.491 --> 00:11:51.810
She really completely fired up the field to suggest that we've been making

171
00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:55.810
mistakes all along and assuming they don't experience emotion in the same way as

172
00:11:55.811 --> 00:11:58.000
the rest of us,
she said,
indeed they do.

173
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.220
They're just not showing it in their face.

174
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.630
Another important component of schizophrenia to know and think about as the home

175
00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:07.960
context that these individuals are often associated with.

176
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.130
And this is this notion by Jill Hooli at Harvard University of expressed emotion

177
00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:12.964
or II.

178
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:17.680
So she would ask the question of why do patients with schizophrenia seem to be

179
00:12:17.681 --> 00:12:22.240
more likely to return to the hospital after discharge if they're living with

180
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:26.050
their families than not?
So why wouldn't they be more supported and comforted?

181
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.780
And what she found is that looking at expressed emotion and family discussions,

182
00:12:30.781 --> 00:12:34.720
which she found is that there's often hostility expressed in these family

183
00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:38.450
interactions towards a patient of Chris at criticism of the patient and over

184
00:12:38.451 --> 00:12:40.990
protective overinvolved attitudes.

185
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.460
This is really the question of which comes first is it that the symptoms of

186
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:49.300
schizophrenia create unusual thoughts and the patient that that generate

187
00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:53.680
increased critical comments from the family or do increase critical comments

188
00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:58.030
from the family really trigger the onset of unusual patient thoughts.

189
00:12:58.031 --> 00:13:00.640
And this is of tricky by directional relationship,

190
00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:04.600
but it just suggests that part of the symptoms we see in schizophrenia,
you know,

191
00:13:04.601 --> 00:13:07.090
may be emerging from the home life.

192
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:11.290
And so is home really home sweet home in individuals with schizophrenia.

193
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:15.130
And with this research has found is that individuals and families who are high

194
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.570
expressed emotion as opposed to those who are low and express emotion actually

195
00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:21.880
have uh,
and fare worse outcomes.

196
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.080
So this is percent relapse here on the access for up to 60%,

197
00:13:26.081 --> 00:13:29.890
and you're seeing a higher rate of relapse and individuals who are in a high

198
00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:34.270
expressed emotion environment who are in yellow spending a high amount of time

199
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:38.290
or high contact with their family.
Um,
so if you're in that kind of environment,

200
00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:42.160
it's especially pernicious and predicts relapse much greater if you're spending

201
00:13:42.161 --> 00:13:43.630
more time with the partners.

202
00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.640
So on high he families contact may actually be bad for individuals,

203
00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:51.890
whereas in low e families contact and be so supportive,

204
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.560
buffer or good for patients.

205
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.950
So now we're going to quickly turn to borderline personality disorder.

206
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.240
So borderline personality started as part of a broader category of what we call

207
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:06.220
access to personality disorders.
This includes also mental retardation,

208
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.560
but when we zoom in on personality disorders,

209
00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.070
really what's important to know about them as they have a longstanding duration.

210
00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.020
These are things that emerge early in life.

211
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.920
They're pervasive and thought of as being relatively inflexible patterns of

212
00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:19.480
behavior and inner experience.

213
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.950
They deviate markedly from cultural expectations or norms.

214
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.870
And this pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment across

215
00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:30.610
multiple domains of functioning.

216
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:35.070
And this should be manifested in at least two of the following cognitive effect

217
00:14:35.071 --> 00:14:39.640
of interpersonal functioning or impulse control and is not due to another mental

218
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:44.110
disorder.
So there are lots of overlap between different personalities orders,

219
00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:47.560
but I just want to show you the three broad clusters that have been discussed

220
00:14:47.561 --> 00:14:49.240
with respect to personality disorders.

221
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.460
There's cluster a odd or eccentric cluster,

222
00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:56.360
be dramatic or erratic in cluster c,
anxious or fearful.

223
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.120
And although this is not a class in abnormal psychology,

224
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.990
what I'd like to do is just orient this to you to highlight in on what we're

225
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:06.590
going to talk about today,
which is borderline personality disorder here.

226
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.950
So we're going to talk about borderline personality disorder because it's a

227
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:14.870
really prominent and important persona sorta that really exemplifies core

228
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:17.930
difficulties in emotion,
reactivity and regulation.

229
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:22.370
So if we look at the DSM criteria for borderline personality disorder,

230
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.990
what we see here is this idea of um,
really,
you know,

231
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:31.100
impulsive,
unstable,
stormy relationships,
unstable sense of self.

232
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:35.690
And as you can see here,
emotion regulation,
problems and of core,

233
00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:39.440
part of what might be triggering this people think is a very difficult home

234
00:15:39.441 --> 00:15:40.081
environment.

235
00:15:40.081 --> 00:15:44.660
So having an early environment where behavioral patterns are fueled by parental

236
00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:46.760
punishing,
ignoring a child's needs,

237
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.090
but on the one hand attending to behavioral outbursts.

238
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.600
So when we think about these things have emotion regulation difficulties,

239
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:58.750
how do they exactly look in borderline personality disorder when we apply the

240
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:01.010
sort of lens of emotion science.

241
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.860
So what research has shown is that in borderline percentage,

242
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.800
sort of what we're seeing is heightened emotion or activity,

243
00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:11.300
particularly for negative emotions as well as difficulty regulating emotions,

244
00:16:11.301 --> 00:16:15.350
having a really unstable,
positive and negative emotional repertoire.

245
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.590
So I'll give you some key pieces of example before we wrap up today.

246
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:23.040
So in one study that was recently published,
um,

247
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:27.260
they talked about borderline personality disorder as really thinking about it as

248
00:16:27.261 --> 00:16:30.260
volatility from negative to positive and back again.

249
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:34.070
So what they did is they followed individuals with bipolar disorder over the

250
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:37.370
course of a 21 day experience sampling diary.

251
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:41.450
And they had people self report using something like a palm pilot.

252
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:45.650
Their daily experience of both positive and negative emotion and using really

253
00:16:45.651 --> 00:16:48.170
sophisticated multilevel modeling techniques.

254
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:52.310
What they found that was most diagnostic of borderline personality disorder was

255
00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:56.360
a rapid oscillation over the course of the week between positive and negative

256
00:16:56.361 --> 00:16:57.740
emotion.
So they said,

257
00:16:57.741 --> 00:17:01.430
what really seems to be a core feature of borderline percentage order is the

258
00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:03.050
unstable almost,
you know,

259
00:17:03.051 --> 00:17:07.680
vicissitudes of the emotions going up and down and back again.
Um,

260
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.230
there's also been neuroimaging studies that look at Amygdala activity and

261
00:17:11.231 --> 00:17:12.860
borderline personality disorder.
Again,

262
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.970
we talked about this as a brain region associated with both emotional salients

263
00:17:16.971 --> 00:17:20.750
and potentially as a fear center and what we're seeing in borderline personality

264
00:17:20.751 --> 00:17:23.570
disorders,
what seems to be a Migdal a hyper activity.

265
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:26.480
So we see increased activity for example,

266
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:31.340
in response to an effect of pictures and fearful faces get also having a reduced

267
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:34.730
volume of the Amygdala as well.
Importantly,

268
00:17:34.731 --> 00:17:38.930
we also see reduced volume in prefrontal cognitive control regions like the

269
00:17:38.931 --> 00:17:41.720
media and orbital prefrontal cortex.
And the,

270
00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:46.370
we see failure of active engagement and response to negative or trauma related

271
00:17:46.371 --> 00:17:51.090
scripts.
Um,
we also see things like reduced,
um,
you know,

272
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:52.830
uh,
functioning or you know,

273
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.770
adaptive functioning in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
Again,

274
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.170
another prefrontal cognitive control regions.

275
00:17:58.171 --> 00:18:01.740
So we see increased activity in response to pain stimuli,

276
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:05.430
but a failure of adaptive activation response to trauma scripts.

277
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.930
So what we're seeing is both at the self reported behavioral and neurological

278
00:18:09.931 --> 00:18:10.980
level,
you know,

279
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:15.420
difficulties with reactivity and difficulty regulating emotions that seem to be

280
00:18:15.421 --> 00:18:19.290
unstable and wavering between positive and negative emotion extremes.

281
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.280
Borderline personality disorder has been depicted widely in the media.
Um,

282
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.630
but in one particular movie,
um,
you know,
the,
uh,

283
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.880
with the Angelina Jolie and Bruno and a writer girl interrupted,

284
00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:33.930
we see a lot of discussion and portrayals of what borderline personal disorder

285
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.400
looks like.
Um,
the treatment of borderline personality disorder.

286
00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:41.850
It really has been pioneered by Marsha Linehan at the University of Washington

287
00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:45.450
who developed what's called dialectical behavior therapy or DBT,

288
00:18:45.451 --> 00:18:49.530
where the goal here is to reach what she calls a state of wise mind or a balance

289
00:18:49.531 --> 00:18:51.810
between both rational and emotional states.

290
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.310
And she has four main modules of dialectical behavior therapy that include

291
00:18:56.311 --> 00:19:00.180
mindfulness.
So observing emotions without judging them.
Second,

292
00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:04.950
interpersonal effectiveness.
So being assertive,
saying,
knowing how to say no,

293
00:19:04.951 --> 00:19:08.340
make a request,
coping with life stressors effectively.

294
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.460
Third distress tolerance.
And fourth,

295
00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:13.410
and most importantly to what we've been talking about today,

296
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.290
teaching individuals with borderline personality disorder,

297
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.490
how to effectively regulate emotions by both labeling them,

298
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:25.200
managing them,
and trying to increase experiences of healthy,
positive emotions.

299
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:30.030
So I want to just conclude since this is our last lecture on emotional
disorders,

300
00:19:30.031 --> 00:19:33.660
that by reminding ourselves that even though we've characterized many ways that

301
00:19:33.661 --> 00:19:34.980
emotions can be experienced,

302
00:19:34.981 --> 00:19:39.981
two extreme or relative deficits or even disjunction among emotion response

303
00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:40.944
components,

304
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.160
that this is simply characterizing differences in the ways emotions are

305
00:19:44.161 --> 00:19:48.780
manifested in ways they cause difficulties for people from anxiety disorders to

306
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.440
mood disorders,
schizophrenia to even personality disorders.

307
00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:56.820
But this doesn't imply that there's any judgment as to what is the best or most

308
00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:59.700
ideal emotion state.
And as Hans Asperger said,

309
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.800
not everything that steps out of line and thus abnormal must necessarily be

310
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:09.360
inferior.
So with that,
I want to conclude with our takeaway questions.

311
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.830
So the first question from today is as follows,

312
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.370
how does schizophrenia represent an example of emotion,

313
00:20:17.371 --> 00:20:22.371
disjunction and what channels and specifically or in particularly is the emotion

314
00:20:22.411 --> 00:20:26.310
disjunction between second,
in what way is emotion,

315
00:20:26.311 --> 00:20:30.660
reactivity and regulation impaired and borderline personality disorder.

316
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:31.891
And finally,

317
00:20:31.891 --> 00:20:36.630
what are the four core modules in DBT for treating borderline personality

318
00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:40.320
disorder,
especially with respect to emotion related difficulties.

319
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:41.911
Finally,

320
00:20:41.911 --> 00:20:45.270
now we're going to conclude with our expert interview as part of the experts in

321
00:20:45.271 --> 00:20:50.000
emotion interview series.
Um,

346
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:16.260
So I now turn to our special experts in emotion interview with doctor and crane

347
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.460
on schizophrenia and emotion

348

for experts and emotion interview.

349
00:22:23.271 --> 00:22:27.050
We'll be speaking with Dr. David Watson on personality and emotion.

350

360
00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:01.850

361
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:06.500
