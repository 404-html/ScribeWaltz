1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.050
Welcome back to human emotion.
Um,

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.930
today we're going to continue the second part of our discussion as to whether

3
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:11.931
emotions are evolutionarily evolved and we're going to do so today by focusing

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.200
even deeper on this issue of evolution and emotion.

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.220
So we're going to look at this question of our emotions,

6
00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:22.820
really part of our early evolutionarily,
uh,

7
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.330
history and origins by doing the following today.
As you can see on the roadmap,

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.760
we'll talk about the evolution of emotion,

9
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.160
the principle of cultural universality,

10
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.140
a functional approach to different kinds of emotions wrapped up by our takeaway

11
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:39.150
questions and expert interview today.

12
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.600
So let's start with evolution and emotion.

13
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.620
So here you can see here is the reminder from our last lecture,

14
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.880
there were five big take home ideas to grasp behind evolutionary theory.

15
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.070
This included gene replication,
selection pressures,
natural selection pressures,

16
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.460
sexual selection pressures,
and group selection pressures.

17
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.380
<v 1>Okay,</v>

18
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.360
<v 0>so when we think about the sort of evolutionary approach to motion Paul Ekman,</v>

19
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:09.900
who's one of the sort of a founders behind this thinking,
uh,

20
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:14.040
he thought about the question for us of what is an emotion from this
perspective?

21
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.960
And from an evolutionary perspective,

22
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:19.260
he posited six features of what an emotion is.

23
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.800
So first he would say emotions are brief.

24
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.170
They happen in four to five seconds.
Quick.
Second,

25
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.400
emotions are unbidden.
He would say they are involuntary.

26
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.200
Emotions are not in our control.

27
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.050
That they're simply something that happens to you.

28
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.480
Third emotions are what he called cross species phenomena.

29
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.750
So you see similar behaviors and experiences and other primate species.

30
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.720
Fourth,
emotions are coherent.
So we talked earlier about emotions,

31
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:57.080
having multiple components,
right?
Expressions,
uh,

32
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.590
experiences of emotion internally and physiological responses.

33
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.120
He would say these three components of emotion work together and come online

34
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:09.860
together.
They cohere.
Fifth emotions are fast.

35
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.850
So there's a quick onset to,
there are whole emotional system.

36
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.530
Sometimes emotions can sort of get online within even milliseconds.

37
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.090
So it doesn't take long.

38
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:23.720
Once you're sort of a brain registers at an emotion should occur.

39
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:26.780
It happens fast.
And finally,

40
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:30.560
the sixth feature of what is an emotion Pollock women would say is that it has

41
00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:34.490
an automatic appraisal or evaluation.
So that,
um,

42
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.600
in other words,

43
00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:39.860
the appraisal is your evaluation of the world and that this is something that

44
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:42.800
accompanies emotion and can happen very fast.

45
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.480
So these are the six features of what is an emotion from an evolutionary

46
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:50.300
perspective on as discussed by Paul Ekman.

47
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.070
Okay.

48
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.000
So now we've talked a little bit about what an emotion is from an evolutionary

49
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.850
perspective.
Now I want to turn to this notion of cultural universality.

50
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.510
So this is the idea that emotions are evolved and because they're evolved,

51
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.300
we should see them similarly present across different populations and cultures.

52
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.890
So here's a first example.
Um,

53
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.790
that's evidence of this idea that emotions are cultural universal.

54
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.770
So what we see it really interesting early work done,
um,

55
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.050
suggest here that emotion expressions are evident even among the [inaudible]

56
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.480
congenitally blind.
So children who are born blind,
independent of culture,

57
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:35.170
as you can see here,
show expressions even at an early age.

58
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:40.090
So here we see a young child smiling.
Um,
there's also evidence by Matsumoto.

59
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.380
I'm showing that Olympians who are blind,
when they have won a gold medal,

60
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:46.570
they will also show expressions of happiness.

61
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.450
Or if they lost expressions of sadness or grief.

62
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.740
So this seems to be something that's hardwired in us to express emotions and

63
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:55.990
that their co a universal across cultures,

64
00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:59.500
they're not something we necessarily have to learn through seeing other people

65
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:04.240
express emotions.
A second example,
um,

66
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:08.170
that was really pushed forth by Paul Ekman,
uh,
in his New Guinea study,

67
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:12.240
which we'll talk about in a minute,
is this idea of co emotion,

68
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.140
emotions being cultural universal in so far as we see emotion expressions

69
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:21.580
consistent across westernized and non Westernized cultures.

70
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.420
So here he went to study,
um,
the tribal people of New Guinea,
um,

71
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.480
to look at whether or not indeed they experienced,
um,

72
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.090
emotions in the same way as non western individuals.

73
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:39.091
So here what [inaudible] did is he took it across cultural approach to

74
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:43.930
understanding emotion by studying the preindustrial foray Treisman of New
Guinea,

75
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.610
uh,
just north of Australia.

76
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.650
And here he observed that members of this isolated culture could reliably

77
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:55.270
identify expressions of emotion and photographs of people from cultures they

78
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:58.420
weren't even familiar with.
So on this evidence,

79
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.350
Paul Ekman concluded that expressions of emotion,
uh,

80
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.540
must be sort of basic,

81
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.190
this sort of evolutionary phenomena that's hardwired in us from birth and that

82
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:11.680
they should be similarly seen across cultures.

83
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.790
So let's look at some of the data that he did in his famous New Guinea study.

84
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.430
So the goal of his research was to examine if basic emotion expressions are

85
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:26.170
culturally universal.
And his method,
as we just spoke about,

86
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:29.650
was to travel to the non Westernized tribe in New Guinea.

87
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.860
And there were two parts to his study.

88
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.630
So part one that you see here is that he showed a series of six basic emotion

89
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:42.631
expressions and asked the new Guinea tribes people to choose which emotion in

90
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:46.540
these pictures best matched an emotion word.

91
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.430
So to pick out which kind of emotion word fit the picture and it looks something

92
00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:52.264
like this.

93
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.770
So they would see a picture of someone expressing an emotion and they'd be given

94
00:05:57.771 --> 00:06:01.100
a list of emotions from a,
of the six basic emotions.

95
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.910
And they would be asked to select which emotion best match the picture.

96
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.900
So you can see here the correct answer would be selecting happiness to match

97
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.310
that expression right there.

98
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.930
Or perhaps they saw an expression more like this and they were asked to again

99
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:17.590
indicate from these six basic emotion words,
uh,

100
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.640
translated to their own native language,

101
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.850
which best match the picture like discussed.

102
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.080
Um,
like I said,
there were two parts of this study.
So on the second part,
um,

103
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.270
individuals are asked to listen to vignettes or stories of individuals

104
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.620
experiencing different kinds of emotional life events.
And from these vignettes,

105
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:43.340
they were asked to pick the emotion photo that best match the story.

106
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.910
So for example,
they'd be told the story,

107
00:06:47.911 --> 00:06:51.160
a story about someone who experienced the time,
um,

108
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.680
where they saw a snake and they were feeling very scared or fearful and from

109
00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:59.790
these six pictures to pick which photograph best matched that person's

110
00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:02.880
experience.
So you would pick the bottom photo in the middle.

111
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.800
So this was to try to get away from just using words to match photos,

112
00:07:07.801 --> 00:07:12.060
but instead to try to use the expressions themselves to match the stories.

113
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.010
Um,
if you're interested in learning more about Paul Ackman's research,

114
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.820
both this early New Guinea study that was one of the pioneering studies for the

115
00:07:20.821 --> 00:07:23.450
ice idea of cultural universality.
Um,

116
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:28.530
then you can refer here to his book called emotions revealed.
Okay.

117
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:32.370
So we've talked a little bit about cultural universality or how many of our

118
00:07:32.371 --> 00:07:34.280
emotions are sort of hardwired.

119
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.020
And thus we see them present across all kinds of cultures,

120
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.960
both westernized and even non industrialized,

121
00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:41.820
non Western countries like New Guinea.

122
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.260
So now we're going to turn to this idea of a functional approach to emotions.

123
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.910
And what I mean by this is that emotions are thought of as being functional,

124
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.990
so functional in the sense that they help us to achieve our goals and it's

125
00:07:54.991 --> 00:07:58.740
important that such motions be functional in order to help us,
uh,

126
00:07:58.741 --> 00:08:01.770
sort of meet our survival goals or needs.

127
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.370
So let's turn now to this functional approach on emotions.

128
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.500
So here we're going to go through the six basic emotions and walk through the

129
00:08:10.501 --> 00:08:14.820
features of what way they are functional.
So we'll talk about fear

130
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.000
followed by sadness,
then discussed anger,

131
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:25.440
happiness.
And last but not least,
surprise.

132
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.720
So let's start with fear and do a functional analysis of fear from an

133
00:08:30.721 --> 00:08:32.100
evolutionary perspective.

134
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.750
So here we see fear and what we think of from fear of,

135
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.950
so this is our functional analysis of fear,

136
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:45.080
is there's gotta be some kind of recurring evolutionary situation that elicits

137
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:46.130
or triggers sphere.

138
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.080
So this would be hearing cues associated with a Predator or some sort of threat

139
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:52.130
to one's survival,

140
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.100
the appraisal or thoughts behind fear or that this is unsafe,

141
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.470
this is dangerous or please don't attack.
Um,

142
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.790
and the behavior would be this kind of flight or fight reaction,

143
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.960
focus more on the flight of getting away from that situation as quickly as

144
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:07.794
possible.

145
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.820
Our physiological response would include increased blood flow to the periphery

146
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.020
as well as increased oxygen volume.
And what's the function of this?
Again,

147
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:17.400
we said emotions are functional.

148
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:21.000
They're supposed to be there to perform some sort of goal for us or aid in our

149
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:23.400
survival.
Well here,
the function of,
um,

150
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.750
of an emotion like fear would be to help you escape the Predator,
um,

151
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.100
to sort of ensure your safety or if need be defend for yourself.

152
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.640
And you can see this as all sort of supported by,
you know,

153
00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:37.530
evaluating the situation is unsafe.

154
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:42.450
Having this sort of physiological mobile it mobilization to sort of get away as

155
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:45.510
quickly as possible.
So let's fear,

156
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.670
let's now turn to sadness and do a same or similar functional approach.

157
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.770
So if we look at sadness using the same sort of schematic we just did with fear,

158
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:02.080
the recurrent evolutionary situation would be losing something of value.

159
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.520
So it could be a person,
it could be an object or it could be a place.

160
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.270
The appraisal behind sadness would be,
I miss,

161
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.810
I miss that thing or I need comfort behavior.

162
00:10:13.811 --> 00:10:18.811
Often associated with sadness is motor slowing and retardation or just a general

163
00:10:18.851 --> 00:10:23.680
withdraw,
kind of stepping away from things that you would normally engage in.
Um,

164
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.760
we see changes in our physiological can,
uh,
sort of repertoire.

165
00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:32.260
We see increased heart rate and breathing and often we see increased activity of

166
00:10:32.261 --> 00:10:37.180
the lack of remote glands associated with crying or having tears and people

167
00:10:37.181 --> 00:10:39.760
often wonder,
why do we feel sad?
What,
what is the function?

168
00:10:39.761 --> 00:10:42.220
Why do we have it in the first place?
Um,

169
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.010
and it's really interesting because sadness is important for us.

170
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.410
It's critical to our survival goals.

171
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:52.710
So it helps us feel motivated to avoid future losses and change circumstances

172
00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:56.680
around us to make sure that that's the case.
And importantly,
sadness,

173
00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:01.360
elicit social support from others.
So when you need comforting or you need help,

174
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:06.610
um,
expressions and experiences of sadness pull for other people to get close to

175
00:11:06.611 --> 00:11:10.870
you.
What about disgust?

176
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.640
So discusses an emotion most of us don't enjoy experiencing,

177
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.860
but we have it there for a reason.

178
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.280
So the recurrent evolutionary situation behind discussed is encountering some

179
00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:27.640
potential poison or contaminant and there's these universal listers,

180
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.470
cross culture that seemed to elicit disgust.
And most of us such as feces,

181
00:11:32.471 --> 00:11:35.950
urine,
blood vomit,
flesh,
all those good things there.

182
00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.160
Most of us feel disgust when we see them.
Um,

183
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:43.330
the appraisal behind discussed is that this is unhealthy or this is unsafe for

184
00:11:43.331 --> 00:11:44.164
me.

185
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.910
And behaviors include trying to repel or kind of distance oneself from the

186
00:11:48.911 --> 00:11:52.630
disgusting stimuli and it has a very characteristic facial expression.

187
00:11:52.631 --> 00:11:55.000
You can see in this young man,
um,

188
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:59.260
what we see physiologically as this Vegas nerve stimulation that's involved in

189
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:00.190
digestion.

190
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.690
And the function again is to repel a substance away from the body.

191
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.220
So I talk about universal,
universal,
illicit or is of disgust.

192
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.570
And here's an example of one that's used in a lot of studies.
Um,

193
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.020
hopefully most of you feel some discussing this photo.
If you don't,

194
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.540
then you are an interesting evolutionary case.

195
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.880
It seems that we have this instinctive kind of discussed instinct and David

196
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.210
Pizarro,
uh,

197
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.990
from Cornell University has done a lot of work on discuss using stimulii like

198
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:33.460
this and we'll be speaking with us about his work later in the course.

199
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:38.320
So I promise I won't show you that picture again of the teeth and we'll turn now

200
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:41.800
to anger.
So we've all felt anger at different times.

201
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:46.180
And why do we have anger in the first place?
What goal does it serve for us?

202
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:51.450
So the recurrent evolutionary situation with anger is really you're,
you're uh,

203
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.310
trying to,
uh,

204
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:58.390
sort of pursue a goal and it's forwarded or its stymied or someone's doing

205
00:12:58.391 --> 00:13:01.930
something that's getting in your way and that you don't approve of.
So you,

206
00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:04.540
the thoughts that would go through your head or appraisals would be,

207
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:09.010
you are in the way of what I want.
I'm going to attack you.

208
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.070
You're doing something wrong.
And here again,

209
00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:14.230
we have this fight or fight reaction here,

210
00:13:14.231 --> 00:13:18.010
focused more on the fight part of it and what you see physiologically as

211
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:20.440
increased blood flow and increase the oxygen volume,

212
00:13:20.441 --> 00:13:23.920
sort of mobilizing your body to attack.

213
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.850
And the function of anger.
It's important for us to have anger as well.

214
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:33.090
It helps us confront and eliminate a person or thing in the way of our goal or

215
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.750
someone or something that may be committing some sort of moral wrongdoing.

216
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:45.000
And what about happiness?
It's something that's really interesting to all of us.

217
00:13:45.001 --> 00:13:50.001
We see modern society almost obsessed with pursuing happiness and experiencing

218
00:13:50.161 --> 00:13:54.060
even more happiness.
So why do we care so much about happiness?

219
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.930
Why might it be actually very critical for our survival.

220
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.860
So here we see happiness.

221
00:14:01.861 --> 00:14:05.890
So the recurrent evolutionary situation is a situation in which there's

222
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:10.710
potential rewards and opportunities that are available to us.
Could be a food,

223
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.760
could be a potential mating partner or,
or some other resource.

224
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.210
And the thoughts are appraisals that go on in our minds are things like,

225
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.460
I like that or I want that.

226
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:24.550
And also it's a really pro social kind of emotion.
So,
um,

227
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.490
we're thinking things like I'm friendly,

228
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.530
I want to connect with that person around me.

229
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.040
So we had behaviors that include incentives seeking.

230
00:14:32.041 --> 00:14:36.240
So trying to seek out and get rewards in the environment or to show other people

231
00:14:36.241 --> 00:14:38.460
that you have in more affiliative orientation,

232
00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:41.400
you want to be part of their group,
you want to connect with them.

233
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.300
And we see different kinds of physiological things go on in our body when we

234
00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:46.134
feel happy.

235
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.670
On the one hand we might see increased sort of cardiovascular or physiological

236
00:14:50.671 --> 00:14:51.710
arousal,
um,

237
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.120
that will help us get the energy to go obtain that award or goal.

238
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.270
Um,
and we might also see increased vagal tone,

239
00:14:59.271 --> 00:15:03.590
which we'll talk more about later in the course as a sort of physiological sort

240
00:15:03.591 --> 00:15:04.370
of,
um,

241
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:09.260
substrate or correlate of these kind of feelings that connect us to other

242
00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:11.330
people.
I want to keep us close to them.

243
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:17.470
The function of happiness is to help motivate energy to acquire and attain

244
00:15:17.721 --> 00:15:22.220
potential rewards or to establish relationships with other people,

245
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:27.490
either friendships or romantic relationships as well as relationships with close

246
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:28.520
family members.

247
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:35.450
Last but not least is this funny emotion of surprise and it's something that we

248
00:15:35.451 --> 00:15:38.690
see has been built in us for many,
many,

249
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.790
many years in our evolutionary history.

250
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:45.130
So the recurrent situation here is something unexpected happens.
Um,

251
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.280
and you think things like,
well,
what is that?
Or look over there.
Um,

252
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.590
behaviors include energy mobilization,

253
00:15:51.591 --> 00:15:55.250
increased attentional focus to kind of see what is happening in environment and

254
00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:59.000
what exactly has just changed.
Um,
you see increased blood flow,

255
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:02.240
increased oxygen volume,
sort of your body sort of getting mobilized.

256
00:16:02.241 --> 00:16:05.690
It's alerted to things going on around it and it's trying to gauge what is it

257
00:16:05.691 --> 00:16:07.250
and how should one respond.

258
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:11.660
So the function of it is to help you evaluate when there's unexpected changes in

259
00:16:11.661 --> 00:16:16.661
your environment and to readily and quickly re adapt to these new circumstances.

260
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.230
So we've gone through the six basic emotions,
but I want to leave one here,

261
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.590
which wasn't on the original list,
which is this emotion of jealousy.

262
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.770
I'm sort of as a teaser for something we're going to talk about later in the

263
00:16:27.771 --> 00:16:30.920
course.
Then we get to the ideas of sex and love.
Um,

264
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.280
and here it's interesting because if you want to learn about jealousy,

265
00:16:34.281 --> 00:16:39.140
it's really important and actually incredibly necessary to our sexual survival.

266
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.710
So David Bus wrote a book called the Dangerous Passion,

267
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.190
why jealousy is as necessary as love and sex.

268
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.480
So we'll talk later in the course about just why it's important to actually feel

269
00:16:50.481 --> 00:16:51.314
jealous,

270
00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.920
how many of our romantic relationships might be threatened if we didn't feel

271
00:16:54.921 --> 00:16:56.600
jealousy in the first place.

272
00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:01.580
Now finally we're going to turn to our takeaway questions from today.

273
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.030
And these include three questions as as normal.

274
00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.740
So the three takeaway questions for today,
our first,

275
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.710
what is Edmunds criteria for an emotion?

276
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.910
We talked about that at the beginning and there were six criteria.
What are they?

277
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:23.450
Second,
can you list some supportive evidence that we discussed today?
Uh,

278
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.060
for cultural universality of emotions.

279
00:17:27.061 --> 00:17:31.940
So this idea that emotions are present across all peoples of all cultures from

280
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:36.440
early on in our evolutionary history.
And third,

281
00:17:36.441 --> 00:17:40.850
can you provide a functional analysis for the six basic emotions we discussed

282
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:43.070
today?
And if interested,

283
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.040
could you provide the same kind of analysis for jealousy,

284
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:48.980
which we just touched on as a teaser at the very,

285
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:57.720
and as usual,
we're going to conclude today with an expert interview.
And again,

286
00:17:57.721 --> 00:18:00.480
this is part of our experts in emotion interview series.

287
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.280
Today we have the pleasure of speaking with Paul Ekman,

288
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.960
who's going to share his perspective on the evolution of emotion and whether

289
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:12.180
emotions are culturally universal.

290
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.980
So Dr. Paul Ekman is a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of

291
00:18:16.981 --> 00:18:18.450
California San Francisco,

292
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.720
and has authored or edited 13 books most recently as we showed earlier in the

293
00:18:24.001 --> 00:18:25.930
course,
emotions revealed.
Um,

294
00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.850
and he's also the coauthor with the Dalai Lama on emotional awareness,

295
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.930
overcoming the obstacles to psychological balance and compassion.

296
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:38.310
Paul Ekman has consulted with federal and law,
local law enforcement,

297
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.850
national security,
corporate sales and negotiations,

298
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.900
health and education professionals and animators at some of the largest

299
00:18:45.901 --> 00:18:50.640
animations Siri studios in the world.
Some of you might know the show lie to me,

300
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:55.050
and he was one of the consultants there to sort of teach them how to detect a

301
00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:59.670
