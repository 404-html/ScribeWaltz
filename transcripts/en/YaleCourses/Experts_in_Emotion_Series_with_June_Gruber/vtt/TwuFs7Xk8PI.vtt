1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.110
Welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.280
Today we will conclude our section on emotion and health by probing into the

3
00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:10.510
role of psychotherapy in alleviating emotional suffering.
In other words,

4
00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:14.440
can we heal our emotions through the lens of therapy,
and if so,

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.550
what are the active ingredients of a successful emotion related intervention?

6
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.550
Looking at our roadmap today,

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.390
we'll see that we have the honor of having a very special guest lecture on this

8
00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:30.070
topic from Doctor Stefan Hoffman and eminent scholar in the field of emotion in

9
00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:31.000
psychotherapy.

10
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.690
This will be followed by takeaway questions and our expert interview

11
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.050
today for our guests lecture,
Dr Stefan Hoffman will be speaking with us.

12
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.820
He is a professor of psychology at the Department of Psychology at Boston

13
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.030
University where he directs the psychotherapy and emotion research laboratory.

14
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.660
His main research focus is on the mechanisms of treatment change,

15
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.500
translating discoveries from neuroscience into clinical applications,

16
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.670
emotion regulation strategies,
and cultural expressions of psychopathology,

17
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.770
including social anxiety disorder.

18
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.870
He has published more than 200 scientific articles and 15 books and is the

19
00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:11.200
president of the Association for Behavioral and cognitive therapies.

20
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.220

Beck Institute for Cognitive Studies at Assumption College.

27
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.360
So it is my honor now to hear a very special guest lecture from Doctor Stefan

28
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.503
Hoffman.

29
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.020
<v 1>Hi,
uh,
my name is Stefan Hoffman.</v>

30
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:48.990
I'm professor of psychology at Boston University.

31
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.890
I am going to talk about emotion in psychotherapy.

32
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.040
Emotions are essential,
uh,
in mental disorders,
uh,

33
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.150
and um,
in the treatment of mental disorders.

34
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.540
Uh,
in fact,

35
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.990
this goes to the very hard to some very fundamental fundamental questions as to

36
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.230
how the mind and the body are,
uh,
associated,

37
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.660
uh,
renewed the card.
Um,
uh,
early on,

38
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.510
um,
uh,
claim that the soul,

39
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.010
the mind and the body are two distinct entities.
The mind being entirely,

40
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.170
uh,
immaterial,
unique to humans and,
uh,

41
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.080
links to cognitions and consciousness.
Whereas the body,
uh,

42
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.000
is entirely material and comparable to a machine that,
uh,
animals,

43
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.800
uh,
health,
uh,

44
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.870
in the bodily changes caused emotions with which they are associated.

45
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:53.860
And this is an issue that,
uh,
we will be discussing also,
uh,
uh,

46
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.090
in,
uh,
in later theories or William James in particular,
uh,

47
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.550
had a similar idea as to how mind and the body relates.
However,
he,

48
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.733
um,

49
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.170
assumes monistic view in that mental actions may be uniform in absolutely,

50
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.410
uh,
to,
uh,

51
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.720
function of brain action varying escalator later various and being to the brain

52
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:19.330
action as to s effect to cost.

53
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:22.960
It's what he wrote in his principles of psychology of the very first

54
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.380
introduction into psychology textbook.
Uh,

55
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.740
he sees emotions as secondary to a specific physiological symptoms,

56
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:36.550
sensations.
So we feel sad,
uh,

57
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.720
because we cry,
we feel happy because we laughed.

58
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:43.150
This has become known as the James Lang theory.

59
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.450
Alternative to that theory was to a notion by say,

60
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.650
Schachter and singer in that,
um,
uh,
it is to cognitive appraisal,

61
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.880
the cognitive interpretation of these,
uh,
of symptoms that,
uh,

62
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.100
determine what emotional response we have.
And this is an issue that,
uh,

63
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.010
has become a prominent,
uh,

64
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.900
point in modern theories.
Sigmund Freud,
uh,

65
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.990
thought the saw emotions as a safety valve that lets off psychic steam and the

66
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:20.420
events that caused these emotions that are stirred up,
uh,

67
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.330
by some instinctual drive levy do all the tenitus,
uh,

68
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.260
there tends to be repressed.
Now,
Skinner,
uh,
didn't really,

69
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.560
uh,
put much emphasis on emotions.

70
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:34.870
He thought that all human behavior,

71
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.630
including La Language and also thoughts,

72
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:42.631
mental processes are shaped by and maintained by an arrangement of past and

73
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:43.534
present reinforcer.

74
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.540
So he thought his stimulus leads to response and it doesn't really matter how

75
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:50.920
this leads to a response.

76
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:55.921
Important thing that it does lead to a response in all actions in humans are,

77
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.480
uh,
a,
um,
a chain of such a stimulus,
response,
relationships,

78
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.630
emotions he's saw as private experiences and inaccessible to observation.

79
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:11.530
And therefore we shouldn't bother studying them in great detail.
Now,

80
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.400
along came norm Chomsky,
a sack of linguist,
uh,
who,

81
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.920
uh,
specifically criticized,
uh,
Skinner's,
uh,

82
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.000
verbal behavior,

83
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:27.001
a book that he published back in 1959 and he thought he thought that a

84
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:32.341
conditioning radical behaviorism cannot explain how language is acquired in

85
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:37.580
children.
And also universal grammar,
uh,
is a,
uh,

86
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.650
uh,
it's inconsistent with the notion that Skinner had.

87
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.890
Instead,
he thought language is a product of a universally in need.
Uh,

88
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.810
ability,
uh,
that is that all humans have a,

89
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.880
this marks the beginning of the cognitive revolution.

90
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:59.510
And from a left to right,
we have a number of proponents,

91
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.130
John Piaget,
uh,
on the very left,
uh,
uh,
Aaron T.

92
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.450
Beck and Albert Ellis and Arnold Lazarus,
uh,
and,
uh,
uh,

93
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:13.340
Albert Bandura and a more modern theorists,
David Clark.
Uh,
they,

94
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.310
uh,
all,
um,
uh,
evolve these thinkers,
um,
had their,

95
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.550
had their ideas evolved as a result of this cognitive revolution.

96
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.090
What is the cognitive theory of emotion and psychological disorders?

97
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.620
The cognitive model can be,
um,
quite simply explained,

98
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.700
uh,
by some ancient philosophers and also other,
uh,

99
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.950
philosophical thinkers and writers,
Epictetus road main,

100
00:06:43.951 --> 00:06:48.650
or not move by things,
but the view they take of them.
Um,
so in other words,

101
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.450
it is not the emotional response.

102
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.900
That emotional response is not caused directly by the stimulus,

103
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.980
but rather by the way you view,

104
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.990
you praise the stimulus.

105
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.110
So cognitive appraisal as an important mediator between the stimulus and the

106
00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:10.940
emotional response.
Similarly,
uh,

107
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.680
Marcus a really is a road.
If you are distressed by anything external,

108
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.900
the pain is not due to the thing itself,

109
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.520
but to your estimate of it and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.

110
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.150
To put it another way,
the distress and pain,

111
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:30.350
the emotional response is not caused by the stimulus itself,
by back,

112
00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:34.910
by the cognitive appraisal.
Uh,
Shakespeare road.

113
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.800
There's nothing either good or bad,
but thinking makes it so,
in other words,

114
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:45.230
the,
uh,
uh,
your judgment of whether or not something is good or bad.

115
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.980
It's not due to the stimulus itself,
but due to the thinking,

116
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.690
the cognitive appraisal,
a more modern,
uh,

117
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.520
and more complex,
uh,
idea,
uh,

118
00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:01.540
or translating this very basic idea until modern thinking.

119
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.870
Um,
uh,
uh,
uh,
we have a,
a,
uh,

120
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:13.370
depending on a particular,
uh,
belief that people have,
um,

121
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:14.300
uh,

122
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.300
a particular trigger situation is being interpreted in a certain way in

123
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:21.380
psychological disorders.

124
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:26.510
This is often a expressed as a maladaptive cognitive,
uh,

125
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.310
thought kind of appraisal and attentional processes are also involved,

126
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:36.590
uh,
there guide the person toward certain stimuli,

127
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.000
ignoring others.
This then leads to physiological symptoms,

128
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:44.940
subjective experience it and behavioral responses which,
uh,

129
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.830
often feed back to the beliefs.
And these,
uh,

130
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.920
the cognitive appraisal said we have,
this is a very generic model.

131
00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:55.810
And let me explain it to you more concretely.
Uh,

132
00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:00.330
using two particular,
uh,
uh,
psychological disorders.

133
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.740
Let's take spider phobia.

134
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.670
A person with spider phobia might have the belief that spiders are dangerous and

135
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:11.830
the person might skim the environment.
Uh,
um,

136
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.650
examining whether there are spiders around a certain attentional process.

137
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:21.390
And if there is in fact a,
an object that might look like a spider,
um,

138
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.660
this would then lead,
could lead to the,

139
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.110
to the belief this ics by them,

140
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.120
despite of will attack me leading them to heart racing and filling us off fear

141
00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:33.114
and disgust.

142
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.410
And the person wants to avoid the situation and get out of the situation.

143
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.350
Um,
another example might be panic disorder.
Uh,

144
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.360
so a person might have the belief that I have to be in control of my body at any

145
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:51.240
time.
Uh,
as a result,

146
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:55.050
I focus on parts of my body that I think might be out of control,

147
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:58.700
such as my heart.
Uh,
and,
uh,
if I feel now my,

148
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.360
my heart is beating fast,
uh,
Eh,

149
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.200
I might have the belief that I have a heart attack,

150
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:09.440
which then leads to a further increase in heart rate,

151
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:14.100
uh,
subjective feelings of terror and distress and,
uh,

152
00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:16.170
and maybe,
uh,
a,
uh,

153
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:20.460
a desire to get out of the situation or Toya Hospital.
Uh,
so that,

154
00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:25.740
uh,
a medical doctors around in case an emergency is happening.
This,

155
00:10:25.741 --> 00:10:29.900
then again can feed back to the very idea that,
uh,

156
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.790
something is something might be wrong with me and I have,

157
00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:35.790
I am not in control of my body at any moment.

158
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.770
Now,
uh,
this is a rather complex,
a picture,
oops.
Uh,

159
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.750
this is a rather complex picture.
Uh,
however,

160
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:50.790
it exemplifies a number of strategies psychologists have been using to target,

161
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.970
uh,
depending on the psychological,
uh,

162
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.000
symptoms and syndrome of specific aspects of this cognitive model.

163
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.230
Um,
for example,
um,
uh,
a person might,

164
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.870
um,
might be,
um,
uh,
encouraged,

165
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.770
uh,
to,
to choose different situations,
stuck in the simplest case,

166
00:11:16.771 --> 00:11:21.210
a person with spider phobia might choose to Alaska where there no spiders
around.

167
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.190
Therefore,
the trigger is not there anymore.
Now,
obviously,
they are,
uh,
more,
um,
uh,

168
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.520
uh,
this is not the most effective way of treating spider phobia.

169
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.150
Other ways are a psychoeducation cognitive restructuring.

170
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:38.180
You might question some of these basic ideas that the person has a of spiders,

171
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:42.990
in fact,
dangerous.
Um,
uh,
have us,
has a spider ever attacked you,

172
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.760
et cetera.
Uh,
so psychoeducation,

173
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:50.400
cognitive restructuring is to core of contemporary cognitive behavior therapy.

174
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.890
Um,
uh,
attention.

175
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:58.360
More modern approaches have been found to be quite effective,

176
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:03.640
but also relaxation can help in certain for certain disorders.
Even breathing,

177
00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:08.530
retraining,
uh,
particularly,
uh,
effective.
Our exposure,
uh,

178
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.750
therapy,
uh,
procedures.

179
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:16.050
Also acceptance procedure in which we accept our feelings rather than trying to

180
00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:21.880
avoid,
uh,
we often talk about that in terms of experiential avoidance,

181
00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:24.670
which I try not to have these feelings,

182
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.920
but by encouraging the person to embrace and to become comfortable with feelings

183
00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:34.030
of anxiety,
uh,
the,
this vicious cycle can be disrupted.

184
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:39.280
A behavioral activation behavior modification are other additional strategies

185
00:12:39.281 --> 00:12:42.220
that can be used for certain disorders.
In particular,
depression.

186
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.740
Mindfulness Meditation is a more modern approach.
Uh,
in fact,
it isn't.

187
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.970
It is borrowed from,
um,
uh,
the Buddhist literature,

188
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.370
which is obviously a very old,

189
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:58.940
but we have adopted dead in contemporary cognitive behavior therapy,
uh,

190
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.330
to encourage the person to,
um,
uh,
uh,

191
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:09.370
to take a stance of nonjudgmental awareness.
Um,
and,
uh,

192
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:12.460
and this often also can disrupt these,
this vicious cycle.

193
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:18.700
Um,
in particular exposure,
uh,
therapy,
uh,
is,
uh,

194
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.541
is,
is a,

195
00:13:19.541 --> 00:13:24.340
is a highly effective form of a treatment for anxiety disorders.

196
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.110
There are just a few,
um,
uh,

197
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:33.520
ways or how people deal with their distress.

198
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.560
And,
uh,
this obviously gives psychologists a way to interfere,

199
00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:43.390
uh,
and to,
uh,
to modify these maladaptive behaviors.

200
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.550
People with panic disorder might carry cell phones with them,
uh,
or uh,

201
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.170
people with obsessive compulsive disorder.
My carrier,
good luck,

202
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.670
good luck charm or take medication carrying sunglasses can water bottle having a

203
00:13:54.671 --> 00:13:58.550
bible attend holding a drink.
All of this are,
uh,
uh,

204
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:03.250
what we call safety signals that makes the person feel in a safe place even

205
00:14:03.251 --> 00:14:06.600
though it obviously doesn't make a difference.
Um,

206
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.870
behavioral avoidance strategies might be,
uh,
might include avoiding eye contact,

207
00:14:10.871 --> 00:14:15.871
avoiding drinking coffee because it leads to heightened arousal that panic

208
00:14:15.911 --> 00:14:20.330
disorder patients dislike.
Attempting to control the breathing,
um,
uh,

209
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:25.270
avoiding exercise,
avoiding touching a single or procrastination.

210
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.130
Uh,
all of these are examples of behavioral avoidance strategies for a various

211
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.570
anxiety disorders.

212
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.910
Cognitive avoidance can in main clued distraction,

213
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.920
tuning out,
reassuring yourself,
pushing away thoughts,
pushing away memories,

214
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:46.240
thinking positive thoughts,
which is not what we believe is cognitive therapy,

215
00:14:46.241 --> 00:14:47.890
but thinking positive thoughts.

216
00:14:47.891 --> 00:14:52.480
It's actually maladaptive way of dealing with your,
uh,
uh,
distress,
warring,

217
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.310
rumination and thought suppression.
All of that,
uh,

218
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.720
we consider a cognitive form of cognitive avoidance.

219
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.530
Uh,
this is very much consistent with,
um,

220
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.080
emotion theories,
contemporary emotion theories,

221
00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:14.160
which assume that emotions arise as a result of,
um,

222
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.540
of focusing your attention on certain,
uh,

223
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:23.590
certain stimuli and a maladaptive appraisal of these situations,

224
00:15:24.201 --> 00:15:27.830
which then leads to the,
the emotional response.
And you can,

225
00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:32.720
um,
modify these,
uh,
these,

226
00:15:32.721 --> 00:15:36.260
these parts of this emotion regulation process,
uh,

227
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:40.900
at various stages by modifying the situation by,
uh,

228
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.920
differential,
uh,
uh,

229
00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:47.960
deployment of attention by changing cognitions and buy a chain,

230
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:52.420
modifying the response,
we actually distinguish,
um,

231
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:56.570
and deceit and focused and responds focus strategies.

232
00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:01.460
Cognitive appraisal is premier Li a response focus strategy.

233
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:07.640
Uh,
so far we have not spoken much about positive effect yet.

234
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.300
Positive ethic is an important,
uh,

235
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:14.480
dimension in our discussion.
Uh,

236
00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:19.510
positive ethic can both be adaptive.
And maladaptive,
uh,

237
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.420
for this discussion,

238
00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:25.421
I primarily want to focus on the adaptive on the good parts of the positive

239
00:16:25.431 --> 00:16:27.920
ethic dimension.
Uh,

240
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.440
certain triggers lead to an effective style.

241
00:16:30.441 --> 00:16:34.460
People differ in the way they respond to situations.

242
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:36.710
Some people tend to respond more positively,

243
00:16:36.711 --> 00:16:40.370
others more negatively to a very similar situation.

244
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.840
This is obviously linked to a particular diaphysis to a particular genetic

245
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:45.501
makeup.

246
00:16:45.501 --> 00:16:50.501
A person has a negative effect is being disregulated and can result in emotional

247
00:16:51.891 --> 00:16:55.610
disorders such as an anxiety disorder.
Uh,
a,

248
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.670
a positive effect,
uh,

249
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:02.510
tends to counter the effects of a negative of negative effect.

250
00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:04.160
And we,
in psychotherapy,

251
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.930
we have not focused enough on capitalizing on,

252
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.630
on positive ethic.
In fact,
uh,

253
00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:16.690
certain strategies including mindfulness strategies may just enhance a positive

254
00:17:16.941 --> 00:17:21.520
ethic,
which as a result,
uh,
inhibits negative ethic and also,
um,

255
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:26.180
uh,
uh,
has a beneficial effect on,
uh,
in the emotional response.

256
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:31.990
Now,
uh,
let me share with you with some,
uh,
um,

257
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:37.150
neuroscience approaches did we've been using to examine this puzzle of emotion,

258
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:44.220
uh,
uh,
cognitive appraisal and,
uh,
uh,
in,

259
00:17:44.221 --> 00:17:49.040
in more detail in particular,
we've been examining a prediction of,

260
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.980
uh,
of psychiatric disorders.
Uh,

261
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:57.110
and for this purpose we might examine the patient's brain activation,

262
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.280
um,
right before,
uh,
before they initiate a particular treatment.

263
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:08.100
Um,
in,
uh,
in this particular study we found that,
uh,
uh,

264
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.650
depending on a particular task,
they have to,

265
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.030
had to view certain faces and decide whether or not they saw a particular face

266
00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:20.031
before the parade of the activation of certain brain areas that are used in

267
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.740
processing phases.

268
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.170
The better the person will respond to treatment,
to cognitive behavior treatment,

269
00:18:28.171 --> 00:18:29.860
suggesting that,
uh,

270
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.420
you need to be able to process information and avoidance strategies that,

271
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.770
uh,
tends to,
uh,

272
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:44.030
distract you and not processed information works against you when it comes to

273
00:18:44.761 --> 00:18:46.910
treatment to,
uh,

274
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:52.130
we can quite accurately predict who will respond to treatment and will not

275
00:18:53.671 --> 00:18:58.671
respond to treatment based on once a brain activation prior to treatment.

276
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:00.630
So,
um,

277
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:05.750
in discharge is an example of a particular measure that is used to measure to,

278
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:10.880
to assess social anxiety.
Uh,
the,
uh,

279
00:19:10.881 --> 00:19:15.240
on the x axis depicted is the actual change of,
uh,

280
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:17.220
in this particular measure,
low carb,

281
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:22.080
the Libra with social anxiety scale on the y axis of what would be predicted

282
00:19:22.081 --> 00:19:26.430
based on,
uh,
once brain activation,
uh,
to a particular task.

283
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.660
And as you can see,
there's a very strong relationship of 0.66.

284
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:36.270
Uh,
now psychotherapy is a form of learning,

285
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:41.510
a rather complex form of learning and perhaps we can enhance the learning by,

286
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:44.610
uh,

287
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:49.320
by augmenting the process that happens during this learning process.

288
00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.870
Uh,
in particular,
um,
uh,

289
00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:54.990
I'm not going to obviously describe all of this in detail.

290
00:19:54.991 --> 00:19:59.490
This is just to depict the complexity of what is happening during,

291
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:04.560
uh,
this what is going on,
on the neuronal cellular level.

292
00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.780
Uh,
when learning occurs.
In essence,
there are,
uh,

293
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:13.680
there are two cells.
You have seen this,
uh,
such a slide of a synopsis.

294
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.240
Uh,
in particular the hormone,
uh,
uh,

295
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:21.750
the neurotransmitter glutamate is quite a important in this learning process.

296
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:26.850
And as a,
as a,
um,
as you learn something new,

297
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:27.840
um,

298
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.840
glutamate is being released in the synaptic gap that binds to the respective

299
00:20:33.091 --> 00:20:36.570
receptor side units.
Um,
but this,

300
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:41.490
there needs to be sufficient,
uh,
release of glutamate for this to happen.

301
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.450
Um,
and we know that once,
um,

302
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:49.260
once enough signaling occurs,
um,

303
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.770
there are complex processes.
Uh,

304
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:56.260
they're not only lead to the building of news receptors at the particular

305
00:20:56.261 --> 00:20:59.490
synapsis,
but also to adjacent,
uh,

306
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:04.040
new receptors at adjacent synopsis.
Uh,
in other words,
uh,

307
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.870
learning has a positive cascading effect.

308
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:11.110
If learning is optimal,
if learning is suboptimal,

309
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:16.120
not much will be happening at the synopsis.
Uh,
uh,

310
00:21:16.121 --> 00:21:20.830
just to depict it more simplistically,
uh,
when glutamate,

311
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:25.890
this particular neurotransmitter I just described and glycine a bind together at

312
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.540
this,
uh,
receptive side unit,

313
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.980
we call it an NMD receptor and methyl diaspora,

314
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:36.990
Todd receptor calcium ions come from the outside to inside of the cell,

315
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.360
which then leads to longterm potentiation,
which is the,
uh,

316
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.320
biological basis for,
um,
for learning

317
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:53.460
a decide glycerin is a particular molecule,
uh,
that,
uh,

318
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:58.730
that binds to this the glycine receptor side unit that leads to greater influx

319
00:22:00.761 --> 00:22:04.540
of calcium leading to greater longterm potentiation.

320
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:10.140
We have shown and others have shown that if you give decent grocerant in small,

321
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.340
a very small dose,

322
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.970
which of a substance it happens to be also an antibiotic,

323
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:20.350
but you give such a small amount that there's,
that uh,
uh,

324
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:24.910
the antibiotic,
uh,
Bill below the,
the action of the antibiotic property,

325
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:29.710
uh,
uh,
if you give as such a small amount of,
uh,
uh,

326
00:22:29.711 --> 00:22:31.730
of the sacral certain,
uh,
the,

327
00:22:31.731 --> 00:22:35.890
the learning that happens during exposure therapy is being enhanced.

328
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.330
Uh,
in other words,
the person learns a lot faster,

329
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:44.650
whatever they would usually learn,
which takes him a lot.
Uh,
uh,

330
00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:45.821
it,
the,

331
00:22:45.821 --> 00:22:49.300
the learning is a lot faster for those who receive the Sackler Seron versus

332
00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:53.230
those who received top placebo.
So to conclude,

333
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:59.050
the most effective contemporary psychotherapy is cognitive behavior therapy.

334
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.360
And it's founded on the idea that,
uh,

335
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:07.020
we appraised a stimulus in our environment,
uh,

336
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.050
in our body.

337
00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.370
And this appraisal can be maladaptive causes us,

338
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:17.200
uh,
emotional distress.
And by modifying this cognitive appraisal,

339
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:22.330
we can effectively treat psychiatric disorders.
Cognitive appraisal,

340
00:23:22.331 --> 00:23:24.940
therefore is a very powerful emotion regulation strategy,

341
00:23:24.941 --> 00:23:29.560
but it is not the only emotion regulation strategy.
More modern approaches,

342
00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:30.280
uh,

343
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.940
incorporate other emotion regulation strategies such as mindfulness techniques.

344
00:23:33.941 --> 00:23:37.930
And I have not spoken much about that.
These strategies are,

345
00:23:37.931 --> 00:23:42.670
can compliment and enhance traditional cognitive behavior therapy and most

346
00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:46.750
exciting,
I think,
uh,
are more,
uh,

347
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:51.820
modern neuroscience approaches that can be used to further augment and also

348
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:57.710
predict treatment outcome.
Okay.

349
00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:02.190
And if you'd like to know more about these issues,

350
00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:05.790
you might find it in this book.
Introduction to modern CBT.

351
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.080
Thank you for your attention.

352
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.860
<v 0>We will now move to our takeaway questions.</v>

353
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.470
Our first takeaway question asks,

354
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:17.400
what does the traditional cognitive model of psychology and what are the three

355
00:24:17.401 --> 00:24:21.780
temporal components of the cognitive model discussed today by Dr Stefan Hoffman

356
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:23.543
too.

357
00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:27.960
Can you describe the components of the generic CBT model proposed by Hoffman?

358
00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.820
How does it apply to panic disorder and spider phobia?
And three,

359
00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.820
can you describe the components of the emotion disregulation,

360
00:24:35.821 --> 00:24:40.590
model of mood and anxiety disorders proposed by Hoffman and colleagues in 2012

361
00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:43.890
we'll now move to our expert interview.

362
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.430
Today we will be speaking with Dr. Roy Baumeister.

363
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.440
Dr Baumeister is currently a professor of psychology at Florida State
University.

364
00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:57.300
He received his phd in social psychology from Princeton in 1978 and did a

365
00:24:57.301 --> 00:25:00.270
postdoctoral fellowship and sociology at UC Berkeley.

366
00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:04.830
Dr Baumeister's research spans multiple topics including self identity,

367
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:08.550
self regulation,
interpersonal rejection and the need to belong,

368
00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.950
sexuality and gender aggression,

369
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.890
self esteem meaning and self presentation.

370
00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.970
Dr Baumeister's received research grants from the National Institutes of health

371
00:25:17.971 --> 00:25:19.530
and from the Templeton Foundation.

372
00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.400
He has over 500 publication and 31 books.

373
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:27.630
The Institute for scientific information lists him among the handful of the most

374
00:25:27.631 --> 00:25:30.480
cited and most influential psychologists in the world.

375
00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.470
He has received lifetime achievement awards from the Society for personality and

376
00:25:34.471 --> 00:25:37.950
Social Psychology,
the international society for self and identity,

377
00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.610
and the William James Award from the association for Psychological Science.

378
00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:46.230
So I now turn to our experts in emotion interview with Dr. Roy Baumeister on

379
00:25:46.231 --> 00:25:48.150
self regulation and emotion.
