00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.550
Today we'll be speaking with Dr. Roy Baumeister on self regulation and emotion.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.770
Dr Baumeister is currently a professor of psychology at Florida State
University.

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.250
He received his phd in social psychology from Princeton in 1978 and did a

4
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:19.620
postdoctoral fellowship in sociology at UC Berkeley.

5
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.720
Dr Baumeister's research spans multiple topics including self and identity,

6
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.290
self regulation,
interpersonal rejection,
and the need to belong,

7
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.480
sexuality and gender aggression,
self esteem meaning and self presentation.

8
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.830
He is received research grants from the National Institutes of health and from

9
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:39.030
the Templeton Foundation.

10
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.330
He has authored over 500 publications and his 31 books include evil inside human

11
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:46.320
violence and cruelty,

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.510
the cultural animal meanings of life and the New York Times bestseller
willpower,

13
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.940
rediscovering the greatest human strength,

14
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.950
the Institute for Scientific Information Lists Dr Baumeister among the handful

15
00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:02.250
of the most cited an influential psychologist in the world.

16
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.660
He has received lifetime achievement awards from the Society for personality and

17
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:11.100
social psychology from the international society for self and identity.

18
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.050
And most recently the William James Award from the association for Psychological

19
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.350
Science.

20
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.790
So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Dr. Roy Baumeister on

21
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:25.260
self regulation and emotion.
So welcome.
Right.

22
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.680
Thanks for speaking with us today.

23
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.770
<v 1>Thank you for having me,
Jim.</v>

24
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.700
<v 0>Great.</v>

25
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.090
What I wanted to start at is asking you just a little bit about what you know,

26
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.080
got you.
First interested in the idea of emotion or studying emotion.

27
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.210
<v 1>It's hard to say.
I mean,
I'm interested in everything.
My project is,</v>

28
00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:47.710
I want to understand what human life is all about and so emotion is a big part

29
00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:51.280
of it.
Uh,
I got to it a little bit slower than some of the others.

30
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.750
I think some of the specific ideas came from findings that surprised me.

31
00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.700
I always assumed as I think most people in our field do that emotion is

32
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.500
immediately causes behavior.

33
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.940
When we review papers or whenever we submit them and and so on,

34
00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:10.200
the alternate explanations and that's how scientists work.
And I was,

35
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.130
how can we explain this action?

36
00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:16.120
It's usually because the person felt this way or had this emotion or we were

37
00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:19.270
afraid or they were angry or they were upset or they were happy or something.

38
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.200
So emotion is assumed to be the driving force.
Uh,

39
00:02:23.201 --> 00:02:27.310
and yet several big investigations of mine and to other phenomena they have just

40
00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:30.850
didn't turn out to be true.
Well,
one of the first was,
uh,

41
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.920
it was self destructive behavior or something.

42
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.930
I'm interested in because that's a paradox.

43
00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:39.660
And why do people do think that it's crew themselves up?
Uh,
and yet,
uh,

44
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.920
you know,
the assumption,
well,

45
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.820
they felt guilty so they want it to be punished or something like that.
But no,

46
00:02:45.821 --> 00:02:50.770
that doesn't appear to be to emotion is relevant,
but it,
uh,
it's not,
uh,
uh,

47
00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:53.350
you know,
because of some direct influence of emotional state.

48
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.790
And then I work on rejection there.
We assumed too,
um,

49
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.780
that,
uh,
people who were rejected or excluded by others,

50
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.790
they'd be upset and that would drive their behavior.

51
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.590
We started doing the studies and the lab,

52
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:09.820
we got huge behavioral effects all the time and yet we couldn't find any sign of

53
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:12.970
emotion.
So,
obviously emotion was not driving it and that,

54
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.680
that led me to start questioning,
uh,

55
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.830
how much of a role does emotion play in guiding behavior?
Uh,

56
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:24.160
so I think that was one of the big,
big things that got me interested in it.

57
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.870
<v 0>So what I want to ask you then,
I mean,
since you've gotten interested in it,</v>

58
00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:30.740
you've done some really interesting studies that shed a lot of important

59
00:03:30.741 --> 00:03:34.610
insights on emotion and the nature of self regulation.
So for example,

60
00:03:34.611 --> 00:03:36.260
I mean you're widely known,
you know,

61
00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:40.940
for your influential work on the role of human self regulation in particular for

62
00:03:40.941 --> 00:03:42.650
this concept of ego depletion.

63
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.250
And I wondered if you could just tell us a bit more about what you see as the

64
00:03:46.251 --> 00:03:49.160
central findings or discoveries in this line of work.

65
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.700
<v 1>Uh,
defining there is that,</v>

66
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.930
do you know after people exert self control after the controlled regulate their

67
00:03:56.931 --> 00:04:00.410
behavior in,
uh,
in,
uh,
in one task,

68
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.200
if we present them with another,
they do worse on that.

69
00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:08.201
So it looks like some of their energy or willpower or something is used up in

70
00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:12.230
the first act of self control.
So they don't have as much available.
Uh,

71
00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:16.480
for the second one,
controlling emotion can be one of those tasks.
Uh,
uh,

72
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.810
so,
uh,

73
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.760
after say you've a had a hard day at work or after you've been making yourself

74
00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:27.140
concentrate or controlling your performance to make yourself persevere or

75
00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:30.010
whatever,
uh,
then you might have less,
uh,

76
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.610
less will power for controlling your,
uh,
your emotions afterwards,

77
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.270
then you might react more strong.
You know,

78
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.890
you might let your emotions guide your behavior in some way.

79
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.490
And more recent findings are suggesting that a one effect of this depleted state

80
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:49.920
is that people actually feel their emotions more intensely.
Hmm.
Uh,

81
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.110
so not only are you not restraining them,
although that,
you know,

82
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.110
that might somehow feed into it,
uh,
but,
uh,
you know,

83
00:04:57.111 --> 00:05:00.680
their mount you're upset by watching and upsetting movie is higher if you're,

84
00:05:00.681 --> 00:05:05.680
your willpower has been depleted in state of ego depletion.
Um,

85
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.533
<v 0>that's great.</v>

86
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.600
I wanted to ask you a little bit more about some of the work that you've done

87
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:12.790
that is more directly relevant to motion as well.

88
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:16.810
So you've proposed a really interesting theory of emotion as this feedback

89
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:17.740
system,
right?

90
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.790
That typically has more indirect influences on behavior as opposed to more

91
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:24.100
directly causing,
you know,
human behavior.

92
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.520
And I wondered if you could elaborate on this approach as to how you think

93
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:29.020
emotion shapes behavior.

94
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.220
<v 1>Okay.
Um,
we,
uh,</v>

95
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.310
I like everyone else started out with the assumption that a usually emotion is

96
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:42.040
what causes behavior.
It's your current emotional state.

97
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.270
And that sort of means that the beginnings of behavior are somehow in the

98
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:47.320
emotion both state.

99
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.150
And that's been criticized by other people who were starting to say there are a

100
00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:54.580
lot of behaviors and not that many emotions.

101
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.380
That is something that has many different emotions.

102
00:05:57.381 --> 00:06:00.680
So how you act has to be somehow worked out in the situation.

103
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.920
There might be emotions have a sort of broad approach or avoid tendencies cause

104
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:07.070
those are basic.

105
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.490
And then you figured out how to apply that in the immediate situation.

106
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.560
But to say that,
uh,
you know,
anger contains the beginning of aggression in it.

107
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.080
Uh,
guilt contains whatever,
you know,

108
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.570
they're all sorts of behaviors people do because they feel guilty.
Yeah.
Uh,

109
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.170
that's hot.
That's,
that's question about,
um,

110
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.550
the most common example in the one everybody uses and I think that fooled us is,

111
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.280
is that fear makes you run away.
Uh,

112
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:39.281
but increasingly people are saying that fear is not a good model for other

113
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:44.540
emotions.
A lot of researchers say that,
well in nature,

114
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.860
there isn't time for the animal to get afraid.
Uh,

115
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.130
it has to take off immediately as soon as there's the threatening stimulus.

116
00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:55.700
If you wait for an emotional state to build up and then for the brain to say,

117
00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:59.610
okay,
I'm afraid that's it.
So I better get moving by then the Predator will,

118
00:06:59.611 --> 00:07:01.700
it will have eaten you.
So,
uh,

119
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.770
if the flight happens before the fear looking at this and we have you reviewed a

120
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:11.510
massive amount of information,
uh,
suggesting that yes,
indeed.

121
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.910
Uh,
emotion is not usually a,

122
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.530
the behavior and the way it is.
It's not that adaptive of behavior.

123
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.260
People Act because of their emotional states.

124
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.740
They tend to do things that they're sorry about it.

125
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.040
It's like the familiar example.

126
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.850
Don't send an email message when you're still mad.
Calm down

127
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.700
before you hit them.
You can write it but don't hit send.
Uh,
and,

128
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.680
and that's it.
It's,
it interferes with your judgment.

129
00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:42.200
So what that means is that that's not why we evolved emotions just to guide our

130
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:46.370
behavior.
If it makes us do things that are often stupid and self destructive,

131
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.720
still people without emotions don't hate very effectively.

132
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:54.050
There's something useful there.
So there has to be some other process.

133
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:56.270
And that made us think it's a,

134
00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.480
what emotion does is make you reflect on the experience after the fact so that

135
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.590
you learn the lesson,
uh,
and that you,

136
00:08:04.591 --> 00:08:09.470
you extract how to behave in the future that turns out to be highly adaptive and

137
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:13.850
is pretty common.
It hasn't been studied nearly as much,
uh,
but we think,
uh,

138
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.740
maybe the next couple of decades.
So,
um,

139
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.190
emotion researchers should stop looking so much at current emotional state and

140
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:24.440
started looking at anticipated emotional states.

141
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.120
The guilt is a great example in that it's a much better example than,
than fear.

142
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:33.650
Perhaps as a prototype for how emotion works in general.
You do something,

143
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.770
it turns out to be bad and you feel guilty.
I mean,
it must,

144
00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:40.040
people don't deliberately do things that are,
are going to make them feel guilty.

145
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.980
Uh,
they do something and then I'll just say,
oh,

146
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:44.870
you heard Mary or you made me feel bad.
I have this.

147
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:46.540
And then you feel guilty and you feel bad.

148
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:51.740
Guilt makes you reflect on what you did.
Uh,
I shouldn't have done this.

149
00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:54.710
Or if I had done this,
it would work out better.
And so then,

150
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.400
and then it stores a little trace,

151
00:08:56.401 --> 00:09:00.750
a little like emotional tank so that the next time you're in that situation,
uh,

152
00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.400
you're tempted to do the same thing.

153
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.350
And you have this little memories of this little tag,
which it has an automatic,

154
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.090
a bit of effect attached to it and says,
oh,
that's danger.

155
00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:15.030
And that reminds you of the last time you did that you got in trouble and you

156
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:16.680
felt bad.
So you avoided.

157
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:21.681
It can really be a powerful and effective guide of in behavior if you almost

158
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:24.510
never feel guilty.
Uh,

159
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.100
as long as you avoid doing things that you will make you feel guilty,
uh,

160
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.370
then you can stay out of trouble.
And that's,
that's really the deal.

161
00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:35.530
That's what we strive for in civilized life.
You know,

162
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:40.320
it's not too to feel guilty all the time for the bad things we do,

163
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:45.000
but rather to learn to avoid doing things that will make us feel guilty.

164
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.340
And if everybody did that would be a better place.

165
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.530
<v 0>So it's interesting cause you've talked about the role of anticipation and</v>

166
00:09:50.531 --> 00:09:53.680
reflection in your model and I wonder if you could just elaborate a tiny bit

167
00:09:53.681 --> 00:09:57.120
more.
I know you've alluded to this on the role of feedback,
right?
And,

168
00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.050
and the way emotion shapes behavior.

169
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.480
<v 1>Yes.
Uh,
uh,
um,
remember emotion,</v>

170
00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:06.480
we're talking here about the full fledge conscious emotion that takes a little

171
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:11.481
while to arise in the heat of the moment in the crisis or whatever that might

172
00:10:12.181 --> 00:10:16.710
be,
um,
might get in the way.
Uh,
but,

173
00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:21.660
uh,
there seems to be a delayed reaction that afterwards you feel bad or you feel

174
00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:26.340
good about something that pulls your mind tobacco back in to reflect on what you

175
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:29.970
did so that you are going to extract the lesson.
Um,

176
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.960
it's especially important for humans because our social lives are so
complicated.

177
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:37.110
There's so many things going on that,
uh,
you know,

178
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.970
we can reflect on what we did badly and learn all the different ways,
uh,

179
00:10:41.971 --> 00:10:43.470
that we might avoid it.
I mean,

180
00:10:43.471 --> 00:10:47.990
you go into a store to buy something and you,
you,
uh,

181
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.120
uh,
something goes wrong and you buy a badly and you feel bad afterwards.
Well,

182
00:10:52.121 --> 00:10:53.790
you can't never buy anything again.

183
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:57.300
You can to avoid wearing clothes or whatever.

184
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:02.400
So you figure how in that situation could I have avoided the problem or the bad

185
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:07.260
outcome?
It takes really some scrutiny over or ruminating,

186
00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:09.690
mulling over and emotion seems to be really good at that.

187
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.400
We know emotions stimulates you to replay events,
not just how they happened,

188
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.940
but in called counterfactual a ways.

189
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:22.830
You replay the event with different actions and different outcomes and find that

190
00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:25.560
you settle on one will,
this then would have produced a good outcome.

191
00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:27.120
This is maybe what I should have done.

192
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.870
And then you store that away and the next time a similar situation arises,

193
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:35.530
there's a little,
uh,
a tag and a little bit of a,
a little bit of the,
uh,

194
00:11:35.531 --> 00:11:38.490
automatic to effect the feeling and brings back,
yes,

195
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:42.300
I learned my lesson the last time and you behave better.

196
00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:44.940
So it's a,
again,

197
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:49.380
it's not that the current emotional state is teaching you how to act in the

198
00:11:49.381 --> 00:11:50.214
present,

199
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.250
but it's helping you learn the lesson from what happened so that the next time,

200
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.020
uh,
you can do better.
And as I said,
as you learned to anticipate the emotions,

201
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.950
that really facilitates the process to a,
as with guilt,
if you learn off,

202
00:12:03.951 --> 00:12:07.060
like do this again,
I'll end up feeling guilty again so I'm not going to do this.

203
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:07.960
<v 0>Great.</v>

204
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.140
So thank you for sharing your insights on this really important work in terms of

205
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:15.520
how emotion shapes behavior and also kind of the role of self regulation.
Um,

206
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.190
I wondered if you could say a little bit,
as you're thinking forward,

207
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.450
where are you see,
you know,
the,
the future of the field headed in this domain?

208
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.730
<v 1>All right.
Uh,
well,
I,
uh,</v>

209
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.533
<v 2>wow,</v>

210
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:36.470
<v 1>sure.
The boss,
um,
in our theory about emotion has feedback.</v>

211
00:12:36.471 --> 00:12:39.590
There's the currently felt emotion,
your,
your current state.

212
00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.510
And that's what researchers study a lot of.

213
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:46.130
And then there's the anticipation of how you could feel,
uh,
in the future.

214
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.570
Um,
now when we looked at which of those are driving behavior,

215
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.380
we found the current emotional state.
And,
and we,
we,
we took this,

216
00:12:54.381 --> 00:12:57.950
we looked in our top journal,
the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,

217
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:03.050
uh,
every article since 1987 when they started doing mediation analysis.

218
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.520
Uh,
and we found several hundred articles that tested for mediation by emotion.

219
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.190
And the vast majority were not significant emotion.

220
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.880
You're currently felt emotional state was not driving your behavior.
Uh,

221
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.630
we also looked at once on an dissipated emotion.
And,
uh,

222
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.580
there we're only about a dozen,
but 90% of those,
uh,
guided behavior.

223
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:26.900
So it looks like if we want to understand how people act,
uh,

224
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:31.010
looking at anticipated emotion is the way to go,
but nobody's doing it yet.

225
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:35.150
So I think the field is likely to wake up sometime in the next 10 years.

226
00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.170
Uh,

227
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:41.170
maybe some of us encouraging them to say that trying to understand behavior

228
00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:45.080
based on what's driving it in your current emotional state.

229
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.160
That's not getting us this far.
But looking at anticipated emotion,

230
00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:52.430
we haven't looked at that and that's where all the action is that really

231
00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:57.140
deserves a lot more,
uh,
uh,
intensive study.
Um,
I think,

232
00:13:57.141 --> 00:13:57.950
uh,

233
00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.480
we need to sharpen up our terms and our concepts and our understanding of the

234
00:14:02.481 --> 00:14:05.630
term emotion is used in lots of different ways.
Uh,

235
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.160
we had a distinguished sort of those little tags.
You get a little twinge of a,

236
00:14:10.161 --> 00:14:14.630
this is good or this is bad,
that that counts as emotion,
uh,
to some people.

237
00:14:14.631 --> 00:14:17.150
But it's very different from what,
you know,

238
00:14:17.151 --> 00:14:22.070
walking around and weeping and sobbing with the remorse or greed for something

239
00:14:22.071 --> 00:14:26.810
because something really bad just happened.
So separating those states,

240
00:14:26.811 --> 00:14:30.650
I think a,
those are important.
And understanding how they fit together,

241
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.670
how emotion fits in the big picture.
I think that's still a challenge.

242
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.330
This emotion,
cognition,
motivation,
uh,

243
00:14:38.331 --> 00:14:42.230
those seem to be the three big categories,
uh,
with behavior being,

244
00:14:42.231 --> 00:14:46.820
being eloquent and so,
exactly how does the emotion fit in there and contribute,

245
00:14:46.821 --> 00:14:50.450
uh,
to,
to,
uh,
occasionally messing us up.

246
00:14:50.451 --> 00:14:52.680
But more often than not helping us live the good life.

247
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:53.970
I think that's the way to go.

248
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.050
<v 0>Thank you.
And my last question for you is,</v>

249
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.220
what advice do you have for students who are thinking about embarking in this

250
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:02.900
field?
What might you tell them?

251
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.890
<v 1>No,
just study emotion.
Um,</v>

252
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:13.610
I think the most pressing need is far a methodological creativity.

253
00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:18.460
If you can think of ways,
uh,
to study emotional stage to get people in them.

254
00:15:18.461 --> 00:15:19.460
That's what's held it back.

255
00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:22.670
We know a lot more about cognition than about emotion.

256
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:27.560
And I think that's not cause cognition is more important,
uh,
are more prevalent.

257
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:31.250
It's just that it's easier to study.
So,
uh,
uh,

258
00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:36.440
always be on the lookout for new methods of that I think historically has held

259
00:15:36.441 --> 00:15:40.080
back the study of emotion.
Um,
so,
uh,

260
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.660
come up with new methods and then,
uh,
be really disciplined in critical,

261
00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:46.990
and I'm looking at the ideas,
uh,

262
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:50.900
theories and to try to understand what's right about everyone and what's wrong

263
00:15:50.901 --> 00:15:51.730
about it.

264
00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.190
<v 0>Great.
Well,
thank you so much for speaking today.</v>

265
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.660
<v 1>Oh,
thank you for having me on.</v>

266
00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:59.940
<v 0>So this concludes our experts and emotion interview with Dr. Roy Baumeister from</v>

267
00:15:59.941 --> 00:16:02.670
Florida State University.
Thank you so much again.
