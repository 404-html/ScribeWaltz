1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.470
Welcome back to human emotion.
Um,

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.960
this is our final segment on emotion and evolution.
Again,

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.490
trying to conclude our thoughts today and discussion of his evolution all there

4
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:13.720
is to emotion.
Um,

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.910
and today we're going to be thinking about the evolution of emotion by actually

6
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:22.230
considering some criticisms to this theory and alternative perspectives.

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.510
Um,
so from the last two lectures we talked about the evolutionary theory of

8
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:28.320
emotion.

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.340
And the three basic takeaway points that we discussed were the fact that first

10
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.040
of all,
emotions are biologically rooted.

11
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.560
They are part of our evolutionary history.

12
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.080
Emotions are universal across cultures and emotion serves specific functions

13
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.910
important for our survival.

14
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.390
But really is this the entire story about emotion or should we be questioning if

15
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:54.270
emotion really is all there is to emotion?
Um,

16
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.960
are there any arguments against this perspective?
And if there are,

17
00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:01.290
what might they look like?
So here,

18
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:04.590
this is what we're going to consider today or some of these counter arguments

19
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.780
and criticisms to evolutionary theory.
And our roadmap will go as follows.

20
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:11.910
So we'll talk about some of these criticisms.

21
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.460
We'll talk about one of the alternative perspectives,

22
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:16.230
which is called social constructivism.

23
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.950
And then we'll wrap up with our takeaway questions and expert interview of the

24
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:20.784
day.

25
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.900
So let's start here with some criticisms that have been given to evolutionary

26
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.510
theory as it applies to emotion.

27
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.860
So there's political,
conceptual,

28
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.790
and empirical criticisms,
and we'll talk about each of these three right now.

29
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.990
So political criticisms of evolutionary theory,
um,

30
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.550
suggest that this theory really seems to imply this really uncomfortable

31
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:48.810
biological determinism that everything about our emotions can simply be

32
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:52.880
explained by our sort of innate biological wiring.
Um,

33
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.980
gives very little influence or opportunity for things like culture or experience

34
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:03.390
to shift or change how we feel and who we feel these things about.

35
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.480
It also seems to largely emphasize sex differences as part of this biological

36
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:13.470
determinism that men and women are simply built differently and have different

37
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:14.670
emotional profiles.

38
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.190
And some would argue on these political criticisms that it can be interpreted as

39
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:23.580
justifying a darker side of human emotions.
Um,

40
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.350
that the reason we feel things like hate and rage are simply because we're wired

41
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:32.790
to be this way.
I'm giving very little room for four change,
um,

42
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.010
outside of this biological determinism.

43
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:38.940
So this is a sort of political approach to criticizing evolutionary theory.

44
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.000
The second is more conceptual.

45
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.270
So this conceptual criticism would argue that well the mind is not massively

46
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:51.270
modular,
doesn't have these programs or systems built in it,

47
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:55.140
like the ones that uh,
cause meetings and to be talked about.
Um,

48
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.340
or as a in the census scribed by these evolutionary psychologists.
Um,

49
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.470
in fact and said the mine was evolved to give us flexibility.

50
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.440
So it shouldn't just be the case that when we see a snake,

51
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:07.510
we just had this program that gets flipped on.

52
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.040
We should have an ability to be more versatile and flexible and how we feel when

53
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:13.960
we see things in the environment around us.

54
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.720
The conceptual criticisms would also argue that the ea but we talked about

55
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.810
earlier,
is not the sole environment.
If human adaptation,

56
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.010
this sort of Savannah Hunter Gatherer Society can't explain all of our current

57
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:30.340
emotional states.
Um,
instead,
as you can see here,

58
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.510
natural selection can only work in a very few generations.

59
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.810
And this seems to cast doubts on the idea that we stopped evolving thousands of

60
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.570
years ago.
Rather it there would suggest what we should still be evolving,

61
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:47.770
but not all of our emotions can be traced back to one simple environment.

62
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.540
The EA and some empirical criticisms,
uh,

63
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:57.420
suggest here that some of the findings behind evolutionary theory,
um,

64
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.990
that had been used to bolster these accounts of human psychology actually have

65
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:05.440
some major limitations in the studies themselves.

66
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.540
And because of these limitations,

67
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:10.390
they have other plausible alternative explanations as well.

68
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.810
And so empirical criticisms of evolutionary theory say that they just provide

69
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:21.340
these just so stories that we have fear just so we could,
you know,

70
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.590
flee from Predators or um,
you know,

71
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:26.860
we have certain facial configurations just so we could do this or that.

72
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.690
And in other words,
that these just,

73
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:33.691
so stories are really told after the fact in this post hoc fashion and that many

74
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:36.460
theories of evolutionary theory as such,

75
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.180
since we're telling stories of things that happened thousands of years ago,

76
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:41.530
our unfalsifiable,

77
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.640
we can't really design experimental studies that could readily,
uh,

78
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.370
show that these theories are false.

79
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.430
So when we think about some of these limitations,

80
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.120
I'll start with an example of some of the empirical criticisms.
So again,

81
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:59.440
here it's suggested some of the major findings that evolutionary psychologists

82
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:04.330
use to support their theory of emotion,
um,
may not be all that,

83
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.990
that they may actually have some serious fundamental limitations.

84
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.960
So the example I'll use as you can see here,

85
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:14.440
you might remember we just talked about was Paul Ekman study in New Guinea.

86
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.820
So here you remember,

87
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:19.200
he found that the preindustrial preindustrial tribe of the foray,

88
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.960
people were able to recognize facial expressions of emotion.

89
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.910
They are able to use words,
uh,

90
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.970
of emotion to match certain facial expressions and photos.

91
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.260
And after hearing stories or vignettes told they could pick out different photos

92
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:35.860
of people showing emotion expressions to match the story and write.

93
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:37.930
So based on this evidence,
um,

94
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.330
Paul Ekman concluded that expressions of emotion are basic or biological

95
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:47.320
universal to all humans across all cultures.
So in other words,

96
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:50.720
this story was seen as providing strong,
uh,

97
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.660
support in favor of this more,
uh,
evolutionary approach to emotions.

98
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.410
Um,

99
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.410
but is evidence really correct or are there some criticisms and limitations of

100
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:03.830
one of the founding,
uh,

101
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.240
studies behind the evolutionary theory of emotion with respect to this idea of

102
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:09.410
emotions being cultural,

103
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:13.670
universal or sort of biologically sort of innate or hardwired.

104
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.190
So let's see what the criticisms are right here.

105
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.320
So some of the criticisms of this New Guinea study of Paul Ekman are as follows.

106
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:25.580
So the first is that there's language differences and for example,

107
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:28.040
so you could saw that some of the emotions,
uh,

108
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:31.550
that would be used to match the stories were translated to the lake local

109
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:34.010
language.
But there may actually be some difficulties,

110
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:35.630
especially when it comes to emotion,

111
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.370
to translating them in ways that are identical or parallel across cultures.

112
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.510
Different cultures have simply different ways of thinking about or construing

113
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:48.590
the way they speak about emotions.
So there were translation problems.

114
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.710
Second,
and here's the issue,
is that they were provided with emotion words.

115
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:59.030
So you remember seeing a photo of an individual with an expression and six

116
00:06:59.031 --> 00:06:59.900
emotion words.

117
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.710
So they were provided with the emotion words and they had to pick one of the
six.

118
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.710
So this is also thought about is the forced choice method.

119
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.660
So rather than me being given,

120
00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:13.340
shown a photo and letting them tell the person what emotion that photo was

121
00:07:13.341 --> 00:07:16.760
expressing,
they only had a limited option of choices to pick from.

122
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.990
So this may have increased the likelihood that they would pick the coat correct

123
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.850
or right answer.
Um,

124
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.480
so this forced choice method where they are provided the emotional words is seen

125
00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:30.560
as one of the major limitations or criticisms people at generated about the new

126
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:33.050
Guinea study.
Finally,

127
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:36.560
as you saw in some of the photos that we showed as examples of the kinds of

128
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:40.250
stimuli that might have been used in that study was that they were almost these

129
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.050
caricature like expressions.

130
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.600
So many of us probably don't show these exaggerated fear responses or you know,

131
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.390
overly like intense smiles on our face in everyday life.

132
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.570
So are these photos actually naturalistic?

133
00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:57.500
Do they really show the kinds of emotions that people across cultures are likely

134
00:07:57.501 --> 00:08:01.010
to see in their everyday life?
And then finally,

135
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:05.540
this was a really unfamiliar task for these people in New Guinea.
One,

136
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.890
they were shown photographs,

137
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:10.190
which is not part of their everyday life in a preindustrial society.

138
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.410
And the people in the photos were white.

139
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.400
So they were not the kinds of people that they normally interacted with in their

140
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:19.160
everyday life.
But these were Westernized Caucasian adults.

141
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.720
So these are some of the criticisms or limitations of this study,

142
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.400
which is part of the sort of more general empirical criticism of evolutionary

143
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:32.030
theory alongside conceptual and political criticisms as well.

144
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.400
And as we talked about,

145
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:38.570
these criticisms of evolutionary theory have led people to think of them as just

146
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.650
part of a broader trend of these.
Just so stories.
Um,

147
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:46.390
so this was named after a Kipling's book.
Uh,

148
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.450
just so stories,
um,
and you can read this code here,

149
00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:54.860
Doctor Mesmer's guide to bad psychology where he says evolutionary psychologists

150
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:59.340
provide us with these just so stories to explain everything about human behavior

151
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.670
and all without the troublesome need to assemble proof.

152
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:08.030
We can run fast because our ancestors had to escape cave bears got smart because

153
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:13.470
they had to know where the cave bears were and got sexy because they could

154
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:15.870
rescue cave babes from the cave bears.

155
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.850
So the idea is that we're just making up these convenience stories to explain

156
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:24.420
why we are,
you know,
fast,
smart,
and as he would say,

157
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:29.250
sexy without any sort of scientific or empirical proof that this is the case.

158
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.060
So where do we go from here?

159
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:37.290
How do we balance the strengths of evolutionary theories to emotion with some of

160
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:41.430
the criticisms discussed today,
political,
conceptual,

161
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:45.570
empirical.
And I think this is really one of the challenges we have here,

162
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.090
sort of taking the strengths with the weaknesses.

163
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.080
And I think one of the things here is to not get caught up any of the politics

164
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.520
and yourself as a student to really think about where does the evidence lineup

165
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.880
and what right now is the most sort of a compelling argument for or against

166
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:03.360
evolutionary theory.

167
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.440
So I would suggest that you not get caught up on being on one side or the other,

168
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.730
but simply have an open and receptive mind to seeing where the evidence may take

169
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:15.810
you.
Um,
but all the while for any theory that we discuss in class,

170
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.560
whether it's evolutionary or we'll talk about social constructivism later,

171
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.960
any kind of theory,
just to question it,

172
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:26.310
to question its basis because we know that the field of emotion about these

173
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:30.900
everyday and mysterious experiences,
we all know feeling angry or sad or happy,

174
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:36.130
um,
that this is a very new field and as many,
uh,
discoveries as well.
Sharon,

175
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.230
this course,
there's a lot of questions and always room to reconsider things.

176
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.540
So simply think about everything you read,

177
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.780
everything I tell you with a critical and open mind.

178
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:51.360
So we're going to now turn to social constructivism and I hope you take the same

179
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:56.130
mindset of bouncing strengths and weaknesses to this idea as well.

180
00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.340
So Social Constructivism,
as you can see here,

181
00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:04.341
was really sort of talked about a lot and one of the pioneers was James Avril.

182
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:05.640
He said,

183
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.200
emotions are not just remnants of our phylogenetic or evolutionary past,

184
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.400
nor can they be explained in strictly physiological terms.

185
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:19.740
Rather they are social constructions and they can be fully understood only on a

186
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:21.570
social level of analysis.

187
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.800
So social constructivism is this predominant perspective and anthropology,

188
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.800
sociology,
and even some philosophical traditions.

189
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:33.600
And this perspective really argues that emotions are cultural products that oh,

190
00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:37.530
they're meaning to learn social rules.
So for example,

191
00:11:37.531 --> 00:11:41.610
gender and social group differences in the expression and experience of emotions

192
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.200
are no accident at all.

193
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:47.490
But indeed they reveal the way that emotions are constructed within a certain

194
00:11:47.491 --> 00:11:51.570
culture to serve particular social purposes.
Um,
Avril,

195
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.570
you can see here actually went to this more strongly state that emotions don't

196
00:11:55.571 --> 00:11:59.200
need to have any biological or physiological changes.

197
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.380
Sort of the opposite of what we talked about with William James and his

198
00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:06.220
physiological approach that we can actually have an emotion without a racing

199
00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:08.020
heart whatsoever.
He would argue.

200
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.410
So he would say biology plays no role in emotions.

201
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:15.790
It's all about social norms and cultural constructions that have created and

202
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:17.560
shaped the emotions we feel today.

203
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.370
So if we think about social constructivism here,

204
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:25.510
we lined it up against evolutionary theory which says emotions are biologically

205
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:27.160
rooted part of our history.

206
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.660
They serve specific functions and their universal across cultures.

207
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.980
If we put this right up against social constructivism or what's also been called

208
00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:39.490
cultural relativism,
we see a very different perspective.

209
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.350
We see a perspective thing that emotions are actually constructed by cultural

210
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:45.184
values,

211
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.660
by societal institutions and by differences in our language,

212
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:53.260
the way we think about and talk about feelings.
Um,

213
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.510
and that this is a strong claim.

214
00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:59.200
They would say at the very extreme point that biology,

215
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:03.970
both our brain and our sort of autonomic nervous system played no role in

216
00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:07.420
emotions at all.
And that there are these,

217
00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:11.950
what they talk about is open systems,
right?
So that emotions are not fixed.

218
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:16.720
There's not one set of behaviors and physiological responses that you know,

219
00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:20.410
sort of go with fear or that makeup sadness,

220
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:24.220
but that there are these open systems that you can construct an emotion in many

221
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:24.911
different ways.

222
00:13:24.911 --> 00:13:29.710
You can have an emotion of sadness that has very different kinds of expressions,

223
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:33.730
are very different kinds of physiology that we kind of make up and put the

224
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:37.570
pieces together of emotions ourselves through social norms,
through learning,

225
00:13:37.571 --> 00:13:40.240
through speaking with others as we grow up in different societies.

226
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.590
So as you can see here,

227
00:13:41.591 --> 00:13:46.180
these are radically different perspectives and a social constructivists and

228
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:50.140
evolutionary theorists don't really seem to see things a the same way.

229
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.670
But let's think about what social constructivism is and what might be some of

230
00:13:54.671 --> 00:13:58.660
the examples that would make them think that maybe biology plays no role.

231
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.110
And that culture really seems to play a predominant role in emotions.

232
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.870
So if we take the example of anger,

233
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:09.160
so evolutionary theorists would say that anger is considered one of the six

234
00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:13.870
basic kind of evolutionarily evolved the motions.
But if it is,

235
00:14:13.871 --> 00:14:17.440
it should be cross cultural,
uh,
in terms of being universal,
right?

236
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.880
But yet we don't see it across all cultures.
For example,
in the Inuit culture,

237
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:22.840
um,

238
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.840
we don't see anger because in this culture it would be too risky to experience

239
00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:32.971
or express anger in the small homogeneous culture living in harsh communities.

240
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.490
Um,
and so because of that cultural context,

241
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.250
we don't really see the experience of anger.

242
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:43.060
So then can it really be thought to be sort of biologically basic are

243
00:14:43.061 --> 00:14:45.310
evolutionarily evolved?
They would say no.

244
00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:50.340
Here's one example how even one of the core basic emotions may not be actually

245
00:14:50.621 --> 00:14:51.454
so basic.

246
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.910
The social constructivist also bring up the example of culture specific emotions

247
00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.590
where there's actually some emotions that are not only not universal across

248
00:15:00.591 --> 00:15:04.010
cultures,
but that we only see in certain cultural contexts.

249
00:15:04.011 --> 00:15:07.250
So consider the emotion of uh,
my in Japan.

250
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:12.640
So umyes this interesting emotion that is described as the feeling of dependency

251
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.310
upon another person.
Um,

252
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.150
now this is something that's highly devalued in Western society,
um,

253
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:24.470
to have this indulgent feeling of dependency akin to what a child feels to its

254
00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:29.270
mother,
but in more sort of,
um,
interdependent are collectivistic societies.

255
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:31.850
Like in Japan,
this is a highly valued,

256
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.680
highly what they call hyper cognizant emotion,
that scene rather predominantly.

257
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:41.090
So what's interesting is why would there be some emotions and some cultures and

258
00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:44.510
not emotions and other cultures if emotions are really thought to be these

259
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.560
hardwired biological systems that originated early in our history and should be

260
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:50.990
across all cultures.

261
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:52.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

262
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.990
<v 0>So that's sort of an introduction of social constructivism and what we're gonna</v>

263
00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:01.510
do today is rapid with some takeaway questions and then discuss social

264
00:16:01.511 --> 00:16:04.450
constructivism and more depth with our expert interview today.

265
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.450
So let's move to our takeaway questions.

266
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.340
So for today,
they,

267
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:18.370
the first one is what are the main criticisms of an evolutionary approach to

268
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.273
emotion?

269
00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:26.030
What were the empirical criticisms that we discussed today against Paul Ekman is

270
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:27.150
a new Guinea study.

271
00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:32.860
And then finally sort of what are the three central tenets or critical core

272
00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:35.260
pieces of the social constructivist account.

273
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:40.690
And can you provide a couple examples of evidence in favor of this alternative

274
00:16:40.691 --> 00:16:42.550
approach to understanding emotion?

275
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.630
Turning to our expert interview today as part of the experts in emotion

276
00:16:51.631 --> 00:16:52.590
interview series,

277
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:57.000
we will be talking with Dr Yulia Chance Sova Dutton,

278
00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:01.200
who will share her experience on whether emotions indeed are socially

279
00:17:01.201 --> 00:17:02.034
constructed.

280
00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:06.990
Dr. Chen Sova Dutton received her phd from Stanford University and is currently

281
00:17:06.991 --> 00:17:08.850
an assistant professor at Georgetown.

282
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.200
Her Research Interests Center on cultural shaping of emotions and social support

283
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:18.590
and she conducts exciting work on emotion and culture internationally and East

284
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.520
Asian,
uh,
Russian and west African cultural contexts.
Um,
interestingly,

285
00:17:23.521 --> 00:17:25.290
she's also a native of Russia,

286
00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.090
so I now turn to a very special experts and emotion interview with a treasured

287
00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:32.820
colleague of mine,
Dr Yuliya,
Yulia,
and Sova Dutton.

288
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:34.300
<v 1>Okay,</v>

289
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.470
<v 0>thanks for a great class.</v>
