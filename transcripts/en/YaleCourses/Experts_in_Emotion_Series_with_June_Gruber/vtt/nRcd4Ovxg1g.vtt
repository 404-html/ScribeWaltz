00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.730
Hi.
So today,
human emotion,

2
00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:06.690
we're going to talk about the way in which emotion shaped the way that we think.

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.870
And here we'll be trying to answer some of the biggest questions that have

4
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:12.150
plagued the field of emotion for decades.

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.560
That is in what way is emotion really distinct from thinking?

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.460
So we used to think of emotion and cognition as to vastly separate entities that

7
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:24.270
were even at odds with each other.

8
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.160
We know now through recruiting scientific evidence that in fact they're not only

9
00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:32.190
not at odds,
but in fact,
as you can see here,

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.520
they overlap an important and an interesting ways.

11
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.360
And in particular we've talked earlier in this series and emotion and cognition

12
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:44.250
and the ways in which feelings actually do shape the way we think.
However,

13
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:48.210
most of what we've talked about so far has been talking about relatively

14
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:52.080
conscious types of thoughts,
memories,
and perceptions.

15
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.490
Yet to what extent can emotions actually shaped the way we think,

16
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.960
even unconsciously,
sort of outside of our awareness completely.

17
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.300
So in other words,

18
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.990
can emotions actually be unconscious?

19
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.330
So this is this idea of is really all we're is.

20
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.350
Most of what we're seeing really below the surface and in fact unconscious and

21
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.350
that most of our conscious life is really just a mere tip of the iceberg.

22
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.150
So today we're going to try to delve deep into this idea of unconscious

23
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:26.010
emotional experiences.

24
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.780
And by doing so we're going to really try to probe into this idea of the

25
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:34.830
psychological unconscious.
So by the psychological unconscious,

26
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:39.450
as you can see here,
what we're referring to is the conscious experience,

27
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:44.310
thought and action that's influenced by percepts memories and other mental

28
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:49.311
states which are inaccessible to phenomenal awareness and somehow independent of

29
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.500
voluntary control.
So indeed many of our mental states,

30
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:59.700
and perhaps even our emotions may not be fully accessible to us and we actually

31
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:04.701
may not be fully aware of all the powerful influence our feelings are having on

32
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:07.380
our everyday life.
And the way we think about the world,

33
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:08.850
the way we judge other people,

34
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.090
and the way we decide what we like and what we don't like.

35
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.770
So today this is going to be our third segment on emotion and cognition.

36
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.500
And we're going to be delving deep into the unconscious.

37
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.850
And looking at the question of can feelings actually be unconscious?

38
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.710
And if they can,
what role do they play in our lives?
Do they shape who we are,

39
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:29.670
what we do,

40
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.750
how we perceive the world in ways that we may not at all be aware of?

41
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.320
So our roadmap today is going to go as follows.

42
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.820
We're going to start with some origins,

43
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:43.290
sort of where did this idea that emotions can even be unconscious first begin.

44
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.700
Then we're going to turn to some recent empirical studies that focus on priming

45
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:48.211
studies,

46
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:52.500
which we'll talk about in a moment as one really innovative paradigm to get at

47
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.020
unconscious emotional processes.

48
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.160
Then we'll conclude with our takeaway questions and expert interview for this

49
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.950
particular module.
So let's start with origins.
In other words,

50
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:06.910
where did this idea that emotions can be unconscious even begin?

51
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.560
So here we're going to delve into the unconscious emotional life that really

52
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:16.540
originated with Sigmund Freud and Carl Young.
So Sigmund Freud said,

53
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.310
our right to assume the existence of something mental that is unconscious and to

54
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:26.230
deploy that assumption for the purposes of scientific terrific work is disputed

55
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:28.180
in many quarters.
To this,

56
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:32.350
we can reply that our assumption of the ICAN conscious is necessary and

57
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:37.150
legitimate and that we possess numerous proofs of its existence.

58
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.751
So again,

59
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:42.751
he argued that of course we have a rich unconscious life and that there's many,

60
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:46.150
many instances that proves its existence.

61
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.170
And so for those of you who have taken maybe introductory to psychology,

62
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:51.490
this might look familiar to you.

63
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:55.420
So here is Freud and his sort of depiction of our mental life.

64
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.190
So he sort of thought about it in many different stages of things being

65
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.490
unconscious,
preconscious and even conscious,
right?

66
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.170
And the important part here is that he assumed that much of our mental life was

67
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:09.640
largely unconscious.

68
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:14.440
So below this sort of level of awareness or below the ocean of awareness,

69
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:17.050
if you think of that metaphor of an iceberg,
right?

70
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.520
And he further reason that much of our mental suffering and distress arose from

71
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:24.760
conflict among different unconscious forces.

72
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.890
So he would talk about the ID,

73
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:31.090
right as the sort of sole seat of unconscious desires and passions and

74
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:31.924
aggressions.

75
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.940
Whereas the Super Ego was really sort of our external societal norms.

76
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.570
And here we are for most of our lives,
sitting at the ego,

77
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:45.130
which is really trying to reconcile the desires of the ID and the social norms

78
00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:49.930
of the Super Ego.
So what's important here is that he did pause it.

79
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.040
A large portion of our life is largely unconscious.
And that in fact,

80
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:57.670
much of our unconscious experience manifested through our dreams and our

81
00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:01.780
impulses actually has important rich symbolic meaning as well.

82
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.220
So he was really one of the first people to really spend a lot of time

83
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.540
emphasizing the role of the unconscious and a lot of our emotional states that

84
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:15.220
arise from it.
But he focused primarily on aggression and sexual impulses.

85
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.080
Another famous figure in this field was Carl Young,

86
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.160
who also really emphasize the role of the unconscious.
And he said,

87
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:26.950
until you make the unconscious conscious,

88
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.040
it will direct your life and you will call it fate.

89
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.950
And so he also said in addition to our immediate consciousness,

90
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.780
which is of a thoroughly personal nature and which we believe to be the only

91
00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:45.430
empirical psyche,
even if we tack on the personal unconscious as an appendix,

92
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.880
he said there exists a second psychic system of a collective universal and in

93
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:55.330
personal nature,
which is identical in all individuals.

94
00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.170
This collective unconscious does not develop individually,

95
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.280
but in fact is inherited.
It consists of preexistent forms,

96
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:08.540
what he called the archetypes,
which can only become conscious secondarily,

97
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.630
and which give definite form to certain psychic events.

98
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.890
So it's important to take home here as Carl Young also emphasize the role of the

99
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:17.390
unconscious.
But he said,

100
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:21.980
not only do we have our own personal or individual unconscious mental life,

101
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:23.720
but that as a human species,

102
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.320
we also partake in what's called the more collective unconscious,

103
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:31.520
shared among in many individuals and with important symbolic forms are

104
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:33.050
archetypes.
So again,

105
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:36.650
what I want you to take home here is that we have two early predecessors for it

106
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:41.060
and young who have really put forth this idea that the unconscious plays a vital

107
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:45.890
role in our psychological life.
And emotional wellbeing.
Um,

108
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.930
since then there had been some early studies on Korsakoff Syndrome that further

109
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:55.340
really emphasize the role of the unconscious.
So here what you see,

110
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:59.300
so this is a study that was done.
You can see here in the early 19 hundreds,
um,

111
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.010
in a classic demonstration of what we have now come to call spared implicit

112
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:09.000
memory or an organic amnesia.
The researcher who did this study,
um,

113
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.080
on Korsakoff Syndrome,
uh,

114
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.320
pricked and unsuspecting Korsakoff Syndrome patient with a pin hidden in his

115
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:20.030
hand and event that had caused the patient quite a bit of distress of course.

116
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.110
And when the researcher subsequently left the room and returned after the

117
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:28.130
patient had regained her composure and failed to even recognize who the

118
00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:28.911
researcher was,

119
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:32.780
had no recollection of this unfortunate incident that had just transpired

120
00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:36.140
between them.
However,
nonetheless,

121
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.410
the patient with Korsakoff Syndrome that has a form of organic amnesia refused

122
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.010
to shake the researchers hand.
When asked why she replied,
well,

123
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:48.470
sometimes people hide pins in their hands.

124
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.880
And so this story illustrates this phenomena of what they call source amnesia.

125
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.220
Familiar in many studies of memory.

126
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.660
And what's most important here is that assumes that the patient shaking hands,

127
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:04.520
um,
it made the patient nervous as well.
Although the patient didn't know why.

128
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:08.180
So they had an emotional reaction without any conscious awareness as to what

129
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:11.990
might have caused that feeling or that reticence of shaking the experimenters

130
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:12.311
hands.

131
00:08:12.311 --> 00:08:16.280
So this was an early study that suggests there may be a dissociation between

132
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:21.281
conscious awareness of an emotional state and sort of understanding its

133
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:25.940
influence on subsequent behavior.
So these are some early origins.

134
00:08:25.941 --> 00:08:29.300
And now I want to turn to more recent experimental studies in the realm of

135
00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:33.680
priming that have really given a new vitality and force this idea of the

136
00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:35.390
unconscious emotional life.

137
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:40.400
So I want to start here with some studies that were done by Robert Science on

138
00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:45.020
what he called the mere exposure effect.
So this is really interesting work.

139
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.080
So what happened in these studies,

140
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:53.081
the near exposure affect what essentially posits that repeated exposure to some

141
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:55.530
given stimulus increases liking.

142
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:58.770
So the more familiar you are with some given symbol,
the more you like it.

143
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.670
And he used an example in his study of Chinese ideograms.

144
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.890
So in the 1960s,

145
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.390
Robert Science conducted a series of experiments which demonstrated that simply

146
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:14.391
exposing participants too unfamiliar stimulates such as Chinese ideograms.

147
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:16.650
So individuals who weren't fluent in China,

148
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.680
Chinese themselves actually led them to rate these images more positively than

149
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.580
other similar stimuli that they had not been previously exposed to.

150
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.850
So in other words,
by simply seeing an image,

151
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.270
you're more likely to have positive emotional feelings to it,

152
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.340
even if you can't consciously recall having seen that image before.
Right?

153
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.370
Um,
or even if they presented these images that very,

154
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:46.371
very quick brief durations that couldn't be consciously recalled or or

155
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:47.304
remembered.

156
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.350
So when these another words you and presenting these subliminally very quickly,

157
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.750
you know,
in a way that can't be consciously recalled,

158
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:59.190
it still produced the same effect of liking these Chinese symbols more than

159
00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:02.070
unfamiliar symbols that people hadn't previously seen.

160
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:07.310
So this led Zions to conclude this famous quote here that mere preferences need

161
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:08.580
no inferences.

162
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.760
So we may simply like things without having any conscious inference or reason as

163
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:14.994
to why.

164
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.250
Then there were a series of emotional priming studies.

165
00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:24.030
So here emotional faces were presented subliminally.

166
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:28.470
So that's at a rapid speed that cannot be consciously perceived and found that

167
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.730
even in these instances,

168
00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:32.840
we're finding that when you present people really rapidly with stimulate,

169
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.680
it influences how they feel,

170
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:38.730
even though they can't consciously tell you why or can't consciously recall even

171
00:10:38.731 --> 00:10:40.110
having seen that image.

172
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.390
So one example of this sort of subliminal face priming is a study where

173
00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:49.380
individuals were primed with negative pictures of faces.
So like,
uh,

174
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.910
a frowny face here,
right?
And they were flashed for a quick instant.

175
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:59.270
And what happened here is that graduate students tended to rate their own

176
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:05.151
research more negatively when they were primed with a really brief image of a

177
00:11:05.161 --> 00:11:07.330
negative face,
right?
Um,

178
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.040
and they would even evaluate more neutral stimuli in a more negative light.

179
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.390
So another words,
what this scowling face presented really briefly,

180
00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:19.770
really instantly and which graduate students couldn't even recall having seen it

181
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.150
actually shaped the way they not only evaluated neutral stimuli,

182
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:29.100
but even how they evaluated their own very personal research ideas.

183
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.121
So in a way,

184
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:34.740
this can even shape the way that you emotionally feel about yourself.
Not just,

185
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:39.120
you know,
Chinese idiom grams are not just sort of external neutral stimuli,

186
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:43.190
but that there's this really powerful force of presenting emotional stimuli

187
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.850
rapidly that shapes a wide range of,

188
00:11:45.851 --> 00:11:48.750
of stimuli and how you emotionally feel about them.

189
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.830
Then there's been a series of studies that have really been pushed forward by a

190
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.750
of mine here at yelling university doctor John Barge,

191
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.500
who's looked further at what else emotion priming can do.

192
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:04.770
So can we actually experienced physical warmth in a way that unconsciously

193
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:09.670
promotes a social warmth or emotional feelings of affiliate iveness towards

194
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:13.930
others.
So in a study done by Lawrence wines and John Barge that was published,

195
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.300
published in science,
they argued this,

196
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:20.560
this claim that experience visit physical warmth actually promotes interpersonal

197
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:23.230
warmth.
So you can see here in the abstract,

198
00:12:23.231 --> 00:12:27.190
they argue that warmth is one of the most powerful personality traits and social

199
00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:29.770
judgment,
right?
And what they found here,

200
00:12:29.771 --> 00:12:34.510
it's very fascinating that they hypothesize that experiences of physical warmth

201
00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:37.300
or coolness would increase feelings of social warrant,

202
00:12:37.301 --> 00:12:41.260
their coldness without a person even being aware of their influence.

203
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.100
So they did this in a really clever way.

204
00:12:44.101 --> 00:12:48.790
So they had participants briefly hold a cup of either hot or iced coffee.

205
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.290
And then they were later asked to judge an unfamiliar target person,
um,

206
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.520
as having either a more warm personality or more cold personality.

207
00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:02.200
And they found indeed that individuals who've held that Warm Cup of coffee later

208
00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:05.620
rated an unfamiliar strangers having a warmer personality,

209
00:13:05.621 --> 00:13:07.990
being more generous and more caring,

210
00:13:07.991 --> 00:13:11.380
and that they were even more likely to choose a gift for a friend instead of

211
00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:12.214
themselves.

212
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:16.180
So what I want to show you here is a brief five minute video of Dr John Barge,

213
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:20.500
sharing some of these provocative and really groundbreaking studies showing just

214
00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:24.460
how powerful nonconscious emotional priming can be,

215
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:29.560
even by simply holding a cup of warm or hot coffee or warm or cold coffee.

216
00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:30.394
That is

217
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.700
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

218
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.430
<v 2>1996 professor John bodge shocked to Doug rage,</v>

219
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.440
his fellow psychologists by publishing studies,

220
00:13:46.441 --> 00:13:51.330
which controversially showed that our decisions can be subliminally manipulated,

221
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.510
<v 3>had fruit thrown at me at these talks when I give these results early in the
90s.</v>

222
00:13:56.511 --> 00:13:57.610
And they were joking,
you know,

223
00:13:57.611 --> 00:14:00.880
but I had apples and oranges lobbed at me because they thought you're going too

224
00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:01.714
far.

225
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:08.130
I have ceased being surprised at the results of these studies.
Uh,

226
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.610
the only because of all the long experience with these things keep working

227
00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:17.780
<v 2>subliminal effect that rattled so many cages is called prime.</v>

228
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.450
<v 3>You're watching television or watching a movie or reading a book and what's</v>

229
00:14:25.451 --> 00:14:27.340
happening in the movie or TV.

230
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.920
It could be something or someone doing something very brave.

231
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:40.490
And that just by itself activates ideas and the concept of bravery.

232
00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:45.530
And you might be more likely to see another person as a brave person or another

233
00:14:45.531 --> 00:14:48.800
person as a kind person or an intelligent person,

234
00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.980
more than usual and more than you have had the prior,

235
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.400
<v 2>prior event not happened.
And that's the nature of priming</v>

236
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:05.430
images and even words slipping thoughts and feelings into our subconscious is

237
00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:06.304
one thing.

238
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:11.530
But what is more worrying is how those thoughts and feelings can then change our

239
00:15:11.531 --> 00:15:12.364
behavior.

240
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.030
Today,
one of John Barges,
Phd Students,

241
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:23.900
is running an experiment to investigate the priming effects of temperature.

242
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.640
<v 5>What we do in our experiment,
we very briefly,</v>

243
00:15:30.641 --> 00:15:35.641
I suppose people to a warm or cold substance and what we expect to happen is

244
00:15:35.801 --> 00:15:40.210
that that simple experience with a warm substance or a cold subs as well,

245
00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.700
prime people to sort of activate these uh,

246
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:48.340
feelings of warmth and comfort and the things that we've learned about since we

247
00:15:48.341 --> 00:15:49.174
were very young.

248
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.340
<v 1>Yes,</v>

249
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.200
<v 5>and when we have those things in mind,</v>

250
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:58.310
those things we know will color people's judgements and decisions and their

251
00:15:58.311 --> 00:15:59.240
behaviors as well.

252
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:05.230
<v 2>Volunteers for the experiment or asked to hold a warm cup of coffee as they are</v>

253
00:16:05.231 --> 00:16:08.980
met by Lawrence.
They had been primed with heat.

254
00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:14.850
The purpose of the experiment is to record participants judgments about

255
00:16:14.851 --> 00:16:16.620
Lawrence's colleague Randy.

256
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.410
<v 1>That was great.
It was awesome.
Until I got stranded in Florida,</v>

257
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:24.000
there's a snowstorm.

258
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:31.810
<v 2>The theory is that the hot drink will somehow elicit positive feelings towards</v>

259
00:16:31.811 --> 00:16:36.811
Randy even several minutes after experiencing the warmth of the cup and he has

260
00:16:37.211 --> 00:16:41.500
the killer question.
Would you give Randy permanent job

261
00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.150
<v 1>based on your belief and scratching or for India which you hired?</v>

262
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.980
Her last project manager seemed like a generally friendly guy,

263
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:55.340
so yeah,
I would say so.
Yeah.
We're not
sure.

264
00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:56.813
Yes.

265
00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:04.110
<v 2>Saying warm and friendly things about a stranger might just be the normal polite</v>

266
00:17:04.111 --> 00:17:07.380
response time to cool things down

267
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:14.770
<v 1>except for the</v>

268
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.710
<v 2>temperature of the drink.
Identical conditions.</v>

269
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.870
The same conversation with Randy,

270
00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:28.820
<v 1>not risky and six minutes later the same questions from Lawrence.</v>

271
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.300
Based on your a brief interaction with coaching,

272
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.450
you recommend him or would you hire Randy as project manager

273
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.210
as a leader?
I'm not sure.
Based on the brief interaction,

274
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.300
no,
maybe not from the impression that I got.

275
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:50.400
The experiment

276
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.400
<v 2>shows remarkably that a brief encounter with a beverage could see you either</v>

277
00:17:55.471 --> 00:17:56.880
hired or fired.

278
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.970
It's a powerful effect and one that might have worrying applications

279
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:10.790
<v 5>and the case of say a consumer products I'm feeling warm about a product</v>

280
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.400
presumably will make you more likely to buy it.

281
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.280
I'm feeling warm about a spokesperson may make you be more likely to listen to

282
00:18:17.281 --> 00:18:18.910
that person and trust their judgment.

283
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.470
So the web politicians handing your cups of coffee,
right?
Essentially.

284
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.430
Essentially,
yes.

285
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.371
<v 3>People say,</v>

286
00:18:24.371 --> 00:18:27.370
how can you get these effects with such a rinky dink little manipulations and

287
00:18:27.371 --> 00:18:31.420
moving people's behavior all over the place.
And we also,

288
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.900
where you get a little defensive when we hear that,
and I don't know,

289
00:18:34.901 --> 00:18:39.010
it just keeps working.
We do these things and they work and that's,
you know,

290
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.510
sorry.
But they do.

291
00:18:40.511 --> 00:18:44.560
And now our job is to understand and try to explain to people why that is.

292
00:18:44.561 --> 00:18:47.740
Why does the human mind is constructed in a way that you can get these effects

293
00:18:47.741 --> 00:18:48.574
at all?

294
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.850
<v 0>So I'm going to walk you through just a couple of other examples of these</v>

295
00:18:53.851 --> 00:18:57.330
powerful studies that have done primarily by doctor John Barge.

296
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.560
This one looking at the way in which we can unconsciously regulate our emotions.

297
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.740
So this study is called keeping one's distance,

298
00:19:04.741 --> 00:19:08.700
the influence of spacial distance cues on an effect and evaluation.

299
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.200
So in this study,

300
00:19:10.201 --> 00:19:14.550
participants were randomly assigned to simply plot points on a Cartesian grid

301
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:18.900
here,
either points that were close together,
intermediate,

302
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.820
or far apart.
And in other words,
within the frame of this Cartesian plane,

303
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:28.560
the points used in this study were manipulating people's physical sense of

304
00:19:28.561 --> 00:19:31.890
either being physically close or physically far away.

305
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.340
After simply pop plotting points on a graph,

306
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:39.330
participants were asked to read a book passage and answer some questions that

307
00:19:39.331 --> 00:19:43.290
assess the extent to which they enjoyed or liked the excerpt.

308
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:48.330
And what they found in the study quite powerfully is that simply manipulating

309
00:19:48.331 --> 00:19:49.470
physical distance,

310
00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:54.030
radically shift people's self reported enjoyment levels.

311
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.140
So those who plotted two points that were closer together.
Um,

312
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:01.940
if you see here,
um,
that they actually,
um,

313
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.300
it influenced the degree to which they reported self reported enjoyment here.

314
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:11.550
So the mere activation of physical distance concepts of near versus far without

315
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:16.380
any explicit reference to the self or social concepts is sufficient to influence

316
00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:21.381
people's evaluations and emotions in terms of how much they actually enjoy

317
00:20:21.781 --> 00:20:25.200
something powerfully enough.
Um,
so in other words,

318
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.740
people primed with a spacial distance condition on the right,

319
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.820
enjoyed the excerpt more than those prime to spacial closeness and the

320
00:20:32.821 --> 00:20:37.350
intermediate condition.
Lastly,
but not least,

321
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.090
I'm a recent study,
looked at this,
um,

322
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:44.130
by looking at what they called the substitute substitutability of physical and

323
00:20:44.131 --> 00:20:46.500
social warmth in everyday life.

324
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:51.390
So here what they did is they had people fill out questionnaire measures of self

325
00:20:51.391 --> 00:20:52.690
self-reported loneliness.

326
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:57.070
Afterwards they filled out questionnaires that ask them the frequency in which

327
00:20:57.071 --> 00:21:00.070
they took either warm or cold showers or baths.

328
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.230
And what they found here,

329
00:21:02.231 --> 00:21:06.370
if you look at the relationship between loneliness and the tendency to take warm

330
00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:07.204
showers,

331
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.110
is that they found that those people who are higher in self reported loneliness

332
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.220
were actually associated with an increased tendency to take warm showers or

333
00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:18.970
baths.
So in a sense,
it seems that people who are feeling lonely,

334
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:23.890
sort of emotionally cold may unconsciously try to regulate this sense of

335
00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:26.590
emotional coldness through physical warmth,

336
00:21:26.591 --> 00:21:29.350
by taking a warmer shower or warmer bath.

337
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:35.040
And they've also replicated this in coldness manipulations that make people feel

338
00:21:35.381 --> 00:21:36.220
lonelier as well.

339
00:21:36.221 --> 00:21:40.630
So in some ways mean we may be trying to unconsciously regulate our emotions in

340
00:21:40.631 --> 00:21:44.140
ways that we have no idea were even doing in our everyday life.

341
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.870
Um,
and this has gained a lot,

342
00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:49.810
this particular study gained a lot of widespread media attention.

343
00:21:49.811 --> 00:21:53.560
So feeling lonely,
take a warm bath.
Um,
in other words,

344
00:21:53.561 --> 00:21:57.550
this idea of really looking at unconscious forces on our emotions,

345
00:21:57.551 --> 00:22:00.430
our social preferences,
how we regulate our emotions.

346
00:22:00.431 --> 00:22:04.210
It's something that seems to capture a lot of excitement and a lot of attention

347
00:22:04.211 --> 00:22:05.770
from the general public as well.

348
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.880
So now I want to conclude with our takeaway questions.

349
00:22:09.881 --> 00:22:13.990
We've talked about the origins of unconscious emotions,
recent priming studies.

350
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.900
So what are some of the important points to take away from today?

351
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:19.383
First,

352
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:24.040
what did early theorists such as Freud and young posit about the role of the

353
00:22:24.041 --> 00:22:27.670
unconscious in emotional life?
Second,

354
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.990
what did early studies on subliminal priming reveal about the nature of

355
00:22:31.991 --> 00:22:34.780
unconscious emotion?
And finally,

356
00:22:34.781 --> 00:22:38.560
can you describe several experimental studies that we recently discussed towards

357
00:22:38.561 --> 00:22:41.860
the end of lecture today about priming on emotion,

358
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.850
emotion regulation,
and social perceptions of others.

359
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:51.040
And now we'll turn to our expert interview as part of the experts and emotion

360
00:22:51.041 --> 00:22:52.030
interview series.

361
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.100
Today we'll be speaking with doctor John Barge from Yale University on

362
00:22:57.101 --> 00:22:58.420
unconscious emotion.

363
00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:02.560
Dr Barge received his phd at the University of Michigan and is currently a

364
00:23:02.561 --> 00:23:06.700
professor at Yale University where he directs the automaticity and cognition,

365
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.970
motivation and evaluation or acne laboratory.

366
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.980
Dr Barges work focuses on automaticity and unconscious processing as a method to

367
00:23:14.981 --> 00:23:19.150
better understand social behavior as well as philosophical topics such as

368
00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.043
freewill.

369
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:24.700
Much of doctor barges work investigates whether behavior is thought to be under

370
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:29.620
volitional control,
may actually result from more automatic interpretations of,

371
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.640
as well as reactions to external stimuli such as words.

372
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.620
He's received numerous awards for his achievements as well as discussion and top

373
00:23:38.621 --> 00:23:40.090
tier media outlets.

374
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:44.530
So I now turn to a very special experts and emotion interview with my colleague,

375
00:23:44.531 --> 00:23:45.680
Doctor Barge.
