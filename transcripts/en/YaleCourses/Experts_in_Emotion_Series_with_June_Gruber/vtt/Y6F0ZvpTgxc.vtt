00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.920
Hi,
welcome to human emotion.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.210
Today we're going to look at the question of how do emotions shape our everyday

3
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:07.044
choices?

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.330
This is our third series on judgment and decision making where we'll look at

5
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:16.860
emotion and choice and answer the question just alluded to of do our feelings

6
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:20.430
actually shape the way we make choices in everyday life?

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.350
So here's a quote that I'd like to read with you.
It says,

8
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.510
the capacity of the human mind for formulating and solving complex problems is

9
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:33.270
very small compared with the size of the problems.

10
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.740
Who solution is required for objectively rational behavior in the real world.

11
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.120
So this was a coat by Herbert Simon who won the 1978 Nobel prize in economics.

12
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.980
And I want to now think about,
when we think about the rational human mind,

13
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:50.520
how does this relate to the way we make choices,
risk taking,

14
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.820
and the following and our roadmap today.
And in particular,

15
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:57.210
we'll look at the role of emotion and how it shapes the way we make choices.

16
00:00:57.211 --> 00:00:58.380
How does emotion a shape,

17
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.160
shape the kinds of risks we're willing to take as well as those who are not?

18
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.330
So let's start with this concept of making choices and Kenora.

19
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.740
Emotions actually shape the choices we make.

20
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.390
So first I want to begin with the question of,
um,
are,

21
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.320
is choosing always rational?
So economist assume that humans are rational,
right?

22
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.100
They put human beings in the equation and they say,
okay,

23
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.540
well the steps and rational decision making the human should follow should be as

24
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:28.290
follows.
You clearly define a problem,
you gather the relevant information,

25
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:32.100
including alternatives.
You identify the evaluation criteria,

26
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.570
you weight the criteria against giving goals,
evaluate alternative,

27
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.410
uh,

28
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.100
each alternative on each criterion and select an alternative that may maximize

29
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:44.460
this criteria.
But if you put human beings in the equation,

30
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.470
are they always following these rational decision making steps?
And if not,

31
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:53.340
why?
So what we find is there's,
on the one hand,

32
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:57.540
the rational model assumptions that we kind of went through earlier that include

33
00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:01.650
considering alternatives and comparing their probable outcomes using absolute

34
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:04.950
standards and factual information and really systematically,

35
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:08.880
always evaluating alternatives simultaneously.
And when we're making choices,

36
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:10.470
choose the one with the higher payoff.

37
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.240
But what we find is that real life decision making is not always rational,
right?

38
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.070
And real life organizational evidence suggests that instead on this right hand

39
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:24.060
column,
we see that we have limited information processing,
cap capabilities,

40
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.290
and often we only consider a small set of alternatives.
Instead,

41
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:29.730
we have an implicit favorite.

42
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.570
And so we processed facts in different ways and we evaluate alternative

43
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:38.970
sequentially and often just choose the one that seems to be good enough.

44
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.800
So we don't seem to always operate in these rational ways and we make choices or

45
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:44.730
make decisions.

46
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.070
So it seems that the rational model assumptions may not be correct.

47
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.340
And let's start here with this concept that my have aluminate this,

48
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:55.320
which is the paradox of choice,
right?

49
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.350
So we know that when people are offered to many investment options for their

50
00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:02.380
savings,
they have difficulty choosing,
right?

51
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.560
And choosing and often wind up not saving at all.

52
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.150
So here's an example from the paradox of choice that you find that when people

53
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.030
are given a set of 24 jars of jam,

54
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.690
only 60% will actually approach and only 3% will actually buy any of these jars.

55
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.520
Whereas if they are sampling from a smaller size,

56
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:25.960
you can see here in the picture of only six set of jams,
40% approach,

57
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:30.040
but 30% by,
right?
So it's almost as if when we have fewer choices,

58
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.280
we're more likely to actually choose to buy something.

59
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.410
This seems a bit paradoxical,
right?

60
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.620
And it doesn't seem to fall this rational model of decision making.

61
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.880
So people think that there's these different processing systems we have for

62
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:43.840
making choices.

63
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.050
And I'll walk through these right now and I want you to think about which of

64
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:51.880
these two systems might be most heavily influenced by our own emotions.

65
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.280
So this has really worked,

66
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:57.700
that was laid out by Daniel Kahneman who laid out what he talked about as a

67
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:58.511
system one,

68
00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:02.620
which is a more intuitive system versus system two that's more effortful

69
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:03.730
thinking he would say.

70
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.170
So let's go through a few examples here to eliminate the system one versus

71
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:09.340
system two distinction.

72
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.700
So here's a question I want you to consider a ball and a bat costs $1 and 10

73
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.720
cents in total,
the bat costs $1 more than the ball.

74
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.320
So how much does the ball cost?
Think about it for a second.

75
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.220
Okay.
What we find is that when people answer really correctly,
um,

76
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:32.290
the intuitive system,
they'll say 10 cents.

77
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.620
But if people sort of think more deliberately,
uh,

78
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.440
we know that the correct answer is actually a dollar,
right?

79
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:42.700
5 cents plus a dollar oh five.
Let's go through another example.

80
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.370
It takes five machines,

81
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.700
five minutes to make five widgets.

82
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.800
So how long will it take a hundred machines to make 100 widgets?

83
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.263
All right,
go.

84
00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:58.643
<v 1>Okay,</v>

85
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.110
<v 0>how many of you answered the intuitive answer,</v>

86
00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:05.400
which is a hundred minutes versus the correct answer,
which goes,

87
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.900
each machine takes five minutes to make a widget.
So in five minutes,

88
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.540
a hundred machines will make a hundred widgets.

89
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.710
So we're seeing this kind of distinction between these two systems already,

90
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.000
the intuitive system and what might be the more effortful system leading to a

91
00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:24.750
correct answer.
Finally,
here's the last question.

92
00:05:24.751 --> 00:05:28.320
So in a lake there was a patch of lily pads.

93
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.230
The patch doubles in size every day.

94
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.000
If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake,

95
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.250
how long would it take for the patch to cover half the lake?
All right,

96
00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:43.410
go.
What would you guess how many days?

97
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.310
The intuitive answer many people often give is 24 days.

98
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.260
While the correct more deliberative are effortful answer is actually 47 days.

99
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.750
So again,
this is this distinction between our system one,

100
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:03.650
which is an intuitive system and system to a more effortful system.

101
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.970
So,
um,

102
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.090
the point here is that you're most likely to be affected by framing when you're

103
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:14.270
in a system one mode.
So let's go through this other example here.

104
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.690
So imagine that the United States is preparing for that for it.

105
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.840
An outbreak of an unusual disease that is expected to kill 600 people to

106
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:26.450
alternative programs have been proposed.

107
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.490
Assume that the exact scientific estimates of the consequences of the programs

108
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:35.360
are as follows,
program c 400 people will die.

109
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.110
Program d there's a one third probability that no one will die and a two thirds

110
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:44.630
probability that 600 people will die.

111
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.950
So people are often asked which program do you prefer?
And as I said earlier,

112
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.760
the point is that you're often affected by the framing of these programs,
right?

113
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:55.790
When you're in a system,
one intuitive mode.
And it actually,

114
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:59.300
these two programs are objective Lee the same.
However,

115
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:02.240
changing to a loss frame,
uh,

116
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.750
dramatically shifts preferences towards risk seeking behavior.

117
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.010
So people are typically risk averse when it comes to gains and risk seeking when

118
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:11.210
it comes to losses.

119
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.110
So you can see here if you frame them differently,
how does the change,

120
00:07:16.111 --> 00:07:20.100
what kind of program you want to pick programs see now says 200 people will be

121
00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:21.870
saved,
right?
So again,

122
00:07:21.871 --> 00:07:26.250
changing it now to a gain frame dramatically may shift your preference towards

123
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.680
which of the programs you're likely to prefer.

124
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.530
So when we think about emotions,

125
00:07:32.531 --> 00:07:35.560
we know that strong emotions seem to promote more system.

126
00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:38.110
One thinking and decision making.

127
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:42.070
So this accounts for things such as framing effects,
sunk costs,

128
00:07:42.071 --> 00:07:47.020
escalation of commitment,
auction,
fevers and leadership,
decision making studies.

129
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.130
Right.
Um,

130
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.710
so interestingly what we're seeing is that s really fascinatingly,

131
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:57.730
our emotions seem to promote this more automatic and intuitive kind of decision

132
00:07:57.731 --> 00:08:01.030
making and influences the kinds of choices that we're making.

133
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.110
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

134
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.650
<v 0>So we've talked a little bit about making choices in this distinction between</v>

135
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:11.340
system one more intuitive and system to more sort of effortful,
uh,

136
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.080
types of processing information and ways of making decisions when it comes to

137
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:19.100
symbol sort of calculations on a cognitive reflection task as well as more

138
00:08:19.101 --> 00:08:19.980
important decision.

139
00:08:19.981 --> 00:08:23.150
So when it comes to which kind of program are you going to evaluate and choose

140
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:28.440
when it comes to saving lives,
how does it then influence risk taking me?

141
00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:29.600
We alluded to this a little,

142
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.930
but let's delve into this a bit more and thinking about how does emotion shape

143
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:36.410
choices such as the kinds of risks we're willing to take versus those that were

144
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:39.350
more aversive towards?
So I think about risk taking.

145
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:42.980
One of the studies that has often gain a lot of attention here comes to sexual

146
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:43.814
risk taking.

147
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:48.050
So this is a study by Dan Arielli and colleagues called the the heat of the

148
00:08:48.051 --> 00:08:51.770
moment,
the effect of sexual arousal on sexual decision making.

149
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.900
So his abstract reads,

150
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.600
despite the social of decisions taken in the heat of the moment,

151
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.460
very little research has actually examined the effect of sexual arousal on

152
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:04.110
judgment and decision making.

153
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:09.350
So here we examine the effect of sexual arousal induced by self stimulation on

154
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:13.290
judgments and hypothetical decisions made by male college students.

155
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.750
So let me walk you through his provocative study.

156
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.920
So here you had male participants enter the lab and they were signed to one of

157
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:22.200
two conditions on either the top or bottom row.

158
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.970
So one was a self stimulation condition.

159
00:09:24.971 --> 00:09:29.400
So they were assigned to that condition of the masturbation or a neutral state

160
00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:34.200
where they literally did nothing.
Then they were given images,
sort of of sexual,

161
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:35.310
have a sexual nature.

162
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.690
And after asked to answer questions indicating how appealing they found a range

163
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:44.520
of sexual stimuli and activities,
both visual and written questionnaires.

164
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.180
Finally at the end.
And here's what's really interesting.

165
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.800
They describe their willingness to engage in a unsafe sex.

166
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:55.340
So this is the risk taking willingness box you see here at the,

167
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.780
see here at the far right when they're aroused.

168
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.000
And the results are really fascinating.

169
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:03.780
So you see that increased sexual arousal in the moment.

170
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.920
So this is our self stimulation condition when compared to a neutral condition,

171
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:11.460
a pack impacts profound areas of judgment and decision making.

172
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.480
So the heat of the moment really seems to change the kinds of risks that we're

173
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:16.201
willing to take.

174
00:10:16.201 --> 00:10:20.040
So you ratchet up the emotional arousal in the sexual domain and we'll be more

175
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:23.990
likely to take all kinds of risks.
So you can see here,
for example,
um,

176
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.440
higher scores in the aroused or self submit stimulation condition compared to

177
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:31.440
the neutral condition across a whole range of questions,
right?

178
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.060
So you can see the different scores here.

179
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.090
So people who are in this more sort of heat of the moment aroused state,
um,

180
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.150
rate higher on items such as,

181
00:10:39.151 --> 00:10:42.870
can you imagine having sex with someone who was extremely fat?

182
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:45.060
Can you enjoy having sex with someone who hated?

183
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.220
Is the smell of cigarette smoke arousing?
Um,

184
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.300
would it be fun to type your sexual partner?

185
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:55.320
Do you prefer to kiss and have sex with the light on or is kissing frustrating?

186
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.390
So there's a range of questions here.

187
00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:01.740
And then what gets really interesting are these more risk taking questions.

188
00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:02.071
Again,

189
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:06.570
we're seeing individuals who are induced into a state of sexual arousal or more

190
00:11:06.571 --> 00:11:10.260
likely to do things such as,
um,
apply pressure sexually.

191
00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:14.280
So would you keep trying to have sex after your date?
Said No.
You know,

192
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:17.580
would you slip a woman a drug to increase the chance that she would have sex

193
00:11:17.581 --> 00:11:18.390
with you?

194
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:22.260
So they're more likely to engage in sort of sexual curse of behavior as well as

195
00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:26.880
more likely to take risks,
taking choices when it comes to safe sexual practice.

196
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.950
So they would say endorse,
you know,
um,
for example,
um,
let's see,

197
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:36.420
uh,
a condom decreases sexual pleasure.
They would agree more with that.

198
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.030
I'm a condom interferes with sexual spontaneity.

199
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.530
They wouldn't agree with that too.

200
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.070
Would you use a condom even if you are afraid that a woman might change your

201
00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:46.230
mind while you went to get it?
Right.

202
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.460
So they're more likely to both apply sexually Carson the pressure and they're

203
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:55.461
more likely to endorse questions are associated with unsafe sexual practices.

204
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.710
So we know that emotional arousal specially in the sexual domain,

205
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.550
we'll actually profoundly influenced the kinds of decisions people make when it

206
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:07.960
comes to important social,
um,
and sexual practice related behaviors.

207
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.850
So what about emotional valence and other kinds of risk taking behaviors outside

208
00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:16.270
of the sexual domain?
So we know just broadly speaking,

209
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:21.271
that positive or happy faces actually make us more likely to take risks and

210
00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:25.060
negative and angry faces make us least likely to take risks.

211
00:12:25.061 --> 00:12:28.270
So there's something about the positive valence domain generally,

212
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:30.580
and specifically with respect to sexual arousal,

213
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.240
that increases our likelihood of wanting to just take risks and go for it.

214
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.870
It's almost as if positive emotions release our emotional breaks.

215
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.700
Thinking about our earlier lecture,
you know,

216
00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:43.180
we've talked about emotional breaks in the domain of emotion regulation as well

217
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:45.180
as in the domain of adolescents.
Um,

218
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.060
and that positive emotions really seemed to just release these inhibitory
breaks,

219
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.530
whereas negative emotions,

220
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:54.190
maybe it actually seemed to help us apply inhibitory breaks and make us less

221
00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:56.710
likely to engage in risk taking behaviors.

222
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.710
So now with our brief introduction we've had today to decision making and choice

223
00:13:02.711 --> 00:13:05.830
selection as well as risk taking and the role that emotion plays.

224
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.050
We're going to turn to our takeaway questions.

225
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.080
So first question asks,

226
00:13:13.081 --> 00:13:17.310
how do rational model assumptions versus organizational evidence differ in the

227
00:13:17.311 --> 00:13:19.320
approach to human decision making?

228
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:20.570
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

229
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.403
<v 0>Second,</v>

230
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:25.310
can you describe this distinction we talked about today between system one and

231
00:13:25.311 --> 00:13:29.720
system two processing and which of these two systems as emotions seem to most

232
00:13:29.721 --> 00:13:33.500
heavily impact or influence?
And finally,

233
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:38.420
how do emotional arousal and emotional valence influence risk taking?
Uh,

234
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.380
both the general variety and have a specific kind of variety related to sexual

235
00:13:42.381 --> 00:13:45.650
behavior and sexually safe practices that we talked about today.

236
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:47.370
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

237
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.810
<v 0>So now with our takeaway questions,</v>

238
00:13:48.811 --> 00:13:52.410
I want to turn to our expert interview to conclude our lecture for today.

239
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.500
So this is part of the experts in emotion interview series.

240
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.210
We'll have to cut that out later.

241
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.300
So today for our experts in emotion interview series,

242
00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:08.140
we'll be speaking with Dr. Michael Norton on consumerism and emotion.

243
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.280
So Dr. Norton is an associate professor of business administration and the

244
00:14:12.281 --> 00:14:15.940
marketing unit and a Marvin Bower fellow at the Harvard Business School.

245
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:20.050
He holds a BA in psychology and English from Williams college and a phd in

246
00:14:20.051 --> 00:14:21.940
psychology from Princeton University.

247
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.440
Prior to joining the Harvard Business School Pr,

248
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:29.290
Dr. Norton was a fellow at the MIT media lab at Mit Sloan School of management.

249
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:34.330
He's the coauthor along with Elizabeth Dunn of the Book Happy Money.

250
00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.070
The signs of smarter spending.

251
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.240
His work has been published in a number of leading academic journals including

252
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:44.260
science,
the Journal of personality and social psychology,
Psychological Science,

253
00:14:44.261 --> 00:14:45.790
and the Journal of consumer research.

254
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.270
His work has also been covered in media outlets including the economist,

255
00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:52.340
the Financial Times,
the Wall Street,
and the Washington Post.

256
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.390
Dr. Norton has also appeared on the national public radio and written op eds for

257
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:59.150
the New York Times,
Forbes and the Los Angeles Times.

258
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.930
His research has twice been featured in the New York Times magazine year in

259
00:15:02.931 --> 00:15:07.400
ideas issue in 2007 for his work on ambiguity,
promoting liking.

260
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.770
And in 2009 on the counterfeit self,

261
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.010
his the Ikea effect when Labor leads to love was featured in Harvard Business

262
00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.010
Review's breakthrough ideas.

263
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:21.040
In 2009 in 2010 he won the theoretical innovation prize from the Society of

264
00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:23.150
personality and social psychology.

265
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.410
In 2011 he wanted the sage young scholars award from the foundation for social

266
00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:28.850
and personality psychology.

267
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:33.980
And in 2012 he was selected for wired magazine's smart list as one of the 50

268
00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:35.630
people who will change the world.

269
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.100
So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Dr. Michael Norton on

270
00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:41.630
consumerism and emotion.
