1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.780
So,
hi,
welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.890
So as we spoke about in our last lecture about emotion regulation,

3
00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:11.000
we've seen that some people seem to have full regulatory control over their

4
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.890
emotions as you can see on the left,

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.570
whereas others seem to have literally almost no control over their emotions

6
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:19.330
whatsoever.
Um,

7
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.510
and the question that we've been trying to ask is precisely how and when are

8
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:27.920
people able to really take these reigns over their emotions and what does it

9
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:29.000
mean to do this?

10
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.440
So today we're going to follow up and our second module and emotion regulation

11
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.360
by turning to what is the empirical evidence behind emotion regulation to date.

12
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.630
So what does the scientific data actually say about whether or not we can indeed

13
00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:45.050
control our feelings?

14
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.600
So what we're gonna do today with our roadmap is first cover the evidence on

15
00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:54.860
emotion regulation followed by takeaway questions and an expert interview.

16
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.480
So I want to briefly refresh ourselves from last lecture on what the definition

17
00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:03.380
of emotion regulation was.
So again,
as defined by James Gross,

18
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.390
he said that emotion regulation encompasses the processes by which individuals

19
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:12.170
influence which emotions they have,
when they have them,

20
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.100
and how they experience and express their emotions.

21
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.591
And again,

22
00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:22.040
this is the process model of emotion regulation that we covered in the last

23
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:22.371
lecture,

24
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:26.300
which really goes through a series of strategies and rough temporal sequence

25
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.210
that suggests when and how people manage their emotions with particular

26
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.440
attention given to strategies such as situation modification or selection,

27
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.700
attentional deployment,
cognitive reappraisal and suppression.

28
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.950
And again,
this is a recursive model.

29
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:48.951
So any one type of emotion response here can then generate an entirely new type

30
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:53.280
of emotional experience,
which then itself would be subsequently regulated.

31
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.310
So it's important when we talk about emotion regulation as we move forward to

32
00:01:58.311 --> 00:02:03.311
differentiated among three related overlapping but distinct concepts constructs.

33
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.960
So the first,

34
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.470
when we think about emotion regulation is to differentiate it from what's called

35
00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:14.420
coping.
So coping is distinguished from emotion regulation in so far as coping,

36
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:19.130
mostly focuses on decreasing negative emotion and covers a much longer time

37
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:22.910
periods such as coping with bereavement after the death of a loved one.

38
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.770
Emotion regulation is also distinct from mood regulation.

39
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:32.120
So as we discussed earlier in our course,
moods and emotions are distinct.

40
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.590
Moods are typically have a longer duration and don't often have behavioral or

41
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.110
behavioral or physiological signatures.

42
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.030
So hence mood regulation focuses on a longer term state and more specifically

43
00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:47.000
the experiential or subjective component of emotion.

44
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:51.380
Whereas emotion regulation covers also behavioral and physiological response

45
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:53.960
domains.
Finally,

46
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.980
emotion regulation is distinct from what are called psychological defenses that

47
00:02:57.981 --> 00:02:58.670
originated.

48
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.190
It originated in the Floridian literature and usually focused on the regulation

49
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:08.080
of aggressive or sexual impulses solely or as emotion regulation goes much

50
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:12.760
broader than simply these impulses and defenses are also usually unconscious.

51
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:17.050
Whereas emotion regulation can also be actively conscious as well.

52
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.840
So what I want to do now is think about what is the evidence to date on distinct

53
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:26.680
kinds of what we call emotion regulation.
Strategies are different,
uh,

54
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.010
tactics by which we can flexibly maneuver our emotions,

55
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:33.550
either up or down and either more positive or more negative.

56
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.540
So one commonly used strategy that's gained a lot of scientific data has been

57
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:44.350
called cognitive reappraisal and cognitive reappraisal that we saw on our

58
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:49.351
process model was defined as construing an emotion eliciting situation in a way

59
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:53.050
that alters its emotional impact.
And indeed,

60
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:57.010
this is a form of cognitive change that's been common to many existing cognitive

61
00:03:57.011 --> 00:04:02.011
behavioral or CBT interventions for disorders ranging from depression to anxiety

62
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.550
to bipolar disorder.

63
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.050
And we've seen empirical evidence from James Gross and colleagues suggest that

64
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:12.730
cognitive reappraisal is actually associated with reductions in both negative

65
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:16.180
emotion and reductions and physiological arousal,

66
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.310
which has led it to be really esteemed as one of the most putatively adaptive

67
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.660
emotion regulation strategies studied to date.
So this is cognitive reappraisal.

68
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.040
Um,

69
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.610
I want to show you what this looks like in the context of an experimental study.

70
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.630
So participants who come into the lab,
we'll often be asked to watch emotion,

71
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.950
eliciting film clips.

72
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.430
And here's the kinds of instructions they will receive when trying to

73
00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:41.410
cognitively reappraise.
The response.

74
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.420
So this is from James Grossest studies where participants come in and read the

75
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:49.810
following instructions.
So you'll be viewing a short film clip.

76
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.250
Please try to adopt a detached and unemotional attitude as you watch the film.

77
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.620
In other words,
as you watch the film,

78
00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.850
try to think about what you are seeing objectively in terms of the technical

79
00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:04.930
aspects of the events you observe.
Watch the film clip carefully,

80
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:09.730
but please try to think about what you are seeing so you don't feel anything at

81
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:10.564
all.

82
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.100
And so the second strategy would be behavioral suppression.

83
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.630
So this is a strategy that's been defined as attempting to suppress or inhibit

84
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.540
outward displays of emotion,
as we spoke about earlier.

85
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.110
And it's also something that is less common in a existing CBT interventions.

86
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.650
And it's actually by contrast associated with increased physiological responses.

87
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.230
So this is behavioral suppression.
So again,

88
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:42.220
an experimental studies when you try to experiments,
he manipulates suppression.

89
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.620
The instructions would be as follows.
Again,

90
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:47.770
this is borrowing from James grosses experimental paradigms.

91
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.230
So it would be different from reappraisal.

92
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:52.180
And so far as the instructions would read,

93
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.290
you'll be viewing a short film clip if you have any feelings as you watch the

94
00:05:56.291 --> 00:06:00.050
film clip,
please try your best not to let those feelings show.

95
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.401
In other words,

96
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:06.080
as you watch the film clip tried to behave in such a way that a person watching

97
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:08.840
you would not know you were feeling anything.

98
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.090
So watch the film clip carefully,

99
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:15.320
but please try to behave so that someone watching you would not know that you

100
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:17.420
were feeling anything at all.

101
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

102
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:19.780
<v 0>And finally,</v>

103
00:06:19.781 --> 00:06:23.740
these are often contrasted both reappraisal and suppression with the control

104
00:06:23.741 --> 00:06:26.290
condition,
which is simply called watch.

105
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.060
So participants would simply be asked to view a short film film clip and watch

106
00:06:31.061 --> 00:06:35.710
the film clip carefully.
So this would look something as follows,

107
00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:39.250
if we were doing experimental study on reappraisal and suppression as compared

108
00:06:39.251 --> 00:06:40.510
to a control condition.

109
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.730
So participants would come into a lab and acclimate as part of a resting

110
00:06:45.731 --> 00:06:47.980
baseline.
Subsequently,

111
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.360
they would be asked to simply engage in what watching an emotional film.

112
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.350
And they could either watch the film and let their emotions naturally arise.

113
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.060
Cogley tried to reappraise the film by adopting a detached and unemotional

114
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.720
attitude or suppress.
So try to,

115
00:07:03.721 --> 00:07:08.350
it behaviourally inhibit the responses and so that no one could see what their

116
00:07:08.351 --> 00:07:13.090
outward expressive displays where this would be followed by watching either a

117
00:07:13.091 --> 00:07:17.620
positive film clip,
a negative film clip,
or a neutral film clip.

118
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.040
And subsequently you would measure emotional responding across subjective effect

119
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.220
of components,
behavioral displays,
and physiological responses.

120
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:29.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

121
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.030
<v 0>Okay.
So what are the consequences of engaging in different kinds of emotion</v>

122
00:07:33.031 --> 00:07:35.610
regulation strategies such as those that we talked about today?

123
00:07:35.611 --> 00:07:39.750
Primarily suppression reappraisal as compared to a control condition where

124
00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:42.450
people simply that their emotions arise as they would.

125
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.070
So the short term consequences that have arisen out of laboratory studies

126
00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:51.570
conducted by both James Gross and his colleague Bob Levenson looked something

127
00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:55.680
like this.
So they found that when it came to subjective experience,

128
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.530
when people try to behave really suppress their emotions,

129
00:07:58.531 --> 00:08:03.510
what you found is that suppression either decreased emotion or had no effect at

130
00:08:03.511 --> 00:08:04.344
all,

131
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:09.240
and reappraisal decreased both positive and negative emotion intensity.

132
00:08:09.241 --> 00:08:11.400
So reappraisal seem to be most powerful,

133
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.070
decreasing emotion intensity across the board.

134
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.420
Whereas suppression seem to decrease positive but had no change on negative

135
00:08:18.421 --> 00:08:22.050
emotion when it came to outward displays of behavior.

136
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.940
Not Surprising the suppression,

137
00:08:23.941 --> 00:08:27.810
the instructions inherently asks you to inhibit your outward displays,

138
00:08:27.811 --> 00:08:28.320
the behavior.

139
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.000
So we see that suppression is associated with reductions in behavioral displays

140
00:08:33.001 --> 00:08:33.834
of emotion,

141
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.190
whereas reappraisal is also associated with reductions in behavioral displays of

142
00:08:38.191 --> 00:08:41.430
emotion.
And again,
these are in contrast with the watch condition.

143
00:08:41.431 --> 00:08:45.210
So look compared to people's naturally unfolding emotion responses.

144
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.860
Now this bottom thing at the bottom row here and yellow physiology is one that I

145
00:08:49.861 --> 00:08:51.090
find the most interesting.

146
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:56.250
So while suppression actually does lead you to inhibit your displays of emotion

147
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:59.340
and shows maybe some reduction in emotion intensity,

148
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.920
what you see here with the plus sign indicates is that it's amplifying your

149
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.190
physiological responding.

150
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:09.450
So it's almost as if the more you try to inhibit the emotions you're showing in

151
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:14.300
your face,
the more they're sort of this,
um,
downstream almost.
Um,

152
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:19.260
I think of it as like a sort of bounce back effect where your autonomic system

153
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:20.280
just ratchets up.

154
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.570
So in a way suppression seems to be not wholly effective.

155
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.150
We're trying to not show what we're feeling but our,

156
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:31.590
but our bodies amping up physiologically heart rate,
skin conductance,

157
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.370
sort of the autonomic nervous system is counteracting that in response.

158
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.880
Whereas what you see with re reappraisal and why it's gained so much attention

159
00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:43.050
as a potentially punitive adaptive strategy is that it really seems to decrease

160
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:45.240
emotion intensity across the board.

161
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:49.800
So you see decreased motion experience behavior and physiological activation.

162
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.840
So this is a short term consequences.

163
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:56.430
This is in the context of the well defined experimental laboratory paradigm that

164
00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:59.340
we walked through.
What about longterm consequences?

165
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:03.720
What about people who tend to use these strategies such as suppression or

166
00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:08.220
reappraisal in everyday life?
What do they look like?
So this is some work that,

167
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.980
um,
well we'll go ratan that in a second actually.

168
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:13.920
So when we think about the longterm consequences,

169
00:10:13.921 --> 00:10:17.420
so this is work done by James Gross and other colleagues such as all of our
John,

170
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.970
uh,
among others is what we see.
And this is really interesting.

171
00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:25.560
So people who tend to self report engaging in cognitive reappraisal on an

172
00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:30.561
everyday basis have a wide variety of really adaptive longterm consequences.

173
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.970
So they have better social relationships,

174
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.660
they cope better with stress and they report more positive emotion.

175
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.680
Whereas those who engage in a more frequent basis and behavioral suppression

176
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.350
report feeling less authentic and social life,

177
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.910
they have poor coping strategies when trying to manage stress and they actually

178
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:51.750
tend to report less positive and more negative emotion.

179
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.690
So it seems that when we try to engage in behavioral suppression in Everyday

180
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.210
Thought,
it seems that we really,
um,

181
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.050
diminish our internal cognitive resources.

182
00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:04.200
We're not coping with stress as much and we're actually feeling like we're

183
00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:05.910
leaving an inauthentic life.

184
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.410
That's also manifest in terms of feeling less positive and more negative.
Again,

185
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:11.940
it seems to be that in the long run,

186
00:11:11.941 --> 00:11:16.500
cognitive reappraisal seems to be one of the most adaptive strategies,

187
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:20.790
at least compared to suppression.
So what about findings,

188
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:22.860
looking at emotion regulation in the brain?

189
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.450
So to what extent does the data suggests that we can actually regulate our

190
00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:30.930
emotions in ways that show distinct patterns of neural activity?

191
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.730
So this is work that's really been pioneered by Kevin Ochsner at Columbia

192
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.730
University and his tasks looked as follows.

193
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:43.731
So participants would view a stimulus or image like the one you see here and

194
00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:48.891
they would be asked to attend to their feelings by either trying to increase

195
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.650
their negative feelings or decreased their negative feelings.

196
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.170
So when we think about using reappraisal to increase negative emotions,

197
00:11:56.171 --> 00:12:00.460
they would be told to think about the image in a way that makes you feel more

198
00:12:00.461 --> 00:12:01.294
negative.

199
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:06.310
So an example when looking at this image might be to think she's in pain is week

200
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:08.350
of the heart may die soon.

201
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.730
The other condition is to use reappraisals to try to decrease negative emotion

202
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:13.270
intensity.

203
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:17.470
So to think about the image in a way that makes you feel less negative.

204
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.770
So you could also cognitively construe this image to say,
well,

205
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.570
she's just tired or annoyed.
She,
she's hardy and will be better soon.

206
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:30.520
So what do you find in the scanner when you ask people to do this?

207
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.480
So in the condition where people are asked to use reappraisal to increase

208
00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:35.950
negative emotion,
so again,

209
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.250
to sort of see the image and think either he or she is in pain,

210
00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:43.000
is week of the heart may die soon.
Will you actually see,

211
00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.770
and it's really fascinating,

212
00:12:44.771 --> 00:12:49.771
you see decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex and increased activity in

213
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:51.604
the Amygdala.

214
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.690
So what we're seeing is decreased activity in our cognitive control centers that

215
00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:59.680
are thought to be associated with successful regulatory control and increased

216
00:12:59.681 --> 00:13:03.460
activity in brain regions like the Amygdala that are associated with heightened

217
00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:07.660
emotion,
intensity and salience,
particularly for negative emotions.

218
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.430
By contrast,

219
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:12.700
and we think of reappraisal is a way to decrease negative emotion intensity.

220
00:13:12.701 --> 00:13:16.390
We might think that the woman or man in the photos just tired or annoyed,

221
00:13:16.391 --> 00:13:18.550
they're hardy bell be better soon.

222
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.960
And we see a very different pattern of finding.

223
00:13:20.961 --> 00:13:25.570
So we see instead that we see heightened activation in the and sort of cognitive

224
00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:30.550
control prefrontal regions such as the prefrontal cortex and decreased activity

225
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:31.384
in the Amygdala.

226
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.930
So what we're seeing is when we use your appraisal to decrease emotion
intensity,

227
00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:39.100
we're seeing heightened activation in these cognitive control regions associated

228
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:43.210
with successful emotion regulation and decrease intensity in these more sort of

229
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:47.920
subcortical regions associated with increased emotion,
intensity and salience.

230
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:53.190
So indeed reappraisal works to both ratchet up and ratchet down activity in both

231
00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:56.590
cognitive control regions and more,
um,

232
00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.620
subcortical emotion salient regions.

233
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.480
So another strategy that's been looked at in addition to reappraisal and

234
00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:07.060
suppression is what's been called cognitive distancing.

235
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.530
So this was work really sort of championed by Ethan Cross and when he talks

236
00:14:11.531 --> 00:14:15.550
about cognitive dissonance saying this is defined as the repetitive focus on the

237
00:14:15.551 --> 00:14:20.551
content causes and consequences of one's an affective or emotional state that is

238
00:14:20.981 --> 00:14:25.510
conducive to problem solving.
And this really involves kind of what he would say,

239
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.520
taking a third person perspective.

240
00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:32.020
So almost being a fly on the wall and taking what he would call a distance,

241
00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:33.880
why perspective.
Um,

242
00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.480
and what you find is that when people are able to sort of step back from their

243
00:14:37.481 --> 00:14:40.600
emotional situation,
take a third person perspective,

244
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.720
that it actually shows reductions and negative emotions.

245
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.830
And in our lab we found that taking a third person perspective actually also

246
00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.380
results in decreases in positive emotion intensity too.

247
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.640
So this cognitive distancing strategy really seems to be another effective

248
00:14:55.641 --> 00:15:00.530
regulatory tool to decrease emotion intensity.
So,
um,

249
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.550
I'm going to show you what this looks like in the laboratory.

250
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:07.220
In some studies we've done to try to experimentally study and elicit,
um,

251
00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:10.580
you know,
this cognitive regulation strategy called cognitive distancing.

252
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.410
So at the beginning of the experiment,

253
00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.900
people come in and there's a resting baseline.

254
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.660
Afterwards we had participants in arts task think,

255
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.880
listen to an audio recorded script asking them to recall a happy

256
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:24.590
autobiographical experience.

257
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.010
And once they had identified a salient positive memory,
they were in stock,

258
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:34.060
instructed to press the space bar on the computer keypad to continue afterwards

259
00:15:34.461 --> 00:15:35.960
using it within subjects design.

260
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:39.530
They were then asked to reflect on this same happy memory using either a

261
00:15:39.531 --> 00:15:41.170
cognitive distancing strategies.

262
00:15:41.171 --> 00:15:45.200
So trying to watch the event from a distance to adopt this third person

263
00:15:45.201 --> 00:15:46.910
perspective.
Um,

264
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:51.500
or they were asked to immerse in the memory and afterwards we got reports of an

265
00:15:51.501 --> 00:15:54.470
effect as well as physiological signatures of heart rate.

266
00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.940
So let me give you an example of what this cognitive dissonance in condition

267
00:15:58.941 --> 00:16:00.290
actually sounded like.

268
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:04.670
So participants again listened to a prerecorded audio script that I'll show you

269
00:16:04.671 --> 00:16:05.900
right now what it looks like.

270
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:12.160
Please go back to the time in place of the same happy venue earliest at you and

271
00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:14.580
see the side I emotion.

272
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.060
So they were taking place at the same people away from the situation earlier

273
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.400
applies from a,

274
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.850
just to take a few steps back as you do it in the situation to what is now

275
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.210
comment the disease.

276
00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:32.300
And as they did this to focus on what has now become the distant view and as

277
00:16:32.301 --> 00:16:36.500
they continue to watch the distant you to try to understand the emotions that

278
00:16:36.501 --> 00:16:39.440
the distance you experienced as the event unfolded.

279
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.840
Why did he or she had those feelings?

280
00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.660
What were the underlying causes and reasons.

281
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

282
00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:50.530
<v 0>So what we find when we look at evidence for this distance,
why strategy,</v>

283
00:16:50.531 --> 00:16:54.280
which has also been called reflective processing as compared to a more

284
00:16:54.281 --> 00:16:56.560
maladaptive strategy called rumination,

285
00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.190
is we see the consequences to be quite divergent.

286
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:04.270
So when people are simply mauling over and emotionally that are ruminating on
it,

287
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.780
we see increased negative effect,
increased positive affect,

288
00:17:07.781 --> 00:17:09.670
and greater physiological arousal.

289
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:14.020
So ruminating or mauling over the causes and consequences seems to sort of

290
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.310
amplify or ratchet up your emotion intensity.
By contrast,

291
00:17:18.311 --> 00:17:20.020
when engaging in this sort of distance,

292
00:17:20.021 --> 00:17:24.970
why are reflective processing by Ethan Kross and colleagues?

293
00:17:24.971 --> 00:17:28.630
We see decreased negative affect,
decreased positive effect,

294
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.670
and decreased physiological arousal.

295
00:17:30.671 --> 00:17:33.940
So by taking a third person perspective or simply stepping back,

296
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.720
it seems to really soothe or ease our emotion,
intensity,

297
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.850
whether it's positive or negative.

298
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.920
Now when we think about emotion regulation and think about psychopathology,

299
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.070
what are the ways in which emotion regulation may go awry?

300
00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.930
And we'll talk this later in the course when we get too emotional disorders.

301
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.590
But what are some clues about how emotion regulation goes awry and people

302
00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:59.550
suffering from mood disorders,
anxiety disorders,
schizophrenia,

303
00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:00.840
and even substance abuse.

304
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.170
So this is something we've been working actively in our lab to try to solve this

305
00:18:04.171 --> 00:18:05.004
puzzle of.

306
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:10.010
How exactly do individuals who suffer from these disorders show relative

307
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:13.770
difficulties or impairments when it comes to emotion regulation?

308
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:18.420
And so we've been really looking at this question here and really trying to

309
00:18:18.421 --> 00:18:22.650
tease apart what seems to be going on across a wide variety of disorders as a

310
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:27.300
sort of trans diagnostic theme is that many individuals suffering from emotional

311
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:30.690
disorders in particular in our lab,
we studied bipolar disorder,

312
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.680
seem to have difficulties in what we call emotion regulation achievement.

313
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:38.040
So this is the observable emotion regulation performance.

314
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:40.140
So when left to their own accords,

315
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.530
do they regulate successfully or spontaneously?

316
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:46.920
And it seems that many individuals do not do it on their own,

317
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.490
but when we bring them into the lab and run them through paradigms such as the

318
00:18:50.491 --> 00:18:51.570
ones I showed you today,

319
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:55.680
and cue them into which strategies to use and what context to use them,

320
00:18:55.681 --> 00:19:00.681
then it seems that they do indeed have this ability or capacity for successful

321
00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:03.000
emotion regulation performance.

322
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:06.960
It seems that such individuals with bipolar disorder,
major depression,

323
00:19:06.961 --> 00:19:10.560
social anxiety,
can regulate successfully.

324
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.880
So part of one of the mysteries of psychopathology and emotional disorders that

325
00:19:14.881 --> 00:19:19.110
we're really working on with other emotion regulation researchers such as James

326
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.090
Gross as well as Doug men,

327
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:24.630
is to tease apart how do we understand this discrepancy between why some

328
00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:27.330
individuals might not regulate successfully on their own,

329
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.080
but yet have the intact capacity or ability to do so.

330
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.440
So here we're really probing this puzzle of the chasm between having the ability

331
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.200
to regulate but not necessarily achieving successfully.

332
00:19:40.201 --> 00:19:43.890
And this is the puzzle we've been looking at in bipolar disorder,
in our work,

333
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:45.520
but that many other research,
right?

334
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.080
Researchers right now in emotion and psychopathology or trying to understand

335
00:19:49.081 --> 00:19:52.020
more trans diagnostically.
So with that,

336
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.960
I'm going to conclude with our takeaway questions and expert interview.

337
00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.450
So for our takeaway questions today,

338
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:00.570
the first one asks,

339
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.130
how is emotion regulation distinct from related constructs of coping,

340
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.820
mood regulation,
and defense's second,

341
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:13.500
what are the short and longterm health consequences of reappraisal and

342
00:20:13.501 --> 00:20:17.580
suppression and what about reflective versus ruminative processing?

343
00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:23.210
Finally,
what are the neural basis of emotion regulation discussed today

344
00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:25.751
and now?

345
00:20:25.751 --> 00:20:29.320
I turned to our expert interview as part of the experts in emotion interview

346
00:20:29.321 --> 00:20:33.580
series.
Today we'll be speaking with Dr Kevin Ochsner,

347
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:38.170
who's a professor of psychology at Columbia University on emotion regulation and

348
00:20:38.171 --> 00:20:39.004
the brain.

349
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:43.600
Doctor Ochsner received his phd in psychology from Harvard University where he

350
00:20:43.601 --> 00:20:46.600
also received postdoctoral training and social psychology.

351
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:51.430
He later received additional training in functional neuro imaging at Stanford

352
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.400
University where he subsequently held the position of a research scientist.

353
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.540
He's currently a professor of Psychology at Columbia University and director of

354
00:20:58.541 --> 00:21:01.690
the social cognitive and affective neuroscience laboratory.

355
00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:06.520
His lab studies the psychological and neuro processes involved in emotion,

356
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.480
self regulation,
person perception and their interactions.

357
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:14.050
He's received various awards for his research and teaching,

358
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.740
including the American Psychological Association's division three new

359
00:21:17.741 --> 00:21:21.370
investigator award.
They cognitive neuroscience societies,

360
00:21:21.371 --> 00:21:22.600
young investigator award,

361
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.710
and the Columbia University's Distinguished Faculty award.

362
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:30.670
So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Doctor Kevin Ochsner.
