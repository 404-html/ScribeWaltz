1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.990
Welcome back to human emotion.
Today we'll be,
uh,

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.210
entering our second component of emotion and cognition and today focusing on the

3
00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:12.100
concept of emotional intelligence.

4
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.640
And I'm particularly excited to have a very special guest lecture today,

5
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.570
a world renowned expert on the topic,
Dr Marc Brackett.

6
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.120
So our roadmap today on emotion cognition part two will go as follows.

7
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.300
We'll start with our guests lecture on emotional intelligence,

8
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.470
followed by takeaway questions corresponding to the guest lecture today and

9
00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:34.270
concluding with our expert interview.

10
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.100
So I'm going to start here by briefly introducing our special guest lecture

11
00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:42.310
today,
who's going to speak with us on emotional intelligence.

12
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.340
So today we have Dr Marc Brackett speaking with us.

13
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.030
Mark Brackett is the director of the Yale Center for emotional intelligence and

14
00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:53.140
he's also a research scientist in psychology and faculty fellow in the Edwards

15
00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:56.740
teglar center in child development and social policy at Yale University.

16
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.100
Dr Bracket is the author of 90 scholarly publications and the developer have to

17
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.540
university courses on emotional intelligence.

18
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.160
He's also the co creator of the ruler approach to social and emotional learning.

19
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.510
Um,
ruler fosters the development of social and emotional skills.

20
00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:16.540
And children from kindergarten through high school as well as school leaders,

21
00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:18.340
teachers,
staff,
and families.

22
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.760
Over 500,000 students in hundreds of schools throughout the world have benefited

23
00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:24.664
from ruler.

24
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.800
So I'm very excited today to have Dr Marc Brackett with us today to share his

25
00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:31.990
expertise on emotional intelligence.

26
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.020
<v 1>So the topic of my presentation is emotional intelligence.
And uh,
again,</v>

27
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:38.070
my name is Marc Brackett,

28
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.590
the director of the Yale Center for emotional intelligence.

29
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.850
Let me give you an overview of my presentation before I begin.
First,

30
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:48.720
what I'd like to do is share with you sort of the traditional versus the modern

31
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:49.590
view of emotions.

32
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.740
Then we'll talk about the foundations of emotional intelligence.

33
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.610
I'll give you a brief history of this idea of emotional intelligence.

34
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.110
Then we'll talk about how do you measure emotional intelligence.
Following that,

35
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.730
we'll think about how does our,

36
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:05.580
what is emotion intelligence predict about a person's everyday life?

37
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.510
And then I'll talk to you about where most of my work lives these days,

38
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:11.970
which is how do you create emotionally intelligent the schools?

39
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.900
And then we'll end with what we believe is the future of emotional intelligence.

40
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.520
As you can see from this slide,
uh,

41
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.090
historically the idea of an emotional intelligence would be an oxymoron.

42
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.070
As a matter of fact,
it was quite interesting about,
uh,
about two weeks ago,

43
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:31.260
I was coming back from a trip and I was in a taxi coming back from the airport

44
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.350
and the taxi driver asked me,
so what do you do when I said,

45
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.760
I studied this concept of emotional intelligence?
And he said to me,

46
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.540
that sounds like an oxymoron.
And too many people,

47
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:45.820
emotional intelligence would be an oxymoron because as you can see from the

48
00:02:45.821 --> 00:02:48.590
slide historic Lee,
uh,

49
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.340
in the ancient Greece,
people would say things like,
rule your feelings less.

50
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:57.690
They'll rule you even in psychology and education,
uh,

51
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.330
experts said that emotions cause a complete loss of cerebral control and no

52
00:03:02.331 --> 00:03:06.580
trace of conscious purpose.
So the idea of an emotional intelligence,
uh,

53
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.730
would be an oxymoron,
at least back in the early 19 hundreds.

54
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:14.783
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

55
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.920
<v 1>a very different view exists these days.</v>

56
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.910
Abundant research has not been conducted on the role of emotions and why

57
00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:24.630
emotions drive for primary aspects of our everyday life.

58
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.010
The first is that emotions drive attention,
memory and learning.
Think about it,

59
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.920
if you're a student in school and you're board,

60
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.040
how will you be present in that classroom?

61
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.310
What will happen is that your mind will be distracted and you will be thinking

62
00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:41.580
about all the things you want to do over the weekend versus being engaged in the

63
00:03:41.581 --> 00:03:42.480
learning process.

64
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.200
The second is that emotions drive much of our everyday decisions.

65
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.510
How many of us have made a bad decision?

66
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.840
And we think it's our rational side that is controlling that,

67
00:03:51.841 --> 00:03:54.990
but oftentimes it's an emotional component.

68
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.100
The third is relationship quality.
And I always ask people,

69
00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:02.310
how many of you like to be around somebody who's angry and disgruntled all the

70
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:03.144
time?

71
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.150
And typically most people try to stay away from people who act like that because

72
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.190
we,
they're unpredictable.
Uh,

73
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.360
we don't like to be around people who generate a lot of negative emotions.

74
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.780
And finally,
another area of research that has gone,

75
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.890
gotten a lot of attention is how emotions drive much of our mental health and

76
00:04:22.891 --> 00:04:27.630
physical health.
When we think about what most people seek treatment for,

77
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.250
such as anxiety and depression,

78
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.290
we think about how those are disorders for many parts are for much part in

79
00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:35.250
emotion regulation.

80
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.260
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.180
<v 1>So in 1990 we were very lucky here at Yale,
Peter Salivate,</v>

82
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.570
the now president of the university and my doctoral adviser John Mayer,

83
00:04:45.571 --> 00:04:49.900
define the idea or the concept of emotional intelligence and where they define

84
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:54.570
emotional intelligence as is the ability to monitor one's own and other's

85
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.290
feelings,

86
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.950
to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one's thinking

87
00:04:58.951 --> 00:04:59.784
and action.

88
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.190
And this was a unique time in history back in 1990 because up until the late

89
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.300
seventies and eighties people were kind of studying emotions in disparate ways.

90
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.980
So what that means is that there were individuals studying how emotions drive

91
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:16.710
attention and memory and they were in their own little camp.

92
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.600
There were developmental psychologist studying how children's emotional

93
00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:23.370
understanding develops over time and with age.

94
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.860
There were other studying emotion regulation and there were more at is really

95
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.670
trying to understand how emotion perception exists.
Is it universal?

96
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.270
Do people read faces the same way across different cultures.

97
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.020
But what Peter and Jack did was they saw that there are these different domains

98
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.420
of what people do with their emotional life.

99
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.330
And they asserted that there were individual differences,

100
00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:51.810
that some people were better or worse at reading facial expressions.

101
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.270
Some people were better or worse that are regulating emotions.

102
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.430
And in that year they also provided the first empirical study that it could be

103
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:03.090
measured like a traditional intelligence.
Now,

104
00:06:03.091 --> 00:06:06.180
many of you probably heard of the term emotional intelligence through with

105
00:06:06.181 --> 00:06:07.110
popularization.

106
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.660
And in 1995 Dan Goleman wrote the bestselling pop psychology book ever written

107
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.760
on the topic of emotional intelligence.

108
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.380
And that book has now sold millions of copies and has been translated into I

109
00:06:19.381 --> 00:06:20.430
think,
30 languages.

110
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.020
One thing that Dan did do was broaden the definition of emotional intelligence

111
00:06:25.021 --> 00:06:26.250
for the popular audience,

112
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.650
but you also made some pretty substantial claims that EEQ matters more than Iq,

113
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.630
that it's the best predictor of success in life.
And in many ways that,
uh,

114
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.420
those claims were far outreach,

115
00:06:39.421 --> 00:06:42.030
the empirical investigations that had been done at the time,

116
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.010
yet the timing was right.
There was lots of going on in America.
Uh,

117
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.720
this was post the bell curve where people were very sort of nervous about what

118
00:06:51.721 --> 00:06:55.920
it means to be intelligent and that intelligent was this meant non malleable

119
00:06:55.921 --> 00:07:00.030
idea or construct.
And there was also a lot of violence in schools.

120
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.010
And what emotional intelligence did was promised that there was another way to

121
00:07:05.011 --> 00:07:10.011
be smart and that perhaps this way of being smart mattered more than general

122
00:07:10.171 --> 00:07:11.004
intelligence

123
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.820
in 1997 after all the popularization,
uh,

124
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.960
Marin's hell every redefine emotional intelligence and really broke it down into

125
00:07:21.961 --> 00:07:25.500
its four basic parts.
And as you can see from our slide here,

126
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.610
they argued that emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive a praise and

127
00:07:29.611 --> 00:07:33.750
express your emotion,
to understand emotion and emotional knowledge,

128
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.760
to access in generate feelings when they facilitate thought and to regulate

129
00:07:38.761 --> 00:07:41.830
emotions in a way that assists thought.
So they came up with,

130
00:07:41.831 --> 00:07:45.990
they call their four branch model of emotional intelligence.
Now,

131
00:07:45.991 --> 00:07:47.370
many people are curious,
you know,

132
00:07:47.371 --> 00:07:50.070
how do you measure this thing called emotional intelligence?

133
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.980
And what we've learned over the years is that people are trying to measure it

134
00:07:52.981 --> 00:07:56.100
with three different measurement tools.
The first is self report.

135
00:07:56.101 --> 00:08:00.120
You can ask someone directly,
do you read facial expressions?
Well,

136
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.400
how skilled are you at regulating your emotions?

137
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.820
Can also ask people who know you well for example,

138
00:08:05.821 --> 00:08:08.340
you can ask your family and your friends are in a workplace.

139
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.290
You might ask your direct reports or the person you report to and figure out or

140
00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:15.930
learn what they think about your emotional intelligence.

141
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:21.770
The third way is what we call performance assessment tools of emotional

142
00:08:21.991 --> 00:08:23.550
intelligence and our laboratory.

143
00:08:23.551 --> 00:08:27.360
We've really focused on that because the gold standard for measuring and

144
00:08:27.361 --> 00:08:29.430
intelligence is using performance measures.

145
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.600
We've really focused on measuring emotional intelligence of the set of mental

146
00:08:33.601 --> 00:08:34.434
abilities.

147
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:39.530
So we do is we ask people to solve emotional in problems and we look at how they

148
00:08:40.111 --> 00:08:43.500
score on such task by comparing them to different criteria.

149
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.600
The primary criteria that we use,

150
00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:50.340
our expert consensus course where we bring in experts from different domains of

151
00:08:50.341 --> 00:08:54.630
emotion research and we get their expert opinions about what um,

152
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.510
the answer is for a particular question.

153
00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.400
<v 2>Okay.</v>

154
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.300
<v 1>Now as you can see here,</v>

155
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:05.301
we've studied the relationship between different types of emotional intelligence

156
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:08.610
measures and what we've learned is that performance measures of emotional

157
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:12.810
intelligence are related to but not redundant with personality well being in

158
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:13.740
general intelligence.

159
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.870
So that tells us is that emotional intelligence is this new construct that

160
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:23.100
explains variance above and beyond existing personality variables like the big

161
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:25.110
five or general intelligence.

162
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.390
Well we've also shown is that self report measures of emotional intelligence do

163
00:09:30.391 --> 00:09:33.360
not correlate at all with ability measures.

164
00:09:33.361 --> 00:09:37.110
Our performance assessment tools and this diagram here on the right demonstrates

165
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:39.150
that.
So what we have here,

166
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:43.500
our people's performance scores taking a the bottom 25th,

167
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.900
the second,
the third and the fourth quartile.

168
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.280
And these lines in the middle are all self report measures of emotional

169
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:51.114
intelligence.

170
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.110
And what you can see is that most people think that they're above average on

171
00:09:55.111 --> 00:09:56.100
emotional intelligence,

172
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.060
which is just like most people believe they are in general intelligence and that

173
00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:05.061
there seems to be no relationship between performance assessment tools and self

174
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:07.860
report measures.
Uh,
you know,
it's,
it,

175
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:11.790
it makes me think oftentimes when I teach psychology,
uh,
to undergraduates,

176
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:13.500
I have them look at each other and I say,

177
00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:15.900
how much smarter do you think you are than the person next to you?

178
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.470
And for some reason 80% of my students think they're smarter than the person

179
00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:21.420
next to them.
So,
uh,

180
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.710
generally what we're saying is that you can't measure an intelligence by asking

181
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:27.570
people what they think about their intelligence.

182
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.460
You have to know what their actual score is or at least tested in a way that's

183
00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:33.294
more objective.

184
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:35.230
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

185
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.790
<v 1>So in some about measurement,</v>

186
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.150
we know that self knowledge is quite limited in the domain of emotional

187
00:10:40.151 --> 00:10:43.030
intelligence as it is in other domains.
As you can see,

188
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:47.920
even in other domains such as intelligence or attractiveness,

189
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.460
people just don't know how to rate themselves,
you know,
a model and may think,

190
00:10:51.461 --> 00:10:55.090
well,
this model is even more beautiful than I am.
Or someone who I say,
well,

191
00:10:55.091 --> 00:10:56.950
it's gotta be somebody who's smarter than I am.

192
00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:02.290
So what we do in our laboratory is really focused on how do you measure

193
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.020
emotional intelligence as a set of mental abilities.
Now,

194
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.870
many of us want to know what does emotional intelligence predict about a

195
00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:14.610
person's life?
And as you can see from this slide,
the left column a,

196
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.490
these are mostly adolescents and middle schools and high schools in this

197
00:11:17.491 --> 00:11:20.010
particular research,
less skilled.

198
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.050
<v 2>Okay.</v>

199
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.620
<v 1>Is the column on the left more skilled is the column on the right.</v>

200
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:26.410
<v 2>Okay.</v>

201
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.260
<v 1>And these are not just their studies that we've done in our laboratory,</v>

202
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.710
but studies from different labs across the United States and even the world.

203
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.911
And in general,

204
00:11:33.911 --> 00:11:38.911
what you see is that children or adolescents who are less skilled in these

205
00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:43.360
abilities and emotional intelligence tend to live quite different lives than

206
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.770
those who are more skilled.

207
00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.173
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

208
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.480
<v 1>Even in business.
And teaching applications.</v>

209
00:11:52.481 --> 00:11:57.400
You can see outcomes of being emotionally intelligent,
uh,
are quite staggering.

210
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.940
Higher customer service ratings enhance expressiveness and empathy,

211
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:05.890
greater social support from colleagues,
greater job satisfaction there.
Re,
um,

212
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.470
the report of more positive emotions at work.

213
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.630
It's a matter of fact that did one study recently in Connecticut with a about

214
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:18.631
100 managers and I asked it does 100 managed to take our performance tests of

215
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:21.940
emotional intelligence?
And they had the CEO,
the CFO,

216
00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:26.890
and the COO of the organization rate them on different leadership competencies.

217
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.620
And I asked one extra question,
which was,

218
00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:31.630
if you were to leave this company tomorrow,

219
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.810
what would you do to take this person with you?

220
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.280
And what we showed was that the individuals are these managers who had the

221
00:12:39.281 --> 00:12:43.330
highest scores on our test of emotion intelligence were rated by the top

222
00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:47.380
executives of that organization as the ones who they would fight to take with

223
00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:48.010
them.

224
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.310
So people just want to be around people who are more emotionally intelligent.

225
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.140
<v 2>Okay.</v>

226
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.670
<v 1>Now as I said earlier,</v>

227
00:12:55.671 --> 00:12:58.760
the focus of my research really has been in school systems.

228
00:12:58.761 --> 00:13:02.960
How do you create emotional intelligent organizations and in particular schools,

229
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:08.240
what we know is that schools have changed.
The function of schools have changed.

230
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.840
A traditional training for teachers and leaders has neglected emotional

231
00:13:11.841 --> 00:13:15.530
intelligence instruction for decades or forever.
Uh,

232
00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.170
the nature of teaching and leading has changed is more burnout.

233
00:13:18.171 --> 00:13:19.520
There's larger classrooms.

234
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.750
We have standardized testing and the prevalence of social emotional problems in

235
00:13:23.751 --> 00:13:27.350
schools has really risen.
And as you can see from this list,

236
00:13:27.351 --> 00:13:30.620
from absenteeism to drop to a bullying.

237
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:33.300
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

238
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.430
<v 1>Now the approach that we've created in schools,</v>

239
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.760
we call ruler and roller stands for five key skills.

240
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.600
And those are embedded in the theory of emotional intelligence.

241
00:13:42.601 --> 00:13:46.050
The first is recognizing emotion.
The second is understanding.

242
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:50.520
The third is labeling,
expressing,
regulating.
So we do a little game with it.

243
00:13:50.521 --> 00:13:54.870
It's recognizing emotion,
understanding emotion,
a labeling,

244
00:13:54.871 --> 00:13:58.740
emotion,
expressing emotion and regulating emotion.

245
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.810
Let me take you through those skills really quickly.

246
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.260
The first is recognizing emotion,

247
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.760
identifying emotion and face and posture,
gesture,
voice in physiology.

248
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.420
So it's not just about recognizing emotions and the face,

249
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.100
it's listening to someone's voice.
It is paying attention to their body posture.

250
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.560
It is looking at their gestures.

251
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:21.470
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

252
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.860
<v 1>The understanding of emotion gets more complex because we're trying to think</v>

253
00:14:24.861 --> 00:14:27.980
here about the causes and the consequences of emotion.

254
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.940
How do our emotions affect our attention,
our thinking,
our decisions,

255
00:14:31.941 --> 00:14:34.820
and our behavior.
So different moods,
for example,

256
00:14:34.821 --> 00:14:38.540
are associated with different types of thinking and judgment and decision
making.

257
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.150
For example,
if you're a very high energy and pleasant,

258
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.830
it's better for brainstorming.

259
00:14:42.831 --> 00:14:45.650
Whereas if you're a slightly lower in energy and slightly unpleasant,

260
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.160
it might be better at critical thinking,
for example,
or proofing of paper.

261
00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.130
If you're a student labeling emotion,

262
00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:55.480
it has to do with that sophisticated vocabulary that we want to teach your

263
00:14:55.481 --> 00:14:58.550
children and adults to use when talking about their feelings.
States,

264
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.420
we know that most people have two words in there in the English language to

265
00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:04.850
describe how they're feeling.
Fine.
Okay.

266
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.350
Well when children learn ruler,
they started saying,
well,
I feel elated.

267
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:14.210
I'm feeling a bit despair.
Um,
I'm not nervous.

268
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:18.500
I'm actually apprehensive.
I'm not just calm.
I'm feeling serene.

269
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.090
So we help children really differentiate their emotional experience because what

270
00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:25.190
we believe is that when children can name it,

271
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.800
they're going to be more skilled at taming it.

272
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.210
By creating or giving children the language to describe their emotional states,

273
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.190
what we're able to do is help them create a mental model of what that emotional

274
00:15:37.191 --> 00:15:39.080
experience is like and in turn,

275
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.450
give them the strategies they need to help them regulate it.

276
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.430
Expressing emotion is next.
I always joke around with people and say,

277
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:50.270
how many of you know someone who is a socially inappropriate and everybody seems

278
00:15:50.271 --> 00:15:55.271
to raise their hand because not many of us are taught about how to express our

279
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:58.150
emotions the right time with the right place.
You know,

280
00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.050
I remember vividly when I was a graduate student,

281
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.430
I was with a colleague of mine who was just very down about something going on

282
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:07.370
and one of our mentors came in the room.
He just started screaming,

283
00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:08.990
you're not going to believe when I did this weekend.

284
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.350
Just not paying attention to the cues and not knowing that it wasn't the right

285
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:15.200
time or place to really talk about all the great things that happened over her

286
00:16:15.201 --> 00:16:16.010
weekend,

287
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.240
that we're really focusing on helping this young woman manage her emotions.

288
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.140
It's also has to do with culture.
Uh,

289
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.380
most of our schools these days are multicultural.

290
00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.950
So the rules for emotion very is a function of culture.

291
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:35.210
My other careers I teach martial arts and had been to Korea a lot and what we've

292
00:16:35.211 --> 00:16:37.730
learned in Korea is that,
you know,

293
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.810
eye gaze means something different than eye gaze here or in New York City.

294
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.180
Um,
the uh,

295
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.350
the rules about how much you share about your own emotions varies as a function

296
00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:49.184
of culture.

297
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.330
So we want to do is make schools cultural literate about emotion as well.

298
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:59.290
And the final r and ruler is regulating emotions and this skill focus

299
00:17:00.471 --> 00:17:05.471
specifically on the knowledge and strategies that we use to prevent,

300
00:17:05.571 --> 00:17:08.210
reduce an issue,
maintain or enhance our emotions.

301
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:12.290
And the way we think about emotion regulation in schools and in life in general

302
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.170
is that we have goals and we have strategies.

303
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.130
So when we're experiencing an emotion,
what we want to do is first think about,

304
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.080
do I want to prevent this feeling from occurring?

305
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.430
So how many of you have anticipated going to a relatives house that you just

306
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.490
dreaded going to and you can think,

307
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:32.060
I'll kind of gotta be so uptight in this house or this person with this person.

308
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.420
So what do you do to prepare for that or prevent the negative emotion?

309
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.010
Obviously we need to reduce those ones that get us unexpectedly.
Um,

310
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.760
we also have to be at an initiate emotions.
So as a teacher in particular,

311
00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:48.200
we want to teach teachers how to create an emotion so that the learning

312
00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:52.880
experience can be more engaging.
Oftentimes we want to maintain or emotions.

313
00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.780
Uh,
this is really getting at,
you know,
we're feeling pleasant.

314
00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.130
Then we go home or we go to a party or go to our friend's house and the dreams

315
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:02.580
dealers come in and try to sort of steal us of our pleasant emotions.

316
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:05.940
And what do we do to maintain those positive feelings?
And of course,
since then,

317
00:18:05.941 --> 00:18:08.100
we have to just boost the energy and enhance emotions.

318
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.490
So rulers theory of change is um,
very straightforward.

319
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.490
What we argue is that you have our approach,

320
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.050
which is the intervention and then the strategies are we,
as I say,

321
00:18:22.051 --> 00:18:26.100
train everybody with a face from leaders to teachers and staff to classroom

322
00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:29.640
curriculum,
getting families involved.
Very importantly,

323
00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:31.950
we have what we call our proximal outcomes.

324
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:37.220
Our goal here is that what we want to do is both develop the individual skills

325
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.790
of the student,
the teacher,
the leader of the family member,

326
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:47.030
but also create a common language and a community where the climate is

327
00:18:47.191 --> 00:18:48.150
emotionally healthy.

328
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.980
And so taking the systems approach and this individual difference approach and

329
00:18:52.981 --> 00:18:56.100
combining them is really our mechanism for change.

330
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.490
And what we now know from our research is that when you do develop the

331
00:18:59.491 --> 00:19:02.010
individual skills and you change the climate,

332
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.040
you can get the outcomes that you're interested from academic achievement,

333
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:06.570
going up to relationship,

334
00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.380
becoming better to better mental and physical health.

335
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.870
Very quickly when I want to do is share with you the methods that we use to

336
00:19:15.871 --> 00:19:18.360
create an emotionally intelligent school system.

337
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.550
The first tool is called the charter.

338
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.690
So we try to work with schools to get rid of their rules and help them think

339
00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:27.960
about how students and teachers want to feel.
So instead of saying,

340
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.660
can't run the hallways,
keep your hands to yourself.

341
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.950
We ask kids to think about and talk about the feelings that they want to have

342
00:19:34.951 --> 00:19:36.420
each day when they come into school.

343
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.100
Then we ask them to consider the behaviors that are necessary for those emotions

344
00:19:41.101 --> 00:19:45.480
to come alive.
And finally,
knowing that conflict is just part of life,

345
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.480
we ask students to think critically about what are the things that they would

346
00:19:48.481 --> 00:19:52.350
like to do to prevent conflict and to manage it when it occurs.

347
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.890
And this becomes what we call the emotional literacy charter.

348
00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.630
The second tool is called the mood meter.
And as I mentioned earlier,

349
00:20:00.631 --> 00:20:03.270
emotions drive much of our thinking and decision making.

350
00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:08.250
So this tool is helping children and adults learn about their emotions.

351
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.400
There are two axes,
the pleasantness and the energy access,

352
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.450
and then that those axes break up into four quadrants.
The yellow,
the red,

353
00:20:15.451 --> 00:20:18.600
the blue,
and the green.
So yellow is positive emotions,

354
00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:23.400
which goes from maybe happy to ecstatic red would be the anxiety and anger

355
00:20:23.401 --> 00:20:23.940
family,

356
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:28.920
which maybe peeve too enraged or uneasy too panicky.

357
00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:29.820
Uh,

358
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.820
the blue would go from sad to depressed and the green from just calm to bliss or

359
00:20:35.041 --> 00:20:37.470
serene.
So in with the mood meter,

360
00:20:37.471 --> 00:20:40.230
what we do is teach children how to build their vocabulary.

361
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.610
We teach them how to develop strategies to help shift their moods from different

362
00:20:44.611 --> 00:20:45.960
quadrants to other quadrants.

363
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:51.910
The third tool is we call them at a moment and um,
you know,

364
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:56.710
the men and women is a special tool because,
uh,
the idea of this fourth step,

365
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.090
which we call the best self,

366
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.540
came out of many conversations with my colleague Robin Stern,

367
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.640
but also out of a,

368
00:21:03.641 --> 00:21:07.360
an article that was written here at Yale about the course that I taught a few

369
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.360
years ago.
And this one student of mine wrote a court,

370
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.470
wrote an article and it was called the feelings master.
And I remember,
you know,

371
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.800
being a little embarrassed by it,

372
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:20.050
but also trying to think what does a head is a feeling of the master at live his

373
00:21:20.051 --> 00:21:23.890
life.
So when I'd walk around campus,
I think it has the feelings master walk,

374
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.220
you know,
feelings,
master of walks with good posture.

375
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.170
Then I'd be having meetings with my students,

376
00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:32.410
maybe one which would be kind of like uncomfortable at the student was kind of

377
00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:33.610
whining and it's there.

378
00:21:33.611 --> 00:21:35.980
How does the feelings master react to the whining student?

379
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:41.520
And what I started realizing is that to be skilled and emotion regulation,

380
00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.600
what we want to do is have motivation to be skilled.

381
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.530
So the four or the six steps of the Meta moment is teaching people that

382
00:21:50.531 --> 00:21:52.330
something happens.
Knowing your triggers,

383
00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:56.140
sensing how those triggers are affecting your thoughts,
your physiology,

384
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.820
even your expressive behavior,

385
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.830
knowing that when you're activated tried to stop as early as possible in that

386
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.890
intensity building part of it.

387
00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:10.570
Take that breath to activate your parasympathetic nervous system so you can be

388
00:22:10.571 --> 00:22:15.280
clear.
Then we teach children and adults to activate their best self.

389
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.040
So what does the ideal teacher doing this situation?

390
00:22:18.041 --> 00:22:19.960
What does the ideal student doing this situation?

391
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.240
And by activating that best self,

392
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.340
what we know and believe is that you will choose more adaptive and healthy

393
00:22:27.341 --> 00:22:30.490
strategies to downregulate or change your emotional state.

394
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.630
And hopefully that will then lead you to a successful interaction.

395
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:36.820
Finally,

396
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:40.720
what we know is that not all of us are skilled at taking them on a moments.

397
00:22:40.721 --> 00:22:42.820
And many of us,
even myself included,

398
00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.490
sometimes know that the Meta moment is the right thing to do.

399
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:50.380
But of course make that bad decision and say the unpleasant thing or the hurtful

400
00:22:50.381 --> 00:22:53.020
thing to someone and then we have to problem solve.

401
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:58.890
So the blueprint is now getting away from just me and talking about the we in

402
00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:04.630
emotion regulation that what happened is there was a problem between the two of

403
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:09.430
us.
Maybe I misread you,
maybe I sort of wasn't really paying attention.

404
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:10.840
Uh,

405
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:15.040
and it asked the individual to really break down their inexperience and the

406
00:23:15.041 --> 00:23:16.420
other person's experience.

407
00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:20.680
So the goal of the blueprint is really to help build empathy and perspective

408
00:23:20.681 --> 00:23:23.050
taking by considering not only how did you feel,

409
00:23:23.051 --> 00:23:26.130
but how do the other person feel.
Not only just what causes your feelings,

410
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.320
but what might have caused the other person,
how did the other person regulate?

411
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:33.880
And oftentimes when we complete the blueprint,
we realize that we have,
uh,

412
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.270
we don't have enough information and,
uh,

413
00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.210
we may have made some assumptions about the other person and that we need to

414
00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:44.110
further investigate so that we can have clarity and resolve the conflict

415
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:49.070
creative land effectively.
To finalize my presentation,

416
00:23:49.071 --> 00:23:53.400
what we've learned from our work on ruler in schools,
we've now done,
uh,

417
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.770
a number of experiments,

418
00:23:54.771 --> 00:23:59.210
one very large randomized control trial and 66 schools in the New York area.

419
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.450
What we're showing is that schools that decide to take this approach on

420
00:24:02.451 --> 00:24:05.000
seriously look different.
Um,

421
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.240
they have students who report less anxiety and depression,

422
00:24:08.241 --> 00:24:10.430
students who manage their emotions more effectively,

423
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:12.020
that are better problem solvers.

424
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:16.730
And as you can see many positive gains even in academic performance.

425
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:20.810
And we've also shown that not only do we help the individuals develop their

426
00:24:20.811 --> 00:24:25.580
skills,
but what we also can do is change the climate and culture of classrooms.

427
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.640
They're more engaging as students are more connected,

428
00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.220
they experience more positive emotions in school.

429
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.760
And knowing that the experience of positive emotions and engagement is the

430
00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.610
predictor of academic success.
That makes us pretty happy with the findings.

431
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.040
Lastly,
we're,
you know,

432
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.070
in the very beginning stages of our understanding of this concept of emotional

433
00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:53.690
intelligence,
if you make the comparison to General Intelligence,
uh,
you know,

434
00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:56.780
that was the fine well over a hundred years ago when people had been trying to

435
00:24:56.781 --> 00:24:58.760
measure and general intelligence for decades,

436
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.070
a hundred years or more emotional intelligence is only defined in 1990 redefine

437
00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:05.180
in 1997.

438
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.600
And so we have about 2025 years of research to unpack this complex component of

439
00:25:12.081 --> 00:25:15.730
emotional intelligence,
these recognizing emotion skills and understanding,

440
00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.700
labeling,
expressing and regulating.
So the future of emotional intelligence,

441
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.840
I believe we'll continue to build new performance measures where we start

442
00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:28.070
breaking down the crystallized versus a fluid aspects of emotional intelligence.

443
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.730
Well,
we'll also do is study how emotional intelligence develops,

444
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:36.140
including the biological and environmental influences and gender differences,

445
00:25:36.141 --> 00:25:39.320
which have been apparent from the beginning of our research on emotional

446
00:25:39.321 --> 00:25:41.210
intelligence.
And finally,

447
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.570
I think most people are interested in emotional intelligence because they want

448
00:25:44.571 --> 00:25:47.900
to know what it can do for them.
How can it improve their lives?

449
00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:49.880
So much of our research in the future,

450
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:53.270
we'll focus on what does it mean to be an emotionally intelligent person?

451
00:25:53.271 --> 00:25:55.130
How does it influence my relationships?

452
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:59.270
How does it influence my mental health and how does it influence my performance

453
00:25:59.271 --> 00:26:01.130
both at school and at work?

454
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.540
So that's concludes my presentation on emotion intelligence.

455
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.870
<v 0>So thanks for fantastic guests,</v>

456
00:26:07.871 --> 00:26:11.020
lecture from Doctor Mark Brackett on emotional intelligence.

457
00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.980
So now we're going to do a segue to our takeaway questions that correspond to

458
00:26:14.981 --> 00:26:19.540
this really fantastic guest lecture from today.
So the takeaway questions,

459
00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.260
these kind of correspond to the main points you want to glean from this guest

460
00:26:23.261 --> 00:26:25.270
lecture you had.
Stay from Dr Marc Brackett.

461
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.790
The first really focuses on how would you define what emotional intelligence is.

462
00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.040
Second,

463
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:37.060
what are the different ways that you can systematically try to measure emotional

464
00:26:37.061 --> 00:26:39.370
intelligence?
And finally,

465
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:44.160
what does the ruler approach discussed today stand for and how would you

466
00:26:44.161 --> 00:26:46.950
describe each of its component parts?

467
00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:48.890
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

468
00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:49.101
<v 0>no,</v>

469
00:26:49.101 --> 00:26:53.270
I just want to conclude then with our expert interview today and for our expert
