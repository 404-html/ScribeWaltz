1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.280
And for experts and emotion interview today.
Um,

2
00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:07.540
we'll be speaking with Dr Lisa Parr who share her expertise on expressions of

3
00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:08.980
emotion and chimpanzees.

4
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.840
Dr Par received her phd in psychology at Emory university and is now an

5
00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:17.830
assistant professor in the division of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science and

6
00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:22.180
directs the Comparative Research Laboratory at the Yerkes National Primate

7
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.781
Research Center,
uh,

8
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:26.830
examining emotional communication and social cognition in monkeys and apes.

9
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.430
A doctor [inaudible] has received several awards in her career,

10
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.470
including the Frank A.

11
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.160
Beach comparative psychology award from the American psychological association

12
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.310
as well as funding from the National Institute of Mental Health,

13
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.660
the National Science Foundation and the National Alliance for autism research.

14
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.730
And on a side note,
as a native Australian doctor,
par enjoys fishing,

15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.160
cooking,
and riding her motorcycle.

16
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.050
So we will now turn to a very special experts and emotion interview with Doctor

17
00:00:56.051 --> 00:01:00.820
Lisa Par.
Yeah.
So thanks for speaking with us today,
Lisa.

18
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.340
You're very welcome.
The morning,
every morning.

19
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.050
So what I wanted to start out asking you a bit about is what first got you

20
00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:11.620
interested in studying emotions,
sort of where did it all begin for you?

21
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.220
<v 1>Yeah,
that's an interesting question.
Um,</v>

22
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.690
I think I'd have to trace it back to before I started Grad school.

23
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:23.160
I was working in a lab that was interested in laterality and asymmetries and we

24
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:27.000
were doing a project looking at facial asymmetries and chimpanzee you use,

25
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:31.710
and so my role is the technician was to go basically be the photographer and

26
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:34.380
take a lot of photographs of,
of chimpanzee users.

27
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:37.830
They were making lots of expressions and playing and interacting with one

28
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.330
another.
And um,

29
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.860
I wasn't really thinking too much about the goal of the project when I was

30
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.820
acting as the photographer.
But after a while,
you know,
you look at,

31
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.590
at their behavior and you know,
you,
you naturally start to have questions.

32
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:56.610
What do these expressions really mean and are they really able to interpret them

33
00:01:56.611 --> 00:02:00.540
and do they communicate something about emotion,
like human facial expressions.

34
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:04.710
So that's where the sort of trajectory went from there.

35
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.081
<v 0>That's really interesting.</v>

36
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:08.930
So I'm going to ask you then a little bit about this trajectory because it's

37
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.990
something that I know a lot of people find so interesting.
I mean,

38
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.560
what you've done is conduct this groundbreaking research to sort of

39
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.920
systematically and objectively develop a coding system to quantify emotion

40
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:25.730
expressions for the first time,
you know,
in nonhuman primates in particular,

41
00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:29.050
chimpanzees,
which you refer to as chimp facts.
Um,

42
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.880
and I wonder if you could say a little bit about the steps involved in

43
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:33.230
developing the system.

44
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.570
<v 1>Right.
So,
um,
the system,
as you know,
the,</v>

45
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:40.820
the facial action coding system was developed by Paul Ekman in the 1970.

46
00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:45.821
So I can't take credit for the system itself and really was a brilliant idea and

47
00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:50.040
still remains the gold standard for looking at,
at facial movement,
um,

48
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.500
in humans to this day.
And,
you know,
like I said,
um,

49
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.460
and we started to to think about chimpanzee facial expressions and what they may

50
00:02:57.461 --> 00:03:01.030
mean,
and as a,
a sort of student to be theology,

51
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:05.290
I'm understanding about animal behavior.
One of the first questions was,
you know,

52
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:08.080
let's really try and quantify what these movements are.

53
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.350
And probably if I was studying a different species,

54
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:15.750
it may not have seemed so pertinent.
But when you watch a group of chimpanzees,

55
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.880
the just amazing depth of complexity in their facial expressions is really quite

56
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:24.790
daunting.
So the first thing that we had to do was,

57
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.660
was just create basically a language to describe what we were seeing.

58
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.250
And so that's,
that's where the chimp facts came.
So,
um,

59
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.210
basically paralleling the development of the human facts.
We first,
uh,

60
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.040
did some dissections to make sure that the facial anatomy of the chimpanzee was

61
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:43.120
similar to humans.

62
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:46.570
And that's important because the face itself is quite different.
The,

63
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.750
the structure and morphology of the,
of the chimpanzee face,

64
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:51.700
they have a very heavy brow ridge.

65
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.020
They don't have a fatty knows like we do are these fatty cheeks are reverted

66
00:03:56.021 --> 00:04:00.430
lips.
So it's really quite a different palette that you're working with.
Um,

67
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.080
and we did confirm all 23 mimetic facial muscles in the chimpanzee similar to

68
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:08.500
humans.
And the next thing we did was a,
a little bit bizarre.

69
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:13.501
We actually did some intra muscular stimulations of the different muscles to

70
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:16.480
verify that when the muscle contract,

71
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.490
I'm going to make lots of weird facial to extent,
um,
that,

72
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.160
that actually produced the movements that we were seeing.
Um,
uh,

73
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.970
when the chimpanzees were making facial expressions so we could confirm that

74
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.220
specific facial movements were actually due to the action of,

75
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.350
of individual facial muscles.
And then it was really just a,
um,

76
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.290
a painstaking task of watching lots of video and isolating examples of the

77
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:45.700
particular movements and then creating the manual and the descriptions,
um,

78
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.630
which is,
uh,
you know,
um,
only a fraction of the,

79
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:53.710
of the complexity of the human facts,
but,
um,
nonetheless it,

80
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:57.820
it needed to be done.
So that's the basic process.

81
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.360
<v 0>So what do you see as the parallels between,
you know,
as you said,</v>

82
00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:05.350
Paul Ackman's facial action coding system in humans and the system that you

83
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:08.250
developed for chimpanzees or chimp facts?
[inaudible]

84
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.450
<v 1>well,
the system,
the system is identical in all of the different steps in the,
um,</v>

85
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.890
you know,
the resources that it provides for you.
So,
um,

86
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.630
we have,
um,
individual action unit similar to the,
to the human facts.

87
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:26.170
The numbers are identical because the musculature is identical.
And,

88
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.100
and basically if,
if you throw out a series of numbers to be,

89
00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:34.330
I can tell you what that expression is in the,
you know,
a six,

90
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:38.260
a 12 and um,
and you know exactly what the expression is.

91
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:42.580
So it just gives us that objective tool to describe what we're seeing without

92
00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:46.390
having to say,
is that a bared teeth?
Cause it kind of looks like a bared teeth,

93
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:49.120
but there's also this other movement in there and you know,

94
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:52.720
it is it really prototypical or not.
So it gives us the ability to,

95
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.910
to really describe that with a lot of precision.

96
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.090
<v 0>I mean,
it's fascinating.</v>

97
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.800
I'm sure you get many questions about what can we use chimp facts for.

98
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.020
And when you get asked these kinds of questions,

99
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:07.520
what do you think are the promises that can be used with this tool and coding,

100
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:11.390
you know,
systematically emotion expressions in the faces of chimpanzees?

101
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.440
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,
you know,
I think the question still remain in terms of humans.</v>

102
00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:21.060
I think the real,
um,
fascinating part of,
of,
uh,
animal communication,

103
00:06:21.061 --> 00:06:23.970
especially a,
a species as complex as a chimpanzee,

104
00:06:23.971 --> 00:06:28.650
is what are all the nuances of the,
of the communication that they use.

105
00:06:28.651 --> 00:06:31.560
And you know,
even in humans,
you know,

106
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.860
Paul Ekman described prototypical facial expressions,

107
00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:38.700
these expressions of basic emotion like anger and fear.
And you know,

108
00:06:38.701 --> 00:06:42.420
these are really hard emotion words.
Um,
but the,

109
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.530
the reality is that the everyday communication that we have is filled with

110
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.420
subtle nuances and,

111
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.280
and micro expressions and very low intensity versions of expressions.

112
00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:58.281
We don't walk around all the time with these huge big on off static displays and

113
00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:02.910
chimpanzee user are the same.
Um,
and you know,
like I said,

114
00:07:02.911 --> 00:07:06.450
if I had studied with studying,
uh,
maybe,
maybe simpler species,

115
00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:10.110
I don't want to use that without that word in quotes,
similar species,
uh,

116
00:07:10.111 --> 00:07:13.110
you know,
it wouldn't have been maybe such an urgent need,

117
00:07:13.111 --> 00:07:15.660
but because the chimpanzee is so,

118
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.610
there's really just such an amazing amount of complexity in how they communicate

119
00:07:20.611 --> 00:07:23.700
with one another that,
you know,
it made it really necessary to develop it.

120
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.583
<v 0>That tool.</v>

121
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.270
And I also know you've talked a lot about the importance of context and

122
00:07:28.271 --> 00:07:29.860
interpreting these expressions.

123
00:07:29.861 --> 00:07:31.900
And I wonder if you could just say a little bit about that.

124
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.390
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean that's part of the of the complexity is,
you know,</v>

125
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.410
one expression is not tied with one context.
It's um,
you know,

126
00:07:40.411 --> 00:07:44.190
they can be used across a range of different contexts.
Do you can,
you know,

127
00:07:44.191 --> 00:07:47.310
see animals that have been involved in a fight bearing their teeth at one

128
00:07:47.311 --> 00:07:50.220
another,
but then you can see a mother greeting her,

129
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.140
her infant and burying the teeth.

130
00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:57.060
So here you have what appears to be the same expression you used in drastically

131
00:07:57.061 --> 00:08:00.010
different contexts in it.
You know,
it raises the question,
you know,

132
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.060
what are these expressions really mean and how do they really function?

133
00:08:03.061 --> 00:08:05.480
And at least to date,
um,
there,

134
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.500
there haven't been a lot of studies looking at that function that it's takes a

135
00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:12.410
lot of time and a lot of,
um,

136
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.450
dedication to do those sorts of studies because you have to wait for the

137
00:08:15.451 --> 00:08:18.120
expressions to occur.
And so,
um,

138
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.720
that's a big project for one that that really needs to be done.

139
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:26.100
But I'll give you an example of one data set.
My colleague and developing that,

140
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.930
the chimp facts,
Bridget Waller,
who's in the UK,
Portsmouth University,
um,

141
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.240
has done a study looking at place signaling and chimpanzees.

142
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.120
Chimpanzees have a very characteristic play face.

143
00:08:36.121 --> 00:08:40.560
They dropped the mouth open and they usually keep the upper teeth covered.
Um,

144
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:45.590
but during certain play about sometimes you see flashes of the upper teeth and

145
00:08:45.841 --> 00:08:49.950
it raises the question is that what does that additional movement communicating

146
00:08:49.951 --> 00:08:51.330
in the context of play?

147
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.540
And what she found was that individuals who flashed the upper are usually a more

148
00:08:56.581 --> 00:09:01.260
dominant or older than their play partners.
And when the upper teeth are flashed,

149
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:05.850
it extends the length of the playbook.
So it may signal something like,
you know,

150
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:09.810
we're,
we're a disparate Dyad,
I'm higher ranking than you are.

151
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:11.970
So there's some maybe some social tension there,

152
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.450
but when I flashed my upper teeth,
I'm signaling,
hey,
it's okay,

153
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:19.230
we can still keep playing.
You know,
it's,
it's okay.
So maybe like,
you know,

154
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:22.890
a younger sibling playing with their older brother and you know,
so there's,

155
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.880
there's a real,
um,

156
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.470
mediation of that interaction through the use of this additional movement.

157
00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:31.470
And you know,
that isn't an expression in and of itself.

158
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:35.850
So until the chimp fax was created,
we wouldn't have had a way to really,
um,

159
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.820
very nicely quantify and describe these things.

160
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.810
<v 0>And just a little bit,
I mean,</v>

161
00:09:40.811 --> 00:09:44.980
I know when people go about thinking that they want to train and become,

162
00:09:44.981 --> 00:09:49.240
you know,
a certified facial action coder and that sort of human fax system,

163
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.700
you know,
it takes 80 to a hundred hours and you know,
these laborious tests that,

164
00:09:53.701 --> 00:09:55.380
that people go through.
Um,

165
00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.170
having been a facs coder myself and I just wonder if it's the same kind of

166
00:09:59.171 --> 00:10:02.070
intensive training process when it comes to chimp facts too.

167
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.181
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

168
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:06.510
We really recommend people who want to use the system that they first become

169
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:10.470
certified on the human facts because it's,
it's such a,
uh,

170
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:14.640
the system is so much more in depth than humans because there are additional

171
00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:18.850
movements that humans do that we weren't able to find in the chimpanzee.
Um,

172
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.600
that's sort of an interesting thing that,

173
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:25.790
because I guess you could speculate that it's because of the facial morphology.

174
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:31.311
The upper part of the face of the chimpanzee is not nearly as as mobile as the

175
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:37.050
human face.
For example,
they don't have eyebrows.
They have a heavy brow ridge,

176
00:10:37.051 --> 00:10:39.360
but it's the same color as the rest of the head.

177
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.230
And so you don't get all the sort of upper facial signaling that that you do in

178
00:10:43.231 --> 00:10:47.490
humans.
So it's a,
it's a reduced form of,
of the facts as a whole.

179
00:10:47.491 --> 00:10:51.660
So we recommend that people first learn the human facts,
which yes,

180
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:54.830
it takes a long time.
Um,
but once they learn the human factor,

181
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.480
the chimp facts is really,
is really quite straight forward.

182
00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.730
<v 0>This is really interesting.
Just thinking about,
you know,</v>

183
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.020
the development of this coding system for being able to quantify emotion

184
00:11:05.021 --> 00:11:08.680
expressions and chimpanzees and I know a related line of work that you've done

185
00:11:08.681 --> 00:11:13.480
has also looked at sort of emotion discrimination or recognition in chimpanzees.

186
00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.690
And I wonder if you could say a little bit about your work here and their

187
00:11:16.691 --> 00:11:20.560
ability to recognize or seemingly discriminate between different facial

188
00:11:20.561 --> 00:11:22.630
expressions among other chimps.

189
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.600
<v 1>Yeah,
that's a good question.
Um,
it was one of the first questions that we had.</v>

190
00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:30.900
We noticed the chimpanzees have a variety of,

191
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.890
of facial expressions just like humans and we wondered whether they saw them as

192
00:11:34.891 --> 00:11:37.680
discrete categories.
Um,
so again,

193
00:11:37.681 --> 00:11:41.760
I sort of have a part time career as a photographer,
uh,

194
00:11:41.761 --> 00:11:43.620
spending a lot of time taking pictures of,

195
00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:48.150
of chimpanzees and of course there are challenges and that they're always behind

196
00:11:48.151 --> 00:11:53.100
a tree or something like that.
Um,
anyway,
we put together a,
a,
a really nice,

197
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.340
uh,
stimulus set of,

198
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.360
of photographs and we use a computer interface to test their recognition

199
00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:04.300
ability.
It's a very straightforward task called the match to sample task.

200
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:08.920
They,
they actually use a joystick to manipulate a cursor on the computer screen.

201
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.110
Yeah,
it sounds,
it sounds kind of crazy,

202
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:15.010
but they're actually extremely good at it and they really love to do that sort

203
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:15.760
of task.

204
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.060
So they first see a picture of what we call the sample and then they see two

205
00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:19.871
comparisons.

206
00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:24.871
One matches the sample and it can match on a variety of different visual or,

207
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:28.900
or,
or,
um,
you know,
content wise dimensions.

208
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.800
So the first thing would be simply to present them with a picture of an

209
00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:36.760
expression in the matches,
the identical picture.
But then,
you know,
your,

210
00:12:36.761 --> 00:12:39.940
your question is really about picture matching and not about expression

211
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:40.774
recognition.

212
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.370
So what we did instead is we gave them a picture of a facial expression is the

213
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:48.430
sample and the correct choice was a different individual,

214
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:50.800
but making the same category of expression.

215
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.710
And then the non match was every other expression category.

216
00:12:54.711 --> 00:12:57.900
So we had all different combinations and we found that,
um,

217
00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.740
without really any training at all,

218
00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:04.540
they were able to match those basic categories,
uh,
across different individuals.

219
00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:08.230
So,
um,
it just proved to us that these,
uh,

220
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.410
these facial signals are,
are very salient,

221
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:16.470
easily recognizable and a seem to store it into the same sort of categories

222
00:13:16.741 --> 00:13:19.060
that,
that we were seeing,
which was,
which was nice.

223
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.030
<v 0>Oh,
that's fascinating work.
And I'm incredibly impressed too as you say,</v>

224
00:13:23.031 --> 00:13:26.560
that they're able to complete this computerized task just as any,
you know,

225
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.700
human research participant might.

226
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.660
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
They,
um,
they're very good at that.</v>

227
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.960
<v 0>One question,
I'm sure you've been asked,</v>

228
00:13:33.961 --> 00:13:35.850
and I don't know if there's an answer to this,

229
00:13:35.851 --> 00:13:39.690
but you found that they can reliably discriminate between emotion expressions

230
00:13:39.691 --> 00:13:41.040
within their own species.

231
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:45.120
To what extent do you think there's any ability for cross species recognition

232
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.700
perhaps between people might ask you a chimp than a human?

233
00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:49.980
And do we know that answer at this point?

234
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.950
<v 1>You know,
we don't really know the answer at this point.
I think,
um,
you know,</v>

235
00:13:54.951 --> 00:13:58.640
because we,
we work in captivity in a laboratory environment,

236
00:13:58.641 --> 00:14:02.540
there are restrictions in terms of,
um,
you know,
safety protocols.

237
00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:07.541
We have to wear a surgical masks and shields to cover our faces and things to

238
00:14:08.451 --> 00:14:10.970
prevent cross contamination.
And,
um,

239
00:14:10.971 --> 00:14:15.971
and so it's question about how much the chimpanzees actually know about our

240
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.350
facial expressions.
Um,

241
00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:22.050
you could certainly use facts to,
um,

242
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.990
compare similar facial expressions based on the movements that are involved and

243
00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:31.310
see if the chimpanzees can tell,
hey,
that's a Aau 12 plus six,

244
00:14:31.311 --> 00:14:34.660
I'm going to match that to the human [inaudible] six.
Um,

245
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.900
and those are definitely things that,
that we have lined up to do.
Um,

246
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:43.760
the other thing that we've done is simply try and use fax as a tool to match

247
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.030
homologous,
uh,
facial movements.
So,
um,

248
00:14:47.031 --> 00:14:50.420
movements that we believe are derive from a common ancestor.

249
00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.340
So could ask the question,

250
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:55.950
do chimpanzee expressions resemble any human,
uh,

251
00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.140
basic facial expressions?
And when we do that,
um,
like I said,

252
00:15:00.141 --> 00:15:02.590
chimpanzees don't have a lot of upper facial movements.

253
00:15:02.591 --> 00:15:05.600
So if you kind of discount some of the upper facial movements,

254
00:15:05.601 --> 00:15:10.601
you can match chimpanzee facial expressions to a surprising variety of everyday

255
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:16.430
human emotions like joy and surprise and,
and sadness and excitement.

256
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.050
Um,
and,
and,
and those line up in terms of the actual movements that are,

257
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.030
that are used to produce those expressions.

258
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.930
<v 0>Thank you so much for speaking about your work.</v>

259
00:15:25.931 --> 00:15:29.120
I know this is something that a lot of people in the,
you know,

260
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:30.370
study of human emotion,

261
00:15:30.371 --> 00:15:33.820
want to know how much we can also understand the emotions of non humans.

262
00:15:33.821 --> 00:15:38.460
And so your work has just done a really beautiful job beginning to lay those

263
00:15:38.461 --> 00:15:41.140
steps out for how we can even begin to quantify,
you know,

264
00:15:41.141 --> 00:15:45.490
something like an emotion expression.
And so I wanted to ask you,
you know,

265
00:15:45.491 --> 00:15:48.640
it sounds like you have some steps in line for where you want to take the

266
00:15:48.641 --> 00:15:51.220
research next.
And I wonder from your perspective,

267
00:15:51.221 --> 00:15:54.820
sort of where do you see the future of emotion in this field headed?

268
00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.900
<v 1>That's a great question.</v>

269
00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.920
It's such a complicated topic and I'm not sure that we're much closer in the

270
00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:07.110
last few years and really understanding at a philosophical level what emotion

271
00:16:07.111 --> 00:16:11.200
and animals really is.
Um,
there are a number of,
uh,

272
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:15.970
exciting young investigators who are working in this area.
And you know,

273
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.090
I think just like in,
in human work,

274
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:22.830
what we need to be careful of is having really deep,
uh,
descriptions of behavior,

275
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.860
uh,
and understanding that behavior,
um,

276
00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:30.890
in terms of the context in which the expressions are used and the subtle

277
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.830
nuances.
So these micro expressions.
And so it's really,
I think,

278
00:16:34.831 --> 00:16:39.831
getting away from the kind of static pictures of prototypical expressions and

279
00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.190
getting down into the,

280
00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:45.900
into the trenches in terms of everyday communication and exactly what,
uh,

281
00:16:45.901 --> 00:16:47.310
what the animals are doing.
And,

282
00:16:47.311 --> 00:16:51.480
and I think for that there's going to need to be a little bit of a revolution in

283
00:16:51.481 --> 00:16:56.430
how we study these sorts of things.
You know,
I can't ask my animals to,
you know,

284
00:16:56.431 --> 00:17:01.170
sit behind the camera and look perfectly,
uh,
face forward and,
uh,
you know,

285
00:17:01.171 --> 00:17:04.180
I'm studying them in that particular context.
So we need to,
you know,

286
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:08.120
find a way to get cameras on the ground and,
you know,
integrate,
um,

287
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.760
the perspective of lots of different cameras so that we can actually sort of get

288
00:17:11.761 --> 00:17:16.380
down at their level and,
and,
um,
and um,
you know,
um,
look at it from that,

289
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.150
from that point of view,
from their point of view.

290
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.040
<v 0>So what advice then do you have for future students who are thinking about</v>

291
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:27.420
embarking in this study of emotion in particular,
studying in emotion,
you know,

292
00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:30.180
in nonhumans chimpanzees for example.

293
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:35.810
<v 1>Wow.
Um,
well be objective.
Um,
it's,
it's really,</v>

294
00:17:35.811 --> 00:17:37.890
really difficult to,
uh,

295
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:42.770
think about emotion and other animals without invoking our own emotion.
Um,

296
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:47.540
it's really just impossible because we see things through our eyes and,

297
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:48.260
um,

298
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:53.160
I think just back and being objective and making sure that,

299
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.870
you know,
it's the science and the results that are,
that are speaking,
um,

300
00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:01.440
as opposed to,
you know,
using our own,
um,
um,
you know,
um,

301
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.500
perceptions and,
um,
you know,
we have to,

302
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.420
we have to just make sure that we're being as objective as possible and,
um,

303
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.353
it's challenging.

304
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.480
<v 0>Well,
amidst all the challenges,</v>

305
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.780
you've continued to do what I think is some of the most amazing work in this

306
00:18:15.781 --> 00:18:16.231
field.

307
00:18:16.231 --> 00:18:20.370
So I just want to thank you for speaking with us today and being part of this,

308
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.610
you know,
series and understanding emotion better.

309
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.170
<v 1>That's an exciting thing.
Thank you very much for having me.
Appreciate it.</v>

310
00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.093
<v 0>Thank you.</v>

311
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.990
So this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Doctor Lisa [inaudible]

312
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.320
from Emory university.
