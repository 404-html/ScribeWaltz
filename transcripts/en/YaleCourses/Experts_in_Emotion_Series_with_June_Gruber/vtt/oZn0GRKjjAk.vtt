1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.510
So I'd like to start off today by echoing a common observation that many of us

2
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.310
have either experienced or thought to ourselves.

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.850
And that's the thought that bad things happen.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.230
So during the course of a normal lifespan,
we all encounter difficulty,

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.780
whether it's mourning the loss of a loved one,

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.470
enduring events of violence as well as life threatening events.

7
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.250
These events can be deeply distressing and even debilitating.

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.040
And when we think of trauma,
we think of,
you know,

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.300
repercussions that span many,
many years afterwards.

10
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.670
So before we begin today,

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.760
I'd like to do a thought exercise with you and ask you to think about a time in

12
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:48.690
your life that was a very difficult event.
Now,
as you recall,

13
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:51.000
this typical and perhaps even traumatic event,

14
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.600
I'd like you to think about how you would describe what that event was.

15
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.040
So what triggered or elicited a particular emotional reaction?

16
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.150
How was that emotional reaction?
How did you react to the difficulty event?

17
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.280
How was that feeling in your body and how long did it last for?

18
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.450
So I'd like you to take a moment and think about it.
You can pause the video.

19
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.710
And when you're done thinking about it and recalling it as vividly as possible,

20
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.430
I'd like you to resume the video cause what we're going to do today is just

21
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:24.810
think about how we cope with trauma and the different trajectories people take

22
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:26.340
when they cope well with trauma.

23
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.790
And when we struggle and have difficulty coping with traumatic and difficult

24
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:30.624
life events.

25
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.410
This is going to begin our first part of a three part series on emotional
health.

26
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.830
Today we'll be starting with resilience.
Really asking this question,

27
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:44.280
is it really true that what doesn't kill you actually can make you stronger?

28
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.090
We'll be doing it as follows.
So our roadmap today,

29
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:53.091
we'll start with the concept of what we have traditionally studied and known in

30
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:55.590
the field of trauma and emotional health.

31
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.560
Then we'll turn to this concept of resilience with seat,

32
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:02.910
which seems to be a somewhat lighter side of how people respond to and cope with

33
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:06.300
trauma.
Concluding with our takeaway questions and expert interview.

34
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.100
So let's begin with trauma and how it relates to our emotional health.

35
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.120
So traditionally the emphasis on trauma and emotional health was really

36
00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:21.840
assessing how people frequently fail to cope with trauma.

37
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.910
And this was really in the realm of clinical psychology or looking at the Dsm,

38
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:29.730
the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.

39
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.300
It was really looking at psychopathological responses to trauma.

40
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:38.010
So here the focus was often on what we think of as extreme responses to trauma.

41
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.370
So examples include chronic grief,
depression,

42
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.000
and a very classic example of the kinds of difficulties people have when

43
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:50.001
confronting traumatic life experiences is PTSD or post traumatic stress

44
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:53.190
disorder.
So if we look into the DSM and open it up,

45
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.330
we see that the criteria for post traumatic stress disorder includes one

46
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.870
encountering a stress or being exposed to a traumatic event to having some

47
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:05.980
intrusive recollections of the trauma that is persistently re-experienced even

48
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:07.990
after the event has absolved.

49
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.110
Third as a sort of avoidant or numbing style.

50
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:14.830
So avoiding things that might remind you of that particular trauma or feeling

51
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:17.740
just a general sense of what people describe as emotionally numb.

52
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.020
You also see physiological hyperarousal and this duration is really prolonged,

53
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:28.021
so it must last at least one month continuously and cause significant impairment

54
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:33.160
across social,
occupational,
or other important areas of functioning.
So again,

55
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:37.210
the original emphasis and we think about trauma has been on how people fail to

56
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:41.710
cope well with trauma and the kinds of difficulties that are encapsulated in an

57
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:44.800
individual who's having trouble coping with a traumatic life.

58
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:48.670
Events such as in the case of PTSD.
Now,

59
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.690
although this is very important and it helps us develop treatments to alleviate

60
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:55.570
suffering among individuals suffering from either PTSD,

61
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.030
depression or chronic grief,
for example,

62
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.590
the emphasis really is on a certain kind of slice of the population.

63
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:06.460
So what we're really getting is the emphasis on psychopathology are the ways in

64
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:10.600
which people don't cope well with trauma.
So this leads to a sampling bias,
right?

65
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.340
And really begs the question of,
well,
what about the rest of the population?

66
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.790
You know,
how do other people cope with trauma who don't suffer these cane?

67
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.060
Same kinds of symptoms and for an extreme duration of time.

68
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.020
So this is work done by George Bonanno and colleagues where they've really tried

69
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:30.040
to map out different trajectories of responding to traumatic events.

70
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.910
So here you can see disruption and functioning on the left side followed by a

71
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:37.780
traumatic event and looking at the ways people respond even one year and two

72
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:38.980
years after the event.

73
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.140
So what we see first is the kind of response that we typically characterize an

74
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:49.000
associate with psychopathology,
PTSD for example,
right?
However,

75
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.210
and what we see here is there's a traumatic event and there's some disruption in

76
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:55.450
functioning when the event occurs and it relevant a persist at a relatively

77
00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:59.230
stable high level,
even up to two years after the event.

78
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.730
Now what's important to think about here is this is just one way a person can

79
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:07.660
respond to a traumatic event.
By contrast,
if you look here,

80
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.650
this is what's thought of as the normative or average response.

81
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.010
So although you do see a disruption and functioning when the initial event

82
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:15.790
occurs,

83
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.380
what you notice is over time a decrease in function and functional impairment,

84
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.390
you know,
one and two years later.

85
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.800
So the important point to think about here is that although some people respond

86
00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:30.520
this way and have you know long standing impairment,

87
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.930
most people don't.

88
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.940
Most people seem to suffer some disruption but that it absorbs over time.

89
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.580
And who is the slice of the population?

90
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.370
What is this normative or average response to,
you know,

91
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.080
encountering a traumatic event,
right?

92
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.500
So we can take this a step further as well and look at starting with what we had

93
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:58.280
before this kind of psychopathological or what's thought as a chronic response

94
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:01.760
to stressors.
So this is five to 30% of the population.

95
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.630
Then we can look at what we think of as recovery.

96
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:07.490
So these are the two lines we saw originally.

97
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.930
So recovery is sort of the normative response,
15 to 25% of the population.

98
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.380
And what you see here in white and yellow are two other groups of people.

99
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.080
You have people who have a delayed response to trauma.

100
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.670
So this is zero to 15% of the population and people who are resilient here at

101
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:26.870
the bottom.
Now what's interesting,
if you focus here on the bottom of resilience,

102
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:32.030
what you're seeing is that people are not showing a large increase in disruption

103
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:33.530
and functioning to the traumatic event,

104
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.460
and this remains relatively stable over time.
And what's really interesting here,

105
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:38.300
if you pay attention,

106
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.320
the resilient group at the bottom is the largest percent of the population.

107
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.310
So most people respond this way.

108
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.190
So this suggest one that we may be neglecting.

109
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:52.880
Very important individual variability and how we typically study trauma.

110
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.770
There's many different trajectories,

111
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:59.060
not just this chronic heightened level of functional impairment that we see in

112
00:06:59.061 --> 00:07:02.610
cases of psychopathology,
PTSD,
chronic grief,
et cetera.

113
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.430
And it also suggests that if we only focus on this top segment here,

114
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.960
we're likely to generate misleading conclusions about how everyone in the world

115
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:12.980
responds to trauma.

116
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.430
If we're focusing on just this one extreme subset of the population.

117
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.260
So although most,

118
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.520
many or some people may suffer a chronic and severe impairment following trauma,

119
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.140
many people don't.
And in fact it seems that most people don't.
So the Spanx,

120
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:28.160
the question of how do you,

121
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:33.161
most of the people in the population or how do most of us respond to trauma?

122
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.870
How do most of us recover from trauma?

123
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.200
How do we become resilient in other words?

124
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.160
So what we're really looking at here then,

125
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.330
so we draw these all line lines here,
all in gray.

126
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.290
The part that we're really focusing on here again is this yellow line,

127
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.730
the resilient line,
and again,
really begging the question of what is resiliency.

128
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:03.500
So now what I want to do is turn to resiliency and really focus on what might

129
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:06.860
think of as this lighter side of coping with trauma.

130
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.960
So it's interesting here from this graph and the takeaway question we'll walk

131
00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:15.350
through is that we are amazingly resilient creatures.

132
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.290
So if we think of those two trajectories we saw earlier,

133
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:21.950
the yellow line at the bottom,
the resilient line,
and the red line at the top,

134
00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:25.180
that kind of chronic and persistent functional impairment associated

135
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.380
psychopathology.
What we see,

136
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:30.080
and this is work largely done by George Banana and colleagues,

137
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.760
is that in response to a large variety of traumas,
bereavement,
terrorist attack,

138
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:39.500
a traumatic injury,
breast cancer surgery,
job loss,
divorce,

139
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.460
birth of a child combat deployment,
and even spinal cord lesion.

140
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.820
What you see by and large is that if you look at the percentage of people and

141
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.700
categorize them into these different groups,

142
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.880
the majority of people show a resilient type of response course over time in

143
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.520
response to these different traumatic events above and beyond that,
um,

144
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.250
compared to a more chronic and persistent course.

145
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.600
So this just suggests that we are amazingly resilient and in fact profoundly

146
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:09.720
resilient and response to things that seem like they would be absolutely

147
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:14.010
incapacitating.
Things that we can't imagine getting over terrorist attack,

148
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:17.040
spinal cord injuries.
But yet most of us do,

149
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:22.230
we seem to bounce back from traumas and do so in a way that seems to span all

150
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:26.310
different kinds of domains.
So how are we these amazingly,

151
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:28.800
profoundly resilient human beings?

152
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.910
So let's start by defining what resiliency is.

153
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.790
So we talked about the theory of bouncing back from trauma.

154
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.470
So it's resiliency has been defined on the one hand as an individual's tendency

155
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.300
to cope with stress and adversity,

156
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.540
adversity and a really important component of resilience.

157
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:49.590
And I always think of a bouncing ball because it's really about responding to

158
00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:54.180
stress and adversity by rebounding or bouncing back that even though there may

159
00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:57.240
be some temporary disruption and an individual's functioning,

160
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:01.320
what you're seeing is that after the event they do bounce back to their baseline

161
00:10:01.321 --> 00:10:05.940
levels of functioning.
And when we think of resiliency and adjustment,

162
00:10:05.941 --> 00:10:10.740
there's a really um,
you know,
important couple take home points to think about.

163
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.590
So resiliency and adjustment as you can see here.

164
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:18.090
So resiliency is associated with an absence of symptoms and reported

165
00:10:18.091 --> 00:10:22.350
psychological distress associated with an increased level of mental health and

166
00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:27.180
functioning as associated with increased positive adjustment as rated by close

167
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:29.100
friends and relatives.
And finally,

168
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:33.570
resilience is increase associated with increased positive experiences including

169
00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:36.900
positive images of the self as well as images of comfort.

170
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.130
So what we're seeing is that resiliency across many domains of functioning is

171
00:10:41.131 --> 00:10:42.900
predicting positive adjustment.

172
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:48.390
So we know that resiliency promotes adaptive adjustment in response to trauma.

173
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.200
But then this begs the question,
right?

174
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.230
Why are some people more resilient than others?

175
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.980
So we know that many of us are resilient in response to stressors,

176
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.460
but why are some more resilient than others?
Now,

177
00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:06.420
some caveats before we really delve into this question is that,
you know,

178
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.400
this is a heterogeneous category.

179
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.760
We're talking about different people with different experiences and different

180
00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:15.420
backgrounds and there's likely many different routes to the same end.

181
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:19.230
So many different ways in which someone can be resilient or become resilient.

182
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:24.510
And there's often multiple and sometimes unexpected predictors.
That being said,

183
00:11:24.511 --> 00:11:27.570
let me show you a glimpse of the literature that highlights different kinds of

184
00:11:27.571 --> 00:11:32.571
factors that promote and predict why some people may be more resilient than

185
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:33.624
others.

186
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.650
So if we look at factors that are related to pre event,

187
00:11:38.651 --> 00:11:42.630
so these are individual difference factors before the trauma has occurred that

188
00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:45.960
predict increased resiliency when the trauma unfolds.

189
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.890
So we look at those factors such as the individual's age and gender,

190
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.740
how prepared they are for the trauma,

191
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.340
sort of how do they have the appropriate mobilization resources in play.
Um,

192
00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:01.270
if it's something that they can predict maybe such as an earthquake or a storm,

193
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.170
have they had prior exposure to that particular type of trauma?

194
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.550
Do they have the economic resources to effectively combat the trauma and bounce

195
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:11.680
back from it?
And interestingly,

196
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.590
do they have beliefs that are often predictive of resiliency,

197
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:19.590
such as acceptance of death or sense of greater justice in the world?
Um,

198
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.880
did they have increased social support?

199
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.080
Cognitive styles like being more optimistic or feeling that they're more self

200
00:12:26.081 --> 00:12:29.360
efficacious in the world?
These are a list of,
uh,
uh,

201
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:34.450
factors that we know promote greater resilience that individuals may possess or

202
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:36.550
not before a trauma occurs.

203
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.540
Now what about factors that are associated with resilience after the traumatic

204
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:44.110
event has occurred?
And we think of these as post event factors.

205
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.100
Now some of these factors include,
um,

206
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:52.150
and that predict often a difficulty or decreases Lillian's include a loss of

207
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:56.710
adequate resources to cope with the trauma.
They have a less,
um,

208
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.880
sort of a deep sense of searching for meaning in the trauma.

209
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.570
So they're not trying to sort of find some greater meaning out of the event.

210
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.670
They worry more,
ruminate more,
they have increased ongoing stress,

211
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.400
fewer coping skills,
more difficulty.

212
00:13:12.401 --> 00:13:15.880
Cognitively reappraising which we talked about is one of the core emotion

213
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:18.640
regulation strategies discussed earlier in the course,

214
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.780
decreased positive emotion and trouble engaging what we think of as emotional

215
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:23.740
flexibility.

216
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:29.070
So a decreased level of all of these factors here would predict worse

217
00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:33.610
resiliency,
whereas a higher,
uh,
degree of,
of of,
you know,

218
00:13:33.611 --> 00:13:35.710
reappraisal,
coping,
positive emotion,

219
00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.060
flexibility would predict increased resilience after the traumatic event has

220
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:40.894
occurred.

221
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.540
What are some features that help answer this question too as to why or some

222
00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:49.480
individuals more resilient than others?
Well,

223
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.720
there's been worked by George Bonanno and colleagues that have talked about this

224
00:13:52.721 --> 00:13:57.460
idea of having a flexible use of regulatory strategies and behaviors.

225
00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:02.200
And he talks about three central components that help predict resiliency.

226
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.610
So one of them had calls,
context sensitivity,
the second is repertoire.

227
00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:09.070
And the third is the use of feedback from others.

228
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.760
Now I'm going to go through the first two here and really flesh out what he's

229
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:14.920
talking about when he says that,
you know,

230
00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:18.730
an important feature of resiliency is having context sensitivity as well as a

231
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:22.390
repertoire.
So let's think about context sensitivity.

232
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.470
So what George Manana is talking about here when he defined cause context

233
00:14:26.471 --> 00:14:31.471
sensitivity is this idea of really trying to match your regulatory behavior to

234
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:33.100
the situational demand.

235
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.510
So that may be reappraising when the time is right or suppressing your outward

236
00:14:37.511 --> 00:14:40.450
displays of emotion if that's what the situation calls for.

237
00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.340
So what he's really trying to talk about,

238
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:45.940
and I think about this as sort of puzzle pieces fitting together is really

239
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:48.790
fitting the kinds of behaviors,
the kinds of emotions,

240
00:14:48.791 --> 00:14:53.480
the kinds of regulatory strategies you use to that particular context.

241
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.660
So really kind of fine tuning and honing or having your responses be sensitive

242
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.690
to whatever the situational demands or whatever the context calls for.

243
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.590
So this is what he talks about when he talks about context sensitivity.
Um,

244
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.800
what we see interesting is individuals who report increased depression.
Um,

245
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:15.260
both chronically and following traumatic life events don't have context

246
00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:16.790
sensitive responses.
They seem,

247
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.080
they seem to show the same rigid pattern of emotional responses regardless of

248
00:15:21.081 --> 00:15:24.260
the event in front of them,
regardless of the environmental situation.

249
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.730
So really being flexible,

250
00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:29.510
really trying to fit and hone your emotional behaviors to the environment is one

251
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:31.610
of the most central factors.

252
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.760
George Manana would argue that helps promote resiliency.

253
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.660
The other one is this notion of repertoire,
right?

254
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.200
So here he talks about the idea of a toolbox,
right?

255
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:47.180
So you want to have not just one kind of response or one kind of strategy that

256
00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:50.450
you use every time you encounter a trauma,
right?

257
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:54.800
So he says you want to have a wide toolbox of possible regulatory behaviors and

258
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:55.634
strategies.

259
00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:00.230
And he would say in this toolbox that no one tool is going to fit every

260
00:16:00.231 --> 00:16:01.070
situation.

261
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:06.370
That is not all strategies to cope with trauma are either inherently good or

262
00:16:06.381 --> 00:16:08.360
bad.
So earlier on in the course,

263
00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:12.290
we talked about suppression as an emotion regulation strategy that's associated

264
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:15.470
with inhibiting outward displays of emotion.
In the face,

265
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.100
and we talked about this in light of James grosses work,

266
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.520
finding that people who tend to use suppression on a regular basis tend to be

267
00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:25.790
associated with greater negative affect,
lower positive effect,

268
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.880
and overall lower wellbeing.
What one caveat in this research is,

269
00:16:30.881 --> 00:16:33.530
is that it may suggest that suppressions all bad,

270
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.250
but it's always a maladaptive type of regulatory behavior.
Well,

271
00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:41.240
George Macdonald's work has actually suggested that suppression is not always

272
00:16:41.241 --> 00:16:42.110
bad,
right?

273
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:47.270
And it's more about when you exhibit suppression that suggest whether or not

274
00:16:47.271 --> 00:16:52.040
it's going to ultimately be in your favor to suppress your expressions or not.

275
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:56.480
So he would say that really the expression of suppression,
so to speak.

276
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.930
Um,
in other words,
whether you're going to inhibit your emotions,

277
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.700
suppress them or let them out and express them is not as important as whether or

278
00:17:04.701 --> 00:17:06.320
not you have,
you would say in quotes,

279
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:11.350
the ability to flexibly enhance or suppress emotional expression in accord with

280
00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:13.130
the situational demands.

281
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:17.300
So he would say that what this really requires here is a repertoire that

282
00:17:17.301 --> 00:17:22.190
consists of what he calls expressive flexibility as well as positive emotions

283
00:17:22.191 --> 00:17:24.260
signaling.
And I'll walk through each of these right now.

284
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.960
So when it comes to expressive flexibility,

285
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.110
George Bonanno and colleagues argued this is incredibly important.

286
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:35.210
So what they did to study expressive flexibility,
um,
was to con con,
uh,

287
00:17:35.211 --> 00:17:39.050
design and experimental study where they asked participants to either try to

288
00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:43.280
enhance or amplify their emotional responses or suppress them or dampen them.

289
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.360
And he did this among adults who had lost their spouse one and a half to three

290
00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:51.150
years earlier compared to at all,
to had not lost their spouse.

291
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.800
And among the adults who had lost their spouse,
he broke them into two groups.

292
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.950
One of them he called the complicated grief group,
who exhibited,
um,

293
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.440
difficulty following the loss of a spouse and unresolved grief as well as those

294
00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:08.340
who are relatively asymptomatic following the bereavement of their spouse.

295
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.900
Now here's what you found.

296
00:18:09.901 --> 00:18:13.110
So you can see the Mary Group and white and the asymptomatic bereaved group and

297
00:18:13.111 --> 00:18:16.110
gray and the complicated grief group in red.

298
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:21.420
So what he found is that bereaved adults who are suffering from suffering from

299
00:18:21.421 --> 00:18:26.010
complicated grief,
exhibited a decreased ability to enhance their emotions.

300
00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:29.250
So you can see the red bar on the left is lower than the gray and white bar

301
00:18:29.251 --> 00:18:32.310
compared to the other two groups.
And that's for enhancement.

302
00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:35.460
So they had a harder time trying to enhance their emotional expressions.

303
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:36.780
Interestingly,

304
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:41.460
the complicated grief group and read also showed difficulty,
um,

305
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.440
suppressing their emotions as well.

306
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.750
So when they are asked to suppress their emotions,

307
00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:49.200
they did a much poorer job compared to the other two groups as well.

308
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.230
When they are trying to bring their emotion,
Stan,

309
00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.630
you can actually see they showed more emotional expressively compared to the

310
00:18:54.631 --> 00:18:56.520
married in asymptomatic brief group.

311
00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:01.380
So this suggests that it's not about whether you suppress or whether you express

312
00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:02.214
your emotions,

313
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.210
but it suggests that the ability to flexibly move your emotional expressions up

314
00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:06.930
and down,

315
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:11.480
almost like having a really flexible lever in your emotional repertoire signals

316
00:19:11.481 --> 00:19:16.481
something really important and a key factor that's related to the ability to be

317
00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:19.470
resilient in the face of trauma and loss.

318
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.000
And I also talked about positive and emotional signaling as a really important

319
00:19:24.001 --> 00:19:28.770
factor that banana argues is key and coping with trauma and a factor related to

320
00:19:28.771 --> 00:19:29.880
increased resilience.

321
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.910
So this is actually something we talked about earlier in the course and we were

322
00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:36.570
talking about the function of laughter and I want to review it now in light of

323
00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:40.950
this idea that positive emotional signaling may also help us cope better with

324
00:19:40.951 --> 00:19:43.440
trauma.
So as you remember,
he could,

325
00:19:43.441 --> 00:19:47.400
George Bonanno and Dacher Keltner conducted a study looking at laughter

326
00:19:47.401 --> 00:19:50.520
following bereavement and suggesting that predicts better outcomes.

327
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:54.540
So in this study they had 45 adults come into the laboratory who spouse had

328
00:19:54.541 --> 00:19:56.370
recently died in the past six months.

329
00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.300
And here they tried to address the question systematically of whether or not

330
00:20:00.301 --> 00:20:04.740
laughter indeed promotes healing from this absolutely devastating loss of one's

331
00:20:04.741 --> 00:20:05.574
partner.

332
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.350
They conducted an interview with spouses where they ask them to tell me about

333
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:14.520
your relationship with your deceased partner and the participant at six minutes

334
00:20:14.521 --> 00:20:17.430
to share this verbal narrative in response to this question.

335
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.810
And what they did is they then videotaped and coded expressions of laughter

336
00:20:21.811 --> 00:20:24.850
during this narrative and found that those,
um,

337
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.680
widows who are able to laugh with telling them about the relationship with their

338
00:20:28.681 --> 00:20:32.070
deceased partner predict reduce levels of grief.

339
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.730
As you can see here at 14 and 15 months post loss.

340
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.150
So this is suggesting it's something about signaling positive emotion in the

341
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:39.840
face.

342
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.980
May also help people take almost some sort of mental vacation from grief and

343
00:20:43.981 --> 00:20:48.790
suffering and allow them to rebound back and resilient,
uh,
you know,

344
00:20:48.791 --> 00:20:52.480
even one to two years later.
So in sum,

345
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.860
we know that bad things happen,
right?
Um,

346
00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.520
and some people become very severely distressed and struggle while others seem

347
00:21:00.521 --> 00:21:03.550
to be generally okay.
And there's multiple,

348
00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:07.720
an unexpected predictors of who does and who doesn't do well and there's no one

349
00:21:07.721 --> 00:21:10.510
predictor that explains it all.
It's a mix of social,

350
00:21:10.511 --> 00:21:15.010
economic personality and coping resources.
Then maybe even a bit of luck.

351
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:19.510
But most of us seem to be able to bounce back and seem to have some degree of

352
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:22.450
resiliency in us.
And what's really important,

353
00:21:22.451 --> 00:21:25.840
we think about the study of human emotion is that what predicts who and her who

354
00:21:25.841 --> 00:21:30.040
are not resilient seems to relate to some key emotional factors.

355
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.360
And this includes being flexible about our emotions when we experience them and

356
00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:37.450
when we express them,
whether we increase or decrease them,

357
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:42.010
as well as having the ability to signal positive emotions to others in the face

358
00:21:42.011 --> 00:21:46.540
of trauma and in resolving a trauma and coping with it in the aftermath.

359
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.980
So with that,
I'd like to now turn to our takeaway questions

360
00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:53.920
first.

361
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.790
How would you characterize the earlier more clinically focused approaches to

362
00:21:57.791 --> 00:22:01.600
understanding trauma from a Dsm clinical science perspective?

363
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.010
Second,

364
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.700
what is the distinction between resilient and chronic responses to trauma?

365
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.770
So think about the different types of graphs who showed,

366
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.610
showing the longitudinal trajectories of different response styles to trauma.

367
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:14.260
And finally,

368
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:18.820
how would you define what resiliency is and what are some of the key features

369
00:22:18.821 --> 00:22:21.280
that were discussed by George Bonanno in colleagues?

370
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.870
I'll now turn to our experts in emotion interview series.

371
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.230
So for experts in emotion interview,

372
00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.950
we'll be speaking with Dr. George Bonanno on emotion and resilience.

373
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.750
Dr Banano is a professor of clinical psychology and director of the loss trauma

374
00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:41.650
and emotion lab in the Department of Counseling and clinical psychology at

375
00:22:41.651 --> 00:22:43.630
Teachers College,
Columbia University.

376
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.610
He received his phd from Yale University in 1991 and has been a visiting

377
00:22:48.611 --> 00:22:51.580
professor at the University of Hong Kong and in Italy.

378
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.810
Professor Bananas Interests Center on the question of how human beings cope with

379
00:22:55.811 --> 00:22:56.291
loss,

380
00:22:56.291 --> 00:23:01.120
trauma and other forms of extreme adversity with an emphasis on resilience as

381
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:04.510
well as the saluatory role of emotion regulatory processes.

382
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.560
His recent empirical and theoretical work has focused on defining and

383
00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:12.970
documenting resilience in the face of loss or potentially traumatic events.

384
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:17.830
This includes disaster,
the death of loved ones,
terrorist attacks,
bio epidemics,

385
00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:21.700
traumatic injury and life threatening injuries and medical events.

386
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.600
He also focuses on identifying the range of psychological and contextual

387
00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:29.530
variables that predict both psychopathological as well as resigned outcomes,

388
00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:31.420
as well as other patterns of outcomes,

389
00:23:31.421 --> 00:23:34.150
including gradual recovery and delayed reactions.

390
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:37.720
Dr Bonanno's work has been funded by the National Institutes of Health,

391
00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.780
the National Science Foundation,
and the Rockefeller Foundation,

392
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.020
and featured in various print television and radio media,

393
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:49.220
including the new times science news,
Scientific American Wall Street Journal,

394
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:54.200
The Washington Post time,
Newsweek,
CNN,
2020 and NPR.

395
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:58.910
He's also co edited the book,
emotion,
current issues and future directions.

396
00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:03.020
And recently authored the other side of sadness with the new science of

397
00:24:03.021 --> 00:24:05.780
bereavement can tell us about life after loss.

398
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:09.890
So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Dr. George Bonanno.
