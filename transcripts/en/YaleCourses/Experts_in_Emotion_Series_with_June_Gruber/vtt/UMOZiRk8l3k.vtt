00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.760
Welcome to human emotion psychology.
One third one.
I'm June Gruber,

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.180
a professor in the psychology department at Yale University.

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.440
Emotions are part of our everyday life.

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.910
Let's consider some of the emotions perhaps you experienced today.

5
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.220
Perhaps you felt irritated at your alarm clock,
waking up too early,

6
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.150
or maybe perhaps you were very excited and delighted by seeing your iPod

7
00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:34.270
happening to play one of your most favorite songs as you were getting ready in

8
00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:35.104
the morning.

9
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.950
<v 1>Then again,
yeah,</v>

10
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.360
<v 0>perhaps you may have felt a pang of embarrassment when you tripped buying your</v>

11
00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:48.040
morning coffee in front of that same Barisa that you just can't seem to get the

12
00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:52.290
courage to introduce yourself too.
Indeed,

13
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:56.490
emotions are part of our everyday life and in addition to these anecdotal

14
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:57.324
examples,

15
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.540
emotions serve really critical and important parts of who we are and what makes

16
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:05.460
us human.
Um,
for example,
one,

17
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.950
we know emotions motivate behaviors.

18
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.050
They really push us towards achieving our goals and help us shy away from

19
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:18.051
important dangers and threats to emotions are a kind of social glue.

20
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.560
There's social glue that not only bring us towards other people,

21
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.570
but they keep us in lifelong bonds with friends as well as partners.

22
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.490
And then finally,
emotions are also critical to our health.

23
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.360
We see that they underline not only our mental wellbeing,

24
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.260
but they actually facilitate and promote our physical wellbeing.

25
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.240
So emotions do a lot of amazing things for us.
But the question is,

26
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.300
how can this one thing called emotion do so many things for us and be such a

27
00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:53.040
critical part of our everyday life.

28
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.900
How did emotions evolve to be bees?
Things for us in the first place?

29
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.770
And are they something that is unique to us as humans?

30
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.780
Or is it something that we see across all species?
Uh,
and finally,

31
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.740
in what way can we sort of take these emotions,

32
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:13.200
these things that serves so many functions for us,

33
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.190
that sort of color and underlie our everyday experiences?

34
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.750
How can we sort of take in,

35
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:23.040
harness them to build and lead more healthy lives?

36
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.550
So these are some of the questions that we're going to be looking at in this

37
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:28.200
course on human emotion.

38
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.010
And the hope is that you'll be able to understand some of these puzzles better.

39
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.510
And part of what's interesting and fascinating about understanding these puzzles

40
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:41.370
through the lens of human emotion is that you get exposed to a wide variety of

41
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.140
perspectives and techniques.
So you can see here by studying emotion,

42
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.041
um,

43
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:52.020
we're really sort of getting into fields not only in psychology but also in

44
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:55.350
neuroscience,
economics,
computer science,

45
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:57.150
and even art and music.

46
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.560
And I'm going show you today how the course will achieve these aims by using a

47
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:04.540
roadmap to guide you through the lecture.

48
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.710
So first I'll start with some core questions and topics that the course will

49
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:09.544
entertain.

50
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.990
Then we'll turn to logistics about how the course will be structured and operate

51
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.860
and we'll conclude with some takeaway questions that will summarize the key

52
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:19.810
points from today's lecture.

53
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.340
So let's begin with some sample questions and topics.
This course will address.

54
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.530
We'll start with perhaps the age old and puzzling question of what exactly is an

55
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:32.824
emotion.

56
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.070
Then we'll discuss to what extent emotions are evolutionarily evolved versus

57
00:03:40.071 --> 00:03:41.750
more culturally constructed.

58
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.350
We'll also examine questions such as,
why do we laugh?

59
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.010
Why do we cry and is this healthy for us?

60
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.940
And then we'll want to understand,
you know,

61
00:03:58.941 --> 00:04:03.941
how can we design studies that elicit and reliably measure emotional responses,

62
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.130
do culture and age change and transform our emotions,

63
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.440
who we are and what we feel.

64
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.500
And for many of us,
we often wonder,
can we,

65
00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:27.330
by learning about emotions actually learned to read other people's emotions.

66
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.430
As you can see here,
yes,

67
00:04:32.431 --> 00:04:33.690
our brain emotional.

68
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.520
So our brain was once solely thought to be devoted to rational thinking.

69
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.350
Can it also be devoted to emotional feelings and emotional thinking?

70
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.011
That is,

71
00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:48.870
can we find certain parts of the brain and how it operates that gives rise to

72
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:50.880
our everyday emotional life.

73
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.373
<v 1>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.930
<v 0>And although this is a class on human emotions,</v>

75
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.910
we'll examine whether are not too distant monkey relatives as well as our canine

76
00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:06.290
companions also have emotions.
And if they do have emotions,

77
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.840
how similar or different are they?
From our own?

78
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.543
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

79
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.570
<v 0>And Ken emotion go awry.</v>

80
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.810
That is can too much sadness as well as too much happiness can not give rise to

81
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.820
not only mental difficulties but also ways in which um,

82
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.080
emotions can really no longer serve the function that they were intended or

83
00:05:30.081 --> 00:05:31.250
designed to serve.

84
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.413
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.840
<v 0>And really what does sex have to do with it?
Another words,
you know,</v>

86
00:05:38.841 --> 00:05:43.460
how does sex play a role in our emotional life and our emotions?
Like desire,

87
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.980
really emotions in the first place.

88
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.230
Do our emotions make us more self conscious or self aware?

89
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.260
Emotions like shame and embarrassment.

90
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.490
Pride are some of the motions we'll talk about when we think about the issue of

91
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:04.400
whether or not emotions make us more self conscious.

92
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.663
<v 1>Okay.</v>

93
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.950
<v 0>And does our wallet reflect our internal feelings?</v>

94
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.880
In other words,
can money really buy happiness?

95
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.630
Is sleep a form of overnight therapy?

96
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.460
Here we'll examine the important role that researchers are finding that sleep

97
00:06:29.461 --> 00:06:34.461
plays in restoring our emotional wellbeing all while we're laying in bed fast

98
00:06:35.581 --> 00:06:36.414
asleep

99
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.140
and we'll conclude the course on a positive note regarding this important

100
00:06:44.141 --> 00:06:48.280
question to all of us of how can we attain happiness?

101
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.260
A theme that as you can see here is a very popular and prevalent theme taking

102
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:56.320
flight,
especially in us culture.
Um,

103
00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.030
we're more and more interested in understanding what makes us happy and are we

104
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:04.720
doing the right things to maximize and stay happy

105
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.940
in answering some of these questions.
Um,
we'll try to cover the main,

106
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
main course objectives and I think of three domains of eject objectives that I

107
00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:22.820
hope you get out of this course in human emotion answering some of these

108
00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:23.654
questions.

109
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.650
The first is really to expose you to a variety of current issues and theories of

110
00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:34.880
emotion.
So different ways people have thought about and approach this topic.

111
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.300
Second,
um,

112
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.780
you'll get exposure to some of the most innovative and cutting edge scientific

113
00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:46.610
methods and ways of thinking about measuring and studying emotion.

114
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

115
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.690
<v 0>And then third,
and this is perhaps the most important course objective,</v>

116
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.820
is to instill a sense of curiosity and excitement in this new discipline.

117
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.230
Really,
human emotion has only taken flight in the past three decades.

118
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.770
So there's many questions as I bring up for you and we attempt to answer on this

119
00:08:04.771 --> 00:08:08.850
course.
There's many,
perhaps even more unanswered questions.

120
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:14.060
So I hope that this curiosity and excitement will propel you further on in your

121
00:08:14.311 --> 00:08:16.530
pursuit of understanding emotion better.

122
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:18.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:23.200
<v 0>Next I want to turn to some of the core structure and logistics to get a feel of</v>

124
00:08:23.201 --> 00:08:24.970
how will this course operate.

125
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:26.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

126
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.560
<v 0>So there's different domains of logistics that are important and really unique</v>

127
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:34.400
about this course.
I'm going to talk about the course website first,

128
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.610
then the videotape lectures,
what you're watching right now,

129
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.330
discussion sections and expert interviews.

130
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.840
So I'm just going to touch base first on the course website.

131
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.480
So here's an example of the course website.

132
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:52.250
You can see here on human emotion psychology one 31 taught by myself,

133
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:54.040
professor June grouper.
Um,

134
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:59.050
this website will have access not only to a calendar that will lay out all of

135
00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:01.110
the different readings and timeline,

136
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.880
but it will also have the requirements for the course materials that you can

137
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:10.530
download,
a including handouts,
slides and other related materials.

138
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.120
It'll have a website,
have links of interest,

139
00:09:13.121 --> 00:09:17.100
sort of looking at emotion and the broader pop culture and media,
um,

140
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.830
as well as contact information as well.

141
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.750
So this will be your kind of go to resource for a lot of important materials,

142
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.750
uh,
and guidelines that you'll be covering in the course.

143
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:29.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

144
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.900
<v 0>Next one really unique aspect of this course that may not be common props.</v>

145
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:37.980
It's the first time you've taken a course as such,
our videotape lectures.

146
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.120
So as you can see here and what you've been seeing today in the course is that,

147
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.320
um,
all of these lectures will be videotaped for you to watch at your own

148
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:49.260
convenience,
so at a time and place that works for you.

149
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.710
<v 1>Okay.</v>

150
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.900
<v 0>Third are the discussion sections.</v>

151
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.310
So you will have live discussion sections that will look something like this

152
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.670
where you'll be engaging in discussion with your other class members at the

153
00:10:02.671 --> 00:10:03.950
bottom here,
um,

154
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.140
as well as your instructor or teaching assistant for the course.
Um,

155
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.610
these will be meeting regularly and you'll be able to engage in interactive

156
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:16.320
exercises with your teacher as well as classmates as well as feel free to ask

157
00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:20.310
questions in this virtual discussion section.
Environments.

158
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.500
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

159
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.340
<v 0>And then finally,</v>

160
00:10:24.341 --> 00:10:28.210
and perhaps one of the most exciting pieces for me personally to share with you

161
00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:30.520
in this course are the expert interviews.

162
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:34.630
So this is what's called the experts and emotion interview series.

163
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.980
And here you're going to have the opportunity to hear conversations with

164
00:10:38.981 --> 00:10:42.160
visionary figures in the study of human emotion.

165
00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:47.460
And we'll have approximately one of these expert interviews that will nicely map

166
00:10:47.621 --> 00:10:51.640
onto the lecture component and content that you'll have covered that day.

167
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.100
So not only will you get to read about emotion,

168
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.530
watch the online video tape lectures,

169
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.810
discuss them with your classmates in section,

170
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.220
but also get to hear some of the leaders in the field talk about what they think

171
00:11:03.221 --> 00:11:07.390
are the most important aspects of studying emotion and where they see the face

172
00:11:07.391 --> 00:11:10.420
of the future headed.
They'll look something like this.

173
00:11:10.421 --> 00:11:14.920
So it will include a videotape conversation between an emotion expert such as on

174
00:11:14.921 --> 00:11:18.070
the left with me,
your professor for the course on the rights.

175
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.060
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

176
00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.040
<v 0>And to give you a sneak peak,</v>

177
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.580
here's a sample of some of the experts that you're going to have a chance to

178
00:11:24.581 --> 00:11:25.061
hear,

179
00:11:25.061 --> 00:11:30.061
speak about emotion as part of these expert interviews for the course.

180
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.913
<v 1>Okay.</v>

181
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.540
<v 0>And I want to conclude today with the takeaway questions.</v>

182
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:44.400
So here I'm going to cover three main points that I'd like to make sure that you

183
00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:46.620
got while watching this video tape lecture.

184
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.060
And I'll have take home questions at the end of every lecture module to assure

185
00:11:51.061 --> 00:11:55.240
that the main points that I hope were conveyed,
we're clearly,
um,
you know,

186
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.150
transmitted to you and that you know what you need to know.

187
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.130
So the three takeaway questions for this first lecture today include one,

188
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
what kinds of sample questions will you be able to answer by taking this course?

189
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:11.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

190
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:16.460
<v 0>To what are the three unique video components of this course?</v>

191
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.580
What makes this course unique as compared to more traditional classroom

192
00:12:20.581 --> 00:12:22.980
environment?
Uh,
settings.

193
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:24.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

194
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.630
<v 0>And then three,
and this is a really important logistical point,</v>

195
00:12:27.631 --> 00:12:32.631
I hope everyone knows where can you go to find the relevant course materials,

196
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.210
assignment,
due dates and associated readings.

197
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.630
So with that,
I want to welcome you to human emotion.
Um,

198
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.420
and here are some of the credits for the images discuss today in our slides.
