Uh,
Dr. Davidson is the William James and be lost professor of psychology and

3
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:15.090
psychiatry,
director of the wasteman brain imaging lab and the lab for affect of

4
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:16.080
neuroscience.

and the waysman center at the University of Wisconsin Madison.

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.660
Dr. Davidson Ref received his phd from Harvard in psychology and has been at the

8
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:31.890
University of Wisconsin,

24
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.330
So I now turn to our very esteemed experts and emotion interview with Dr.

25
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.100
Richard Davidson on an affect of neuroscience.
So welcome,
Richie.

26
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:39.750
Thank you for speaking with us today.

27
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.960
<v 1>Pleasure to be here,
Jim.
Thank you.</v>

28
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.040
<v 0>I'd like to talk with you,
uh,</v>

29
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.050
just by starting a bit about what first got you interested or started in the

30
00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:49.070
study of emotion.

31
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:52.760
So perhaps you can tell us a bit more about what first sparked your interest in

32
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:53.594
this topic.

33
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.320
<v 1>Sure.
Well,</v>

34
00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.240
I always had the conviction that emotion was the juice of life and,
uh,

35
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.740
it was responsible for what makes each of us unique.

36
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.720
Uh,
also,
uh,

37
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.750
what is critical for determining who may be resilient in the face of adversity,

38
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.120
who may be vulnerable.
Uh,

39
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.150
one of the things that also struck me about emotion was the extraordinary

40
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:28.221
variation across people in how each of us who responds to life slings and

41
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:31.370
arrows,
and,
um,

42
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.530
that is really one of the central things that has captured my attention over the

43
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.970
years and still remains a central focus of our research.

44
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.050
<v 0>That's wonderful.
And so speaking of your research,</v>

45
00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:47.750
I'd love to ask a few questions now just about that.

46
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.200
So your work really founded in paved the way for an entire field focused on

47
00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:56.480
looking at emotion through the lens of neuroscience.

48
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.150
And so when you think of an affect of neuroscience,

49
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.720
do you see as the most exciting discoveries

50
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.960
<v 1>we'll,
uh,</v>

51
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.550
if you look historically at this field,
uh,

52
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.230
originally when we all first began,
uh,

53
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.440
this study of emotion from the perspective of neuroscience was relegated to

54
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.390
rodent studies,
um,
uh,

55
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.460
and looking at relatively primitive kinds of emotional processes.

56
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.940
And I think there was a general,
um,

57
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.120
dogma in the field that emotion was something that happens subcortical Lee,

58
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.480
that it was,
um,

59
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.470
more primitive in certain ways.
Then cognition,

60
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:48.760
which is,
um,
uh,
um,
more,
uh,

61
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.560
associated with human rationality,
uh,
and,
uh,
uh,

62
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.750
associated with cortical function.

63
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.820
And one of the important breakthroughs I think was the understanding that,

64
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.890
um,
the,
uh,
the most evolutionary,
um,

65
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.520
most evolutionarily recent parts of the brain and the parts of the brain that

66
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:14.050
are distinctly human,
um,
participate very importantly in emotion,

67
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.250
uh,
including,
uh,
different areas of the cortex.
And,
uh,

68
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:24.270
that I think was really important in establishing the fact that emotion is

69
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:30.730
something that,
um,
uh,
is,
uh,
uh,

70
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:33.160
works intimately with cognition.

71
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.400
There are no regions of the brain that are exclusively dedicated to emotion.

72
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.963
And,
um,

73
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.060
the dichotomy between thought and emotion was really more a product of something

74
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:51.370
that,
um,
philosophers and scientists imposed on nature.

75
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.750
Then a distinction that actually is honored by the brain.

76
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.670
<v 0>So in your eyes right now,</v>

77
00:04:58.671 --> 00:05:02.810
what do you think are some of the most exciting discoveries of what we do know

78
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.870
about the way in which emotion is organized in the brain or the way in which we

79
00:05:08.271 --> 00:05:11.090
can understand emotion through the lens of neuroscience?

80
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.391
<v 1>Well,</v>

81
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:17.391
I think that neuroscience is giving us a handle on ways to think about or ways

82
00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:23.790
to parse variation in emotion or across people,
uh,

83
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.260
in,
um,
uh,

84
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.320
ways that were not obvious from strictly behavioral or,

85
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.920
um,
other kinds of psychological strictly psychological methods.

86
00:05:34.921 --> 00:05:36.450
So for example,
um,

87
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.460
one of the things that we've been very interested in is different parameters of

88
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:42.750
emotion regulation.
Now,

89
00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:47.751
while emotion regulations certainly has been studied for decades using methods

90
00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:51.390
that don't involve neuroscience,

91
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.760
one of the things that I think neuroscience has given us is um,
uh,

92
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.880
new ways to about regulation.

93
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:02.840
So one aspect of regulation that we've been studying from a neuroscientific

94
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:04.810
perspective is recovering.

95
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.850
That is the propensity to recover from a stressful or adverse event.

96
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.440
Uh,

97
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.440
and you can actually track variation or across people in the rapidity of

98
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:21.110
recovery in different neural systems.

99
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.310
And it turns out that that accounts for very important variants in certain

100
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:30.311
aspects of behavior that are not captured by conventional methods.

101
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:32.830
And this is,
uh,
a,

102
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.220
a distinction which I think comes directly from neuroscience and it's helped us

103
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:43.370
understand not just the brain mechanisms that on July it,

104
00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:46.020
but actually help provide,
um,

105
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.760
a new way of thinking about individual differences in emotion.

106
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.730
<v 0>Thank you.
And you know,
you mentioned individual differences in emotion.</v>

107
00:06:53.731 --> 00:06:58.590
It makes me think of your work that's really looked at variation and emotion in

108
00:06:58.591 --> 00:07:01.560
people who suffer from emotional disorders.
Um,

109
00:07:01.561 --> 00:07:04.740
and I wonder if you could share this a little bit about your work,
for example,

110
00:07:04.741 --> 00:07:06.840
on depression and the ways in which,
um,

111
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.410
their emotional brains may be different from those who aren't suffering from

112
00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:11.244
depression.

113
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.880
<v 1>Sure.
And actually that question,
uh,
uh,</v>

114
00:07:15.881 --> 00:07:20.860
allows me to also highlight some of the things that I think we can distinctly

115
00:07:20.861 --> 00:07:23.740
learn from a neuroscientific approach.

116
00:07:23.741 --> 00:07:28.420
One of the things that we found in recent work with depressed patients is that

117
00:07:28.421 --> 00:07:33.421
when you present a stimulus that's designed to elicit positive effect,

118
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.060
they actually show a transient response to a positive emotional stimulus.

119
00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:42.700
And this is individuals with a,
um,

120
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.210
a formal DSM diagnosis of major depression.

121
00:07:46.211 --> 00:07:49.630
So these are not simply dysphoric students.

122
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:52.910
These are real depressed patients,
uh,

123
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.970
and they show a transient response.

124
00:07:54.971 --> 00:07:59.971
But what distinguishes them is that they seem to lack the capacity to have that

125
00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:06.640
response be sustained over time.
Uh,
and um,
uh,

126
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:11.590
in a healthy person when something positive occurs,

127
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.130
there's a kind of of afterglow,
uh,
that persists.

128
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:20.131
And that afterglow is something that very importantly accounts for individual

129
00:08:22.091 --> 00:08:25.010
differences in,
um,
in,

130
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.270
in dispositional positive mood.
Uh,

131
00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:32.320
and so in the depressed patients,
they show this transient response,

132
00:08:32.321 --> 00:08:35.890
but it is a response that is not sustained.

133
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.380
And specifically in the brain,

134
00:08:38.381 --> 00:08:41.890
what we see is that that transient,
um,

135
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.920
versus the sustained response can be observed in areas of the ventral striatum

136
00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:51.470
that we know are important,
uh,
in reward,
um,

137
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:56.490
particularly the nucleus accumbens and also in prefrontal or connectivity.

138
00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:01.020
Uh,
and so what we see in the depressed patients is that they're are unable to

139
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:05.280
sustain those neural responses over time.
Um,

140
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.170
and the critical difference is the duration of time,
uh,

141
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.120
with which those neural responses are displayed.

142
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:17.070
And what we see is that in very new research,
which is just impressed now,

143
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.660
um,
among depressed patients who are successfully treated,

144
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:27.450
what we see is a change in this specific feature of brain activity,

145
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.900
which accounts for changes in or improvements in their profile of positive

146
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:34.884
effect.

147
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:35.970
<v 0>That's fascinating.</v>

148
00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:39.900
So I suggest that we don't just want to look at their responses to a stimulus in

149
00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:40.711
the moment that we,

150
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:44.970
while it really want to sort of look across time to see what's happening after

151
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:49.140
that stimulus has gone.
Are they able to sort of hold onto the glow as you said?

152
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.350
<v 1>Right.
Yeah,
exactly.</v>

153
00:09:51.351 --> 00:09:56.351
And in very new research we are probing the relation between those indices that

154
00:09:56.931 --> 00:09:59.060
we obtained in the laboratory,

155
00:09:59.061 --> 00:10:04.061
in the scanner and experience sampling where we have the same participants

156
00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:08.510
who've been in the scanner out in the world and we text them on their

157
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.490
smartphones at different points during the day.
Uh,

158
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.560
and we can track the extent to which they're positive effect is sustained in the

159
00:10:18.441 --> 00:10:22.160
real world,
um,
uh,
following a positive event.

160
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.371
<v 0>Fantastic.</v>

161
00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:26.580
So that'll be really interesting potentially to understand the extent to which

162
00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:28.000
these,
you know,

163
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.250
afterglow that they seem to miss might actually be linked to some of their

164
00:10:32.251 --> 00:10:36.600
laboratory responses in their own daily lives where they're confronted with all

165
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:38.760
kinds of different emotional life events.

166
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.230
<v 1>Exactly.</v>

167
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.350
<v 0>Great.
So the last question I wanted to ask you about your research on is really</v>

168
00:10:45.351 --> 00:10:48.820
tracing back to something that you also pioneered along with the field of ethics

169
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.360
of neuroscience.
Um,

170
00:10:50.361 --> 00:10:54.710
your research on meditation and related practices really seem to begin long

171
00:10:54.711 --> 00:10:59.570
before the western scientific community really took hold of these ideas.

172
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:04.100
And so you being one of the first to really look at meditation.

173
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.780
I wonder what you feel were some of the first indications that meditation may

174
00:11:08.781 --> 00:11:11.330
actually have long lasting effects in the brain.

175
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.040
<v 1>Well,
um,
I mean,
the honest truth is that,
uh,
uh,</v>

176
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:22.100
meeting certain remarkable people like the Dalai Lama who had been practicing

177
00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:27.810
daily for your entire lives and just being in their presence,

178
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.520
uh,
and,
uh,
observing their demeanor as a student of emotion,

179
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.910
uh,
has been,
um,
striking.
Uh,

180
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.610
and most people who have met him,
um,

181
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.110
report very similar things that they're,
uh,
just,

182
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.490
I'm quite impressed with,
uh,
uh,
who he is,

183
00:11:47.491 --> 00:11:52.310
his comportment as a human being,
so to speak.
Um,
uh,

184
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.840
and,
and really what they are commenting on our,

185
00:11:55.841 --> 00:12:00.100
his emotional qualities.
Uh,
and I think that,
um,
uh,

186
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.160
in the laboratory we have seen that individuals who spent quite a long period of

187
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:07.880
near adult life,
um,

188
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.960
doing formal meditation practices designed to cultivate both mindfulness as well

189
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:18.010
as explicitly cultivates certain positive characteristics like compassion,

190
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.240
um,

191
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.240
have a very different profiles of neural responses,

192
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:29.290
um,
uh,
in a variety of different kinds of paradigms.
And so,

193
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:30.160
um,

194
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.140
both at baseline as well as in response to certain kinds of emotional stimuli.

195
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.760
And so those early studies that we did in,
uh,

196
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:43.450
the first one was long term practitioners was published in 2004.
Uh,

197
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.290
we observed striking differences in the brains of these individuals,

198
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:52.150
which provided some initial clues that there might be a,
there there that is,

199
00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:55.740
that there might be something,
um,
really,
uh,

200
00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:00.780
quite interesting that is being affected in the brains of these individuals who

201
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:04.390
spent a long time cultivating these,

202
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.450
what I would call positive habits of mind.

203
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.440
<v 0>And what do you see now is this research,</v>

204
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:14.190
at least in the western scientific community has really kind of taken flight.

205
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.630
What do you see right now,

206
00:13:15.631 --> 00:13:18.420
some of the most exciting findings that you're reading about it,

207
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.610
either in your lab or in the works of others?

208
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.560
<v 1>Well,
uh,
I would say two kinds of really exciting new findings.
One is,</v>

209
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:30.380
um,
the really extraordinary,
um,
um,

210
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:35.610
changes that one can see even with a very short amount of practice in both the

211
00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:39.940
function and the structure of the brain.
That is,

212
00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:44.890
you don't need a lot of practice,
um,
to produce measurable changes.

213
00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:47.230
We don't know how long those changes will last.

214
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.300
And my own intuition is that the only last thing,

215
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.830
the extent that people keep practicing these methods,

216
00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:55.570
it's kind of like physical exercise.

217
00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:59.320
No one would think that two weeks of physical exercise is going to change the

218
00:13:59.321 --> 00:14:03.790
body in ways that endure once a person stops exercising.

219
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.700
Uh,
so I think the same thing will be true here,

220
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:11.380
but it is remarkable that we and others,
for example,

221
00:14:11.381 --> 00:14:15.310
have seen changes in as little as two weeks of practice,

222
00:14:15.311 --> 00:14:16.690
30 minutes a day,

223
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.960
and otherwise completely naive participants in a true randomized control design.

224
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:27.280
Um,
so that's one thing that I think is really,
uh,
interesting.
Uh,

225
00:14:27.281 --> 00:14:31.450
I'll,
I'll mention three very quick things.
The second thing or changes in,

226
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.180
um,
uh,
in,
um,

227
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.130
peripheral biological systems biology below the neck,
uh,

228
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.300
that may play an important role in health,
physical health and illness,

229
00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.020
particularly in altering,
um,

230
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:51.070
pathways that are important in inflammation.
We know that inflammation is very,

231
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:56.750
before many chronic diseases like diabetes,
cardiovascular disease,

232
00:14:56.751 --> 00:15:01.610
asthma,
those are all illnesses with a very significant inflammatory component.

233
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.450
And then there's some reason to believe that certain kinds of meditation

234
00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:07.440
practices affect,
um,

235
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:12.730
a cascade of signaling systems that impact inflammation and reduce it.

236
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.420
And there are many studies now published in the scientific literature,
uh,

237
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:22.060
which was showing that the third thing very briefly is,
um,

238
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.960
work with very young children.

239
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:28.310
We know that the brains of young children are more plastic than the brains of

240
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:29.640
older adults.
Uh,

241
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:34.660
and there's some reason to believe that these kinds of strategies may be

242
00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:38.180
particularly effective with very young children.

243
00:15:38.181 --> 00:15:40.760
And we're doing work beginning in preschool,

244
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:45.740
children with kids age four and five years of age.
Uh,
and um,

245
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:50.830
some of the changes that we see with very short amounts of intervention,

246
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:55.700
um,
uh,
are quite remarkable.
And,
um,
uh,
we,

247
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.380
uh,

248
00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:01.380
think that this may be an optimal time to begin these kinds of practices to set

249
00:16:02.241 --> 00:16:04.670
children offs on a very positive trajectory.

250
00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.450
<v 0>That's wonderful.
So speaking of trajectories then,</v>

251
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:12.510
what I wanted to ask you a little about is sort of where you see the trajectory

252
00:16:12.511 --> 00:16:17.190
or face of the future of emotion headed.
So what might be in your mind,

253
00:16:17.191 --> 00:16:19.800
some of the most exciting next steps in store for us?

254
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.830
<v 1>Well,
uh,
I think that,
um,
uh,</v>

255
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:29.780
from a hard no scientific perspective in terms of the biology of emotion,

256
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:34.781
one of the most exciting things is integrating systems level neuroscience with

257
00:16:35.001 --> 00:16:37.170
molecular neuroscience,
uh,

258
00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:41.750
and actually looking at alterations in gene expression that are associated with

259
00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:46.480
different profiles of emotion.
Um,
gene expression in both humans and you know,

260
00:16:46.481 --> 00:16:51.481
awesome and animal work where it can be exact with greater specificity and

261
00:16:51.501 --> 00:16:56.501
there's a whole set of complicated issues which need to be unpacked there.

262
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.930
Uh,
so I think that's going to be very important.
I think that,
um,
the role of,

263
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.670
um,
conscious versus unconscious emotion is something that,

264
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:08.150
um,

265
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:12.860
has only really begun to be explored.

266
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.450
Uh,
but,
uh,

267
00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:18.290
it seems like there's an awful lot of affective processing that occurs.

268
00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:23.291
Non-Consciously and one of the critical questions that we still know very little

269
00:17:23.591 --> 00:17:28.591
about is what the role of punches experience is in aspect,

270
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.350
uh,
and,
um,

271
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:35.380
how Mike conscious experience particularly play a role in the regulation of

272
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:40.430
affect.
Um,
and so that's going to be a very important area to unpack.

273
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.200
A,
and,
um,
finally I would say that,
um,
uh,

274
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:50.710
virtually everything we know about emotion is based the study of a,

275
00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.670
um,
a very small sliver of humanity.
Um,
uh,

276
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.390
and it is,
uh,

277
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.280
individuals from the west who are highly educated,

278
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.460
uh,
uh,
and,
um,
uh,

279
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.990
come from a very select social strata.

280
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.080
And I think that,
um,

281
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:16.680
looking at emotion and other parts of the world is going to be very important

282
00:18:16.681 --> 00:18:21.681
because I'm not convinced that the dimensional structure of emotion that we talk

283
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:27.120
about as western psychologists on is necessarily,
uh,

284
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.550
actually how we were designed.
Um,
uh,
and,
uh,

285
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.540
it may be a structure that we've imposed or that we've learned here in the west,

286
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.673
but,
um,

287
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.540
I'm not sure that these are necessarily the most fundamental dimensions of

288
00:18:42.541 --> 00:18:43.374
emotion.

289
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:48.700
And so I think that there's a lot that's going to be discovered by extending

290
00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:53.850
our,
um,
uh,
investigation beyond western culture.

291
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.140
<v 0>So then the last question I have for you is,</v>

292
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.160
what advice would you have for students and people more generally who are

293
00:19:01.161 --> 00:19:04.280
interested in studying or embarking in emotion?

294
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.640
<v 1>Well,
one of the things I often tell my students is,
um,
uh,
I,</v>

295
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:14.000
for any serious student of emotion at some point early in their career,

296
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:19.300
it's really important that they work with organisms that can't speak either very

297
00:19:21.021 --> 00:19:25.190
young children or animals.
Uh,
and,
um,

298
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:30.280
the reason I say that is because I think that too much of what we think we know

299
00:19:30.441 --> 00:19:34.560
about emotion has been inferred from self report measure.
Uh,

300
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:39.610
and I think it's really important that a serious student of emotion work with a,

301
00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.350
an organism that cannot speak,
uh,
and,
uh,

302
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.830
be forced to make inferences about emotion from something other than language.

303
00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:49.760
Um,

304
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.760
and so I would say that that's one thing that I would highly recommend.

305
00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:01.990
And another thing that I would highly recommend is that serious student of

306
00:20:02.091 --> 00:20:07.091
emotion actually take on some kind of systematic investigation of their own

307
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.330
interior rt,
um,

308
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.360
their own emotional processes because I think that it actually can be very

309
00:20:16.581 --> 00:20:19.460
helpful,
uh,
in,
um,
uh,

310
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:24.020
in understanding the nature of emotion more generally.

311
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.320
<v 0>Well,
