1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.620
For experts and emotion interview.

2
00:00:02.621 --> 00:00:05.950
We have the honor speaking with Dr. Joseph Campos from the University of

3
00:00:05.951 --> 00:00:08.960
California Berkeley on emotion development.
Uh,

4
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.130
Doctor Cambos received his phd from Cornell University and completed post

5
00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:17.050
doctoral training and psychophysiology at the Albert Einstein College of

6
00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:21.430
medicine.
His first faculty position was at the University of Denver in infant

7
00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:25.120
psychophysiology and he's currently a professor of psychology at UC Berkeley.

8
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.620
Dr. Campos was one of the founders of the experimental study of human infants in

9
00:00:29.621 --> 00:00:34.240
the late 1960s and his work with babies led to three major areas of original

10
00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:38.740
contribution.
First was the finding that motoric developments such as crawling,

11
00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:43.741
proceed and recently have been shown to cause major changes and emotion

12
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.400
perception,
spatial cognition,
and even language.
Second,
his,

13
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.540
his other contribution came in the field which we now call social referencing,

14
00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:57.541
which is the baby search for and use of emotional information from significant

15
00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.280
others to help regulate their behavior.

16
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.180
And his third major contribution has come from what he has called the

17
00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:06.070
functionalists theory of emotions,

18
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.310
which stresses the Equa Fonality and echo potentiality of emotional responses in

19
00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:13.330
the interest of problem solving.

20
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.020
Dr. Campos has edited the volume on emotion and early development and the

21
00:01:17.021 --> 00:01:21.460
handbook of child psychology and was a coauthor of one of the first textbooks in

22
00:01:21.461 --> 00:01:25.780
infant development in 1982 his crew has been marked by awards for distinguished

23
00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:26.950
teaching and was,

24
00:01:26.951 --> 00:01:30.730
he was the president of the International Society for infant studies and the co

25
00:01:30.731 --> 00:01:33.820
founder and first president of the international society for research on

26
00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:34.654
emotions.

27
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.740
So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Dr. Joseph Campos.

28
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.680
So welcome Joe.
Thanks for speaking with us today.

29
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.720
<v 2>Well,
to see it again June,
that's been I think 10 years in Secretary Smet.</v>

30
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.750
You so maybe not that long,
but uh,
it's good to see you are,
well,

31
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.670
<v 0>it's good to see you too.
And yes,
it has been about that long,</v>

32
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:58.040
I would say perhaps even more than 10 years.

33
00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:02.450
So it's exciting feel to have this opportunity to talk with you as one of the

34
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:06.520
people.
Um,
for a lot of people,
me included.
Um,

35
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.650
that got me excited about emotion in the first place.

36
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.160
<v 2>Well,
I'm glad they did that.
You asked about why I got into emotion.</v>

37
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.810
<v 0>Yeah.
What first got you interested in studying emotion?</v>

38
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.630
<v 2>Well,
that's kind of like asking me,
um,
uh,
what got me interested in breathing.</v>

39
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.280
Uh,
it,
uh,
to me it,
it was just a fundamental,

40
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.400
I found it always interesting to see how people reacted emotionally,

41
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.750
you know,
whether it was my parents or siblings or whether it was my friends,

42
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.170
uh,
are going to a baseball game or a football game.

43
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.800
Emotion who seemed to be everywhere.
And,
um,

44
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.540
if there's one thing that's been constant in my,

45
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.690
my career has been at the interest in the study of emotion and,

46
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:56.810
um,
uh,

47
00:02:56.811 --> 00:03:01.811
it began with studying at the time when behaviorism rules,

48
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.180
and believe it or not,
my master's thesis was called Masochism and modern goats,

49
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.630
which indicated my interest even with animals.

50
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.980
Because when you condition,
in this case,

51
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.970
it was a goal or set of goats to,
uh,

52
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.740
expect the ucs have a shock.
Uh,

53
00:03:22.741 --> 00:03:23.730
so you'd have a c,

54
00:03:23.731 --> 00:03:28.731
a s a condition stimulus that came on the tone or a buzzer and then a few

55
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.363
seconds later it shock.

56
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.730
The animals seem to be more upset during the time between the condition

57
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:41.290
stimulus.
In the unconditioned stimulus then when he or she got the shock.

58
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.550
So I decided,
well,

59
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:46.360
maybe they will bring the shotgun earlier and shock themselves and here's what

60
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:49.600
they do.
They,
they brought onto the shock earlier.

61
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.420
And so that's why I call it masochism and modern goats.

62
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.190
So subsequently I lost my interest in goat cuisine,
you know,

63
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:01.480
at the time of the graduate student.
So you ate your subjects.
Uh,

64
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.970
so,
uh,
then I moved down to,
uh,

65
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.480
uh,
college students and that was an awful lot of fun.

66
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.870
A sledding psychophysiology psychophysiological responses are just wonderful in

67
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:19.870
terms of being sensitive and keeping you disciplined.

68
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.080
You can be sloppy with psychophysiological indices.

69
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.130
And every time I turned the page and the study of emotion,

70
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:28.600
I got more and more interested.

71
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.770
So it's a right on the metal.

72
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:37.480
It's one of those questions that you can't answer directly because as I said,

73
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:41.100
it's kind of like,
well,
why are you interested in breathing?
Um,

74
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.690
it's just second nature.

75
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.300
<v 0>And so you're right,
I mean,</v>

76
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:50.350
emotions are such an integral part of what make us human and just sort of what,

77
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.030
you know,
govern every single part of our life in many ways.
Um,

78
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.350
and so I think your,

79
00:04:56.351 --> 00:05:00.040
your answer makes a lot of sense for many of us out there in terms of what first

80
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:04.060
got us captured by emotion.
It's,
it's part of our life.

81
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.190
I'm just like breathing.
Um,

82
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.120
what I'd like to ask you a bit now is about your work on emotion,
you know,

83
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.660
this central part of our life.
Um,

84
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.050
and I wanted to start by asking you a bit about some of your work that you're

85
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:21.130
widely known for.
So this influential work on the visual cliff,
you know,

86
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:25.810
that demonstrated the power of emotional communication between a young infant

87
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:28.660
and their caregiver through social referencing.

88
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:32.230
So I wonder if you could tell us a bit more about this,
um,

89
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.600
for those who may not know about this,
you know,

90
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:38.470
really powerful phenomena of emotional communication early on in life.

91
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.950
<v 2>Well,
when I got into the field of emotion and psychology,</v>

92
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:49.360
the first part of it,
and just making sure that emotions were studied.

93
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:52.300
Because when I came into the field,
the emotions were anathema.

94
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.370
There were no textbooks on emotion.

95
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:58.710
They were no entries on emotion in any handbook.
Uh,

96
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.170
there were no chapters on emotion in any handbook.
So,
uh,

97
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.770
the first thing I wanted to do is this goodie emotion per se.

98
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.340
And it turns out that most od behavioral sciences study emotions and emotional

99
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:17.030
expressions is an outward sign of an internal state.
For example,

100
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:20.520
the first day in my email today was,
uh,

101
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.550
a call for papers or journal,
uh,
the face in the brain.

102
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.930
And that indicates the typical approach,

103
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:34.370
which is to study how,
uh,
uh,

104
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.330
an outward sign of emotion reflects something internal.

105
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.700
But I thought that that was only half the story and you had to turn the coin

106
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:48.650
over.
And the OBC verse,
emotions are transmitted.

107
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.390
That broadcasts.

108
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.980
They're not just the outward sign of an internal state.

109
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:57.170
They're not just expressions.

110
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.270
And when I had children,

111
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.880
my wife and I had children,
uh,

112
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.440
I observed is that they kept looking to us,
uh,

113
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.650
in certain times in certain contexts.
And um,

114
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.440
that that made to determine methods by which you could study the effects of

115
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:26.480
emotions,
emotional expressions,
for example,

116
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.810
not as outward signs of an internal state,

117
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.720
but as regulators that the behavior of the other,

118
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.100
I frankly think that that is the real value of emotion,
uh,

119
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:43.130
in fact that they are crucial in regulating the behavior of others and others

120
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:50.250
regulating our behavior.
Um,
either way,

121
00:07:50.251 --> 00:07:53.760
a very good illustration and contemporary,
uh,

122
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:59.230
psychology is a current interest in self conscious emotions like shame.

123
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.490
It's actually misnamed.
It shouldn't be self conscious,

124
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.680
it should be other conscious.

125
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.520
And the interest in self time just emphasizes is solipsistic phenomenon where

126
00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:17.900
all your interested in is what takes place in the brain and the mind.

127
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:23.060
And then,
uh,
how it goes out to the edge of the body.
And there it stops.

128
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.910
Not so not so.

129
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:31.570
Other conscious means that when you're in a state of shame,

130
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:37.660
you had receiving in reality or through attribution,

131
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.650
the social signals of another person which powerfully affect your behavior.

132
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:45.110
For example,
the scorn of another person,

133
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.760
the disappointment or disgust of another person and so forth.

134
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.960
Um,
same thing with pride.
Uh,

135
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.120
it is the reaction of the oven that matters.

136
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.920
Not this self idea itself is involved in all aspects of emotion.

137
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.450
Don't get me wrong,
but uh,

138
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.560
it is this emphasis on the other that attracted me and actually,

139
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.470
uh,
the view of emotion that I favor.

140
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.190
And that as you know from the seminar that you participated in here at Berkeley,

141
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.940
it was what Dick Lazarus was a relational view of motion where self and other

142
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:28.790
self and act together like the North Pole and south pole of the magnet operated

143
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:35.070
in the regulation of behavior or iron filings,

144
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:37.560
whatever you want to hold them.

145
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.550
So that is what got me involved in what is called social referencing.

146
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:44.351
I was like,

147
00:09:44.351 --> 00:09:49.351
that term is actually a very narrow in its um,

148
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.950
true designation has become applied more broadly than it was originally intended

149
00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:56.304
to be.

150
00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.460
But I hope that I have captured the sense of the importance of approaching your

151
00:10:02.471 --> 00:10:07.471
emotion from this transmission orientation to compliment the expression

152
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.073
orientation.

153
00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.080
<v 0>Yeah,
I mean this is really helpful and I think it's really important to think of</v>

154
00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:17.380
these sort of,
you know,
other conscious emotions as well.

155
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.270
I wondered if you could just say a tiny bit more about sort of the role in fear,

156
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.030
you know,

157
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:27.970
as an emotion that is transmitted and picked up by an infant that helps them

158
00:10:27.971 --> 00:10:30.850
regulate their behaviors and learn about the world around them,

159
00:10:30.851 --> 00:10:33.670
through the visual cliff experiment,
for example.

160
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.120
<v 2>Well,
the visual cliff experiment was very successful,</v>

161
00:10:37.121 --> 00:10:40.630
so were reasons that we still don't fully understand,
but,
but,
uh,

162
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.710
this phenomenon is ubiquitous.
It's ubiquitous.

163
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:50.380
And,
um,
um,
in 1989 earthquake,
I was sitting,

164
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.430
uh,

165
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:56.430
in front of the very large window and told him and hall a window that faced the

166
00:10:56.711 --> 00:11:01.711
plaza where people just walk past underweight to their automobiles or to the

167
00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:05.950
subway.
And the earthquake hit at five oh four.

168
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.780
And what did you say?
You did not see people,
everybody who was an earthquake,

169
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:16.050
but you didn't see people look up above to see if a portion of the roofing I've

170
00:11:16.601 --> 00:11:20.440
told them and haul is going to fall on their heads.
No,
they look at each other.

171
00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.070
It's so ubiquitous phenomenon.

172
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.370
If you're in an elevator and the elevator suddenly stops,

173
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.970
you don't look at the uh,
uh,
push button device.

174
00:11:30.971 --> 00:11:34.840
You don't look for the telephone,
you can call for an emergency,

175
00:11:34.841 --> 00:11:39.760
help you look at each other.
And in the case of the,

176
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.570
um,
baby,
well let me just give you an example.

177
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.450
One phenomenon that is very,

178
00:11:46.451 --> 00:11:50.050
very important in development is called stranger distress,

179
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.280
used to be called stranger anxiety.
Well,
uh,

180
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.350
some babies show it very strongly and some babies hardly show it at all.

181
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.540
And one of the things that,
uh,

182
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.920
we've noticed is that the baby essentially using the mother's reaction to the

183
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:13.570
stranger as a means of determining how to behave towards that stranger.

184
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.840
We did a study with Maria Bowsher,
uh,

185
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.330
in which a stranger entered the room.
Very simple experiment.

186
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:27.250
And the mother greeted the stranger in the same way,

187
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.690
except in terms of the vocalists envelope by which she greeted the stranger.

188
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.920
She said,
a very cheery,
hello,
how are you?

189
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.160
Or a very stern way,
oh,
oh are you?

190
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:44.530
And then the stranger kept approaching the baby.

191
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:49.000
And that very simple vocalization which lasted no more than three to five

192
00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:52.210
seconds at the very beginning of the entry of the experiment,

193
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.410
powerfully affected the eight and a half month old baby's reaction to that

194
00:12:56.411 --> 00:12:57.244
stranger.

195
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.770
And if this happens consistently,

196
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.250
the baby is going to learn,
hey,

197
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.140
mommy doesn't seem to like people who have certain characteristics,

198
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.340
um,
or mommy does,
like people who have certain characteristics.

199
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:20.080
And in addition to other factors,
of course I would include temperament here.
Uh,

200
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:25.270
the baby essentially learns to catch the emotion of the other person.

201
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:30.430
And why should an animal it baby become afraid of,
for example,

202
00:13:30.431 --> 00:13:32.420
cockroaches.
Uh,

203
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:37.150
our younger daughter is terrified of insects.

204
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:42.840
She's never been bitten by an insect in any manner.
That's crucial.
Um,

205
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.600
but none of us in our family react very friendly to a cockroach and a or to a

206
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:54.880
grasshopper and she's picked that up.
Hmm.
So,

207
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:55.900
um,

208
00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:00.490
the social referencing and as a way of learning vicariously sort of the

209
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.080
experiences picked up from the reactions of other people and it's just very

210
00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:06.490
biologically adaptive.

211
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.510
It can also be very biologically on adaptive if,
uh,

212
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:15.370
the signal is not veridical or is transmitted an odd fashion.

213
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.860
<v 0>So it's really interesting when we think about just the transmission of emotions</v>

214
00:14:19.861 --> 00:14:22.170
and how we learn and acquire them.
And you know,

215
00:14:22.171 --> 00:14:24.900
with the example you talk about with the earthquake in [inaudible] 89,

216
00:14:24.901 --> 00:14:28.440
just how this stays with us throughout life.
Um,
you know,

217
00:14:28.441 --> 00:14:31.950
it makes me think about other work you've done where you've really pioneered our

218
00:14:31.951 --> 00:14:35.100
understanding of the development of a wide variety of emotions,

219
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.530
including also anger and happiness.

220
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.670
And I wonder if you could say a bit more about what are these emotions look like

221
00:14:41.671 --> 00:14:45.360
when they first emerge?
You know,
perhaps even early in infancy.

222
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:47.790
<v 2>Well.
Um,</v>

223
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
let me say something that's pretty shocking to here and that is I don't believe

224
00:14:53.811 --> 00:14:58.220
in Lotions,
quote unquote the merge.
I think they become organized.

225
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:04.100
So there are aspects of emotion that are evident very early and uh,

226
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:06.920
your baby's life.

227
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:11.240
And then other aspects of emotion come online.

228
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.400
And as the baby develops,

229
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:18.260
more and more aspects come together into that gets stalled in terms of the

230
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:21.500
baby's reaction that we call emotion.

231
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.700
And depending upon where you cut into this,
uh,

232
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:30.470
develop ETL process of organization and putting components together,

233
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.660
you can say anger develops at a birth,
anger develops at a,

234
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.160
uh,
one month.

235
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.820
Anger develops at three months and go develops at seven months.

236
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.110
So you have to put the question more specifically.

237
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:50.240
When does a particular aspect of emotion that you are interested in,
uh,

238
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.970
first become quantifiable?

239
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:58.100
And the second question you have to ask is when there's the element or the

240
00:15:58.101 --> 00:16:02.540
component that you're interested in become linked to other components.
Example,

241
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.110
anger is not just in the face,

242
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.100
it's shown in the voice and mothers will say,
Oh,

243
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.660
my baby is angry.

244
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:17.180
But did you look at the facial expression of the baby and you quantify it using

245
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:22.190
any of a number of facial expression coding systems.
And you don't get the,
uh,

246
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.930
pattern facial expression.

247
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.050
But does that mean it the baby's not showing anger but at the voice?

248
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.140
What about the way the baby tenses up?

249
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.680
<v 0>That's really interesting.
So I mean,</v>

250
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.960
we're talking about this idea of social referencing.

251
00:16:34.961 --> 00:16:39.340
We're talking about when emotions first become organized and infants.
Um,

252
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.670
and a lot of this work really,
you set the stage for,
you know,

253
00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:47.340
and has guided a lot of the way researchers looking at emotional development,
uh,

254
00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.610
you know,
will,
will operationalize and measure these constructs.

255
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.750
And I wonder,
you know,
as you see where the fields come from,
you know,

256
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.180
in understanding emotional development,

257
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.960
where do you see the face of the future headed,
moving forward?

258
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.470
<v 2>Well and,
um,
develop battle,
uh,
work.</v>

259
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.340
Obviously the oceans did,

260
00:17:12.341 --> 00:17:16.900
I happened to mentioned as the other conscious,
oh,
oceans have to be studied.

261
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:21.730
Uh,
some people say for examples of that shame is a master emotion,

262
00:17:21.731 --> 00:17:25.660
the most significant demotion.
And when does it begin?

263
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.660
Um,
and what are its consequences?
How does it transmit to others?

264
00:17:31.661 --> 00:17:35.080
How does it affect other people and what is it about other people to bring it

265
00:17:35.081 --> 00:17:37.770
about?
And uh,
I'm Tom Sheppard,

266
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:42.780
sociologists have argued about this shame rage spiral is somebody shames you.

267
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.520
Yeah,
you do is draw from social contact,

268
00:17:46.521 --> 00:17:51.521
but you also have a desire just strike back because you're self self play,

269
00:17:52.441 --> 00:17:56.520
a role in the margin has been wounded.
Um,
that's very,
very important.

270
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.080
And the same thing holds true for the other emotions like jealousy.

271
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:06.300
Even in the bay area in the last week we have had so many horrible crimes all

272
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:09.240
linked to the emotion of jealousy.
Now to me,

273
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:14.270
I think that that is an extremely important area that has been relatively,

274
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.330
I'm just studied.
I mean have you did a histogram,

275
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.480
you would get um,

276
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:26.150
thousand studies of fear and anger and so forth and you would all lead,

277
00:18:27.771 --> 00:18:29.300
you get a little rebuttal.

278
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.330
It'd be drab of studies on these self conscious emotions.

279
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.080
And most of the studies are not done well.

280
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.730
They're not done using a multiday componential approach.

281
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:48.140
<v 0>So it's interesting to think about,
you know,
as manifest,
oh,
sorry.</v>

282
00:18:48.141 --> 00:18:49.950
I was just saying it's interesting to think about,
you know,
the role,

283
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.920
self conscious emotions as really being an important piece of where the field is

284
00:18:54.921 --> 00:18:57.830
going to need to move and understanding emotional development.

285
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

286
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.340
<v 0>Um,
and I think then I want to ask you to,</v>

287
00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:06.660
as we think about where the field moves forward,
you know,
and students,

288
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:08.420
oh,
sorry,
go ahead.

289
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.253
<v 1>Okay,</v>

290
00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.290
<v 0>no,
go ahead.
Oh,
oh,
sure.</v>

291
00:19:14.291 --> 00:19:16.750
I'll just start over with that question.
But essentially,

292
00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:20.560
so when we think about where the field of emotions headed,
moving forward,

293
00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.340
such a big part of what moves it forward,
what the momentum is,

294
00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.870
are the current students we had today or future students maybe pondering or

295
00:19:28.871 --> 00:19:31.720
thinking about embarking in the study of emotion.

296
00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:37.120
And so what sort of advice do you give to students who are thinking about,

297
00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:37.870
you know,

298
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:42.580
embarking or trying to understand you're trying to become part of this movement

299
00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:43.930
in the field of emotion?

300
00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.240
<v 2>Well,
I would like,
uh,
the next generation and students to,</v>

301
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.700
uh,
not be lemmings.

302
00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:57.040
We behavioral scientists and probably biological sciences and physical sciences

303
00:19:57.041 --> 00:19:58.240
as well are lemmings.

304
00:19:58.241 --> 00:20:03.241
We tend to follow the leader and we tend to add incrementally to the knowledge

305
00:20:03.761 --> 00:20:08.590
base as a field,
but it does not add to the understanding phase to the field,

306
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.410
and I'm not going to go into the difference between knowledge and understanding,

307
00:20:11.411 --> 00:20:12.820
but the difference is profound.

308
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:19.180
But I would like to encourage is for people to try to understand emotion and to

309
00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:23.920
understand that if they want to make a solid contribution.

310
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.050
In my experience it's two factors help make for that advanced.

311
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:29.463
Number one,

312
00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:36.180
there has to be a an idea that's in the air that's a present.

313
00:20:37.631 --> 00:20:39.330
People recognize it

314
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:41.223
<v 1>but they,</v>

315
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.770
<v 2>oh,
I'll get it a bit importance.
And then number two,</v>

316
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.800
develop a method that allows you to investigate the phenomenon as well as you

317
00:20:52.991 --> 00:20:57.991
can when you had a conjunction of a topic that is deemed to be very important

318
00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:03.420
and a method that helps actualize the advancement of our understanding of that

319
00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:07.690
topic.
That is so beginning to emerge,
to be important.

320
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:13.030
You've got yourself the makings of a solid contribution to understand.

321
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.820
<v 0>Thank you so much,
Joe,
for speaking with us today.</v>

322
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:22.260
It's been just a real pleasure to hear your thoughts and insights on not only

323
00:21:22.261 --> 00:21:25.680
emotional development,
but you know,
the field of emotion as a whole.

324
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.420
<v 2>Well,
I'm sorry that I'm not,
uh,
closer,
uh,</v>

325
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.740
so that we could continue our discussions on these issues because of course,

326
00:21:32.741 --> 00:21:35.260
we've only scratched the surface.
Um,

327
00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:40.840
the field is very exciting and if you take out from journals like emotion and

328
00:21:42.191 --> 00:21:43.090
emotion review,

329
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.830
incremental studies that add to the bulk of the Journal,

330
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.360
um,

331
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:54.360
it turns out that there's quite a bit of true understanding that remains to be

332
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:55.654
added.

333
00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:56.643
<v 0>Hm.</v>

334
00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:01.000
And that's a wonderful place to end to think about all the truth that will be,

335
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.720
you know,
to be discovered,
you know,
as the field moves forward.
Right.

336
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.310
It's very important.
Well,
thank you again.
Um,

337
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:14.140
so this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Dr. Joseph Campos from

338
00:22:14.141 --> 00:22:16.390
the University of California at Berkeley.
