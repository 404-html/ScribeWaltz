1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.220
Welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.540
So one of the most important and controversial questions we've talked about last

3
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:11.541
time is what is it exactly that makes human emotion and behavior unique in the

4
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:12.900
animal kingdom?

5
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.360
Today we're going to take this one step further by asking this question of

6
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:22.320
whether or not our emotions are really so different or whether they're actually

7
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:26.580
quite similar to some of our closest nonhuman primate relatives.

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.550
Sort of asking the question,
is it really monkey see monkey feel?
Um,

9
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.370
and as we stated in the last lecture,

10
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:37.371
we can learn a lot about our own emotions by studying how unique versus how

11
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:40.470
similar they are with other species near us,

12
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.570
given we share a large part of our evolutionary lineage.

13
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:47.910
As you can see here with nonhuman primates,

14
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.360
should we ask the question of whether or not monkeys and apes can also feel

15
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:55.080
emotions just like us?

16
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

17
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.860
<v 0>In other words,
do they express emotions the same way we do?</v>

18
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.140
So to look at some of these questions today,
our roadmap will go as follows.

19
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.380
We'll start by talking about emotion expression here.

20
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:14.270
We'll look at the question of whether or not a monkeys and apes actually express

21
00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:17.780
emotions the same way we do,
or whether it's actually quite different.

22
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.210
Well then turn to questions looking at whether or not they recognize and pick up

23
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:25.100
on emotional cues from others.

24
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.880
And then we'll turn to this idea of complex emotions.

25
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.080
So what about more complex feelings like empathy or gratitude?

26
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.840
Is this something solely reserved for humans?

27
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.020
Or can monkeys also capture and experiences these more mysterious kind of higher

28
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:45.380
order feelings?
We'll conclude with our typical takeaway questions.

29
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.580
And then today where I'm really honored to have a special expert interview with

30
00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:54.581
Doctor Lisa Parr who has developed a system for coding emotional expressions in

31
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:56.960
the chimpanzee face.

32
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.740
Very similar to the way we code emotional expressions and human faces.

33
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.460
So with that,
we'll start today with emotion expression.

34
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.000
As you can see here,
emotion expressions seem to be evident not only in humans,

35
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:13.590
but if you look at these photos here,

36
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.270
it would be hard to argue that there's no such thing as emotional expressions.

37
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.720
And chimpanzees,
for example.
So in humans,

38
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:25.380
we know that emotion expressions are critical for human survival.

39
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.010
We use our face to signal to others when we're in pain,

40
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.650
alert others to signals of danger or fear,

41
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.750
and an even more subtle and a tantalizing ways signal attraction to potential

42
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:40.920
romantic partners.
And we know a bit about how humans do this,

43
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.810
but we know almost nothing about how other species such as the chimpanzee,

44
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.950
um,
express emotions.
That is until very recently,

45
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.950
and as we started out by looking at these pictures,

46
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.790
if you look carefully out then we might all agree that these monkeys are

47
00:02:56.791 --> 00:03:00.850
expressing emotions,
right?
Or,
or are they?

48
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.010
So here,

49
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.780
let's start with the observation first of where emotional expressions actually

50
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:10.570
come from.
And we'll start with the example of smiling.

51
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.650
So when and how do we first see emotion expressions emerge in humans?

52
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.100
So in humans we see expressions of joy or smiling emerge roughly within the

53
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.970
first 30 days of life.

54
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.320
And if we take kind of a cross species comparison and chimpanzees,

55
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.030
Lo and behold,
we see a roughly similar pattern.

56
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.760
We see the emergence of joy or smiling,

57
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:36.760
as you can see in this little baby chimpanzee here,
um,

58
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:40.120
emerge at roughly the same point as in humans.
Um,

59
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.440
we also see other striking similarities between humans and chimpanzees when it

60
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:46.180
comes to smiling.
Um,

61
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.760
both humans and chimpanzees smile more when they're engaging in social play

62
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:56.740
versus when they're alone.
Um,
and they also show smiles,
uh,
with their caregivers.

63
00:03:56.741 --> 00:04:00.550
It's a really important part of forming that initial bond.
Um,

64
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.000
and social smells also serve important communicative functions.

65
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.960
They're ways of expressing who it is they feel comfortable with and who they

66
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:10.570
want to affiliate with.
So in many ways,

67
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:15.250
it seems that we share smiles with our closest evolutionary relatives and they

68
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:19.150
emerge roughly at the same time in development.
Okay.
So that's about smiling.

69
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.590
What about crying?

70
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.320
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

71
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.080
<v 0>so as you can see here,
um,</v>

72
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.980
the sort of expression of crying looks,
you know,

73
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.190
morphologically very similar.
And if we turn to crime,

74
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.030
we also see a similar developmental pattern.
So for example,

75
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.230
fussing and crying occur in the first days of life and peek around six weeks in

76
00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:42.930
humans.
And we see a similar developmental pattern.

77
00:04:42.931 --> 00:04:47.790
And chimpanzees crying is also an important signal between the newborn human,

78
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.880
uh,
and it's caregiver as well as the newborn champion.

79
00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:55.881
It's caregiver to help signal distress or asking for resource such as food.

80
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.110
Um,
at the same time though,

81
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.410
humans when they cry have tears and chimpanzees have these very interesting

82
00:05:03.631 --> 00:05:07.620
tearless cries.
So although there's many similarities,

83
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.040
there's also differences in the fact that they cry without tears.

84
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.320
What about things like surprise and anger?

85
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.580
So we see additional observations later on in the lifespan of human and

86
00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:24.300
chimpanzees where we see expressions such as surprise as you can see here,
uh,

87
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.990
roughly similar both in chimpanzees and humans.

88
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

89
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.070
<v 0>If you look at anger here as well,</v>

90
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.310
we seem to just by observation look really similar when we express certain

91
00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:40.090
emotions.
So up to the state,
these are a lot of anecdotal observations.

92
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.390
How do we get more systematically into the nitty gritty of trying to really code

93
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:49.570
and understand these emotional expressions?
So here,

94
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.650
this is really groundbreaking work done by Lisa par and Kimbark,
um,

95
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.650
to striking researchers who decided to get out there and conduct this

96
00:05:57.651 --> 00:06:00.800
groundbreaking research to more systematically examine,

97
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:04.370
encode emotional expressions in nonhuman primates.

98
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.840
And they asserted that in order to really examine whether emotional expressions

99
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.520
have a similar sort of a appearance and social function across Vcs,

100
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.850
you first need to have a comparable way to observationally code facial

101
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:21.050
expressions of emotion.

102
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.680
So what they did is they first turn towards the existing systematize ways of how

103
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:31.280
we code emotional expressions in humans.

104
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.520
And as you will recall from earlier on in our lectures,

105
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.500
one of the most highly regarded coding systems for sort of mapping emotional

106
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:44.210
expressions in humans is Paul Ekman,
facial action coding system or facs.

107
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.760
Um,

108
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.310
and hear what you're doing is you're identifying and coding these little bundles

109
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:54.200
of muscle contractions in the face that are called action units or a use.

110
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.810
So this is how we do it in humans.

111
00:06:56.811 --> 00:07:01.250
This is kind of one of the gold standards of coding emotions.
How,

112
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.700
and as you see from earlier on,
we can code.
I'm smiles.
Um,

113
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.380
the Aau six cheek razor,
the [inaudible] lip corner pole.

114
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.110
And here's the question of can we adapt this to chimps?

115
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.950
So in collaboration with Paul Ekman,
um,

116
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.830
these two researchers developed what they call chimp facts.
Um,

117
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:24.440
so sort of adapting facts in the human faces.

118
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:27.470
You can see on the left to the chimpanzee face on the right.

119
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.650
So chimp facts is an objective and standardized system for measuring facial

120
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:36.710
muscle movement in the face of the chimpanzee and Ben directly comparing it to

121
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:40.880
humans.
You can see more@chimpfacts.com if you're interested in this.

122
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.960
Um,
so they develop the system in the following ways.

123
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.660
So first they compare the face,

124
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:52.040
little kind of musculature profiles of chimpanzees and humans.

125
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:53.960
As you can see roughly here in these drawings.

126
00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:00.250
Next what they tried to do was then sort of identify comparable facial

127
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:01.280
landmarks.

128
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.400
So what points map on a sort of identically between chimpanzees and humans,

129
00:08:06.711 --> 00:08:09.830
as you can see here.
Then from this,

130
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.440
they arrived at the system of chimp facts.

131
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.130
So Chin facts is really interesting and that it allows for three things.

132
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.440
One you can examine similar facial expression across two very different species

133
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:26.510
too.
You have a more objective coding system that's really oriented towards,

134
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.640
uh,
facial movements,
um,
muscular contractions as opposed to more,

135
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.330
um,
subjective coding systems that may be subject to kind of these,

136
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.160
anther anthropogenic anthro can never say that word,
uh,

137
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.930
anthropomorphizing animals.

138
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:45.470
So rather than just subjectively saying that looks like it's happiness and the

139
00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:48.700
chimp,
you can actually more rigorously code that,
um,
by,

140
00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:52.700
by focusing on the muscle contractions.
And this way you can a third,

141
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:57.210
you can directly compare results between facts and chimp facts.
So

142
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:59.910
here for example,

143
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.590
we can take CIM facts and facts and compare them across three different kinds of

144
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:06.930
facial expressions.
So on the top,

145
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.550
what we see here is what's called a silent bared teeth display and chimpanzees,

146
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.000
which is roughly analogous to a human smile.
Um,

147
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.890
in the middle you see these expressions of screaming.
Um,

148
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.180
and really if you look here,

149
00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:24.710
you see the associated chimp facts and human facts codes,
um,

150
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.010
and you see striking,

151
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:29.940
striking a physiological similarities in the face.

152
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

153
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.710
<v 0>And then finally,
um,</v>

154
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:37.480
laughter in humans is roughly analogous to what's called relaxed open mouth or

155
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.230
rom in chimpanzees using the chimp fax system.

156
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.000
So the bottom line here is that expressions are very similar between chimpanzees

157
00:09:46.001 --> 00:09:49.750
and humans,
but they're not actually a hundred percent identical.

158
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.830
You do see some slight subtleties in the different action units on the left with

159
00:09:53.831 --> 00:09:56.380
the chimpanzees to on the right with humans.

160
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.370
So what's interesting here is researchers took this system,
um,

161
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.140
and try to found that the equivalent of smiling and laughter and chimps.

162
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:10.890
So the SBT and rom there at the top,
right.
Um,

163
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.190
and when they looked at the frequency of when these expressions occurred,

164
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.020
they found that they occurred mainly during positive,
prosocial events or play.

165
00:10:19.021 --> 00:10:21.960
As you can see here,
I'm in the third,
uh,

166
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:26.730
the third line here to the right.
So you see that occurs highly during play.

167
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.020
So just like humans,

168
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:32.610
they seem to express experiences of smiling and laughter that seemed to be

169
00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:36.330
matched to these positive and social bonding activities.

170
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:38.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

171
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.290
<v 0>Importantly,
um,</v>

172
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.100
we need to always keep in mind that we need to carefully consider the complex,

173
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.120
the context in which these complex emotion expressions occur.

174
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.320
As you can see here,

175
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:53.880
there's subtle variations and smiling in chimpanzees which can signal joy,

176
00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:58.470
but also there's a fear,
grin or grimace,
which signals something quite different,

177
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:01.170
which is a sign of submissiveness and distress.

178
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.380
So it's important to when you code the emotional expressions to look at the

179
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:06.510
context in which it's occurring.

180
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:08.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>

181
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.040
<v 0>And as you can see here,</v>

182
00:11:10.041 --> 00:11:14.870
it's also further complex and so far is that chimp facts reveals at least four

183
00:11:14.871 --> 00:11:18.530
different configurations of these bared teeth displays.

184
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.430
And as you can see here at the bottom from left to right,
they really comprise,

185
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:22.790
um,

186
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:27.740
overlapping but distinct patterns of action units or muscle contractions in the

187
00:11:27.741 --> 00:11:28.101
face.

188
00:11:28.101 --> 00:11:32.270
So it's also complex in that they have a lot of varieties and ways in which they

189
00:11:32.271 --> 00:11:34.430
do express these bare teeth displays.

190
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.030
So importantly,
as it says here,
like human smiling,

191
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:45.200
there may be meaningful variations and bared teeth displays.

192
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.120
So just like human smiles,

193
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.980
chimpanzee smells are also equally complex and rich care.

194
00:11:50.981 --> 00:11:54.370
Considering the context.
And variation smile profiles

195
00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.180
and in some,

196
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.230
and sort of what I want you to take home from this is that emotional expressions

197
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.300
do indeed occur in chimpanzees,

198
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.160
but they can only be properly understood when you have a careful objective

199
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:13.180
coding of the facial expressions that are used using a system such as chimp

200
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:17.920
facts.
You focus on the underlying emotions signaled by the facial expression.

201
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.780
So you don't just consider the expression in isolation.
And as we just said,

202
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:27.400
considering the context in which these expressions are being used and what kind

203
00:12:27.401 --> 00:12:29.170
of message they're communicating.

204
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:35.350
So now we've talked a bit about expression.
Let's turn to emotion recognition.

205
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.820
So we've just talked about how non human primates can express emotions in their

206
00:12:39.821 --> 00:12:44.020
faces,
but now we want to answer the question of whether or not they can also

207
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.200
accurately recognize emotions in other people.

208
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.460
So this maps onto something we talked at the very beginning of class of this

209
00:12:51.461 --> 00:12:53.620
idea of emotional understanding.

210
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.860
So this is the knowledge about whether we or other people are experiencing

211
00:12:58.961 --> 00:12:59.794
emotion.

212
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.660
And one part of emotion understanding is being able to accurately pick up on and

213
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:08.920
register accused of emotion.
In the faces of others.

214
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.770
So can chimpanzees recognize emotions in others,

215
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:15.130
not simply express or admit them themselves.

216
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.850
So here's a task that Lisa par and others,
uh,

217
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.230
developed looking at emotion recognition and chimpanzees.

218
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.730
So here what they did is they tried to reliably discriminate between different

219
00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:31.360
facial expressions of emotion using a task,
as you can see here.

220
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.720
So this is also presented in your readings in greater detail,

221
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.690
but let's go through it briefly here.
So in short,

222
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:41.890
participants were presented with an participants being the chimpanzees this
time.

223
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.000
Um,

224
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.870
they are presented with an initial picture and then a second set of pictures in

225
00:13:46.871 --> 00:13:51.310
which they had to indicate with a joystick which of the two photos match the

226
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:56.290
original picture.
So they picked two photos with similar feet facial features,

227
00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.170
so it to,
so that they could really try to differentiate,
um,

228
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:04.750
whether or not chimpanzees were able to discriminate different facial features

229
00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:07.750
versus just specific aspects of emotion expression.

230
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.450
So results show that,
um,

231
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.980
chimpanzees we're actually better able to discriminate distinct versus similar

232
00:14:14.981 --> 00:14:16.630
expressions.
Um,

233
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.320
this indicates that they don't just rely on visual features to discriminate

234
00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:21.190
emotional expressions,

235
00:14:21.191 --> 00:14:25.900
that they're actually really able to tease apart one emotion expression from the

236
00:14:25.901 --> 00:14:28.790
other.
Um,

237
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.350
and so what I want to show you now,
this is just a brief clip.

238
00:14:32.351 --> 00:14:34.120
We'll watch it for about a minute and a half.

239
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.190
We've talked about emotion expression,

240
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.400
we've talked about their ability to recognize and discriminated emotions.

241
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:44.550
So I just want to spend some time now showing you sort of a brief video of what

242
00:14:45.071 --> 00:14:46.300
this work actually looks like.

243
00:14:46.301 --> 00:14:50.230
And here you'll briefly see Dr Lisa par speaking about her work with the

244
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:53.960
chimpanzees and her approach to developing the system of emotion,

245
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:56.240
expression and recognition.

246
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.030
I think we can prove that animals have emotions.

247
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:12.390
I think that there are lots of people now who are starting to learn the

248
00:15:12.391 --> 00:15:15.300
techniques that will enable us to answer those questions.

249
00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.590
<v 2>The study of facial expressions is one way of measuring emotion</v>

250
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.150
chimpanzees have among the most expressive faces in the natural world.

251
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:33.650
<v 3>Okay,</v>

252
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:34.251
<v 0>thank you Ken.</v>

253
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:38.150
Believe what you see in a chimpanzee facial expression when they're screaming.

254
00:15:38.151 --> 00:15:41.030
I don't think there's any reason not to believe that they're upset about

255
00:15:41.031 --> 00:15:44.150
something the same way that,
that we would be upset about something.

256
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:50.940
<v 2>Studies have already identified at least five universal expressions,</v>

257
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.800
easily recognizable and higher primates,
fear,

258
00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.780
disgust,
happiness,

259
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.190
surprise and anger.

260
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:12.180
<v 0>Right now we're doing a lot of tests that involve face recognition to get enough</v>

261
00:16:12.461 --> 00:16:16.150
background about emotion and what the chimpanzees understand about their

262
00:16:16.151 --> 00:16:19.590
emotional signals and what they understand about what the,

263
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.180
the context might be if there's been a fight,

264
00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:26.140
if they're involved in calming one another down after a fight when they play,

265
00:16:26.141 --> 00:16:29.000
they have very distinctive facial expressions.
Uh,

266
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:34.050
and this kind of behavioral evidence gives us the first basis to believe that

267
00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.680
these facial expressions have very distinctive meanings and that they do

268
00:16:38.681 --> 00:16:40.990
communicate about different types of emotion,

269
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:44.901
what the champions,

270
00:16:44.901 --> 00:16:48.760
he understands about their own emotional signals in their own emotional
behavior.

271
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.110
It's really,
I think,

272
00:16:50.111 --> 00:16:54.760
pertinent to understanding a little bit more about the evolution of emotion and

273
00:16:54.761 --> 00:16:57.130
humans and,
and why we are the way we are,

274
00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.110
<v 2>the difference between you and a champion.</v>

275
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

276
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.260
<v 0>So that's just a brief excerpt.
If you'd like to see more,</v>

277
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:05.480
you can watch the discovery channel series,

278
00:17:05.481 --> 00:17:08.270
why dogs smile in chimpanzees cry.

279
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.950
So now I want to turn to the topic of complex emotions.

280
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:14.240
And here we can,

281
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:18.860
we're going to try to answer this really perplexing question of do monkeys

282
00:17:18.861 --> 00:17:23.861
experience these more subtle and deep feelings of gratitude or empathy?

283
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.390
Can they have that capacity or is it really reserved solely for the human

284
00:17:29.391 --> 00:17:30.224
species?

285
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:34.610
So here we'll start by thinking about this question.

286
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:38.040
Can they experience more complex emotions?
Um,

287
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.190
so these complex emotions,

288
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:44.600
our thoughts include higher order thinking or cognition that originally was

289
00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:49.601
thought really to be specific to humans with these larger and denser structures.

290
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.700
So these issues are still new and not fully understood.

291
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.330
But I'll present some of the ideas and thinking right now that researchers are

292
00:17:57.331 --> 00:18:02.331
trying to really get their hands on and observationally see whether or not it

293
00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.610
appears that they have the capacity monkeys,

294
00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:10.020
like the one you see here to experience things such as empathy or gratitude.

295
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:16.170
So here we see France to wall who's been studying complex emotions like empathy.

296
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.520
And as you can see here,

297
00:18:17.521 --> 00:18:22.521
he defines empathy as the ability to put yourself in another individual's shoes.

298
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.330
In order to do so though you need what's called a theory of mind or the ability

299
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:29.730
to mental eyes and sort of,
uh,

300
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:33.480
get into other's internal emotion states.
So in other words,

301
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.910
can you put yourselves in the shoes of another and really feel their emotions,

302
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.500
see it through their own eyes.

303
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.150
And here he believes that we should see empathy and all species who live in

304
00:18:45.151 --> 00:18:46.530
groups,
not just humans,

305
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.240
because empathy is a really important emotion that is critically necessary for

306
00:18:51.241 --> 00:18:56.241
signaling group alarm as well as really forming and maintaining the mother

307
00:18:56.281 --> 00:18:58.830
infant relationship.
So again,

308
00:18:58.831 --> 00:19:02.670
this is a new area and people are really still coming to terms with how we

309
00:19:02.671 --> 00:19:04.170
measure this and how we get at it.

310
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:09.360
But what I'd like to show you is a brief clip here that suggest quite

311
00:19:09.361 --> 00:19:12.120
convincingly that it seems that you know,

312
00:19:12.121 --> 00:19:17.121
chimpanzees and other nonhuman primates absolutely have the ability for empathy.

313
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:20.700
And as you'll see here in this video at suggests that they may have empathy,

314
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:22.320
not just for their own species,

315
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.710
but also across species and their relationships with human beings.

316
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.360
So let's watch this right now.

317
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.730
<v 2>What is it that distinguishes humans from all other beings on the earth?</v>

318
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:45.130
Is the human heart unique or one among many

319
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.890
with her capacity for language,

320
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.450
Washoe was one of the few animals who can share what's in her heart.

321
00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.930
I show has expectations of her friends and a few come in four days a week.

322
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.740
Then by Gosh,
she expects even four days a week.
And if you don't come in,

323
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:07.060
you've got some explaining to do.

324
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:14.030
I was pregnant in the summer of 1982 and I had a miscarriage and was gone for a

325
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:20.520
couple days.
So I came in and she kind of gave me the cold shoulder and I said,

326
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:21.870
I'm sorry I've been gone,

327
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:27.290
but my baby died and I thought washer would understand because I knew she had

328
00:20:27.421 --> 00:20:28.740
lost a baby before too.

329
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:35.120
She looked at me and then she looked away and she looked back into my eyes and

330
00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:40.350
she signed cry.
And I knew in that moment that she felt empathy.

331
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:47.660
I got up to leave and she signed,
she signed please percent talk.

332
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.730
<v 0>And so I came back and we,
and we visited for a while.</v>

333
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.330
So if you'd like to see more about this again,

334
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:05.650
you can see this on the discovery channel series by dogs smile and chimpanzees

335
00:21:05.651 --> 00:21:06.484
cry.

336
00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:07.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

337
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.570
<v 0>So what about complex emotions like gratitude?</v>

338
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.550
So gratitude is really defined as this feeling of thankfulness and appreciation.

339
00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.160
It's thought to help strengthen social bonding.

340
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:23.290
And gratitude is experienced when you perceive a favor as costly to the

341
00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:28.291
benefactor or given by the benefactor with benevolent intentions valued by the

342
00:21:28.481 --> 00:21:32.140
recipient and given gratuitously rather than obligatory.

343
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:36.450
So when we think of complex emotions like gratitude,
again,
we,

344
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:41.050
we don't have,
uh,
a big host of empirical data at this point.
But again,

345
00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:45.760
we do have these sort of observational,
really telling and very moving,
um,

346
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:46.930
you know,

347
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:51.220
experiences shared by people who work closely with nonhuman primates that

348
00:21:51.221 --> 00:21:54.640
suggests that absolutely they experienced feelings of gratitude.

349
00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:56.590
So I'll show you our final clip today.

350
00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.720
And while you're watching it think to yourself,

351
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.890
is it possible that nonhuman primates can experience gratitude?

352
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.073
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

353
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.290
<v 2>If more proof is needed that animals have the capacity for gratitude.</v>

354
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:13.600
Washoe is that proof despite a life spent in during the deprivation,
right

355
00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.573
<v 4>captivity</v>

356
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:21.900
while she and her family live for 13 years in four rooms connected by overhead

357
00:22:22.831 --> 00:22:27.720
tunnels and one a ground level tunnel that connected at very small room at the

358
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:31.320
end of the hallway on the third floor of the psychology building

359
00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:37.150
<v 2>wash.
Those providers had wanted to give her and her family a better home,</v>

360
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.570
but it took years to plan,
fund and Build.

361
00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.450
Then it's moving day approached.

362
00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:48.490
They wanted to assure the chimps that gaining a new home would not mean losing

363
00:22:48.491 --> 00:22:49.330
old friends

364
00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.810
<v 5>wash.
It had moved twice before in her life and it,</v>

365
00:22:53.811 --> 00:22:58.220
all those moves always involved,
uh,
leaving people behind.

366
00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:02.600
And so I created a video tape of what the new building looked like and

367
00:23:02.601 --> 00:23:06.050
videotaped Roger and Debbie and showed that [inaudible] signed to them.

368
00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:09.350
When I showed it to him and said,
look,
this is your,
your new home,

369
00:23:09.351 --> 00:23:13.400
and showed him some of the different things had followed Roger through and

370
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:14.600
they're very interested.

371
00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.570
<v 2>When the chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute was finally ready,</v>

372
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.520
the chimps were moved at night.

373
00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.280
The next morning wash us family woke in their new home.

374
00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.330
They hadn't been out for 13 years.

375
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.720
I mean he hadn't been out in the fresh air and see the sun and can feel the

376
00:24:04.721 --> 00:24:09.721
grass and we thought they would just run out and a

377
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:14.350
swing and play and so on and we will.
They were excited.

378
00:24:14.351 --> 00:24:18.100
They were hooting and they came rushing out and Moisha rather than going out and

379
00:24:18.101 --> 00:24:18.910
playing.

380
00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:23.740
She came down to a wire area were Debbie and I were standing and she reached to

381
00:24:23.741 --> 00:24:28.030
the wire and she took Debbie space and then went to play.

382
00:24:28.031 --> 00:24:32.470
She was thinking or
five was teared up.

383
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:36.940
I had tears streaming down my face because it was the true,
she was very,

384
00:24:36.941 --> 00:24:40.410
very grateful.
I uh,
it was,
it was a moment that,

385
00:24:40.411 --> 00:24:45.411
that I think that will forever be indebted in our brains in your memory.

386
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.880
<v 1>Okay.
Okay.</v>

387
00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:58.150
<v 0>And again,
this is also from why dogs smiling,
chimpanzees cry.</v>

388
00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:04.960
So some caveats when we think about trying to understand emotions in nonhuman

389
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.810
primates first,

390
00:25:06.811 --> 00:25:10.910
do you want to be very careful not to anthropomorphize or ascribe human

391
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:15.020
qualities to what our non human entities or other beings,

392
00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.400
we also have unfortunately a lack of confirmatory self report data.

393
00:25:20.401 --> 00:25:25.401
So we haven't yet developed a sophisticated tools to get qualitative self report

394
00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.280
measures from,
you know,
chimpanzees for example themselves.

395
00:25:29.281 --> 00:25:33.330
So right now a lot of this is based on observational or behavioral coding.

396
00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:37.560
And then finally we have to always keep in mind that just because they have a

397
00:25:37.561 --> 00:25:41.760
behavioral similarity or they show similar expressive signatures in their face,

398
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:47.120
it is not equivalent to having the identical or same psychological experience of

399
00:25:47.191 --> 00:25:51.870
that motion.
So with that,
I'll turn to our takeaway questions.

400
00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.760
The first question today is which expressions emerge at developmentally similar

401
00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:06.620
time points in both humans and chimpanzees.
Second,

402
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:10.490
what is the facial coding system for emotion expression and ships?

403
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:15.170
What is it called and how is it developed?
And then finally,

404
00:26:15.171 --> 00:26:20.171
which higher order or more complex emotions might actually be shared between man

405
00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.950
and nonhuman primates.
Well,

406
00:26:24.951 --> 00:26:27.660
now turn to our expert interview,
um,

407
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.800
as part of the experts in emotion interview series and for experts and emotion

408
00:26:31.801 --> 00:26:33.180
interview today.
Um,

409
00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:37.590
we'll be speaking with Dr Lisa Parr who share her expertise on expressions of

410
00:26:37.591 --> 00:26:39.030
emotion and chimpanzees.

411
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:43.890
Dr Par received her phd in psychology at Emory university and is now an

412
00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:47.880
assistant professor in the division of Psychiatry and behavioral science and

413
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:52.260
directs a Comparative Research Laboratory at the Yerkes National Primate

414
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:52.830
Research Center,
uh,

415
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.910
examining emotional communication and social cognition in monkeys and apes.

416
00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.480
A doctor par has received several awards in her career,

417
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.520
including the Frank A.

418
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:06.240
Beach comparative psychology award from the American psychological association

419
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.360
as well as funding from the National Institute of Mental Health,

420
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:13.740
the National Science Foundation and the National Alliance for autism research.

421
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:18.780
And on a side note,
as a native Australian,
a doctor par enjoys fishing,

422
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.210
cooking,
and riding her motorcycle.

423
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.130
So we will now turn to a very special experts and emotion interview with Doctor

424
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:29.810
Lisa Par.
Okay,
thanks for another great class.
