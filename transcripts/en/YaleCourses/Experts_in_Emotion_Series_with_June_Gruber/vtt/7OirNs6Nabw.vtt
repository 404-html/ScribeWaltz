00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.750
As part of the experts and emotion interview series,

2
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.180
we will be talking with Dr Yulia Chance Sova Dutton who will share her

3
00:00:08.181 --> 00:00:12.140
experience on whether emotions indeed are socially constructed.

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.120
Dr. Chen Sova Dutton received her phd from Stanford University and is currently

5
00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.980
an assistant professor at Georgetown.

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.360
Her Research Interests Center on cultural shaping of emotions and social support

7
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.730
and she conducts exciting work on emotion and culture internationally and East

8
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.240
Asian,
uh,
Russian and west African cultural context.

9
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.100
So I now turn to a very special experts in emotion interview with a treasured

10
00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:39.830
colleague of mine,
Dr Yulia and Sova Dutton.

11
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.940
Welcome Yulia.
Thank you for speaking with us today.
Thank you.

12
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.700
It's always nice to talk to you.
Um,

13
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.810
I wanted to just start out by asking you a little bit as an expert in emotion.

14
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.990
Um,
what first got you interested in emotion?

15
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.540
<v 1>Well,
I grew up as a daughter of an astronomer on an astrophysical observatory.</v>

16
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:08.370
So among the natural scientists and fairly early on in my teenage years,

17
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.450
I became interested in the idea that even in case of this very carefully

18
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:17.070
controlled scientific observations,
um,
our emotions,

19
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.570
motivation,
thoughts are always this unseen,

20
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.860
unacknowledged lens between us and reality.
And I would wonder,

21
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.930
looking at my father and his colleagues getting ready for a observing stars all

22
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.130
night,
how their mood at the time might influence how they pay attention,

23
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.420
whether or not they're going to have particularly useful intuitions later that

24
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.600
day.
And from then on,
once they moved to the United States,

25
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:47.601
I became increasingly interested in how different cultural contexts shape this

26
00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:49.830
process is shape our motions.

27
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.740
<v 0>So,
I mean,
really,
I mean,</v>

28
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:57.120
it's interesting to hear that because you now are one of the foremost experts on

29
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.190
culture and emotion.
Um,

30
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.210
and so I want to ask you some questions about your work in this domain.
I mean,

31
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:07.350
you're widely known for your influential role in trying to understand how

32
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:12.210
different social and you know,
situational factors shape the physiological,

33
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:15.840
behavioral,
and expressive facets of emotion responding in.

34
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.170
And like you're saying how this various cross culturally.

35
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.190
So I wondered if you could tell us a little bit about this work and to what

36
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:27.060
extent it might suggest that our emotions are,
you know,
evolutionarily,
you know,

37
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:30.720
sort of hardwired versus more culturally shaped and modified.

38
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.600
<v 1>I don't necessarily,
uh,
inclusiveness as he worked for,</v>

39
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.430
and this is a very common theme in emotion research to think of emotions as

40
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:43.500
premiere,
the evolutionarily shaped,

41
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.760
and then culture is sort of icing on the cake if you would,
uh,

42
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:52.050
writing to the party late in adjusting this responses slightly.

43
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.560
And I think that if you look at,
um,

44
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.270
environments for which humans evolved and was very little in common,

45
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.690
so humans live all over very diverse natural environments and adapt to them

46
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:11.230
well.
And the common ingredient is that they live with others and they live in a

47
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:13.240
cultural environment.
So yes,

48
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:16.510
where the Lucia nearly shaped to deal with natural threats.

49
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.750
I like rapid new responding to snakes or heights or things that might

50
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:26.290
potentially be polluting dangerous for us,
like something disgusting.

51
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.513
However,

52
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.520
our emotions really are primarily helpful in helping us navigate our cultural

53
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:37.120
environments.
And so I think emotions evolve to be cultural.
I think,

54
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:38.850
uh,
uh,

55
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.890
preparing us from very early on to take in inputs from our cultural environment

56
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.240
and adjust and number of things about how we behave,
how we pay attention,

57
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.021
how we think,

58
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:55.021
but also adjust the way in which we experience and express our emotions.

59
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.880
Okay.
So in your,

60
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.570
<v 0>do you find particular facets of emotion responding more susceptible to cultural</v>

61
00:04:03.921 --> 00:04:05.210
influences than others?

62
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.830
<v 1>Yes.
So in most of our studies,</v>

63
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.140
what we find when we look at different components of emotion is that when you

64
00:04:12.141 --> 00:04:15.050
look at physiological regenerativity,
uh,

65
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.760
when this team you line that people are responding to artist roughly comparable

66
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.820
and similar in their meaning.
In a particular context,

67
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.780
people show similar physiological reactivity.
So for example,

68
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.140
if you show participants something scary,

69
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
their heart rate goes up across cultural context.

70
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.590
We also see considerable similarity and facial expressions.

71
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.630
So people tend to show similar,
uh,
facial expression.
So for example,

72
00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:45.650
smiling when they're feeling positive emotions across context,

73
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.920
even though the intensity and the way that they express a particular expression

74
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.380
are going to differ by context.
But there's similarities there as well.

75
00:04:54.381 --> 00:04:58.340
And then when we move into the domain of the way people think about their

76
00:04:58.341 --> 00:05:00.220
emotions,
um,
uh,

77
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.740
how intensely and how frequently they experienced them,

78
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.980
what they believe about outcomes of their motions,

79
00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:11.981
and also how they respond to situational cues that are all around them.

80
00:05:13.191 --> 00:05:18.191
To what extent these cues churn emotions on or off a or remind people to control

81
00:05:18.441 --> 00:05:22.040
the expressions.
They are,
we see much,
uh,
any many,

82
00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:23.480
many more differences.

83
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.940
<v 0>So one of the things I love most about your work is you've really provided this</v>

84
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.290
elegant and novel way of,
you know,
thinking about these,
you know,

85
00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:36.800
culturally informed models in both positive and negative emotions.

86
00:05:36.801 --> 00:05:41.330
And you've drawn from a wide range of cultural contexts including East Asian,

87
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.350
west African,
and also Russian contacts.

88
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:47.600
And I've wondered if you could tell us a bit more about some of the most

89
00:05:47.601 --> 00:05:52.520
exciting findings that have emerged by studying emotional systems and these very

90
00:05:52.521 --> 00:05:56.480
different culturally distinct context.
Um,

91
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.920
<v 1>in Q and.
A.</v>

92
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.690
So when we are looking at different contexts,
we are starting with the culture.

93
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.950
You're drilling and we're trying to understand what are the cultural beliefs and

94
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.350
different cultures drive attention to different aspects of emotion.

95
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.960
So for example,
in East Asian cultural context,

96
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:21.830
what we see is that emotions are much more likely to be connected to social

97
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.280
environment.
So when European Americans think of their emotions,

98
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:29.360
they think of internal processes that they get to express.

99
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:31.940
But I fundamentally within them,
um,

100
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.230
east Asians often think of emotions as literally unfolding and interpersonal

101
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:39.290
environment.
And as a result would with dental laboratory.

102
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:43.760
And it was very exciting for us is using simple thoughts,

103
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.930
either yourself or others changes emotions differently in cultural context.

104
00:06:48.931 --> 00:06:49.820
So for example,

105
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.770
and we are proud of myself if I'm European American intensifies emotional

106
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:58.130
response.
For East Asians,
it doesn't have the same ethic.

107
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.860
But instead thinking about a family member,
someone who has close connection,

108
00:07:01.861 --> 00:07:04.360
do you thinking about relationship primes,

109
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.910
emotions and intensifies them in other contexts.

110
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.880
Other aspects of emotions are culturally salient.

111
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.680
So in is a African context of Ghana.

112
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.930
My colleague Vivian within [inaudible] and I have done the work on the way in

113
00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:22.970
which this context directs attention to the body.

114
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.430
To encourage,

115
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.780
encourages people to attend to how their body is responding.

116
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.880
And we have looked at how this increased enhanced cultural attention to the body

117
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:37.970
shapes,
emotional response.
And finally,

118
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:41.810
with my native culture of Russia,
the work that we have done,

119
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:46.811
they are most recently focuses on Russian beliefs about negative emotions.

120
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.080
And the idea that negative emotions can have very important positive functions

121
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.340
in one's life.

122
00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.120
And the way in which these beliefs promote Russian participants to seek negative

123
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:05.430
emotions even though they're unpleasant for all of us.
Um,

124
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:07.780
so,
um,

125
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.940
our work in the focus of the work depends to some extent on the context and the

126
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:17.270
common thread there I would say is that cultures,

127
00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:21.020
providers with the scripts of what emotions are,

128
00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:25.880
how they're supposed to unfold,
um,
wolf in the moment.

129
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:29.510
And also what are some of the longer range consequences of these emotions.

130
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.440
And when people feel normally different motions,

131
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:39.010
they don't always follow the same script cause there is this common shared

132
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:43.460
script,
but we don't all follow it.
Uh,
some of us are better at it than others.

133
00:08:43.461 --> 00:08:45.590
Some of us fled out,
attempt to reject it.

134
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.380
And think of ourselves as not very culturally normative,

135
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.780
but it is impossible to be in a cultural context and not be informed by those

136
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:54.614
scripts,

137
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.860
not express and experience emotions in reference to those common and stood

138
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.613
scripts.

139
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.070
And so the script's might be about different aspects of emotion in different

140
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:05.904
contexts,

141
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:10.970
but our larger project is understanding how these cultural scripts interact with

142
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:13.350
individual experience and expression.

143
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.100
<v 0>So fascinating.
I mean,
I love the work you do,</v>

144
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:21.510
especially just all the different contexts that you sample from to really get a

145
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:26.460
sense of the wide diversity and emotional response systems across the world.

146
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.490
Um,
one question that came up while you were talking,

147
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:33.930
I was thinking about is just what you see as some of the most exciting next

148
00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:38.010
steps we can try to pursue if we're interested in trying to understand,
you know,

149
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:41.940
the role that context has on our emotion,
experience and expression.

150
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.000
<v 1>I think it becomes increasingly important for us if we take your safety</v>

151
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.240
seriously to introduce contexts in the laboratory.

152
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.150
And what I noticed about,
uh,

153
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:57.020
much of research comparing particularly European American and Asian,

154
00:09:57.021 --> 00:10:02.021
there is a long tradition for comparing this grips is what we see is that Asian

155
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:03.321
American participants are,

156
00:10:03.321 --> 00:10:07.430
Asian participants in this study are less emotionally expressive and report

157
00:10:07.431 --> 00:10:11.570
experiencing emotions less intensely when thought all of these studies were

158
00:10:11.571 --> 00:10:16.520
conducted in the laboratory where the person is by themself,
friends are not,

159
00:10:16.521 --> 00:10:20.000
their family members are not there.
There's nobody for them to interact with.

160
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.460
And we think that in an effort to make us that is more controlled.

161
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.410
This is a good idea.
But in essence we are making,

162
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:32.630
we're stripping away what makes emotions,
emotions for this context.

163
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.900
And so we need to get better at tapping into traditions in our field of how we

164
00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:40.050
can,
um,

165
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.470
continue being very careful and scientific about studying emotion but also

166
00:10:45.471 --> 00:10:49.130
allowing context.
And so currently in my study for example,

167
00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:54.131
I'm doing more work with diets where groups of friends come in and talk about

168
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.660
distressing experiences and observing how cues from one person influenced

169
00:10:58.661 --> 00:11:00.710
emotional reactivity and another person.

170
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.200
And I think that would be a way for us to,
um,

171
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.080
understand context better.

172
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.520
<v 0>What exciting directions.</v>

173
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:12.000
I can't wait to hear where it leads you because I think you're right.

174
00:11:12.001 --> 00:11:17.001
You can't study the context and culture without having a real ecologically valid

175
00:11:17.881 --> 00:11:20.010
context.
The person's in in the first place.

176
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.400
<v 1>They're also readable evolving methods of helping us study emotions right out</v>

177
00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:30.401
there in the world as they unfold either by observing emotions of others.

178
00:11:31.161 --> 00:11:33.680
So for example,
going out there to compare comparable context,

179
00:11:33.681 --> 00:11:38.060
let's say restaurants in Moscow,
Washington,
um,

180
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:38.991
uh,

181
00:11:38.991 --> 00:11:43.820
Tokyo and observing how people show their emotions when they're talking to close

182
00:11:43.821 --> 00:11:47.760
to others.
Um,
or just having people carry,

183
00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:52.770
that's a me versus devices and examining what they feel in their daily as you do

184
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.310
so well in,
in your own work.

185
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.540
<v 0>Oh,
you do the interesting RightCare,
Yulia,
and I'm your biggest fan.</v>

186
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:03.993
Um,

187
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.960
one of the last things I want to ask you about that I think is really striking

188
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:12.550
too is you not only look at these cross cultural models of emotion,
you know,

189
00:12:12.551 --> 00:12:13.331
around the world,

190
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:17.680
but you also have this really important translational component where you look

191
00:12:17.681 --> 00:12:22.150
at cultural variation and emotional responding among individuals diagnosed with

192
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:22.751
depression,

193
00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:27.670
one of the most common severe and debilitating of all emotional disorders.

194
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.550
And I just wonder your perspective.
You know,

195
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:35.551
to what extent cultural contexts serves as either a potential buffer against or

196
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:38.590
a risk factor for,
you know,

197
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.740
the onset or severity of disorders like depression?

198
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:48.390
<v 1>I think cultural context can serve as a buffer in a number of different ways and</v>

199
00:12:50.301 --> 00:12:54.590
we can consider all different influences starting with,
um,
you know,

200
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:58.460
genetic vulnerabilities in a particular population.
Um,

201
00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.610
the extent to which particular types of stressors are presented,

202
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:05.480
how people characteristic with cope with the stressors would kind of support

203
00:13:05.481 --> 00:13:07.840
systems are the,
uh,
and,

204
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.720
and I'm also very interested in how cultural context,
um,

205
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:17.050
I think expressions of disorder because to the extent that we have this

206
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.940
normative scripts for how to feel and express our emotions,

207
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:28.630
depression seems to not just affect our emotional experiences in a vacuum,

208
00:13:29.271 --> 00:13:33.450
but affects how well we interact with this scripts.
I,

209
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.120
so in some of our studies we find that,
uh,

210
00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.280
depression appears to potentially interrupt people's ability to follow scripts

211
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:48.110
resulting in,
um,
the pattern golf people doing,
going to culture,

212
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:53.130
counter culture,
uh,
emotional expression and experience.
Um,

213
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:58.040
and,
uh,
as a result,
you see very interesting patterns where,
for example,

214
00:13:58.041 --> 00:14:00.080
in Asian American cultural context,

215
00:14:00.081 --> 00:14:05.081
depression is associated not with the implant but with enhanced emotional

216
00:14:05.811 --> 00:14:08.210
reactivity.
Whereas in European American context,

217
00:14:08.211 --> 00:14:13.211
we see more damp in emotional community in response to the norm express openly

218
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.450
Asian contexts in response to the norm to typically moderate.

219
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.780
So I think when we are thinking about assessment and treatment,

220
00:14:20.781 --> 00:14:25.781
it's important for clinician to do assessment of individuals emotional

221
00:14:25.881 --> 00:14:26.714
functioning,

222
00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:31.550
but also to do some degree of assessment for what cultural norms this is

223
00:14:31.551 --> 00:14:35.180
individual interacting with it,
living with.
And again,

224
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:38.810
with the idea that of course everybody in the context is going to be different.

225
00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:43.190
There's tremendous we can cultural variability and that's the norm.
Um,

226
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:48.050
but even the person who doesn't follow their cultural norm is responding to that

227
00:14:48.051 --> 00:14:52.270
norm in some way.
And clinician needs to know about it.
So we,
um,

228
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.070
study how person is functioning.

229
00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:59.000
We scanned their brains and as cultural circle just Hazel Markus is fond of

230
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:01.340
Samuelson,
you just scan the cultural environment.

231
00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.980
I stand psychological functioning better.

232
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.040
<v 0>So how do you think we might be able to use these findings Sunday to develop</v>

233
00:15:10.351 --> 00:15:15.300
more culturally sensitive or tailored psychological interventions when,
you know,

234
00:15:15.301 --> 00:15:19.410
really trying to combat emotional related difficulties and depression for

235
00:15:19.411 --> 00:15:20.244
example.

236
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.950
<v 1>Clinicians just need to be aware and it,</v>

237
00:15:23.951 --> 00:15:28.300
the norms differ and keep it in their mind as a possibility of what they need to

238
00:15:28.301 --> 00:15:32.810
ask about.
So,
for example,
in our studies we show that,
um,

239
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.330
when we compare healthy and depressed European American and Asian American

240
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.060
individuals,
uh,

241
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.900
depressed European American individuals in their emotional reactivity are

242
00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:48.901
virtually indistinguishable from non-depressed healthy Asian Americans and who

243
00:15:49.271 --> 00:15:52.090
clinician easy mistake to make.

244
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:57.270
So interacting with a person who is highly oriented to East Asian culture to

245
00:15:57.581 --> 00:16:02.581
take very culturally normative way of moderating one's IX emotional expression

246
00:16:04.181 --> 00:16:06.160
based on relational context,

247
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:10.000
to take it as an indication that the person doesn't feel intensely and this is

248
00:16:10.001 --> 00:16:13.750
potentially problematic.
So,
um,
as part of assessment,

249
00:16:13.751 --> 00:16:18.240
clinicians need to have skills to,
to,
to,

250
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.050
to ask good questions about this.

251
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.770
And we wouldn't ever expect clinicians to know about every culture in the world.

252
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.040
That's not realistic of course,
but they need to assess it.

253
00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.990
And then treatment,
we also need to think about what are our goals.

254
00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.170
So if a typical,

255
00:16:35.171 --> 00:16:40.171
let's say Russian firmly believes that sadness is an important part of one's

256
00:16:40.811 --> 00:16:44.710
life and wants to cultivate it in themselves and their family members and their

257
00:16:44.711 --> 00:16:49.150
children.
Even if this ration is depressed,

258
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:53.860
what is our goal for their sadness?
Obviously we don't want them to be in beard.

259
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.380
We want them to be functionally well,

260
00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.530
but I want them to be functioning well in their context.

261
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.020
We don't want to eliminate the sadness entirely.

262
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.580
The want to leave this cultural benefits of sadness probably in place.

263
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.460
So our goals for treatment might differ with me.

264
00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:13.120
Help a person do well in their context.

265
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:18.820
Then relative to some universal standard or for the emotional functioning might

266
00:17:19.871 --> 00:17:20.704
look like.

267
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.640
<v 0>So you as an expert and emotion,</v>

268
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.540
where do you see the future of this field headed?

269
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:34.710
<v 1>I think we're in a really exciting point in our field right now and in part what</v>

270
00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:40.560
I really like about it is that we're gaining a really good understanding now of

271
00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:44.010
the way in which emotions are these emergent properties.

272
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:47.670
All of our physiology of our mind and of our culture.

273
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:52.620
And I think we're very to being able to create programs of research that take

274
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:57.770
all these components into account to try to understand how our neurons at

275
00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.540
training by our cultures and vice versa.

276
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.770
Because this is a by directional influenced how what we bring to the table is

277
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:08.190
humans shapes our countries over time.
Um,

278
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.900
so I see a lot of possibilities in this program of research.

279
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.410
<v 0>And so when students come to you,
um,</v>

280
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:20.600
and they are sort of thinking about embarking in this field of emotion,
um,

281
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.330
looking ahead,
what,
what might line store for them,

282
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:25.940
what kind of advice do you give students?

283
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.890
<v 1>I told them that they are in a field that is rapidly developing.</v>

284
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:35.840
Even in just the few years that I've been around,
is there any researcher,

285
00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.430
so much information,
new information becomes available to us.

286
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.170
So I told them that they should be prepared to be absorbing new information very

287
00:18:45.171 --> 00:18:49.710
rapidly.
They need to have a high degree of,
uh,
uh,

288
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:54.590
uncertain tolerance because in our field we are still trying to come up with a

289
00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:58.010
basic definitions.
We're still not in agreement about what emotion is.

290
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.620
Your hands are difficult to manage.
Uh,
um,
not having that certainty,
but,
uh,

291
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.990
in my mind this is a really wonderful thing about her,

292
00:19:06.991 --> 00:19:10.740
I feel because we get to argue about this very important,
interesting ideas.

293
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:16.190
I would also tell them it given the fact that cultural psychologist of emotion

294
00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:18.420
should be prepared to,
to,

295
00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.290
to think about the ways in which brain and culture interact with each other.

296
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.680
That they should be thinking about training in very kind of tangible skills such

297
00:19:28.411 --> 00:19:31.650
as physiological reactivity,
no rest science,

298
00:19:31.651 --> 00:19:33.720
genetic contributions to emotions.

299
00:19:33.721 --> 00:19:38.700
And simultaneously they need to be thinking very carefully about how we

300
00:19:38.701 --> 00:19:42.990
understand cultural norms,
values,
and beliefs about emotion.

301
00:19:42.991 --> 00:19:47.430
How do we study those beyond very broad distinction such as individuals and

302
00:19:47.431 --> 00:19:52.350
collectivism?
More specifically in this context,
um,

303
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.180
what do people think about emotions?

304
00:19:54.181 --> 00:19:57.990
What are the common scripts for how emotions are expressed in healthy and let's

305
00:19:57.991 --> 00:19:59.370
see,
depressed individuals.

306
00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:03.090
And so can you share students of emotions have a lot of training to,

307
00:20:03.091 --> 00:20:06.880

uh,

308
00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:11.310
both of those demands or at least knowing you now for both those domains in

309
00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:15.270
order to join this interdisciplinary teams of researchers.

310
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:20.700
<v 0>So a lot of exciting times ahead with diverse approaches and tools.</v>

311
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:25.700
Absolutely.

314
00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:38.180
