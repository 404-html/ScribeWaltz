1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.150
And today we'll have a doctor.
Derek is Zachary.

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.860
What's an associate professor of psychology at northeastern university who'll be

3
00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:08.870
speaking with us on emotion intention.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.100
So he received his phd from the University of Pennsylvania working with Dr.

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.060
Martin Seligman and his Ba from Stanford University working with Dr Laura

6
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.480
Carstensen.
Doctors Sakowitz.

7
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.560
His research interests lie at the intersection of attention and emotion,

8
00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:23.630
particularly among older adults.

9
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.800
He's received numerous honors including the American Psychological Association

10
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.890
Early Career Award from division 20 the Margaret m and Paul Be Bolts Foundation

11
00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:37.220
Award and behavioral and Social Gerontology for outstanding early career

12
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:40.400
contributions from the Jair Gerontological Society of America,

13
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.550
as well as several graduate mentoring and teaching awards.

14
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.780
His research has been funded by grants from the NIH and doctor Zach Woods has

15
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:50.390
served on the editorial boards of several renowned journals,

16
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:52.790
including psychology and aging emotion,

17
00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:55.490
as well as the Journal of personality and social psychology.

18
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.540
So I now turn to our experts in emotion interview with Doctor Derek [inaudible].

19
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.680
So welcome Derek.
Thanks for speaking with us today.

20
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.760
Can Derek,

21
00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:12.170
I wanted to start out just by asking you some questions about what first got you

22
00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.930
interested in emotion and at the very beginning.

23
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.540
<v 1>So I,
I sort of discovered emotion as an undergraduate at Stanford.
Um,</v>

24
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.710
though I didn't come to it because of emotion per se.

25
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.940
I actually first got interested in the study of aging because I met Laura

26
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.753
Carstensen,
uh,

27
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.200
really one of the world experts on the psychological study of aging at a faculty

28
00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:37.060
dinner during my freshman year at Stanford.

29
00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:40.000
And because I thought she was really great and cool,

30
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:43.680
I decided that I wouldn't start working in her lab.
And,
um,

31
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.470
I learned over the course of my time in the last hub that what she was

32
00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:50.110
interested in was how,
um,

33
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.750
social and emotional processes change with age.

34
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.380
So that is how I ended up studying emotion.
Um,

35
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.390
and I feel very fortunate to have had that,
uh,

36
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.820
had that encounter because it wasn't that I initially had some big question

37
00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:05.380
about emotion I wanted to answer was that I was interested in aging and issues

38
00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:08.560
about emotion became really interesting and important to me in the context of

39
00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:09.394
aging.

40
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.800
<v 0>Wow.
So the serendipitous discovery of emotion,</v>

41
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.000
<v 1>luckily they're in.
Deborah does.</v>

42
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.470
<v 0>So I want to ask you then a few questions about your research now that is</v>

43
00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:22.130
focused on emotion and attention.
Um,
so I mean,

44
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.840
you are widely known in the field for your work on attention and emotion and how

45
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:29.720
this relationship can change through the lifespan.

46
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
And I wondered from your perspective as an expert in this area,

47
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.320
what do you see as the most important discoveries?

48
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.900
<v 1>Me,</v>

49
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.850
the most important discoveries from my own area of research has been that

50
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.220
something that we consider as,

51
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.330
as sort of basic and fundamental as visual attention can really be flexible

52
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.340
depending on things like what goals people are trying to pursue.
Um,

53
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.730
as well as,
uh,
if that it may change over the course of development.
Um,

54
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.960
in that reflect shifting motivation,
shifting goals.

55
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:04.990
So I think for me it's been most exciting to see,

56
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.860
to try to understand differences between people of different ages and something

57
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.390
I think is fundamental is visual attention and to be able to investigate what

58
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:16.840
extent those changes are a function of psychological changes and what's

59
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:21.640
important to people.
And May of course have other,
I have other causes as well.

60
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.500
Um,
so that to me has been very exciting,

61
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:27.490
particularly in light of other research in other labs showing each differences

62
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:29.390
and processing of emotional attention,
um,

63
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.250
in other sorts of cognitive sorts of tasks like in memory tasks.

64
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.790
<v 0>And what do you see as some of the biggest challenges in this line of work too?</v>

65
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.930
<v 1>I see two,
two sort of big challenges.</v>

66
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:44.710
One is just the technical challenge of doing this sort of research.

67
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:48.550
I do using eye tracking to look at visual attention,
um,

68
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:50.830
in populations like older adults.
Uh,

69
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.150
these technologies were not designed really to,
uh,

70
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.550
for use in groups of people who,

71
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.500
who his eyes may not have a typical features,
uh,

72
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.990
that we would expect from a,

73
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:04.270
from younger adults who have assistants were designed for.

74
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.510
So there's the technical challenge of doing something like eye tracking to study

75
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:11.470
attention and older people.
And then there's this sort of pragmatic challenge of,

76
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.681
you know,

77
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:15.490
the reason I'm interested in eye tracking with older people is not just because

78
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:17.110
I want to understand it,
I movement,

79
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.470
but because I want to understand the cognitive processes that help people of

80
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:23.800
different age is a regulate how they feel in real time.

81
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.980
And so the other big challenges that predicting how people feel in real time,

82
00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:30.390
it was really complicated.
Um,

83
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.610
I might be interested in attention is one predictor,

84
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.890
but in the course of everyday life,
um,

85
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.100
there are lots of things that happen that may or may not affect our mood and the

86
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:40.040
short and long term.

87
00:04:40.041 --> 00:04:43.780
So it's been really challenging methodologically to be able to try to predict

88
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:46.930
realtime mood change and how that varies by age.
I think we're making progress,

89
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:48.280
but it's been quite tricky.

90
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.690
<v 0>Well,
all that being said,
I mean you do such sophisticated,
beautiful work,
um,</v>

91
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.710
in spite of all the challenges that year,
you know,
outlining right now.
Um,
I mean,

92
00:04:58.711 --> 00:05:00.420
and in that vein,
you know,

93
00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:04.890
you've continued to do work really looking at how age related changes in the

94
00:05:04.891 --> 00:05:08.790
relationship between attention and emotion shifted across time.

95
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.150
And I just wonder here what you think research tells us about the sort of modify

96
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.450
ability of attention as another important component of emotion regulation more

97
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:20.664
generally.

98
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.320
<v 1>It's interesting,</v>

99
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.830
we initially started doing this work because of our interest specifically in age

100
00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:26.664
differences,

101
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.560
but as we found patterns of each difference that suggested that the ways in

102
00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:34.920
which individuals use their attention to regulate their emotions change changes

103
00:05:34.921 --> 00:05:36.630
with age.
It raised very,

104
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.660
what I think are natural questions about the extent to which we can through time

105
00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:47.010
or through intervention change or attention in a way that influence emotional

106
00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:49.440
regulation.
If that happens naturally with age,

107
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.820
it makes sense to ask how that might have in other formats as well.

108
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.890
And so this has led I think quite naturally just thinking things like,

109
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:00.190
for example,
meditation,
um,

110
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.620
students in my lab who are more having more direct experience than I do.

111
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.170
He's telling me that,
you know,

112
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.050
one of the main reasons that people are interested in meditation is because they

113
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:11.090
believe that in that,

114
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.200
that they can use techniques of meditation to help train your attention because

115
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:17.300
they think that that will improve their wellbeing.

116
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.960
And so that's sort of an implicit belief about being able to train attention for

117
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:21.860
emotion regulation.

118
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:25.910
So I see a lot of parallels between what we can learn about aging and each

119
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:29.000
differences in how people use attention to regulate their emotions.

120
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.300
And something like meditation where people are intentionally trying to write

121
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:34.310
change their retainage and to regulate emotion.

122
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.830
And there are a lot of parallels in a lot of lessons,
uh,

123
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.070
between those two areas in terms of what's possible and also what's not going to

124
00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:43.870
be possible in terms of changing attention for emotion regulation.

125
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.060
<v 0>I mean,
in speaking of parallels,</v>

126
00:06:46.061 --> 00:06:50.710
you've also written about these parallels between aging and disorders of

127
00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:51.221
emotion.

128
00:06:51.221 --> 00:06:55.990
So you've written a nice review looking at the relationship between positivity

129
00:06:55.991 --> 00:07:00.570
bias in both,
you know,
aging or older adults as well as individuals.

130
00:07:00.571 --> 00:07:05.571
So the history of mania or bipolar disorder and in what ways can we really see

131
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.080
sort of parallels as well as possible differences between these two kind of

132
00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:13.480
fundamentally different groups of people.

133
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.860
<v 1>Yeah.
This,
that project really started as a thought experiment did it most of the</v>

134
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.470
experiment?
Yeah,

135
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.020
because I think in the aging area it's become so widely accepted that older

136
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:27.950
adults show positivity in their emotional processing and in their experience

137
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.000
that it's,

138
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.110
there hasn't been much of a dialogue with other areas in which people talk about

139
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.830
positivity biases.

140
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.080
So I thought it would be useful to think about parallels and similarities and

141
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:40.580
differences with other areas of that.

142
00:07:40.581 --> 00:07:44.480
Got me in discussions with people studying bi polar disorder.
And you know,

143
00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:47.870
clearly what we are starting point was that here are two groups of people,

144
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:50.620
older people and people with,
uh,

145
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.190
with bipolar disorder were thought to have some sort of positive offset in some

146
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:59.150
aspect of their experience and or regulation and where their processing of

147
00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:03.320
emotional information.
So he said,
well,
how are these offsets explained,
uh,

148
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:03.980
in the literature?

149
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.790
What are the conceptual models and what do we know empirically about,
uh,

150
00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:09.530
about that?
It turns out that,
you know,

151
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:13.160
it's quite hard to make any definitive conclusions because in large part,

152
00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:16.760
the methods that are used in one field who've not been translated into the
other.

153
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:19.850
So for example,
um,
apparently I've learned from,
uh,

154
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.180
from colleagues in this area that there are numerous studies and the bipolar

155
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.250
bipolar literature on goal frustration and we don't have any of those and they

156
00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:30.620
aging literature,
but it would be a really good thing for somebody to do.
Um,

157
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:35.330
so we've been limited by the lack of sort of a formal parallels in research.

158
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:40.190
Um,
it for me with mostly interesting to think about,
um,
you know,

159
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:44.300
we have a tendency to interpret older adults.
Positivity is a great thing.
Um,

160
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.940
and uh,
and clearly that's not the case in,

161
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.110
in bipolar and even though it's sort of a,
maybe a trait conclusion,

162
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:55.410
I think it's an important conclusion that our interpretation of the positivity

163
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:55.921
offsets,

164
00:08:55.921 --> 00:09:00.450
there's no doubt influenced by our expectations and we really want to understand

165
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:02.880
sort of group differences from,
uh,

166
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.660
from not from neutral negative or positive responding.

167
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.780
Then we started me to conceptual framework that allows us to consider when it's

168
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:14.420
adaptive and when it's not adaptive.
There may or may not be,
um,

169
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.020
interesting differences and our similarities and neuropathways.

170
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.180
I don't think we're at that point yet and neuro processes,
but,
um,

171
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.930
I think it will be interesting for us to keep up with over the years to see if

172
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:28.620
the literature is to become more parallel because they can instruct each other

173
00:09:28.621 --> 00:09:30.870
about what,
uh,
what makes sense and what doesn't.

174
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.310
<v 0>Yeah.
And I mean,
in terms of the literature is kind of instructing each other.</v>

175
00:09:34.311 --> 00:09:37.820
I wonder if you think either of these literatures separately,

176
00:09:37.821 --> 00:09:41.900
our wind sort of put side by side can tell us anything about,
you know,

177
00:09:41.901 --> 00:09:46.580
potential interventions to promote wellbeing more generally or individually in

178
00:09:46.581 --> 00:09:47.990
each of these two populations,

179
00:09:47.991 --> 00:09:51.620
older adults and individuals with a history of mania.
Okay.

180
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.161
<v 1>Well,
you know,</v>

181
00:09:52.161 --> 00:09:55.760
one thing that I do think is suggested by the literature to this point,

182
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.460
and it may just be an artifact of what's been studied,

183
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.580
but to the most consistent findings of an aging literature,

184
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.710
we're not about enhanced positivity per se,

185
00:10:03.711 --> 00:10:05.810
but more about reduction and negativity,

186
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.740
which does not in my reading seem to be the case in the bipolar literature.
So I,

187
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.830
so my belief is that if that pans out as a meaningful distinction in the two,

188
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.240
uh,
the two research areas,

189
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.390
they may be that the aging literature is going to have more implications for

190
00:10:20.391 --> 00:10:23.510
intervention for reducing negative aspect,
whereas the bipolar literature,

191
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.050
we'll have more implications for interventions that could ramp down on

192
00:10:27.051 --> 00:10:30.710
problematic,
positive effect.
Um,
that said,
I mean,

193
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.920
when people ask me about intervention from the aging literature is always
tricky.

194
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:35.810
My usual response is,
well,

195
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:40.820
what the literature suggests is the best intervention is to just wait sort of

196
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.630
that,
the positive effects of time to uh,
to take shape.

197
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.540
And it's only sort of half joking.
I mean,

198
00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:49.700
I do think that that's when one possible lesson,

199
00:10:49.701 --> 00:10:53.600
I mean the meditation parallel is one way that we try to flesh out what the

200
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.480
shorter term implications might be other than been waiting.

201
00:10:56.481 --> 00:10:59.300
But that is sort of one implication I think of the aging literature.

202
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:00.670
<v 0>Excellent.
I mean,</v>

203
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.790
thank you so much for answering all these questions about kind of how you

204
00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:07.660
serendipitously got into the field and motion and how you've been kind of stuck

205
00:11:07.661 --> 00:11:08.830
ever since,
you know,

206
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.150
unraveling this mystery is about attention and emotion across the lifespan.

207
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.400
So the question I have for you now is all of that,
that aside,

208
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.220
where do you see the future of the field headed?
Sort of,

209
00:11:21.221 --> 00:11:22.600
where's it going from here?

210
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.090
<v 1>I mean,
my,
and this is maybe just my hope,
but my,</v>

211
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.240
my expectation is that we'll start to see a better integration across various

212
00:11:32.841 --> 00:11:35.870
levels of analysis that in an emotion research.
Um,

213
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.060
and to me levels of analysis,

214
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:42.800
it certainly includes the usual suspects of levels of analysis,
like biological,

215
00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:44.360
neural,
behavioral,
social.

216
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.920
But it also includes sort of a wider net of things like,
you know,

217
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.500
that are interesting to me,
like,
like gauge differences,
cultural differences,
um,

218
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:58.150
because we have so many great researchers in different areas of emotion focusing

219
00:11:58.151 --> 00:11:59.590
on one aspect,
one,

220
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.400
one of these levels of analysis either going deep or wide and um,

221
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.770
and eventually the hope is that we'll all come together and I think that people

222
00:12:06.771 --> 00:12:11.110
were starting to bridge maybe two to,
uh,
port areas.
But I'm,

223
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:14.460
I'm optimistic that there's going to be work that really goes,
broke,

224
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.580
goes both broader and wider within particular questions.
And what we're seeing,

225
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:21.460
I think is that one barrier to that is different terminology,

226
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:25.150
different operational definitions.
So I'm hopeful that we can at least cross get,

227
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:26.740
get past those,
uh,
those,

228
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.880
those problems and obstacle is to have more common definitions and constructs

229
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.340
that will then allow us to take a broader view.
But that's what,

230
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:34.270
that's what I hope for.

231
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.491
<v 0>That's excellent.</v>

232
00:12:35.491 --> 00:12:40.230
And so when you think about where you hope the future of the field and emotions

233
00:12:40.231 --> 00:12:43.680
going and you have students coming to you who are interested in embarking in

234
00:12:43.681 --> 00:12:47.280
this field,
uh,
what kind of advice do you give them?
Yup.

235
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.800
<v 1>My main advice is that,</v>

236
00:12:49.801 --> 00:12:53.510
and this is clearly rooted in my own experience,
is that,
you know,

237
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.920
emotion is such a rich area.
It's such a hot area.

238
00:12:55.921 --> 00:12:57.870
I think it's a great area for students and be in,

239
00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.800
but I always suggest to students that they make sure to have a thing.
Um,
a,

240
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:06.570
a particular issue topic.
Um,
whether age group,

241
00:13:06.571 --> 00:13:09.000
just a word or some lens through which to view emotion.

242
00:13:09.001 --> 00:13:12.300
Because I think for somebody who's just interested in emotion in general,

243
00:13:12.301 --> 00:13:17.220
it's so vast and it's can be hard to ground one's thinking,
um,
in,

244
00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:19.500
in a literature and the tradition and the history.

245
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:23.940
So I always suggest to students that they start with one with one perspective,

246
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.510
again in my lab,
but would be age differences,
but another lab,

247
00:13:27.511 --> 00:13:30.030
it could have been just a word or it could be some sort of cultural difference

248
00:13:30.031 --> 00:13:33.130
or could be one particular flavor of emotion.
Um,

249
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.830
but just to have some lens in which to view things because then as you expand

250
00:13:37.831 --> 00:13:41.850
out,
you have some sort of basic understanding that you take with you.
So for me,

251
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:45.160
you know,
as initially interested in aging,
so I learned all about that.
Um,

252
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:49.500
and it clearly was the lens with which I thought about emotion.
But then,

253
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.440
you know,
in my,
in sort of another serendipitous experience,

254
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.470
the reason that I ended up doing eye tracking was not because somebody in the

255
00:13:55.471 --> 00:13:56.620
aging literature suggested it,

256
00:13:56.621 --> 00:14:00.240
but because of anxiety you researchers suggested as we were talking about,
um,

257
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.540
about issues,
they said,
well,
you know,
an anxiety,
people were using eye tracking.

258
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:05.970
And I thought,
well,
maybe we could use that in aging.

259
00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:07.950
And it turned out to work out really well.

260
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.890
And I think that if I hadn't had already been grounded in a question where I

261
00:14:10.891 --> 00:14:13.980
felt like I had mastered a one perspective on literature,

262
00:14:13.981 --> 00:14:17.490
I wouldn't have been as open and amenable to try and integrate and across

263
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.040
different literatures and try something to the sort of out of the box.

264
00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:25.041
So I think that these sort of cross cutting approaches,

265
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.470
it may seem like I'm contradicting myself,

266
00:14:28.471 --> 00:14:32.220
but I think that you need some rooting and a basic perspective to then be ready

267
00:14:32.221 --> 00:14:35.120
and able to do work that sort of says,
I have this protective,

268
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.860
I'm going to try to break it up a little bit.
Um,
so that,
anyway,

269
00:14:37.861 --> 00:14:39.300
that's the advice that I would,
but I would give.

270
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.320
<v 0>That's fantastic advice.
Derek,</v>

271
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:46.000
thank you so much for speaking with us today.
Really appreciate it.

272
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.100
Thank you very much.
Great to talk to you.

273
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:52.250
And this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Doctor Derek is

274
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:54.440
Accurate's from northeastern university.
