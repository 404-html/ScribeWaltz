1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.460
So welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.300
This is our very final closing lecture for this course.

3
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:09.690
Psychology one 31 and introduction to human emotion.

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.900
As we've taken a journey in this course through emotion,

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.110
we've been able to connect to it intimately with our own experiences of emotion

6
00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:21.480
and everyday life and at the same time appreciate just how complex and how

7
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:26.481
mysterious emotion truly is by probing emotion from multiple angles and levels,

8
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.440
different theoretical perspectives and using different tools that scientists try

9
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:34.710
to take to quantify exactly what emotion is.

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.050
What I'd like to do in our final lecture is to recap exactly where we've been in

11
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:44.280
our journey through the world of human emotion and where do we go next in this

12
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:47.520
exciting but very young interdisciplinary field.

13
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.750
So in our final lecture we all ask ourselves,

14
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.730
is this really the end of emotion?

15
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.620
In many ways I think of this course as a platform for the beginning of many

16
00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.100
years to come.

17
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.540
I hope for you in your own exploration of emotion and for the field of an effect

18
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:04.770
of science.
More generally.

19
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.510
What we'll be doing today is starting with the summary of where we've gone

20
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:10.530
through this course,

21
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:14.340
taking a time travel journey through all the different lectures and diff topics

22
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:16.410
that have spanned the realm of human emotion.

23
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.880
Then we'll move on to some puzzles of where do we go as a field,

24
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.050
what are some of the most pressing and unanswered questions to date,

25
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.070
and then we'll conclude with an expert interview from someone who is at the

26
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:33.900
forefront of trying to understand exactly how we take the science of emotion and

27
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:38.400
move it forward into an increasingly digital age of human interaction and

28
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:43.140
communication.
So I'll start first with where have we been in this course?

29
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.210
So we started this course off by first acknowledging that human emotion is

30
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:52.590
something that can be studied from a wide variety of perspectives and techniques

31
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.220
ranging across a wide variety of fields.
As you can see here.

32
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.630
And in answering some of the three main course objectives,

33
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.640
we've tried to first expose ourselves to all the current and contemporary

34
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:10.290
theories of emotion style science today here at the forefront of the field.

35
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.420
We've also really gone through systematically what are all the different methods

36
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.010
and tools and ways of thinking about emotions as researchers.

37
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.421
And finally,

38
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:25.890
and what I hope you've gained from this course is an increasing curiosity and

39
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:30.330
excitement in this new discipline charged even more than you were when you first

40
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.620
enrolled in this course.

41
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.600
To better understand exactly what is this thing we call human emotion and why it

42
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:40.500
is so important and vital for our survival as a species.

43
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.601
Importantly,

44
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:46.980
when we think about the course we've covered roughly as amazing as you can see

45
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:47.520
here,

46
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.350
20 broad topics and what I want to do is think about as we sort of spanned

47
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:55.230
through all these topics that we've covered in a relatively brief time,

48
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.920
what are some of the most important insights and questions we've gained?

49
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.100
So I'll start first here with our very first lecture.

50
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.720
So this is when we went through an introduction and overview of what the course

51
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:08.351
was about.

52
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:13.120
And really what we did is start with perhaps the most age old and puzzling

53
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:15.430
question of what exactly is an emotion.

54
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.700
We cover different historical perspectives on this issue.

55
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.110
Starting with the ancient Greek scholars and then moving through time to some of

56
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:25.270
the most contemporary scientists today.

57
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.070
Still grappling with what exactly is an emotion and how do we classify it?

58
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:33.880
Do we think of it as a discrete entity or something that we can capture more

59
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:35.530
along a dimensional approach?

60
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.330
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.850
<v 0>Then we moved on to really trying to,</v>

62
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.550
once we answer the question of what an emotion is,

63
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.260
trying to map out systematically the tools that are used both to elicit

64
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:48.094
emotions.

65
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.940
So trigger these feelings in people as well as then once they're triggered,

66
00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:56.140
try to measure Phi them,
uh,
or measure them in a more quantified,

67
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:57.280
rigorous fashion.

68
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So here we looked at measuring and eliciting emotions and the question that we

69
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:07.630
really tried to tackle is how exactly do we measure emotion?

70
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.060
So we all can relate to what an emotion is.

71
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:14.380
We've all experienced in emotion and we can all see emotions and detect them and

72
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:15.340
people around us.

73
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.930
But how do we try to capture it in the lab and try to quantify it from a more

74
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:22.570
scientific perspective?
Here.

75
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:27.160
We went through eight broad domains of tools that are used to trigger emotions

76
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:28.930
by current scientists in the field.

77
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.200
These range from using films to photos to relived emotional memories to dyadic

78
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:36.790
interactions using music,

79
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:40.960
singing as some of the most powerful tools that make us feel intense,

80
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:45.310
intense feelings,
acoustic startle reflex,
startle,
idling modulation,

81
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.020
and even how the directed facial action task simply by moving our face and the

82
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:50.830
muscles in it,

83
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.390
we can actually make ourselves feel emotions ranging from happiness to even

84
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:56.830
sadness or disgust.

85
00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:59.403
<v 1>Okay.</v>

86
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.350
<v 0>Importantly,</v>

87
00:05:00.351 --> 00:05:04.310
once we talked about how we can use these different tools to trigger an emotion,

88
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.630
we then went through a multi-method approach to emotion that suggests that in

89
00:05:08.631 --> 00:05:10.430
order to quantify emotion response,

90
00:05:10.431 --> 00:05:15.230
you need to really pay attention to it's unique and elegant components looking

91
00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:18.910
across subjective behavioral and physiological response to me,

92
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:20.030
and as you saw here,

93
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.270
both at the level of the brain or the central nervous system,

94
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.680
as well as looking in the autonomic nervous system at peripheral signals like

95
00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:30.950
your heart rate changing or your skin temperature increasing.

96
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.900
<v 1>Okay?</v>

97
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.900
<v 0>Then we took a brief detour away from perhaps the topic of human emotion to</v>

98
00:05:38.211 --> 00:05:43.070
pause for a moment and reflect on the way in which emotions are manifested in

99
00:05:43.071 --> 00:05:44.750
the broader animal kingdom.

100
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.660
And here we were trying to really get at the question,

101
00:05:47.661 --> 00:05:52.100
do different animals like rats,
monkeys,
dogs,
do they have feelings?

102
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.030
So although of course in human emotion we found that we can learn a lot about

103
00:05:56.031 --> 00:05:56.900
our own feelings,

104
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.220
but actually studying how unique versus how similar they are with other species

105
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.540
species near us.

106
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.340
And here what we did is looked at the presence or absence of what we think of as

107
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:11.870
humanlike emotions,
fear,
happiness,
anger and animals.

108
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:16.871
To help us tackle the question of to what extent are these emotions truly human,

109
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:21.650
unique or what kind of human uniqueness do emotions have?
Really,

110
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.700
we looked at this using a wide variety of tools that researchers use,

111
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:28.670
including both,
you know,
lab and field studies.

112
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.140
As you can see here by my colleague Laurie Santos.
Um,

113
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.180
we also realize that perhaps some of our own emotions may not be so uniquely

114
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:38.420
human,

115
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.230
but that we can actually see physiological similarity in some of our closest

116
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.400
nonhuman primates across a wide range of emotions.
As you can see here,

117
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.830
ranging from surprise to even anger.

118
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.350
And it suggests that we even share an intricate social bond and a way of

119
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:58.880
connecting emotionally through what's called impact empathy or empathic accuracy

120
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.290
with some of our closest canine friends who seem to have the special ability to

121
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:06.440
pick up on our own emotions and respond to them.

122
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.030
We then tried to explore this question of the origins of emotions or another

123
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:18.130
words where exactly did our emotions come from or evolve from in the first

124
00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:23.810
place?
Our emotions evolutionarily evolved.

125
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.430
So here we discuss the extent to which emotions indeed are more evolutionarily

126
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:31.970
evolved versus more socially or culturally constructed.

127
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.440
And we began by really covering ground with what's thought to be,
you know,

128
00:07:36.441 --> 00:07:40.430
the forefather of this perspective of an evolutionary approach to emotion.

129
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.850
Darwin who had these prescient observations in his writings,

130
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.290
the expression of the emotion in man and animals where he really,
you know,

131
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:52.820
had these fascinating insights into observing similar expressions of emotion

132
00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:56.960
among,
you know,
human and other animals,
including dogs and cats,

133
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.490
and helped us trace our insights into the early emergence of emotions,

134
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.630
not only in humans but across species on this planet more broadly.

135
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.450
Then we tried to probe individual differences in emotion here.

136
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.050
So we looked at important sources of cultural variation,

137
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.720
potential gender differences between men and women,

138
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.650
and even the role of sexual arousal in our emotional lives.

139
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.840
So for example,
we were really trying to answer this question of do culture,
age,

140
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.470
gender,
sex,
do these change our emotional being?

141
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.670
Do they change who we are and what kinds of emotions we experience?

142
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.890
And those that we expressed to other people.

143
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.940
So you might remember this example from one of our earlier lectures where we

144
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:43.850
tried to look at cultural sources of variation,

145
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:47.810
emotion and found that it can even shape the way that we,
you know,

146
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.840
interpret and ascribe emotions to simple pictures like this of cartoon fish with

147
00:08:52.851 --> 00:08:53.421
Americans.

148
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:56.880
Thinking that the fish and the front is angry and those from a more Chinese

149
00:08:56.881 --> 00:09:01.440
background ascribing sadness to the fish in the front.
So we find that,
you know,

150
00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:06.000
cultural profoundly shapes the way that we perceive emotions in the world around

151
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:06.834
us.

152
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.730
We asked the question on whether or not men and women are really that different

153
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:15.540
emotionally,
right?
And whether it was possible that they really are from,

154
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:18.150
you know,
different emotional planets.

155
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.070
And then we asked ourselves,
what does sex habit,
you know,

156
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.880
anything to do with emotion,
right?
His desire and emotion.

157
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:31.380
And how do men and women differ in their sources of sexual arousal?

158
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.280
And what does this tell us about the kinds of bonds they form with others and

159
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:38.310
the kinds of emotions that they experience during,
you know,

160
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:41.100
context of sexual arousal or desire.

161
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.600
We then moved on to look at really how do we emit or reveal our emotions to

162
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:52.170
others through our behaviors,
through our expressions.
Um,

163
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.160
one of my favorite topics that we covered here was the topic of laughter.

164
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.030
So we all laugh countless times in a given day.

165
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.260
And here we looked at what are the different kinds of laughs that people emit.

166
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.430
We talked about this concept of a laughter dictionary that's been developed to

167
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:13.170
quantify laughs at differ from what are called hisses to grunts to even cackles

168
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.190
and showing that these different kinds of laughters are actually perceived

169
00:10:17.191 --> 00:10:18.390
differently by others.

170
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.410
Some kinds of laughs actually make us look more affiliative to others.

171
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.960
Men and women differ in the way that they laugh.

172
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.100
And we actually looked at different ways that laughter is actually something

173
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:32.940
that can be quite healthy for us,
even at a physical health level.

174
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.410
So it suggests perhaps that laughter not only helps us navigate our social
world,

175
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.220
but really can be a remedy to many of our physical ailments.

176
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.730
And then on the flip side,
we talked about crying.

177
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.960
So most of you probably came into this course thinking that crying serves as

178
00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:52.500
Cathartic function,
right?
It helps us event our emotions,

179
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.700
but it seems that crying is not good for everyone.
Right?

180
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.620
And that it really varies depending on the context you're crying in your own

181
00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:05.730
emotional background and personality style and perhaps even your gender.

182
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.560
So sometimes crying can help us,
but other times it may actually hurt us.

183
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.950
And here,
if you remember this diagram,

184
00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:18.840
we saw how even brief touches to the forearm beneath the curtain between two

185
00:11:18.841 --> 00:11:23.410
complete strangers,
even in the course of a few seconds,
can convey,

186
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:28.430
convey a spectrum of wildly distinct emotions ranging from love and anger to

187
00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:29.520
sadness,

188
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.440
so that we're able simply to use this powerful modality of touch to let other

189
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:36.720
people know exactly how we're feeling.

190
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:42.210
So expression is really powerful in how we convey emotions to other people and

191
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:46.740
how we signal to ourselves the kinds of emotional states we want to feel and how

192
00:11:46.741 --> 00:11:48.030
we want to regulate them.

193
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.720
We then moved onto more physiological approaches to motion.

194
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.220
Looking at to an extent,

195
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:57.790
what can we learn about our emotions through our bodily sensations?

196
00:11:57.791 --> 00:12:01.810
In other words,
is our heart really a window into our feelings?

197
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.930
And research suggests will,
yes,
it is that as our emotions change,

198
00:12:05.931 --> 00:12:07.210
so does our heart rate.

199
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.470
And here we explore different tools and techniques that researchers in the field

200
00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:16.420
of psychophysiology use to measure the body's response and how we've been

201
00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:20.710
mapping a profile of what's called emotion specificity within the autonomic

202
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:25.420
nervous system to really try to get at emotions that range from happiness to

203
00:12:25.421 --> 00:12:26.051
sadness,

204
00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:30.610
to fear and just how we measure these responses using a wide variety of tools.

205
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.330
Um,

206
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:36.330
and sort of technically how you in the lab apply these tools and quantify the

207
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:41.680
response.
Then we got up into the brain and asked ourselves,

208
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:45.970
is the brain something that was once thought solely to be devoted to rational

209
00:12:45.971 --> 00:12:49.120
thinking?
Also emotional,
right?

210
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.560
Are there certain parts of our brain or ways that the brain connects to an

211
00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:58.000
interacts with other neural systems that actually may give rise to our everyday

212
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.690
emotions?
We looked at tools like Fmr,

213
00:13:00.691 --> 00:13:04.930
try and Eeg to study emotion in the brain as well as what are thought to be some

214
00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:08.290
of the major emotional divisions in the brain,
like the limbic system,

215
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.920
the striatum and the neocortex.
Um,

216
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.810
as well as interconnectivity between these regions.

217
00:13:13.811 --> 00:13:18.730
And this is one of the most cutting edge cross disciplinary approaches to

218
00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:23.020
emotion today in a field referred to now as an affect of neuroscience.

219
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:28.000
We then moved on to the world of self conscious emotions and other words,

220
00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:29.920
emotions that are really about the self.

221
00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:34.750
So these are emotions that emerge later in life and require higher kind of

222
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.510
cognitive resources.
They're more complex,

223
00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:41.770
they require an awareness of the self and how the self situates within a broader

224
00:13:41.771 --> 00:13:43.590
social world.
Um,

225
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.670
and here we looked at emotions ranging from pride to also our guests.
You know,

226
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.380
appearance here by John.
Let's,

227
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:55.330
I'm a television writer for both 30 rock and Saturday night live undergoing one

228
00:13:55.331 --> 00:13:59.410
of our standardized embarrassment eliciting pass in the laboratory,

229
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:02.410
which involves singing along to the Beatle song,
twist and shout.

230
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.080
So we learned not only every day,
you know,

231
00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:09.430
folk but also even celebrities experience self conscious emotions like

232
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.260
embarrassment.
Um,
now when we think about emotions,

233
00:14:14.261 --> 00:14:16.600
we've,
we know that they don't occur in a vacuum.

234
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:21.070
Rarely do we experience emotions by ourselves in our own room.

235
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.390
Mostly we experienced them around other people and they're often about other

236
00:14:25.391 --> 00:14:29.080
people.
So we know that emotions are inherently social,

237
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:34.300
but yet to what extent do we know how emotions help us navigate in a social

238
00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:37.630
world.
So here,
this was our 10th lecture.

239
00:14:37.631 --> 00:14:41.680
We really tried to probe this question of to what extent can we think of

240
00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:43.720
emotions in a social world?

241
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:48.880
How do they look in live interactions between people,
partners,
groups,

242
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:54.020
how do they help foster our most important social relationships with friends and

243
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:55.220
romantic partners?

244
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.520
And these are some of the questions that we probed in this module.

245
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.340
And then had special guests,
lecturers as well,

246
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:06.341
looking at topics like emotions and social interaction from Dr. David Desteno as

247
00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:11.210
well as the relational context and how it shapes our emotional lives by Dr.

248
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.043
Margaret Clark.

249
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:13.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

250
00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.690
<v 0>Now when we moved through our halfway point in the course,</v>

251
00:15:16.691 --> 00:15:19.630
we segwayed into looking at this question of morality.

252
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.760
So here we really tried to ask the question of what role does emotion play in

253
00:15:24.761 --> 00:15:29.761
making us moral creatures and how can it influence our behavior for the good and

254
00:15:29.981 --> 00:15:30.814
for the bad.

255
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.050
So we saw definitions of morality by figures like John Height who suggests that

256
00:15:35.051 --> 00:15:39.670
morals are an inherent part of what makes us human and underlie our human

257
00:15:39.671 --> 00:15:42.700
goodness or our sense of virtuous behavior,

258
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:47.020
but we also saw that emotions can lead us to perform perhaps some of the most

259
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.080
nefarious evil acts known to mankind.

260
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:55.360
And so here we had a special guest lecture by Dr Joshua Buckholtz who help us

261
00:15:55.361 --> 00:15:57.970
also understand the dark side of emotion and morality,

262
00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:02.470
looking at emotion among people who are diagnosed with what's called

263
00:16:02.471 --> 00:16:03.304
psychopathy.

264
00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:05.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

265
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.000
<v 0>When we moved on to cognition here we are trying to look at the role of how</v>

266
00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:13.500
emotion shapes the way we think.
How does that shape our emotional memories?

267
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.950
How does it shape attention to the visual world around us,

268
00:16:16.951 --> 00:16:21.951
literally causing us to change how we see the world and might even influence our

269
00:16:22.441 --> 00:16:26.190
unconscious cognitive processes and emotional life?

270
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:31.430
Tracing back to early observations by Freud who suggested that the unconscious

271
00:16:31.561 --> 00:16:35.730
life is a really important part of our emotional health and how recent work by

272
00:16:35.731 --> 00:16:39.390
John Barge colleagues has confirmed this early intuition.

273
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.860
We also had a special guest lecture by Dr Marc Brackett on emotional

274
00:16:43.861 --> 00:16:44.700
intelligence.

275
00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:49.940
So this idea that we may vary an extent to which we perceive emotions accurately

276
00:16:50.101 --> 00:16:51.630
and regulate our emotions.

277
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:53.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

278
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.740
<v 0>When we thought about judgment and decision making,</v>

279
00:16:55.741 --> 00:16:59.520
what we were really trying to get at is how do emotion shape some of the most

280
00:16:59.521 --> 00:17:02.430
important decisions we make in everyday life.

281
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.260
And one place that we started looking at is how we make choices about how to

282
00:17:07.261 --> 00:17:11.790
spend money,
right?
So in other words,
does our wallet reflect our feelings?

283
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:15.030
Do emotion shape how much we spend,
what we buy?

284
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.800
And Ken money actually by happiness.
And we found that,
well it might,

285
00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:24.570
but it depends on how you spend it and perhaps you ought to be spending it on

286
00:17:24.571 --> 00:17:27.540
other people instead of your house instead of yourself.

287
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:33.450
So here,
after looking at,
you know,
morality,
cognition,
decision making,

288
00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.870
we moved on to how we actually can,
you know,

289
00:17:36.871 --> 00:17:39.210
shift and modify our emotions.

290
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:44.420
So precisely how and when are we able to take the reigns over our emotions and

291
00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:48.060
shape them to be the kinds of emotional experiences we want.

292
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.670
So we borrowed from,
you know,

293
00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:55.671
some of the most commonly used and wide reaching accounts of emotion by James

294
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.820
Gross and colleagues when they tried to define emotion regulation as the process

295
00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:03.210
by which individuals influence which emotions they have,

296
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.230
when they have them in how they experience and express their emotions.

297
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:12.120
And one of my fabulous graduate students gave a really interesting guest lecture

298
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:17.010
thinking about how emotion regulation shapes our social relationships and how we

299
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:22.011
can actually leverage our relationships with other people to help us change our

300
00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:24.000
emotional experiences.

301
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:26.543
<v 1>Okay.</v>

302
00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.850
<v 0>Emotional development.</v>

303
00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.000
It's interesting we got into this later on in the course because what this is

304
00:18:31.001 --> 00:18:35.200
really asking is after talking about all these different facets of emotion,

305
00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:41.220
we then got to try to look at how early in our life do emotions actually begin.

306
00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.120
So can you see emotions like happiness and sadness,

307
00:18:46.121 --> 00:18:50.950
fear even in some of our youngest human infants who come to the lab.

308
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.550
And so here we also then when we thought about infants,

309
00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:58.630
we then thought about how to emotions emerge and change the lifespan.

310
00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.910
So here we then moved on to adolescence,

311
00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:05.500
which is described as a period of all gas and no emotional breaks,
right?

312
00:19:05.501 --> 00:19:09.790
So it seems that adolescents seem to constantly be on the go and have trouble

313
00:19:09.791 --> 00:19:12.190
stopping or inhibiting their emotions.

314
00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.360
So this has been coined as a period of emotional storm and stress.

315
00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.460
What happens after adolescence?

316
00:19:18.461 --> 00:19:22.210
What happens as we age into our middle and older adulthood?
Well,

317
00:19:22.211 --> 00:19:26.530
what we found is a very comforting notion that near the end of our lives we

318
00:19:26.531 --> 00:19:31.000
actually seem to become not only wiser but also happier based on the well

319
00:19:31.001 --> 00:19:34.670
established work.
I've Dr Laura,
Laura Carstensen and colleagues,
um,

320
00:19:34.671 --> 00:19:39.250
under what they call their socioemotional selectivity theory.
So as we age,

321
00:19:39.251 --> 00:19:42.910
we actually become happier and we're better able to harness and control our

322
00:19:42.911 --> 00:19:43.744
feelings.

323
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.140
Now if we look at the intersection between how emotion effects health,

324
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.430
we explored three broad domains,
critical to healthy survival.

325
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.090
This included looking at the relationship between emotion and sleep,

326
00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.890
finding that sleep indeed seems to be a form of overnight therapy for our

327
00:20:01.891 --> 00:20:02.850
emotional brain,

328
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:07.620
helping restore and sort of put back in balance our emotional wellbeing.

329
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.500
We also looked at the impact of stress,

330
00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:15.180
both short term and long or more chronic stress on our emotional health.

331
00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:19.380
Finding not surprisingly chronic stress to be detrimental to our emotional

332
00:20:19.381 --> 00:20:20.040
health,

333
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.880
perhaps short and intermittent bouts of stress actually help us accomplish our

334
00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:26.040
most important life goals and tasks.

335
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.450
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

336
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.700
<v 0>Then we also looked at the role of hormones,
right?</v>

337
00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:31.950
Delving into the neuroendocrine system,

338
00:20:31.951 --> 00:20:35.520
and this is a really up and coming area in the field of Africa,

339
00:20:35.521 --> 00:20:38.970
science and trying to understand by measuring hormonal levels,

340
00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:43.380
can we understand something about our emotions and exactly what insights can we

341
00:20:43.381 --> 00:20:46.560
see and would this differ for men versus women?

342
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:52.710
And then we got to the topic that is,
uh,
something,
uh,

343
00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:57.170
most personal interest to me as a clinical psychologist looking at the role of

344
00:20:57.171 --> 00:21:01.490
emotional disorders.
In other words here we asked the question,

345
00:21:01.491 --> 00:21:02.870
can emotion go awry?

346
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:07.310
And what we did is covered three broad themes describing the ways in which

347
00:21:07.311 --> 00:21:10.280
emotion can become dysregulated,
either through extremes,

348
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.380
absences or disjunctions,

349
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.830
and how they become dysregulated and impairing in this way.

350
00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.200
And we looked at this trans diagnostically.

351
00:21:18.201 --> 00:21:22.550
So across a ride variety of clinical disorders ranging from anxiety to

352
00:21:22.551 --> 00:21:25.430
depression,
mania,
schizophrenia,

353
00:21:25.431 --> 00:21:29.180
and even personality disorders like borderline personality disorder.

354
00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:31.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

355
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.850
<v 0>And then we turn to try to think about how can we use emotion to promote</v>

356
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.840
increased mental health?
How can we enhance human wellbeing?

357
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:40.951
Well,

358
00:21:40.951 --> 00:21:45.570
there's the topic of resilience that suggests that most people have this amazing

359
00:21:45.571 --> 00:21:50.130
ability to seemingly bounce back.
You know,
like this beach ball you see here,

360
00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.880
we're all like these emotional beach balls in many ways that we can bounce back

361
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.910
even from some of the most difficult life traumas.

362
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:02.670
And here we also had a fantastic guest lecture from a renowned expert on emotion

363
00:22:02.671 --> 00:22:07.350
in psychotherapy telling us how we can sort of translate these insights from a

364
00:22:07.351 --> 00:22:12.000
course like this on human emotion to develop more targeted interventions to help

365
00:22:12.001 --> 00:22:16.590
people both increase positive emotion and decreased distressing and impairing

366
00:22:16.591 --> 00:22:17.790
negative emotions.

367
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.273
<v 1>Okay?</v>

368
00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:26.000
<v 0>And we concluded by turning to a topic of fascination to human beings for</v>

369
00:22:26.001 --> 00:22:28.310
centuries,
which is happiness.

370
00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.480
And we started by asking exactly what is happiness,

371
00:22:32.481 --> 00:22:37.040
how do people define it and how can we find it in a society with an ever

372
00:22:37.041 --> 00:22:39.350
increasing desire to become happy.

373
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:40.800
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

374
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.670
<v 0>Importantly,</v>

375
00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:45.240
we also talked about some caveats and this is the work that I specialize in in

376
00:22:45.241 --> 00:22:48.960
my laboratory here at Yale,
which is looking at the other side of happiness,

377
00:22:48.961 --> 00:22:53.550
realizing that happiness,
like any state in life has two sides.

378
00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.860
There's a good side and adaptive side,

379
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.500
but there may also be a dark side of happiness.

380
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.390
Talking about the ways in which happiness is experienced too intensely in the

381
00:23:03.391 --> 00:23:06.720
wrong context or pursued for the wrong reasons,

382
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.100
it may actually backfire and decrease our overall sense of wellbeing.

383
00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.980
Um,
and this is something that if you're interested in learning more about,

384
00:23:15.981 --> 00:23:20.330
you can check out my lab,
the positive emotion and psych pathology lab.
Um,

385
00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.330
www.yalepeplab.com.

386
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:24.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

387
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.100
<v 0>And this is something that we've been pursuing,
um,</v>

388
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.680
with another scholar in the field.
Judith Moskowitz,

389
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:33.280
I'm with a book we have coming out called seeing both sides,

390
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.920
the light and dark side of positive emotions.

391
00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:40.921
So here we try to take a comprehensive approach to happiness and wellbeing by

392
00:23:41.021 --> 00:23:44.260
looking at not only the ways that,
that these states are good for us,

393
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:49.220
but when and how they can actually be too much and be too our emotional

394
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:52.580
disadvantage.
So it's coming soon.
So stay tuned.

395
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.520
We also had a very special guest lecturer from philosopher and cognitive

396
00:23:58.521 --> 00:24:02.420
scientists,
Josh know who helped us think about how our morality,

397
00:24:02.421 --> 00:24:04.790
our sense of goodness and badness,

398
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:09.050
how that can shape the way we perceive happiness and others and how we ascribe

399
00:24:09.051 --> 00:24:10.880
happiness to other people as well.

400
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.050
And now here we are,
you know,

401
00:24:15.051 --> 00:24:18.410
summarizing this course and looking ahead to the future.

402
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.320
And I hope that when we think about summarizing this course,

403
00:24:21.321 --> 00:24:25.610
it's important to really think about the unique aspects and experiences at this

404
00:24:25.611 --> 00:24:26.450
course provided,

405
00:24:26.451 --> 00:24:30.650
which really I would think are like any other course on human emotion you've

406
00:24:30.651 --> 00:24:34.640
seen before.
So in addition to covering some of these exciting topics,

407
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.020
you've been able to really view these fantastic videotape guests lectures that

408
00:24:39.021 --> 00:24:41.870
had been broken up into 20 minute modules.

409
00:24:41.871 --> 00:24:46.430
So you've had three 20 minute modules for each lecture with takeaway questions

410
00:24:46.431 --> 00:24:50.270
to help hone some of the most critical insights and points covered in each

411
00:24:50.271 --> 00:24:51.104
lecture.

412
00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.090
You've also had the opportunity to engage in interactive discussions using state

413
00:24:56.091 --> 00:25:00.110
of the art online technology to have discussions about some of these topics,

414
00:25:00.111 --> 00:25:03.830
some of the controversies behind them with both myself as the professor,

415
00:25:03.831 --> 00:25:08.240
as well as some of my graduate student teaching fellows.
And finally,

416
00:25:08.241 --> 00:25:13.010
perhaps one of the most treasured unique components of this course is for the

417
00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:17.120
first time ever and this expert and emotion interview series that aired

418
00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.740
specially for this course.

419
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:23.950
So this included a state of art series that conducted interviews with experts in

420
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:26.540
emotion across the entire country.

421
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:31.220
And here you had the opportunity to view live conversations with visionary

422
00:25:31.221 --> 00:25:32.450
figures in the field,

423
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:37.780
including those names listed here who directly mapped onto the exciting research

424
00:25:38.391 --> 00:25:41.750
that we talked about in lecture and that you covered in your readings.

425
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.960
So this is something that I think unlike any other course,

426
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.790
you were not only able to read about some of these insights in the field of

427
00:25:48.791 --> 00:25:49.624
human ocean,

428
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:54.470
but actually be able to literally hear and see the minds behind them.

429
00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:01.610
So we covered where we went.
Now where do we go from here?

430
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:06.770
So we know that emotion is this exciting and interdisciplinary field and it's

431
00:26:06.771 --> 00:26:08.420
also one that's relatively new.

432
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.650
So we've seen recent interest and an explosion of scientific attention only in

433
00:26:12.651 --> 00:26:13.820
the past few decades.

434
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:19.130
So in many ways this leaves more unanswered questions than answered questions

435
00:26:19.131 --> 00:26:23.930
and many opportunities for people and students like you to become engaged in

436
00:26:23.931 --> 00:26:27.050
this field and move it forward into whole new territories.

437
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.050
So what I'll try to do is conclude by highlighting what I think of the,

438
00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.160
some of the perhaps key puzzles.

439
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.320
I'll talk about four of them and,

440
00:26:36.321 --> 00:26:40.130
but I want to emphasize that these are just four puzzles and there are likely

441
00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:44.550
countless more puzzles out there as we move forward into brave new world of

442
00:26:44.551 --> 00:26:48.510
human emotion.
So when we think about some of the puzzles,

443
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:53.130
one of the ones that has come up consistently is trying to link the kinds of

444
00:26:53.131 --> 00:26:57.360
emotional experiences that we see in the lab to the real world.

445
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.690
Emotions then unfold around us every day in our own lives.

446
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.860
So here what I think is a critical input,
important direction to move forward,

447
00:27:04.861 --> 00:27:09.270
and it's to try to translate what we measure in the lab to what we see out there

448
00:27:09.271 --> 00:27:10.410
in the world in front of us,

449
00:27:10.411 --> 00:27:14.490
and really try to capture the essence of what we all are so familiar with.

450
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:18.660
And it's so intimate to all of us as the experience of feeling emotion.

451
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.860
I think one of the other important puzzle pieces here is to use a multi-method

452
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:25.891
approach.

453
00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:29.970
So we've talked about emotion as something that has multiple components,
right?

454
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:34.470
It has a subjective response,
a behavioral display,
physiological features,

455
00:27:34.471 --> 00:27:36.570
and the autonomic nervous system in the brain,

456
00:27:36.571 --> 00:27:38.880
and also up and coming insights and genetics.

457
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.760
And more and more as we move forward,
as we measure emotion,

458
00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:46.761
it's critical that we integrate these tools and that we try to engage in ever

459
00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:50.730
increasing interdisciplinary collaborations.

460
00:27:50.731 --> 00:27:55.050
Not only between among psychologists with different areas of specialization,

461
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:59.400
but also with neuroscientists,
geneticists,
sociologists,
anthropologists,

462
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:03.180
to really gain the most comprehensive portrait of emotion that we can.

463
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:08.790
And I think for many of us,
a lot of early work on emotion,

464
00:28:08.791 --> 00:28:10.530
especially in clinical psychology,

465
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:14.910
often focused on identifying patterns of distress and how we can alleviate

466
00:28:14.911 --> 00:28:15.810
people suffering.

467
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:21.300
So how can we make people feel less anxious or less depressed?

468
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:25.950
But there's been an ever increasing movement now to think about how can we use

469
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:30.240
emotion to better understand and cultivate a good life?

470
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.180
So one that is full,
not only of happiness,

471
00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:35.940
but of meaning and promoting compassion.

472
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:40.740
So this is a really important emerging trend in the field to think about not

473
00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:43.710
only the ways in which emotions can lead us to suffer,

474
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:48.150
but how we can leverage our emotions and understand them to build the best

475
00:28:48.151 --> 00:28:50.970
possible life for us as human beings.

476
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.080
And finally,
emotion and technology.

477
00:28:55.081 --> 00:28:58.860
So we're existing in an ever increasing technological world.

478
00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:02.430
And how can we use some of these,
you know,

479
00:29:02.431 --> 00:29:06.000
commonly used social media tools,
platforms,

480
00:29:06.001 --> 00:29:08.270
things like Facebook and Twitter.
Um,

481
00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.930
how do we understand the way in which emotion unfolds in these contexts and how

482
00:29:12.931 --> 00:29:14.310
does it change who we are?

483
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:18.090
How does it change the kinds of emotions we expressed to other people?

484
00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.890
So with this topic,

485
00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:24.891
it actually helps us segway into our very final expert interview with the,

486
00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:30.330
a renowned expert on this topic and who works at Facebook as the engineering

487
00:29:31.141 --> 00:29:31.974
director.

488
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:36.630
So here are experts in emotion interview will be with Arturo Bihar,

489
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.850
the director of engineering at Facebook,

490
00:29:38.851 --> 00:29:41.980
and he'll be speaking with us on emotion and social media.

491
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.490
Arturo as director of engineering at Facebook,

492
00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:49.930
has worked on social tools to help people be more mindful of each other.

493
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.950
This includes such areas as identity,
harm and abuse prevention,

494
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:58.960
ways to develop better online citizens and tools designed to help resolve

495
00:29:58.961 --> 00:30:01.630
conflicts between individuals such as bullying.

496
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:06.430
Previously he worked at Yahoo where he worked with a global team dedicated to

497
00:30:06.431 --> 00:30:08.680
providing a secure online experience.

498
00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:13.980
So I now turn to our last experts and emotion interview together with our Touro

499
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.210
Bihar on emotion and social media.

500
00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:19.510
Thank you for a wonderful course and farewell.
