00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.190
For experts in emotion interview.

2
00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:06.930
We have the honor of speaking with Dr Jonathan Rottenberg.
Um,

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.530
a leading researcher in the area of emotion and psychopathology.

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.830
Jonathan Rottenberg has pioneered efforts to integrate the basic science of

5
00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:17.530
emotion with the study of psychopathology.

6
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.030
He received his phd from Stanford University and is currently an associate

7
00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:26.560
professor of psychology at the University of South Florida where he directs the

8
00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:28.480
mood and emotion laboratory.

9
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.530
He's the lead editor of an n of emotion and psychopathology,

10
00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.840
bridging [inaudible] and clinical science.

11
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.740
And he's authored over 30 scientific publications.
His work,

12
00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:41.830
not surprisingly focused on depression as well as crying,

13
00:00:41.831 --> 00:00:45.880
has received international media coverage,
including science news,

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.600
Scientific American,
the New York Times,
ABC News,

15
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.100
and the BBC.

16
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.300
He also writes a blog about depression for psychology today.
Um,

17
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.210
one fun fact about Jonathan Rottenberg is that he decided in his early forties,

18
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.960
he was going to train for a marathon and by the time we'll speak with him,

19
00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:07.330
he'll have already run three during that time.

20
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.340
So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Doctor Jonathan

21
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.180
Rottenberg,
answering the question of,
is crying actually good for us?

22
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.660
Oh,
welcome John.
Thanks for speaking with us today.

23
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.500
<v 1>Thank you for having me.</v>

24
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.870
<v 0>What I'd love to hear from you as we get our conversation going today is a</v>

25
00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:28.350
little bit about your journey into emotions.

26
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:33.310
So what first got you started and that hooked on studying emotion?

27
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.080
<v 1>Well,</v>

28
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.080
I went to a graduates at Stanford and I was arriving there in the late nineties.

29
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.600
And emotion was actually very hot

30
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.123
topic,

31
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.640
new theories or new journals like the journal emotion coming out.

32
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.090
And I had the good fortune of working with uh,

33
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.520
James Gross to an expert on emotional regulation.

34
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.920
And what really excited me was the possibility of combining all of these

35
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.870
methods,
logical methods.

36
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.450
We're starting motion new methods for studying emotional behavior,

37
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.230
uh,
combining these methods with local research.
Um,

38
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.380
Ian garlic was also a Stanford than the late nineties when I was there.

39
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.740
And I thought this was an incredible opportunity because here we have used

40
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.120
remarkable pools that were increasingly understood as eventually break rooms

41
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.070
burned setting in motion.
Uh,
and then we also have a clinical disorder,

42
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.170
a major depressive disorder,
which is very much defined by changes in mood,

43
00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:52.030
in motion.
Um,
only only problem was there wasn't very much research.

44
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.660
And so I saw this,
uh,
using tools.

45
00:02:55.661 --> 00:02:59.890
It's a way to understand in some ways what was the most important of what I

46
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:03.520
would argue is the most important disorder,
um,

47
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.540
in terms of burden,
in terms of

48
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.760
recurrence and just rob prep prevalence.
So,
um,

49
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.340
I got hooked at that moment and I've stayed ever since.

50
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.860
<v 0>And I mean,
since you got hooked,
I mean,</v>

51
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:21.460
you've just conducted some of the most profound discoveries into really

52
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:22.960
understanding,
you know,

53
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:26.530
what is going on in individuals who are suffering from depression.

54
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:30.160
What are the emotional eyes that these individuals and also about the phenomena,

55
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.580
you know,
that may be particularly prevalent in individuals who are depressed.

56
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:36.520
But it's actually something really common to all of us,
which is crying.

57
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.550
And so I'd love to start out asking you some questions about your research.
Um,

58
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.100
first,
first with the topic of crying so we can all,
you know,

59
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:48.550
readily recall times in our own lives.
And we were crying.

60
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.320
And many of us seem to have these beliefs that when we've cried in some way,

61
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:55.510
this has been beneficial for us in some way,

62
00:03:55.511 --> 00:04:00.100
it's been cathartic or helpful to kind of cleanse us of our negative emotional

63
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:03.160
experiences.
Um,
but your work is really,

64
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:08.161
really exciting here in that it suggests that actually that belief may not

65
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:12.820
always be true and that crying is not necessarily and always adaptive for us.

66
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.960
So I was wondering if you could share some of your own scientific observations

67
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.000
and findings that sort of now provide a roadmap for helping us understand when

68
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:26.740
crying is and is not necessarily beneficial or adaptive.

69
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.700
<v 1>Sure.</v>

70
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.700
New growing is one of the most dramatic emotional behaviors from when we first

71
00:04:34.671 --> 00:04:37.640
started out as a little bit maybe to the end of life.

72
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.090
And it spreads through that whole life force in one thing that is particularly

73
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.730
salient about crime is that,
uh,

74
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.260
has a distinctive socially,
uh,
salient,

75
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.480
a signal name.
We fears.

76
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.050
And so we certainly noticed when we cry,

77
00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.500
other people certainly notice when we cry.

78
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:04.430
And so many people have strong opinions about what happens when bad cry or when

79
00:05:04.431 --> 00:05:09.020
other people cry.
And like you said,
there is a very strong leg week.

80
00:05:09.021 --> 00:05:13.190
They crying is started.
And so that is reflected on surveys.

81
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.630
People
equal important,
yes.

82
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.050
And not just being a contrarion but we're really wanting to understand what

83
00:05:23.661 --> 00:05:27.050
extent crime is and is not Cathartic.
Um,

84
00:05:27.051 --> 00:05:29.770
we talk a little bit deeper and so we used the,

85
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.320
have you used a number of different designs from experimental designs?

86
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.980
You survey with designs,
the daily diary designs too.

87
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.050
I try to look at a one and were crying,
might be having a benefits,

88
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.300
might be Cathartic.

89
00:05:44.301 --> 00:05:48.750
And what we've discovered over the years since that not all tying episodes of

90
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.510
liquidity.
I,
so what I mean by that is that a number of things determine,

91
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.790
uh,
whether or not crying it's going to be associated with,

92
00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.750
that's a one years,
um,

93
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.450
we context in which firing occurs.
Um,

94
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.210
and some of these findings maybe aren't so surprising.
Um,

95
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.380
but we just at the end would really want to qualify the idea that when you cry

96
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.080
and feel better,
as it turns out,

97
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:16.820
that when you look at crying in the moment or frying and the daily diary design,

98
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.850
it's really a minority of the crying episode that are associated with improving.

99
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.310
So ones that are are ones in which situation really changes as a function of the

100
00:06:27.451 --> 00:06:29.030
fine.
So social factors.

101
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.540
So do people actually come to the side of the person's crying and crying has its

102
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:36.080
power to draw another.

103
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.470
So those episodes that are drying and others tend to be associated with frying

104
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.140
upsets in which the situation changes,
uh,
um,

105
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.750
seem to be associated with mood benefits.
Um,
and finally the,

106
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.380
the aspect of stayed in the crier seems to really make a difference.

107
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.510
And this is a one connection to depression,
depressed people.

108
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:03.830
It turns out,
and people who are very anxious and not report,

109
00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:08.170
they brine benefits their mood that tremendously.
So,
um,

110
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.110
yes,
crying if anything is associated with mood benefits,

111
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.140
not our frying episodes are upgraded before.

112
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:18.590
And it seemed that both social,
Eric Rustic Sam,

113
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.910
the characteristics of the fryer make a big difference in shaping whether or not

114
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.240
that frying it's sure any bathroom at all.

115
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.250
<v 0>Well,
it's so interesting because you alluded to depression and you know,</v>

116
00:07:30.251 --> 00:07:32.050
when we start our interview I said,
you know,

117
00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:36.130
depression for many people is this sort of,
you know,
quintessential example of,

118
00:07:36.131 --> 00:07:37.990
you know,
profound crying,
right?

119
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.800
And so many people think of crying and depression as synonymous,

120
00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:46.801
but your experiments really challenged some of these big assumptions about how

121
00:07:46.991 --> 00:07:50.230
depression actually alters crying.
Um,

122
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.360
and so I wonder if you could say a little bit about,

123
00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:57.361
in what ways does crying behavior provide a window into understanding what might

124
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.040
actually be disturbed in depression?

125
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.600
<v 1>Sure.
Yeah.
Um,
and this is sort of as a story,
uh,
um,</v>

126
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.420
beings prize you guys.
When I started out,

127
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.690
I thought that our research would confirm,
um,

128
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.960
what's in the Dsm,
the diagnostic manual,
uh,

129
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.910
it's used by clinicians everywhere in the surface,
uh,

130
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.910
defines part of depression as increased brine behavior.
And so I thought,

131
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.250
um,
what,

132
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:32.030
what are we learning is in what ways this Prac at this depression magnify the

133
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:33.020
time response.

134
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.310
And if we wanted to use again these nuclear emotion,

135
00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:40.910
so multimap that a research study,
emotional experience,

136
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:44.960
emotional behavior in emotion related physiology,

137
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.420
bringing depress people into a lab parent,
they're crying.

138
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.450
So does non depressed people.

139
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:56.170
And the data didn't really cooperate as what we found was that contrary to DSM

140
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.900
brass,
people were no more likely to cry.
The sad student lesson,

141
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.450
perhaps Renner's thing we changed is associated with that crying.

142
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.260
We're actually diminished in depressed people said their physiological response

143
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:11.850
then frying like that sweat gland activity.
We're actually the last,
yeah,

144
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.840
those are the non-depressed people.
And then we'd start to look at other,
uh,

145
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.990
I kind of gained this assistant then what we saw near Dari or original analysis

146
00:09:23.881 --> 00:09:28.140
that they've have wherever we look fresh and seem to shrink rather than magnify

147
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.280
the effects of crime.

148
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.320
And so this really made me think about what,
what,

149
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.030
what's in the DSM needs observations that permission to have a years.

150
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.540
And I got that they're simply wrong.
It's not that they're wrong,

151
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:45.700
it's that they're making those observations in particular context.

152
00:09:45.701 --> 00:09:48.320
So someone comes in,
they're depressed,

153
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.070
we're being evaluated and gas,
you see crying behavior.

154
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.440
But I think what we weren't in the experimental work when you present normative,

155
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.980
so we kind of stimuli that mixed the average person crimes.

156
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.290
Like I'm the champ or this is dreadful.
At that scene,

157
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.480
little boy is ripped apart by this incredible loss.

158
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.130
Those kind of more and more cry lessons.

159
00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:18.450
Private listening situations don't eat a lot or the people.

160
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:23.190
Uh,
and so what it makes me think is that the things that are listed in brass,

161
00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:27.540
people's buying or like we'd be different then what are things that are

162
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:31.110
listening?
I,
everyone else is crying.
And so this notion,

163
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:35.340
again of the context really making a big difference.
I'm thinking,
well,

164
00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:40.080
so depressed people reporting to furnish and that they're having a lot of crime

165
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.920
in any crime by themselves and we need prying into their pillow.

166
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:49.130
They may be crying because God or some person isn't helping them.

167
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:55.680
It's not that there are particular sad things in their environment that are

168
00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:56.670
prompting Brian.

169
00:10:56.671 --> 00:11:00.930
We don't even need necessarily a provocation.

170
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.750
So that gives us sort of a different understanding of what,

171
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.000
what the statements and the Bsi might mean and what the change is in motion.
Um,

172
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.150
if depressed people experience and it might reflect,

173
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.910
<v 0>I mean,
in what you're alluding to is another theme in your work,</v>

174
00:11:15.911 --> 00:11:20.410
which really suggests that the emotional nature and lives of individuals with

175
00:11:20.411 --> 00:11:24.100
depression are quite different from those who aren't currently depressed or

176
00:11:24.101 --> 00:11:26.320
maybe don't have a history of being depressed.

177
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:31.120
And I think you found that the emotions that these individuals experience with

178
00:11:31.121 --> 00:11:35.140
suppression don't quite fit their current environmental context,

179
00:11:35.141 --> 00:11:38.830
which you have referred to as this emotion contexts and sensitivity.

180
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.120
And I wonder what you see as some of the most promising discoveries from this

181
00:11:43.121 --> 00:11:44.920
model you developed,
um,

182
00:11:44.921 --> 00:11:49.000
that might help us better understand the nature of emotion in depression.

183
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.470
<v 1>Sure.
Um,</v>

184
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:57.040
so I've been talking about this emotion context sensitivity since like 2005 and

185
00:11:59.921 --> 00:12:01.300
since that time,
you know,

186
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:06.300
there had been another other researchers who wrote replicated this finding,

187
00:12:06.301 --> 00:12:11.301
which was essentially that depressed people don't report and display the

188
00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:14.170
normative changes that you would expect to see,

189
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:19.410
whether it's positive emotions or situations or negative emotion or emotions or

190
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:25.030
situations that depressed people are getting this flattened profile of response

191
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:28.300
or the stereotypic.
Um,
so I think that's,

192
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.360
at this point we can say that that real,

193
00:12:31.361 --> 00:12:36.100
that we found it and not get enough studies and consistently lacrosse labs.

194
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.360
And so we're really looking at a new set of next questions,

195
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:45.130
which is whether this really about what does this reflect for the proximal

196
00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:49.810
mechanism,
whether they're at cognitive mechanisms out of the thought,

197
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.990
whether they're behavioral mechanisms,
whether their physiological,

198
00:12:52.991 --> 00:12:54.220
now I can use that,

199
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:59.290
explained this pad and that generated this pattern in a second.
Um,

200
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:05.100
he set of questions.
I think that also speaks to the meaning,
uh,

201
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:09.520
of this pattern is what is its relationship to the clinical symptoms that you'd

202
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:13.610
see in depression.
So depression with an episodic disorder,
uh,

203
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.680
so it could be diagnosable.
You have at least five of nine symptoms.

204
00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.810
Unethical people typically will be an episode for some months at a time,

205
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.680
like better and we'll have welfare.

206
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.350
It's so we see this pattern of UCI,
uh,

207
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.080
during depressive episodes and have people have looked,
um,

208
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.630
I've not seen very often that it,

209
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.200
that it's there after the depressive episodes and people who are burning very

210
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:42.150
well.
Now we're studying children.
Uh,
and one of our,
um,

211
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.880
one of our aims is to understand whether the CCI pattern might be an antecedent,

212
00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.780
um,
the depression.

213
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.670
Essentially what we're trying to understand or unpack is whether these and

214
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:58.930
emotion might have some causal relationship,
um,
to,

215
00:13:58.931 --> 00:14:00.910
to the clinical syndrome of depression.

216
00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.880
It's possible that they're actually not important.
Um,

217
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.500
it didn't causation of episodes of depression,

218
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:12.100
but they might be more important in the maintenance,
uh,
of depression.

219
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.840
That is how long depression last.
So we found that,
um,

220
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.130
the extent to which a person shows the CCF pattern seems to predict the duration

221
00:14:21.131 --> 00:14:22.570
of the episode.

222
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.900
So this suggests that even if it's not a causal in explaining why person becomes

223
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.670
depressed in the first place.

224
00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:35.260
So it might be quite important in terms of how quickly the depression gets

225
00:14:35.261 --> 00:14:38.020
dissolved.
And so I think there are,
um,

226
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.100
some potential implications for both understanding treatments,

227
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.440
how existing treatments we're defining those treatments and incorporating motion

228
00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:52.441
into our conceptualization of treating I think is another huge area of

229
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.163
opportunity.

230
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.690
<v 0>Yeah.
That was when you were talking,</v>

231
00:14:56.691 --> 00:15:00.590
I mean it makes you wonder how much you can translate these really promising

232
00:15:00.591 --> 00:15:05.591
findings into aiding issues such as you alluded to treatment or differential

233
00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:09.260
diagnosis or identifying people who would benefit from,
you know,

234
00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:11.990
different types of emotion related interventions.

235
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.131
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

236
00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:17.000
I think there's a lot of opportunity where we neuro some work by people like

237
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.200
Andy,
the marking okay.
I think is very important.

238
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:26.090
First steps and speed and understand our existing treatments,

239
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:30.230
treatments that are reasonably reasonably robust and successful.

240
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.300
Most treatments change in motion.

241
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.390
And so simply a pre and post designs where we have people,

242
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.440
um,

243
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:43.230
acid on different aspects of their emotional functioning in episode buyer.
Yeah.

244
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:48.570
Initiation treatment down the same people fasted when the treatment was

245
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.310
successful.
I though it would be quite interesting compare uh,

246
00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:57.330
emotion and between those two a arts success 40 and not successfully treated.

247
00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:58.270
Um,

248
00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:03.270
because right now I think we mostly have assumptions about how treatments for

249
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:05.530
depression,
depression,
change,

250
00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:09.970
immersion experience behavior and rushing belt for writing physiology and in

251
00:16:09.971 --> 00:16:14.470
different contexts.
But we don't have as much data as you might.

252
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.000
Um,
if you might think.

253
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.600
And part of it is because people who do death broke crowds and people would be

254
00:16:19.601 --> 00:16:24.400
based in research are often different people and they're very protective of the

255
00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:28.270
patients who are in the drug bouts in assassins of motion.

256
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:30.710
We started seeing this mocking around,
um,

257
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.910
well from my pig and development perspective,
we need basic science.

258
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:40.570
I think it's absolutely essential to understand just the script up room and

259
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:45.540
that's just not even getting the question.
And you're talking guidance using,
uh,

260
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:50.550
using some emotion data as a predictor of what kind of greeting the Persian

261
00:16:50.831 --> 00:16:54.520
chick yet.
But it should this person I get CBT,

262
00:16:54.521 --> 00:16:58.720
cognitive behavioral therapy or should they get any depressants?
So what,

263
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.800
what specific brand of anti depressant or specific s well,

264
00:17:03.801 --> 00:17:05.720
within five minutes behavioral therapy,

265
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.890
I think ultimately that would be tremendously exciting and important as well.

266
00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:15.610
What we have right now,
it's a big problem of not knowing are what the,

267
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.040
what the patients most likely to respond to them.

268
00:17:18.041 --> 00:17:21.800
You have the fresh and the good news number of Pittman,
uh,

269
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:26.820
efficacious treatments now,
but none of them are back there for everyone.

270
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.400
I'll have fairly high nonresponse or incomplete complete response rates.

271
00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:37.520
And so anything we can do to increase the efficiency of equation Nancy used to

272
00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:42.521
me that emotion data will be very high on the list of data that you could,

273
00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:45.211
<v 0>I mean,</v>

274
00:17:45.211 --> 00:17:48.600
so you've touched on some really important themes about where we need to go
next,

275
00:17:48.601 --> 00:17:48.901
right?

276
00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:53.901
In of really delineating and mapping out this research to aid and facilitate

277
00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:58.650
diagnosis and treatment.
Um,
when you think broadly about the field of emotion,

278
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:02.790
I know we've talked about crying and depression and emotion and treatment today,

279
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.690
where do you see the field of emotion more generally headed as it sort of moves

280
00:18:06.691 --> 00:18:07.740
into the future?

281
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.000
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

282
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.950
<v 1>Wow.
I mean,
I think my work is part of the first wave,</v>

283
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.290
uh,
integrating,
um,

284
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:21.750
basic for research and science,
um,
with clinical signs.

285
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.650
And I think there are very much needs to be a second one.

286
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.580
So part of the first wave was saying we're here,
we can do this.
Um,

287
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:34.850
but developing more mature and robust and sustainable.

288
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.510
So for example,
with my own research with DCI,
okay,

289
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:44.000
we've definitely shown that there is a pattern and that it's,

290
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.870
it's good to show with a robust not beds,

291
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.470
um,
with multiple mastheads that there was a certain pattern.

292
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:57.280
Now we need to go back and go to the next,
the next step.

293
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:02.190
And I've mentioned a few of the,
I think there'll be involved,
but I think,

294
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:07.250
or this could be true for every different classes where it's at as novelists

295
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:12.150
research going on the notion it's raining.
And I think that,
you know,

296
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:16.620
is sort of in some ways the model or where the field needs to go.

297
00:19:16.621 --> 00:19:18.720
Understanding for example,
uh,

298
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.750
individual symptoms and it's feeding like Anhedonia or neglect.

299
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.980
I understand.
When does that happen?
What does that reflect,
you know,
the late,

300
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:33.220
um,
clinical improvement in speed?

301
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.580
So I really,
I think that

302
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.610
it's a matter of continuing to do what we've been doing.

303
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:46.110
I don't think that we need,
I think we're on a good,
uh,
on a good road.
Um,

304
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.320
but I'm not losing focus or energy.
Um,

305
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.750
and so I'll do my best.

306
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.930
You might smell fart and move it's order with them setting.

307
00:19:54.931 --> 00:19:59.190
But I think that there's many opportunities in parallel.

308
00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.210
Um,
I should say also,
um,

309
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:08.170
belatedly that what can happen is you do more explicit in Paris.

310
00:20:08.171 --> 00:20:12.510
And so now we have the descriptions of what's happening in individual disorders,

311
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.880
explicit comparison between disorders.
Um,

312
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.410
I think we have much more to go on the,
for example,

313
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:24.030
airing what's adding to we see in depression with,
uh,
those of anxiety,

314
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:29.040
whether it's your neighbor conditions that are I lake or morbid suffer with

315
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:34.020
depression and understand what's similar,
what's different,
um,
w in terms of what,

316
00:20:34.021 --> 00:20:36.360
how emotion changes and needs to that conditions.

317
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.350
<v 0>So then when you speak to students who are just thinking now about embarking in</v>

318
00:20:41.351 --> 00:20:44.650
this field of emotion,
what kind of advice would you give them?

319
00:20:44.651 --> 00:20:45.820
Or have you given them

320
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.490
<v 1>trust your instincts?
I mean,
I,</v>

321
00:20:49.491 --> 00:20:54.450
I would give them concrete advice boards so there would be to trust their
intent.

322
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.860
I don't think I would have that any success at all if I didn't listen to me

323
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.780
instance initially back crying.

324
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.810
So it's something I read in the BSM and I was like,

325
00:21:04.811 --> 00:21:07.330
well what does that really reflect?
What does it really mean?
What's,
what,

326
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.140
what would that based on?
And I learned it wasn't really based on our research.

327
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:15.220
So I thought,
let's do a research study.
And one thing led to another.

328
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:20.030
And so student has an insight like that.
Even if it's not fully baked,

329
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.610
um,
they should backed on that.
And,
and,
uh,

330
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.900
the contradictory thing is that at the same time,
I think you have to,
um,

331
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:33.190
be able to integrate feedback,
the mentors.
So,

332
00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:34.450
but both things can be true.

333
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.160
So you can very much think that you have a good idea.
Um,

334
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.790
but what the,
what is the job?
And you can stick to your guns.
But what it,

335
00:21:42.791 --> 00:21:47.590
what it meant work and help you do is shape that idea and help you see,

336
00:21:47.591 --> 00:21:51.500
well,
what can I really learn?
Or what are the limitations or,
um,

337
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.350
because I think that science has always this juggling a unit or emotion of

338
00:21:56.351 --> 00:22:00.070
different than other areas of science between being not novel.

339
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.620
So having ideas did the field who's going to need to listen,

340
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.920
to assimilate with,
uh,
uh,

341
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.950
founder dating to what's already known.

342
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:14.110
And so a good student is going to both be wanting to push the envelope and

343
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.460
simple what we already know,

344
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:20.150
but also finding ways to accommodate what they're finding,
um,

345
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.130
with,
with what we already know.
And it never ends.

346
00:22:24.131 --> 00:22:29.131
So it after your get your phd and you're on your postdoc or in your first

347
00:22:31.351 --> 00:22:34.720
faculty position,
or if you've got,
then you're a full professor.

348
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.610
You're just thinking professional,
doesn't matter.

349
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:41.500
This will just predicting predicament will always be true where you have to

350
00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:46.010
develop new ideas but also understand the context.

351
00:22:46.011 --> 00:22:50.050
And most of those ideas are happening.
So graduate school,
just the first,

352
00:22:50.051 --> 00:22:54.190
first in some way,
most demonic place in which that,
uh,

353
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.080
that process unfolds.

354
00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.100
And some of it is that many students feel like they don't know anything.
Um,

355
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.170
but the truth is that,
you know,

356
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.640
even now the fields of emotions a little bit more mature and there's still vast

357
00:23:06.641 --> 00:23:11.330
area,
it's where we really don't know much,
much,
much more than not knowing one.

358
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:15.280
And so they should feel very confident that they can make a contribution.

359
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.550
<v 0>Well,
thank you so much for speaking with us today,
John.
It was wonderful.</v>

360
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.930
<v 1>I was by flasher with breastfeeding.</v>

361
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.030
<v 0>Always good talking to you.</v>

362
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.890
So this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Doctor Jonathan

363
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.620
Rottenberg from the University of South Florida.
Thank you again.
