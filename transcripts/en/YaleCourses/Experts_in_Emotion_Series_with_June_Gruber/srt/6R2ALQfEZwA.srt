1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,540
Today for our experts
and emotion interview.

2
00:00:02,541 --> 00:00:06,680
We have the pleasure of speaking with
Dr Maya to Mirror on the dark side of

3
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:07,790
positive emotion.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,050
Dr Tamir is an assistant professor and
the director of the emotion and self

5
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:15,170
regulation laboratory at the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,860
She completed her undergraduate
degree at Tel Aviv University,

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,210
received her phd from the University
of Illinois at Urbana Champagne and

8
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:26,120
completed her post doctoral
training at Stanford University.

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,980
Dr Tamir is most interested
in understanding what
motivates people to regulate

10
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:35,720
their emotions and in her quest she
studies the implications of both pleasant

11
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:39,920
and unpleasant emotional experiences
and people's beliefs, thoughts,

12
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:41,750
and feelings about emotions.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,310
So I'll now turn to a very special
emotion and expert interview with my

14
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:50,060
colleague, Dr Maya Tamir on the
dark side of positive emotion.

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,260
So welcome Maya.
Thanks for speaking with us today.

16
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,900
Thanks for having me.
That's very nice of you.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,980
Oh,
well you're the nice one here.

18
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,310
So I just wanted to start by asking you
a little bit about your journey into the

19
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:07,700
world of emotions.

20
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:12,701
Sort of what first got you started or
excited to think about getting into this

21
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:14,120
topic in the first place?

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,410
Life
life is imbued with emotions.

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,810
Emotions are probably the most
wonderful thing in lights.

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,990
They can be the most
terrible thing in life.

25
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,280
I think we're all students of
emotion or in many, many ways.

26
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,840
And um,

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,390
I guess I just decided to study
emotions as a scientist as well,

28
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,820
was all very natural.

29
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,840
That's wonderful. And you're
right. Life is imbued with emotion.

30
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:50,840
So how could it not attract your
attention to want to understand it? Right.

31
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,610
I mean, I really think we're all, we
all study emotions all the time, right?

32
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:59,090
It's just that some of us do it in
a laboratory in, some of us don't.

33
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,190
That's a really good point.
I love it.

34
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,200
So since you've decided to embark into
studying emotions in the laboratory,

35
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,800
you've done a lot of
a really amazing work.

36
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:13,620
And I want to ask you just a
little bit about it today. Um,

37
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,570
so one of the things I wanted to
ask you about is your work that has,

38
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,320
um, you know, scientifically
demonstrated that positive emotions,

39
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,650
contrary to what most of us might think
are not always adaptive and can actually

40
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:32,670
be disadvantageous in
specific circumstances such
as your work suggests may be

41
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,650
engaging in competitive tasks.

42
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,120
And so I wonder if you could say a little
bit about how positive emotions seem

43
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:42,000
to be less adaptive in
this kind of context?

44
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,190
Well, according to some theories, um,

45
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,810
specific emotions have evolved to help us
cope with specific types of challenges.

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,700
And so,
um,

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,120
if you think about the types of
challenges that we've confronted in our

48
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,290
evolutionary past, um, one
of them was to avoid threats.

49
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,780
And so you could argue that maybe fear
has evolved as a way to help us avoid

50
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:08,500
threats.

51
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,970
And another type of challenge was to
fight with enemies over resources.

52
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:17,650
And so anger has evolved to help
us effectively fight enemies.

53
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,040
And another type of challenge is actually
to form collaborations with people who

54
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:25,300
want to,
who want to work with us.

55
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,560
And so one of the things that happened
this may do is help us get close to

56
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:32,380
others and work with others. So, um,

57
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,580
if you think about emotions
very broadly in that sense, um,

58
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,670
emotions can be good in some contexts
and not very good. And others,

59
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,230
and it's funny because when we talk
about emotions, we use these terms,

60
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,310
we use the terms positive emotion
and use the term negative emotions.

61
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,270
And when that's implied by that is that
some emotions are good and some emotions

62
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:54,910
are bad,
but that's not necessarily true.

63
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,600
It's not necessarily true for any
emotion and it's not necessarily true for

64
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:01,990
positive emotion. Um, we've learned in,

65
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,790
in my lab and in many
other labs that study, um,

66
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:10,050
cooperation and competition that when
you need to collaborate with somebody

67
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:10,931
else,

68
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:14,950
being happy is actually
very useful because it helps
you connect with others and

69
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:15,880
trust others.

70
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,250
But when you need to fight in happy
is actually not particularly adaptive

71
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,300
because it makes you trust people that
you shouldn't trust. So in some contexts,

72
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,450
happiness can be very useful
and others not so much.

73
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,990
Interesting.
So if you think of,

74
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:34,410
it sounds like the take home lesson of
what we can learn about positive emotion

75
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:39,270
is that it really depends on the context
as to whether or not it can be useful

76
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:43,710
for us or less useful. Is
that right? Right. Excellent.

77
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,920
Um,
and I mean on this fan,

78
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,700
I know you and I have worked on a paper
with one of our lovely colleagues,

79
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:54,701
I'm doctor Iris Mouse and really trying
to delineate the different ways that

80
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:57,630
positive emotion can be disadvantageous,

81
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,790
which people have coined the dark side
of happiness. And I wonder, you know,

82
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,120
from this work that we've done together
what you think of as, you know,

83
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:08,760
the guiding principles that dictate,
you know,

84
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:13,650
both when and how positive emotion might
not always be to our best advantage.

85
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,790
Well, the key for me
when I think about, um,

86
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,920
about emotions and adaptation is that
really we fool ourselves into thinking

87
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:27,910
that some emotions are necessarily
positive or good into emotions are

88
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,830
necessarily negative or or that,

89
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,870
and so when you think about
positive emotions, um,

90
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,810
they, they are often very good,
but they can also be bad at times.

91
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,530
They can have a dark
side. Um, for example,

92
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:49,120
we know that some positive emotions
are, um, better than others.

93
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,291
For example,

94
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:54,250
humoristic pride is a wonderful example
when you think that you're the best

95
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:57,800
person around,
well that could feel wonderful,

96
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,540
but it can have negative consequences
for your social relationships. Um,

97
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,650
there could be emotions
that are, um, uh, pleasant,

98
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,220
but, um, they're not, um,

99
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,560
desirable according to your culture.
For example, we know that pride in,

100
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,950
um, cultures such as the
u s are wonderful to feel,

101
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,180
but in cultures such as China,
uh, they're not as desirable.

102
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,330
And so there might be types of positive
emotions that are better than others.

103
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,170
But even if we put aside all those
positive emotions that we think are not as

104
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:34,200
good,
um,

105
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,930
even the best positive emotion could
be wonderful in some context and not in

106
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,810
others. Like, um, um, well
we talked about before,

107
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,610
even if you feel love or joy in a way,

108
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:50,420
it might be detrimental if you experienced
in a contest of calls for a very

109
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:53,160
different type of emotion.
Right? As we mentioned before,

110
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,000
we talked about collaboration.
We said that if you're,

111
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,690
if you're entering a field of enemies,
um,

112
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,120
maybe being cheerful is not
the best thing at that moment.

113
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,470
Maybe you need to be a little cautious,
a little frightened maybe, right?

114
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:09,950
Maybe you need to be angry in order
to just like where your rights in that

115
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:10,950
context.
Um,

116
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,560
so you want to experience the
right type of positive emotion.

117
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,860
You want to feel the right time of
positive emotion in the right context.

118
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,220
And like anything else in life,

119
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:24,800
you want to experience
positive emotion in moderation.

120
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,900
If you experience positive emotions
into an extreme, um, that can,

121
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,060
that can be very, um, that
can be very harmful. Um,

122
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,150
we know that there's lovely work on um,
uh,

123
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,990
intensity and frequency of positive
emotions showing that if you,

124
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,430
um, experienced, very intense, um,

125
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,300
very frequent positive emotions,

126
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,570
you may be actually a little bit
less satisfied with your life.

127
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,190
Then if you experience just a little
bit less African positive emotions,

128
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,220
if you experienced very, very
intense positive emotions, uh,

129
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,630
it may have some negative consequences.
For example,

130
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:05,150
it may make it very rigid.

131
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,710
It made me keep focus on yourself
and ignore others. It May,

132
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,550
I'll make you prone to take risks,
even unnecessary risks.

133
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,170
And you do,

134
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,300
you've done lovely work linking intense
positive emotions to I'm psychopathology

135
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,970
showing for example, that um,
intense positive aspect is,

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,930
is characteristic of manic individuals.
And so everything in moderation,

137
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:32,320
I think that I think that's
the right thing to do. So,

138
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,430
so if you asked me know
what my recommendation
would be for people who have

139
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:40,370
tried to pursue happiness
or positive emotions,

140
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,740
the right type of positive emotions in
the right context and in the right amount.

141
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,421
Beautiful.

142
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:51,290
And it sounds like at the end of the
day we all come back to Aristotle's,

143
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:55,160
you know, ancient wisdom about
all these three principles.

144
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,630
So thank you so much to my, uh, um, what
I wanted to ask you about was just the,

145
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,060
I mean you have so many
different lines of exciting work,

146
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:07,020
so it's hard to pinpoint what are the
questions just to speak with you about

147
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,590
today. But one of the things that
I wanted to make sure to what

148
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,203
you're very nice,

149
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,360
well you're very nice but not
too nice and not too friendly,

150
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,910
not always,

151
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,250
not always in every context.
Um,

152
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,080
but you've done some really interesting
work on instrumental emotion regulation,

153
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,441
you know,

154
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:33,100
demonstrating that people might not
always want to feel good actually and that

155
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:37,110
sometimes they may actually want to
experience pleasant emotions whereas other

156
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:40,950
times they may not want to experience
pleasant emotions and may actually want to

157
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:43,080
experience unpleasant emotions.

158
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,350
So I wondered if you could flesh
out this interesting and perhaps

159
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:49,620
counterintuitive, finding too many
people out there in the audience.

160
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,340
I like the word the word positive and
negative in good and bad cause I think

161
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:57,290
they have many different implications.

162
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:03,290
The question that I've been interested
in for a while now is what do people want

163
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:03,950
to feel?

164
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,330
Because if we think about emotion
regulation and we think about times in our

165
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:10,490
lives when we want to change how we feel,

166
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,780
I think that immediately we think about
those times when we try to be less

167
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,570
nervous or less angry,
are happier.

168
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,160
And we rushed to ask me, well,
what, what's the strategy? Right?

169
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:27,140
What would be the way for me to get
rid of one emotional state and embrace

170
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:28,790
another?
Um,

171
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:34,310
but if we want to understand how and
why people regulate their emotions,

172
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:37,130
we first need to understand what it
is that they want to feel in different

173
00:10:37,131 --> 00:10:39,310
contexts. And, um,

174
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,920
I do think actually that
people want to feel good.

175
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,380
It's just that I think that there's
several different definitions of what,

176
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,490
you know,
one obvious definition,

177
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:53,270
especially if you think about
emotions involves pleasure.

178
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,490
What do we think about positive emotions?

179
00:10:55,491 --> 00:10:59,030
And when we think about feeling
good or feeling good emotions,

180
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,980
and we typically think about emotions
that are pleasant to feel. But if you,

181
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,530
um, walk on the, um,

182
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,670
on campus at Yale and we grab an
innocent student and ask them,

183
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,320
define good to me, you're telling
me what's good. I Dunno if,

184
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,950
if the only answer you get is pleasure,
right? Because when we think about good,

185
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,200
we think about a variety of things.

186
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:26,201
We think about things that are helpful
or things that are useful or things that

187
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:31,100
are meaningful. And that's also
part of good. And so what, um,

188
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,610
when I think about emotion
regulation and the,

189
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:35,300
and the emotions that people want to feel,

190
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:37,850
I think people want to feel
emotions that are pleasant,

191
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,590
but they also want to feel emotions
that would bring about that those things

192
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:45,280
that are good for them. They want to
feel emotions that are useful. Uh,

193
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,060
they want a few emotions that are helpful.

194
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,600
They want to feel emotions
that are meaningful and
these different emotions are

195
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:55,390
not necessarily pleasant to feel
they can be, but not necessarily.

196
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:59,140
So, um, I think that the people,

197
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,240
people seek happiness,
um,

198
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,920
but they seek those things that make
them happy rather than happiness per se.

199
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,600
And we can think about emotions as
a toolbox, right? That as, as, as,

200
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,010
as a box of tools that help us attain
those goals that are important to us.

201
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,050
And we've done some research showing
that when people have a specific goal,

202
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,030
like when they want to achieve something,
um,

203
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,090
they want to do well on a
test or they want to, um,

204
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,020
um, get the most in a negotiation
or they want to do well.

205
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:38,520
On a computer game, they
can pick different types
of emotions that will help,

206
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,380
that will help them optimize or
maximize those outcomes that they,

207
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:46,140
that they want. Um, and these
emotions can be good or pleasant.

208
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,360
These emotions can be unpleasant,

209
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,060
but they're good in the sense that
they're helpful when we spoke to them.

210
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,190
That's so interesting.
I mean,

211
00:12:53,191 --> 00:12:55,790
it makes me wonder kind of
what are the implications.

212
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,750
This research has really teasing apart,

213
00:12:57,751 --> 00:13:01,680
pleasant and unpleasant from good and bad,
which is so important.

214
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:04,650
And I feel like it's so
rarely done in the literature,

215
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,970
which is why what you do is just
so, so crucial here. You know,

216
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:11,880
what implications do you
think this has for, you know,

217
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:15,630
the kind of emotional goals people set
for themselves and ultimately their

218
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:17,220
wellbeing at the end of the day?

219
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,090
Well, the one distinction we
need to, we need to make is,

220
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,440
is to what extent do I only
care about how I feel right now?

221
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,780
And that's a very valid and important
goal versus to what extent do I care about

222
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,710
longterm outcomes? When you care
about how you feel right now,

223
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,430
what you want to do is you want to change
what you feel right now to something

224
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:42,740
that, that, that you,
that you want, right?

225
00:13:42,741 --> 00:13:45,020
Then typically you want
to feel good in the mud.

226
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:46,670
We want to feel pleasure in the moment.

227
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,270
We want to get rid of things that are
unpleasant but as soon as we look at our

228
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:51,920
lives kind of in a,

229
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:56,810
in as a longer process and
we do that all the time,

230
00:13:56,811 --> 00:14:00,710
right? We do that by going to school
and spending a lot of time studying,

231
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,981
you know,

232
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:05,060
late at night even if you don't like it
because we care about those longer term

233
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:05,894
goals,
right?

234
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,990
We do that when we fight with a partner
or go to an opera or to a ball game even

235
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:14,550
though we don't want to because we
care about a relationship that's,

236
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,800
that's long term and I think that um,
emotions are very,

237
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,970
are very similar to that.

238
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,020
If all we think about is just the current
moment and all they think about is

239
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:28,940
feeling good right now, we may end up
hurting ourselves in the long term.

240
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:33,110
But if we think about life in the longer
term and we make sure that we use our

241
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:37,210
emotions in ways that are
helpful for our longterm goal,

242
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,500
um, then I think we can maximize
a longterm happiness. Um,

243
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,653
so

244
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,970
that's lovely. So when you think then
about where the sort of face of, uh,

245
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,970
emotion in the future,
kind of where it's, um,

246
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,330
based on some of the research you've
done and sort of what got you hooked into

247
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:58,910
this field in the first place,
where do you see,

248
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:04,150
where do you see the next important
steps for the future of emotion in your

249
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:05,060
humble opinion?

250
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,650
Um, well, um,

251
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,200
you know,

252
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,200
I think that the field of emotion as a
whole has made some incredible strides in

253
00:15:21,811 --> 00:15:25,980
the past 10 years or so. And, um,

254
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,990
and I wouldn't be surprised if,
you know, in the next 10 years, um,

255
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,730
research is going to come out.

256
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:37,731
That's going to change the way that
we understand what emotions are,

257
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,000
how they work, um, what
the, what the, what,

258
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,320
what mental processes are,
um, how things work together,

259
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,920
what's the difference between different
mental processes? And I think that,

260
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,350
you know,
it's very similar to kind of how we,

261
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,430
how we begin our conversation by saying
that we use words and we think that

262
00:15:56,431 --> 00:15:58,710
these words reflect reality,
right?

263
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,760
We use the word positive emotion and
negative emotion and that helps us make,

264
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,660
you know, very, very
clear sense of reality.

265
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:11,460
But I think that no reality is
very, it was very complex and, um,

266
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,370
and I think that it's particular,
particularly true about emotion. So I,

267
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,680
I think we're gonna,
we're gonna discover some amazing,

268
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,060
truly kind of groundbreaking,
um,

269
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,120
shattering discoveries about,
about what emotions are. Um,

270
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,700
I think we're going to discover
some amazing things about pleasure.

271
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,180
I think we're going to discover some
amazing things about what a pleasure,

272
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:40,610
pleasure and emotions
work together. Um, um,

273
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,030
what the role of pleasure is, how
it's formed, what it does. So I, I,

274
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,230
I look forward to it, but I,
maybe I made the wrong completely.

275
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,510
Uh,
I highly doubt that.

276
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,590
But when you think about sort of
where the field is headed, I mean,

277
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,400
obviously you'll be a part of that and
all the current colleagues we have in our

278
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:00,234
field will,

279
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,840
but the ones that are going to take
this to the next generation will be the

280
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:05,850
students at this moment,
you know,

281
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:10,710
or those who are considering maybe
pursuing, you know, studies and emotions.

282
00:17:10,711 --> 00:17:14,620
So when you meet with your students
and they sort of ask you for advice or

283
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,280
they're thinking about embarking
in the field of emotion,

284
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,010
what advice do you usually give them?

285
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,790
Uh, well if you asked me about the advice
that I give my own students, I say,

286
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,340
stay in the lab, work hard and
do what I, no, I'm kidding.

287
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,240
Um,
I think,

288
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,970
I think the best advice
I can give people is,

289
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,650
um, to be bold, um,

290
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,440
to challenge ideas, uh, to
challenge basic assumptions,

291
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,640
um, not to spirit, to go against the
spring, the stream. Because I think that,

292
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,340
you know,

293
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,340
that's the way to discovery
and to enjoy the process.

294
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,010
Because if you don't want to have
fun doing science, then don't do it.

295
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,190
So I think that's my,
that's my place. How Fun.

296
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,753
And people,

297
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,340
I love that.
And just remembering to enjoy the process.

298
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,330
I think it's something that maybe
not enough people really emphasize.

299
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:27,870
And it's lovely that you give that
advice to students because you're right,

300
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,840
why would we be here in the first
place if we didn't enjoy it?

301
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,150
And it's wonderful,
isn't it?

302
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,280
It is science and especially emotion
science is a really beautiful thing.

303
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,360
Yup. Well, thank you Maya,
