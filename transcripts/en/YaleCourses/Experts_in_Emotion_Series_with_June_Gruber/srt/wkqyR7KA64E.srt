1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,010
Welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,420
So today we're going to conclude
our discussion on psychophysiology.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,030
And essentially going back to
the question we started with,

4
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:14,031
which is to what extent is our heart
really a window into our soul and our

5
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:15,474
emotions?

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,670
So we're going to do so today by starting
out with an exercise to conclude our

7
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:23,190
discussion on the
psychophysiology of emotions.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,290
So what I'd like you to do is take out
a piece of paper and the pen and think

9
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:31,260
about a time in which you
felt a really strong emotion.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,430
So maybe you felt really happy or excited,
maybe the rice sad,

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,410
maybe very nervous or scared.

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,740
Try to identify one moment
that really stood out to you.

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,580
And as you think in this moment, I want
you to answer three questions about it.

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,990
So what did you notice in terms of what
triggered it or what was the illicit her

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,580
second,

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,660
what did you notice happening in your
body where you aware of your heart racing?

17
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:56,670
Were you aware of your
palms getting sweaty,

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,550
where you're aware of your
breathing becoming more rapid?

19
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,180
And how long did this last?
So I'd like you to pause,

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,880
take a moment to write this down.
And when you're done,

21
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,140
you can resume the video
where we go through our final
lecture today on emotions

22
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:10,974
and the body.

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,760
So today we'll wrap up our discussion of
psychophysiology in our third component,

24
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,900
looking at our final, uh, sort of
discussion into the question of,

25
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,700
is our blood and sweat really a window
into understanding our tears and our

26
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:28,540
deepest fears.

27
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,530
And here we'll talk about two main
themes that are emotion specificity.

28
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,770
So how much can we really map specific
physiological profiles onto unique

29
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:41,110
motions as well as this idea of coherence,

30
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,320
or how well does our heart racing and
our skin temperature increasing actually

31
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:50,170
map onto what we would subjectively
report we're feeling in the moment.

32
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,630
So with today,

33
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,960
we'll start first with this
question of emotion specificity.

34
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,150
And here what we'll start with is looking
at this question of whether or not

35
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:06,151
different emotions actually have different
autonomic or physiological profiles.

36
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,750
So some of you might remember this
table that we've introduced at different

37
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:13,360
points throughout the course and
earlier on in our discussion of

38
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:16,440
psychophysiology. So this is a table, um,

39
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,340
that you'll see more in readings by
Bob Levenson that really advocated for

40
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,790
what's called the sort of
emotion specificity hypothesis.

41
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,930
And this hypothesis suggested that
for many of our most basic emotions,

42
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,540
we should have unique and
distinct profiles, um,

43
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,860
a physiologic corresponding in
our autonomic nervous system.

44
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:41,070
So here you would see anger is uniquely
associated with Bozzo dilation and pupil

45
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,210
expansion. You should also see things
or sorry, Vaseux um, yeah, dilation,

46
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,780
you would see reddening in
the skin. You're but blood
vessels bulging, you know,

47
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:53,920
your pupils actually constricting,
right? With fear. By contrast,

48
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:56,920
you see vasoconstriction,
sweat, glands activating.

49
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,630
This will lead to changes of seeing sort
people becoming Pale, you know, sweating,

50
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:04,660
clammy palms,
higher skin conductance or sweat,

51
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,320
sadness associated activity.
And the tear glands,

52
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,780
right discuss is different
from all of these.

53
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:14,230
We see activation in the salivary glands
where people are actually salivating

54
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:16,180
and drooling when they're
feeling disgusted.

55
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,870
And then happiness is one of the most
interesting and mysterious emotions to

56
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:24,610
date we see associated with activity in
the Vegas nerve or the parasympathetic

57
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:25,780
nervous system.
Um,

58
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,470
and people will describe this
tightness in their chest or goosebumps.

59
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,330
So what we're seeing here is really
specific kinds of physiological changes

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,800
associated with distinct emotions.
Um,

61
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,840
and what you have to ask though,

62
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,330
you saw on that table there
that have the emotions we have,

63
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:47,200
there was only one on the bottom and that
was just happiness, broadly construed.

64
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,730
So emotion specificity really took
flight by looking at differences among

65
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,910
different kinds of negative emotions.
So answering the question,

66
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:56,440
in what way does our body change?

67
00:03:56,441 --> 00:04:00,040
And we're feeling anger
versus fear versus sadness.

68
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,910
And not until very recently.
So just in the past, you know,

69
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:08,911
five years even have people even begun
to try to understand what way different

70
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:13,060
kinds of positive emotions actually
look differently in the body.

71
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,680
So we know overall that people have
associated experiences of happiness with

72
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:19,960
activity in the
parasympathetic nervous system.

73
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,740
But what have you take this broad umbrella
of positive states and try to look

74
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:27,220
and see if they're different. So our
positive feelings, like excitement,

75
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,630
different from positive feelings of
love or pride. So, in other words,

76
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:33,070
the question you've been seeing here,

77
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,370
what about differences
among positive emotions?

78
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,330
Do we see support for this emotion?
Specificity hypothesis there?

79
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,210
So here, this is um, a paper that
I worked on with my colleagues. Um,

80
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,360
we're began to try to look
at this question by looking
at positive emotions at

81
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:54,280
rest and we found that what you see
here is that increased activity of the

82
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:58,000
parasympathetic nervous system.
So you measure this using Rsa,

83
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:03,001
which we talked about earlier actually
seem to really index important aspects of

84
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:06,580
individual differences
in positive emotionality.

85
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,530
So in this study we found for example,

86
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:13,531
that higher degrees of Rsa at rest
actually predicted even at these,

87
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:18,370
you know, eight month outcomes,
greater increases and you know,

88
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:21,490
positive emotionality.
So for one,

89
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,140
what we see is that there
are physiological measures
that seem to map onto

90
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,320
positive emotionality and
they even longitudinally
predict greater increases in

91
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:32,170
positive emotionality.
But as you can see here,

92
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,860
this is really talking about positive
emotion as a whole. So again,

93
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:38,530
what about distinct kinds
of positive emotions?

94
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,310
Do they look different physiologically?
So by and large,

95
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,140
this is a field that is still very new
and has a lot of unsolved mysteries.

96
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:47,651
Um,

97
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:51,700
so what I'll be presenting to you some
data that was recently published in 2011,

98
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,710
the very first study to look at distinct
autonomic profiles among positive

99
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,930
emotions. And I think what's
exciting about this, as it opened up,

100
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,110
it opens up an entire door of research
to more further these mysteries.

101
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,030
Um, but it also brings up
a lot of questions too.

102
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,420
So this was a study done
by Michelle Shiota, um,

103
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:16,160
a professor at Arizona State University
where she looked at a broad variety of

104
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:20,270
physiological measures here.
So we have heart rate projection period,

105
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,290
skin conductance response or
electrodermal activity, respiration,

106
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,990
Rsa, again, that's respiratory sinus
arrhythmia as well as blood pressure,

107
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:34,070
mean arterial pressure. And here
she looked at this in response to,

108
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:34,521
as you can see,

109
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:38,310
here are five different categories of
distinct positive emotional stimuli.

110
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:42,050
So people watched different emotionally
evocative films that really mapped onto

111
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,250
emotions of enthusiasm,
love, a attachment style,

112
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,010
love and nurturing style of love,
amusement and awe.

113
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,790
And hear what I have highlighted in
these black arrows are significant

114
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:56,480
differences that emerged
that differentiated each
of these five emotions from

115
00:06:56,481 --> 00:07:01,370
one another and an upwards Arrow indicates
an increase in that of activity in

116
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:05,120
that physiological channel and a
downwards Arrow indicates a decrease.

117
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,280
So what can we learn from this?

118
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,640
Someone will walk you through the findings
slowly and then I want you to think

119
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:13,070
about toit extent.
This actually makes sense to you.

120
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,400
So the last time you felt
enthusiastic or you felt amused,

121
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,430
did this seem to map onto
your own bodily states?

122
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,160
So let's start first with amusements.
So if you look here,

123
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,140
what we're seeing with
enthusiasm, uh, sorry, thieves.

124
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,390
Yasmine is increase in skin conductance
response and a decrease in Rsa.

125
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,610
So in some ways it seems surprising,
right?

126
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:34,940
Because we thought that happiness was
associated with an increase in Rsa.

127
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,900
The way that the author argues that this
makes sense is that enthusiasm is the

128
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:40,430
state of excitement and joy.

129
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,660
And it's supposed to promote the sort
of pursuit of rewards, sort of, uh,

130
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:47,870
increased activity in what's called
the behavioral activation system.

131
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,350
And so as you're getting really excited
to sort of go after that reward and

132
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:55,220
obtain it, what you really want is to
get your body mobilized. You want to get,

133
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,731
you know,

134
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:59,240
your skin conductance up and you want to
sort of turn down your parasympathetic

135
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:00,080
nervous system.

136
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,320
So excitement might actually be a really
unique emotion and then it's actually

137
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:06,830
associated with getting that sympathetic
activity up and running so you can go

138
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:11,480
pursue and get that reward. When we think
of love. So you think of attachment,

139
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:15,890
right? So maybe it's an attachment
to a romantic partner. Um, you know,

140
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:19,960
and this is really interesting because
what they suggest for example, um,

141
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,130
in this research here is you also see
an increase in heart rate and a decrease

142
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:29,150
in Rsa. So again, what we're
seeing is body bodily mobilization.

143
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,630
When we look at discreet or
specific kinds of positive emotions.

144
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:37,631
So they would argue that this attachment
kind of love it was perhaps mobilizing

145
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,030
your approach behavior to go
seek out a potential mate, right?

146
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,720
And sort of engage them with you and that
you can't just be sitting and resting

147
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:45,321
and digesting.

148
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:49,250
You need to kind of get up and go out
there and try to pursue that potential

149
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:53,210
mate or attachment partner.
We look here at nurturant love,

150
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:57,380
we see an increase in heart rate and
an increase in respiration. So, um,

151
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,960
nurturant love actually is a
bit of a physiological mystery.

152
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,800
We don't quite understand why
the body changes in that way.

153
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,800
So nurturant love you're thinking of
the love you might feel towards a young

154
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:11,280
child or some people who are pet owners
will say they feel this way towards

155
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:12,630
their dogs or their cats.

156
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,890
Why is our heart racing
and we're breathing faster
when we're sort of cued to

157
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:21,120
see images of those things is an
exciting but really unknown mystery.

158
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:25,390
And I love for you to think about how
you would hypothesize, you know, uh,

159
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,330
this story to sort of make sense,
um, in your own understanding of uh,

160
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,460
nurturant love when we get to amusement.

161
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,290
One of the key differences here that
really picks out amusement is an increase

162
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,220
in respiration.

163
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,940
And if you think about the last time you
laughed when you were feeling amused,

164
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:45,000
what happens when we laugh?
So we talked about this earlier in class.

165
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,720
What happens when you laugh as you're
actually engaging in a series of very

166
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,200
rapid, very short breaths. So
essentially when you're amused,

167
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:55,920
you're laughing and that
causes your respiration rate
to pick up, not surprising.

168
00:09:55,921 --> 00:10:00,900
Right? And then finally there's
this magical and mysterious
emotion of awe. So Ah,

169
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:04,830
is supposed to be this emotion that
picks up a sense of wonder and amazement

170
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:07,950
sort of being around something
bigger than the self. Um,

171
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,160
and this was sort of in contrast to
what I think the authors hypothesized.

172
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:14,330
So,
um,

173
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,060
this is interesting because what we're
seeing here is it's not leading to a

174
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:20,130
decrease in physiological arousal,

175
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,480
but it is consistent some ways with
this sort of cardiovascular undoing

176
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:28,770
hypothesis of amusement. So in other
words, what we're seeing here, um,

177
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,870
in some ways, uh, you know,

178
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,500
is the sense in which we're sort
of disengaging our parasympathetic

179
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,030
parasympathetic system,

180
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:40,070
but we're breathing more rapidly and
we're even seeing to some extent, um,

181
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,410
and increase in pep actually means
a decrease in sympathetic activity.

182
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,120
So we're seeing in some way,
uh,

183
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,780
is able to slow our sympathetic
nervous system down, right?

184
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,890
Maybe to help us sort of take in the vast
wonder of things around us. So again,

185
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:56,310
this is the one of the first studies
ever done and I'm excited to think about

186
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:59,910
all the new studies that may come
after this and start to look at emotion

187
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:04,680
specificity in the whole landscape
of broader positive emotions. So,

188
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,160
and I want to turn to emotion coherence.
And again,

189
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:12,270
if you remember from way back when we
first talked about what is an emotion,

190
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,420
we talked about what are
different features of emotions,

191
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:18,570
sort of what are the core constituents
of what makes an emotion and emotion.

192
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,780
And one of the definitions that's proposed
by one of the most famous figures and

193
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:26,250
emotion Pollock men, um, when he tried
to answer this question, he said, well,

194
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:30,180
there's these, you know, kind
of six fundamental features
of what is an emotion.

195
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,740
And one of them that's taking
for granted is coherency.

196
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,810
So this is the idea that we should see,
um,

197
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,640
all of our different channels of
emotion, our behavior, our physiology,

198
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,320
our subjective quality of what it's like
to feel an emotion that these systems

199
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,070
work together and they come
online together at the same time.

200
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:51,540
So the minute you feel an emotion,

201
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,700
your physiology should kick in and
should also see an accompanying facial

202
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:55,534
expression.

203
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,680
But here people have actually begun to
question this basic premise of what is an

204
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:03,610
emotion saying really our
emotions really coherent.

205
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,780
And one of the first studies that tried
to look at this looked at whether or not

206
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:09,390
our physiological,
you know,

207
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,020
responses that we've talked about in these
lectures actually are coherent or map

208
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:17,740
onto subjective reports of how
people are actually feeling.

209
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,830
So let me show you what some of
these studies have looked like. Um,

210
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,300
so for example, what we're going to
be looking at here in these studies,

211
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,660
in other words,
is to what extent does our physiology,

212
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:33,430
so an internal physical sensations, to
what extent do they map onto the quality,

213
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:36,460
uh, you know, at the top, sort of
what does it like to feel an emotion?

214
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,170
Do they actually cohere to,

215
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:43,030
they actually increase and
decrease together or are
they completely mismatched?

216
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,970
So here we're going to ask the question,

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,870
our emotions really coherent and
where's the empirical evidence?

218
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,440
So here this was work pioneered by IRS
mouse and colleagues who took people into

219
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,190
the lab and looked at emotion
coherent systematically.

220
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,810
So she had people come in and watch
emotion films while sitting at a computer,

221
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,530
positive, negative and neutral films.
And while they're watching these films,

222
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,010
she measured second by second assessments
and changes in their heart rate.

223
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,600
She also looked at using a continuous
rating dial moment by moment,

224
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:17,500
self reports of how a person was stealing
from very negative to very positive.

225
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,760
And she was able to take
these two measurements of
heart rate and continuous, uh,

226
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:26,470
self-reported assessments of emotion to
be able to look at to what extent we see

227
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:30,730
coherence or correlations
between moment by moment,

228
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:34,090
changes in heart rate and moment by
moment changes and how people self report

229
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:35,080
their feeling states.

230
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,370
And the upshot of the work by Iris
Nelson colleagues from this sort of

231
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:40,250
complicated,
uh,

232
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:45,070
correlation table that you see here is
that there's at most moderate coherence

233
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,590
on average, you see the highest
coherence between people,

234
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:52,120
self-reported experience and their
external expressions of behavior.

235
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,790
But since we're talking
about psychophysiology,

236
00:13:55,030 --> 00:14:00,030
we see almost no match or coherence
between people's physiological states and

237
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,210
either their subjective experience using
the rating dire we saw earlier or their

238
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,520
outward displays of emotional behavior.

239
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,600
So really it seems to be the case that
emotions might not be as coherent as we

240
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,010
just assumed them to be.

241
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,450
Now researchers interested in looking at
whether or not this was really true for

242
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:21,070
everyone conducted a really interesting
study here and this has done by Jocelyn

243
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:25,780
z and colleagues at UC Berkeley where
they looked at coherence using a similar

244
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,614
paradigm,

245
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,030
looking at associations between heart
rate and self reported emotion and looked

246
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:32,800
at different kinds of people to see,

247
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:36,280
well maybe emotions are more coherent
and some kinds of people than others.

248
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,360
So here you can see they had healthy
control adults who showed the lowest

249
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:44,920
coherence followed by two
really interesting groups
of people that are thought

250
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:48,620
to have a sense of increased
bodily awareness. So the,

251
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,010
these were dancers and
meditators and as you can see,

252
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,610
they found meditators had the highest
degree of coherence between what they

253
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:59,120
reported feeling and what their heart
rate actually showed with dance or

254
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:00,680
somewhere in between,
in between.

255
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,850
So this suggests to some extent that the
greater bodily awareness you may have

256
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,450
and the greater sort of internal
awareness of your own mental states,

257
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,710
the raider coherence you're going to
show between your body and your mind.

258
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,530
So interestingly,
there may be coherence,

259
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,280
but maybe better for some than others
in terms of this almost mind body

260
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:20,114
connection.

261
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,040
Okay.

262
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,100
So with that, I want to conclude
now with our takeaway questions,

263
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,950
talking about motion
specificity and coherence.

264
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:34,350
So what is the physiological evidence
in support of emotion specificity,

265
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,500
especially for the basic emotions we
first talked about that were primarily

266
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:39,670
negative emotions.

267
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,150
Okay.

268
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,450
Then what is the physiological
evidence in support of emotion,

269
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:47,840
specificity for distinct kinds
of positive emotions? Right?

270
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:51,020
So this was this new generation of
research as trying to look at distinct

271
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,670
autonomic profiles for different
positive emotions. And then finally,

272
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:58,700
is there evidence, action,
support of emotion coherence,

273
00:15:58,701 --> 00:16:02,150
which is thought to be a core part of
the basic definition for what is an

274
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:06,290
emotion and what sort of individual
difference factors might influence this

275
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:06,891
relationship.

276
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:10,310
So what kinds of people have the lowest
coherence and what kinds of people might

277
00:16:10,311 --> 00:16:11,660
have the highest coherence.

278
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,450
Okay.

279
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,680
And today I want to conclude with our
expert interview as part of the experts

280
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:19,210
and emotion interview series.

281
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,100
Okay.

282
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,520
So today as part of our series
we'll be speaking with um,

283
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,050
doctor Robert Levenson from the
University of California Berkeley,

284
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,350
who is going to be speaking with us
about this question that's guided much of

285
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:34,980
our discussion today. Blood
tears, sweat and fears,

286
00:16:34,981 --> 00:16:37,290
the autonomic nervous system and emotion.

287
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,340
So doctor Levinson received his phd
from Vanderbilt University in clinical

288
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:44,910
psychology and he's currently a professor
in the Department of Psychology at the

289
00:16:44,911 --> 00:16:46,410
University of California Berkeley,

290
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,430
where he's a member of both the
behavioral neuroscience, clinical science,

291
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,980
developmental and social
personality programs.

292
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,800
He currently serves as the
director of the institute,

293
00:16:55,801 --> 00:16:57,480
or a personality in social research,

294
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,240
as well as the director of
the clinical science program.

295
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,980
So Dr Levinson's research program is in
the area of human emotion studying the

296
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:08,850
Organization of physiological,
behavioral, and subjective systems.

297
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:13,080
The way that these systems are impacted
by neuropathology normal aging and

298
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:13,914
culture,

299
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,640
and the role that emotions play in the
maintenance and disruption of committed

300
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:18,570
relationships.

301
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,370
Dr Levinson's research has been
supported by grants from the NIH and Nia,

302
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,960
and he is the past
president of the Society for
psychophysiological research and

303
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:31,110
the past president of the association
for Psychological Science.

304
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,330
So I now turn to a very special experts
in emotion interview with Doctor Robert

305
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,160
Levenson from the University
of California Berkeley.

306
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:44,410
Okay.
