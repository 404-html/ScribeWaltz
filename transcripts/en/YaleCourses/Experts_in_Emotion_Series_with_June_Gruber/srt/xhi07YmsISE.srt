1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,820
For experts in emotion interview.

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:06,180
We have the honor of speaking with
Dr Leah Summerville on emotion and

3
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:07,020
adolescence.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,400
So doctor Somerville is an assistant
professor of psychology at Harvard

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:11,760
University.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,110
She received her phd from Dartmouth
College where she examined how individual

7
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:20,340
differences and anxiety influenced the
physiological and neural processing of

8
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:22,530
threatening and unpredictable information.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,250
She then completed her post doctoral
training at the Sackler institute for

10
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:28,210
Developmental Psychology,
psycho biology,

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,620
Athey Weill Cornell medical
college currently work in
the affect of neuroscience

12
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:34,651
and development lab,

13
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:39,090
which she directs is focused on unique
relationships between brain development

14
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:43,050
and everyday behavior as both are
changing during the adolescent years,

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,220
heavily influenced by her experiences
working in the team crisis center.

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,540
A longterm objective of her lab is
to inform a potential linkage between

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,410
adolescent specific emotional changes,
brain functioning,

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,730
and the tendency for psychiatric illness
and sub optimal decisions to emerge

19
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,410
during the second decade of life.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,310
She's also teaming up with Boston area
middle schools and high schools to

21
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:06,600
conduct outreach activities,

22
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:10,440
focused on getting adolescents excited
about science and most notably,

23
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:14,760
Dr Somerville's first job was as a
waitress in a greasy spoon diner.

24
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:15,750
So with that,

25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,770
I now turn to our experts and emotion
interview with doctor Leah Summerville.

26
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,840
So welcome Leah. Thanks for
speaking that. That's today.

27
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,630
Thank you.
Thanks for having me.

28
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,880
What I wanted to start out with asking
you about is a little about your journey

29
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,240
into the world of emotion.

30
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:35,790
So what first kind of sparked your
attention and got you interested in this

31
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:36,624
topic?

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,130
Sure.
Um,

33
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,180
well I got interested in emotion I think
right at the beginning of my college

34
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:44,740
years. Um, I thought that um,

35
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,790
I would probably end up as a psych
major even going into college. Um,

36
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,800
but when I wanted to really
gain was experienced working
in laboratory settings.

37
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,080
Um, so I ended up working in two different
labs, um, early on in my college years,

38
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,070
both of which approached the study
of emotion in very different ways.

39
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,540
So I worked in one lab that was looking
at cognitive biases and clinical

40
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,380
depression. So looking at, um,

41
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,520
emotional sort of processes
from a clinical perspective.

42
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,140
And then on the other end I was working
as well in a neuroscience lab that was

43
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:19,650
trying to really pinpoint the role
of a subcortical part of the brain,

44
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,970
the Amygdala in sort of detecting and
assigning relevance to cues in the

45
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:26,790
environment.
So these two research experiences,

46
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,620
although they were really different,
um,

47
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:30,990
sort of had a common
thread of emotion in them.

48
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:32,760
And I think that it kind of hooked me.
And then I went to,

49
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:36,990
there was no turning back from there.
So now you're hooked and stuck forever.

50
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,983
I think so.

51
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,290
So I wanted to ask you a little bit about,
since you've been hooked,

52
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,720
kind of what you've been
doing research wise,

53
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:47,690
I'm cause you're doing some
really exciting work. Um,

54
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,420
so one of the questions I wanted
to ask you about is, I mean,

55
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:54,470
you've really conducted fascinating
research using these tools of neuroscience

56
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:59,320
to better understand the way that the
brain develops and shapes our emotional

57
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:02,440
experiences sort of from
childhood into adulthood.

58
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,430
And I'd love to hear your perspective
on what you think some of the most

59
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,220
interesting and exciting
discoveries are here.

60
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,730
Sure. Um, I think the,

61
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,780
the main discovery that I am very excited
to have had a chance to work on is not

62
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,100
necessarily my own,

63
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:22,180
but when that's been sort of developing
and changing over the last, let's say,

64
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:23,450
decade,
um,

65
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,470
which is the idea that part of the reason
why adolescents may behave in unique

66
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:33,541
ways in terms of their emotional lives
and experiences may in fact be due to the

67
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:38,140
way that in part by two the way
that the brain develops. So, um,

68
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,280
typically adolescents are thought of
as having a sort of unique profile of

69
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:46,600
emotional experiences. So one could say
that they're oriented toward rewards,

70
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,800
which leads them to take risks.
Um,

71
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,750
people could consider them as moody
or more volatile in their emotional

72
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:57,110
reactions. And there is some data
supporting this characterization. Um,

73
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,993
however,

74
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,530
people have used in classically
used these characterizations as,

75
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,870
as things some sort of negative
and um, almost, you know,

76
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,350
unfortunate things about adolescence.
Um,

77
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,790
some people have characterized them as
being in a state of temporary insanity or

78
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,480
that they're unable to control themselves
and seeing things along those lines.

79
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,010
Um,
however,

80
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:23,011
in the last 10 years I brain imaging
has allowed us to pinpoint that in fact,

81
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,610
um,

82
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,870
trajectories and ways in which the brain
develops during the second decade of

83
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:33,130
life may in fact lead adolescents to
be more susceptible to the influence of

84
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:36,370
emotion on their day to day behavior.
And this,

85
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:40,900
and this might change or reframe the way
we can think about adolescence as a way

86
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:44,830
from a sort of deficient period of the
lifespan in toward thinking of this as a

87
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:49,831
very normative and almost sort of mediated
by developed by typical developmental

88
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:51,430
trajectories of the brain.

89
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,310
So right, so you study this
at this period of adolescence,

90
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:58,310
which is such a unique and
memorable time in everyone's life,

91
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,230
but at the same hand on the same hand,

92
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:03,320
like what you're saying is it's described
as this period people say of like

93
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,150
storm and stress, right? With all
gas and no breaks, for example.

94
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,060
And I mean from your perspective then,

95
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,870
I mean it's an expert in really studying
the emotional lives of adolescents in

96
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:16,160
the sort of neural bases.

97
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,170
Why have you found this
group such a particularly
interesting population to work

98
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:22,004
with?

99
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,880
Yeah, that's a really interesting
question because, um, as you know,

100
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:28,610
I'm not a developmental psychologist.
In other words,

101
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:32,570
I didn't enter into psychology
wanting to, um, you know,

102
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,650
pick apart aspects of human
development. Um, but I've gotten really,

103
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:40,730
really interested in adolescents even
in the last five years because they

104
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:45,731
offered a really unique tool or really
unique sort of lens to understand basic

105
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:46,694
emotion.

106
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,020
So what I mean by that is that adolescents
really is a time where we see a lot

107
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:54,510
of changes in the way that
people experience emotion, um,

108
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,760
both in their daily lives as well
as things we invoke in the lab. Um,

109
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:02,070
so adolescence is a
period of life that is,

110
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,860
it's sort of characterized by
emotions that are, um, not, uh,

111
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,810
that are similar sort of qualitatively
to other periods of the lifespan,

112
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,330
but they might be sort of dialed
up in their extremity. So the, um,

113
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,590
adolescents tend to
experience more frequent,

114
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,400
both positive and negative emotions.
And when they experienced them,

115
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,780
they tend to experience them as sort of
heightened as date of a, of extremity.

116
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,130
And this is also a period of life where,
um,

117
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,650
there tends to be a common
onset of psychopathology.

118
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,800
So relative to childhood
as well as adulthood. Um,

119
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,230
mood and anxiety disorders in particular
tend to emerge during adolescence, um,

120
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,100
in their sort of initial onset. So, um,

121
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,200
the way I think of adolescence is a
really unique period of their lives and

122
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,780
where we can track a couple of things.

123
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,980
One is these common and typical changes
in the way that emotions are experienced

124
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,270
and then we can relate them to ways
in which the brain may be behaving or

125
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,520
functioning uniquely
during this time of life.

126
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,190
And so this can tell us both about sort
of basic aspects that link emotional

127
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,550
experiences to a brain
functioning as well as sort of,

128
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,390
um,

129
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,290
give us a lens to really zoom in on this
really particularly interesting period

130
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,124
of life.

131
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,260
It's fascinating. And not only are
you studying emotions, you know,

132
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:21,670
in sort of healthy adolescents,

133
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:25,690
but your work has also explored really
important clinical implications.

134
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:29,080
For one emotion goes awry
with the focus on anxiety.

135
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,460
And I wondered if you could just elaborate
a bit on how your brain imaging work

136
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:38,140
on anxiety can help us understand,
you know, emotion more generally.

137
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,150
Sure. Um, yeah,

138
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:43,540
this is you're referring to is work
that I really got interested in doing

139
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:48,240
graduate school. Um, and based on
reading a great deal about, um, you know,

140
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,770
the brain and neuro basis of emotion.

141
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,340
One thing that I noticed was that most
of the studies that study emotion in the

142
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:59,341
lab tend to use him a procedure where
emotions would be evoked using some sort

143
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:00,700
of Q and the environment.

144
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,540
And then we would measure sort of
brief response to that cue. Um,

145
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,420
but we know that in our everyday
lives and in the real world,

146
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,140
emotions don't necessarily play
out over these very brief, uh,

147
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,440
sort of reactive timescales.
And so what we wanted to do, um,

148
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,080
in this work was to try and provide new
tools and new ways to try and understand

149
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:22,780
how emotion might be maintained over time.

150
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,310
And this would be sort of
trying to understand how
sustained emotion may be sort

151
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:30,220
of held on to,
if you will by circuitry of the brain.

152
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:35,080
And with this work we actually identified
some interesting distinctions between

153
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:39,220
the brain circuitry is that can sort
of evoke in eScience significance to

154
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:44,080
emotional cues, um, relative to those
that actually remain persistently active,

155
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,910
that could hold on to let's
see, an anxious state for
minutes at a time. And so,

156
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,410
um, one of the things I think
is cool about this work is
that it might provide us

157
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:56,970
new avenues to try and understand
maintenance in the lab,

158
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,680
which is not a simple thing to do,

159
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,690
but it may have relevance to a number
of different sort of clinical disorders

160
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,130
that aren't particularly those that are
marked by sort of hyper arousal that

161
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:13,110
maintains over time or
disorders of rumination where
I'm worrying or other kinds

162
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:17,440
of mood states might be maintained over
time. And so we're hoping through, um,

163
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,900
future studies and some current studies
that I'm working on to apply these ideas

164
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,110
to try and ask the question of whether
these sustained emotion systems may in

165
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:33,000
fact also have a prominent role in the
pathophysiology of anxiety disorders.

166
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,180
And do you think from this,
I mean that's just such interesting work.

167
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:40,350
Do you think there might be particular
implications for understanding anxiety

168
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,890
and adolescents that's unique
or different from adults?

169
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,000
Yes. Um, I think so.

170
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:51,001
So one of the interesting features of the
emergence of anxiety disorders is that

171
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,010
certain anxiety disorders based
on epidemiological work, um,

172
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,490
tend to emerge relatively
early in the lifespan.

173
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,240
And these are have sometimes been
referred to as fear disorders.

174
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,740
That is those that are marked by extreme
reactions to some sort of environmental

175
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:07,040
cue.
Um,

176
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:11,830
but disorders of the anxiety disorders
that are more characterized by these sort

177
00:10:11,831 --> 00:10:14,900
of lengthy states of rumination or worry,
um,

178
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,310
tend to initially present themselves
during the adolescent years.

179
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,780
And so one thing we're testing right now
is whether brained properties of brain

180
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:27,070
development in the circuitries that I
sort of mentioned earlier may in fact be

181
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:27,904
distinct.

182
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:33,390
And potentially sped up in path and in
I'm anxious adolescents who tend to have

183
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:36,190
this sort of worry like profile.

184
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,880
And this is something that we are
examining right now through some clinical

185
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:43,870
studies with some collaborators that
I have in New York. So stay tuned.

186
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,480
Very exciting.
I can't wait to hear.

187
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,970
So then,
you know,

188
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:52,570
as you're thinking about the work that
you've been doing and what got you first

189
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:54,430
hooked into the study of emotion,

190
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,520
when you sort of like look
forward into the future,

191
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,410
where do you see the field headed?

192
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,750
I think that, um, even
in the last 10 years, um,

193
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,480
I'm trying to understand that sort of
neural bases and underpinnings of our

194
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:12,350
emotional experiences has
really transformed. I mean,

195
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:16,580
this is a field that's rapidly evolving
and I think we're getting a better and

196
00:11:16,581 --> 00:11:21,581
better handle on some of these basic
functional aspects of different circuitry

197
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,340
in the brain that may mediate,
um,

198
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,770
emotional experiences and
regulation of emotion. Um,

199
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,400
I think what a lot of people are working
towards now is to try and use that

200
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:34,130
information to help inform,
um,

201
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:38,000
sources of risk as well as sources
of resilience. For psychopathology.

202
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,030
So to try to translate this,

203
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,240
these basic findings into a more
sort of clinically relevant way,

204
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,340
clinically relevant contexts,
which may in fact help us to, um,

205
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:53,800
say something really important about the
sources of, um, sources, variability,

206
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,280
sources of risk and resilience
I relevant to psychopathology.

207
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,850
And so when you talk then to students who
are asking you not only where the face

208
00:12:02,851 --> 00:12:03,960
of the future headed,
that,

209
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,980
what advice would you have for them as
they think about embarking into this

210
00:12:07,981 --> 00:12:10,950
field? What, what sorts of
things do you say to them?

211
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:15,510
What do you think are sort of important
kernels of wisdom to take is as someone

212
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:17,790
thinks about getting into
this field and getting hooked?

213
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,930
Um, so I think that one important
thing to consider is that

214
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,930
being an active participant in
working in research laboratories,

215
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:35,250
I really provides insight into how
emotion an emotion research works that you

216
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:40,490
can't really get from a textbook or
from a sitting in a classroom. And I,

217
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,340
so I would encourage people who might
think that they're interested in this

218
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:47,570
field to really get their feet wet and
try out a number of different experiences

219
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,730
working in laboratory setting
and potentially working
in a broad array of them

220
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,920
to really try and hone in on
to the particular interest
areas that you have. Um,

221
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,430
the other thing I would mention is that,
um,

222
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,050
although we don't hear about it as
much these days, um, some of the,

223
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,820
the very classic and really fundamental
things we understand about emotions have

224
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:12,740
in fact been derived through the use
of animal models. And I think that, um,

225
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,800
as a student I was really encouraged to
do a lot of reading on these very basic

226
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:22,970
and fundamental findings that may
diverge from sort of a human emotional

227
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:23,631
experiences,

228
00:13:23,631 --> 00:13:28,631
but really provided the basis
and foundation upon which
the field of emotion has

229
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:32,350
been able to build into the studying,
you know,

230
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,150
all the way up to human
emotion in psychopathology.

231
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,310
So I would also encourage students
to really go back in time and,

232
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:40,790
um,

233
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,540
and read and really make sense of some
of these very fundamental findings that

234
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,620
have shaped the field.

235
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,370
Great. Thank you so much for
speaking with us today, Leah.

236
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:50,810
It was great to talk to you.

237
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,020
Thank you.
It was fine.

238
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,760
Thanks. And this concludes our experts
and emotion interview with Doctor Leah

239
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,170
Summerville from Harvard University.
