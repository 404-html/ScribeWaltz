1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,450
Hi,
welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,050
Today I'm very excited to be
continuing our discussion on happiness.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,810
And as we discussed in our
last lecture as humans,

4
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:10,760
it seems that we have this almost,
you know,

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,840
insatiable desire or yearning to both be
happy and understand what happiness is.

6
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:20,450
So today we're going to start again with
the ancient observation of Aristotle

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,570
who emphasize just how important
happiness is to humans.

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,840
He said happiness is the
meaning and the purpose of life,

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,260
the whole aim and end of human existence.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,580
So today in our second module on happiness
and wellbeing will be pushing our

11
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:37,970
understanding of happiness one step
further by looking at how it relates to

12
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:38,804
morality.

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,250
And in some ways try to look at this
question of how can morality influence

14
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,310
happiness? Is there any way in
which the two are intertwined?

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,890
We'll be doing this today by starting
with a very special guest lecture by Josh

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,120
Nobe here at Yale University,

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,240
followed by our takeaway
questions and expert interview.

18
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,930
So we'll first start with our
guests lecture by Dr Josh Nobe.

19
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,930
Um, so our very special guest lecture
today is by Dr Josh Nobe on morality.

20
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:06,764
And happiness.

21
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,000
Josh is a professor of cognitive science
and philosophy at Yale University and

22
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:13,790
is one of the founders of the
experimental philosophy movement.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,700
His work has also been
covered by the New York Times,

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,750
the BBC slate and scientific American.
So welcome Josh.

25
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:22,700
Thank you for your special
guest lecture today.

26
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,493
Thanks so much.

27
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,840
So today we're going to be taking a step
in a slightly different direction and

28
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:31,180
we're going to try to take a
more interdisciplinary approach.

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,330
So just as in all of the
previous segments of this course,

30
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,970
we're going to be using the kind
of standard methods of psychology.

31
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,960
We're going to be looking at experiments,
statistical analyses and so forth.

32
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,140
But in this segment we're also going
to be taking a different approach.

33
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,580
We're going to be looking at certain
questions that came out of philosophy and

34
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:51,640
certain ideas that philosophers have
developed about those questions.

35
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,481
So in essence,

36
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:56,170
then what we're going to be doing is when
we be ticking philosophical questions

37
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,510
and philosophers ideas
about those questions.

38
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,680
But then we're going to be putting those
ideas to the test using the kind of

39
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,610
standard methods that
we see in psychology.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,410
So this approach of mixing philosophy and
psychology in this way is often called

41
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,970
experimental philosophy.

42
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,250
And that's the kind of approach
we're going to be pursuing here.

43
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,430
So in keeping with this kind
of interdisciplinary approach,

44
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,400
we're going to be talking about work
from an interdisciplinary team of

45
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:19,180
researchers.

46
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,940
So in particular we're going to be
talking about work from Jonathan Phillips

47
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,550
from philosophy, your
instructor, John Gruber,

48
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,960
from psychology and Julian to Fritas
from an interdisciplinary program in

49
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:29,830
cognitive science.

50
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,980
And the question that these researchers
were interested in was the kind of

51
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:36,580
philosophical question about how to
understand what we even mean when we talk

52
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:38,920
about happiness.
So for example,

53
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,010
suppose that we pick out a particular
person and we posed the question,

54
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,330
is this person truly happy?
The philosophical question now is,

55
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,040
what does that question even mean?

56
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,010
What is it that we're really trying to
ask when we ask that kind of question?

57
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,480
And a typical answer that a lot of people
have thought might be right is that in

58
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:56,290
asking that question,

59
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,400
we're basically just asking a
question about this person's states.

60
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,270
So a person would be considered happy
to the extent that that person has high

61
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,140
positive effect.

62
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:09,070
So a lot of positive emotions to extend
through the person has low negative

63
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:12,280
effort. So very few negative
emotions. And finally,

64
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,960
to the extent that the person has a lot
of life satisfaction there is to say has

65
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,790
to believe that her life is fundamentally
going in the right direction.

66
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,230
So according to this view,

67
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,200
as long as you have these certain
kinds of psychological states,

68
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,390
be right to say that you are happy.

69
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,260
But some philosophers have thought
maybe that view is not quite right.

70
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,180
Maybe there's actually more to the story.

71
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,000
Maybe there's something further
going on. So those, for us,

72
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:38,140
we thought maybe we can actually develop
a counter example to this kind of

73
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:40,030
general theory about what
happiness is all about.

74
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,890
So this thought is basically this.

75
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,530
Suppose we mentioned someone
who has all of the states,

76
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,220
someone has a lot of positive emotion,
very little negative emotion,

77
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,130
someone who was extremely satisfied
with the way her life is going.

78
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,270
But now suppose we imagine because
that person has a really evil,

79
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,250
nasty sort of person.
Supposedly.

80
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,870
Imagine that her life is fundamentally
kind of Vapid and meaningless and she has

81
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:03,160
no real friends,

82
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,720
that she's cruel and various ways to
other people to suggestion that these

83
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:10,990
philosophers mid then was that even
if she has all of these kinds of

84
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:14,320
psychological states,
we might say that she's not truly happy.

85
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,730
So on this kind of view,

86
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,630
maybe it's not right to say that
happiness is just a matter of having these

87
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:22,270
kinds of states.
So now we face the question,

88
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,040
we started out with this
idea from philosophy and
idea that maybe happiness is

89
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,950
more than just a matter of having these
certain kinds of psychological states

90
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,110
and we do not want to use these methods
from psychology to test that idea out to

91
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:36,340
see if it's actually correct.

92
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,290
And the way we're going to do this is
by presenting participants with certain

93
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,130
kinds of stories,

94
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:45,700
but people have various kinds of lives
and then asking those participants

95
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,820
whether the people in the
stories actually are happy.

96
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,050
So each participant is going
to be randomly assigned to
get either a story about

97
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:56,380
someone who's leading a good life
or someone who's leading a bad life.

98
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,880
In the actual experiment,

99
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,180
there were four different pairs that
participants can be randomly assigned to

100
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:01,960
receive,

101
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,320
but just to kind of give an example to
give you a sense of what this experiment

102
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:05,890
was like.

103
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,040
We're just going to pick one of these
pairs and you can see what happened in the

104
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,800
good life condition and what
happened in the bad life condition.

105
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,200
So participants in the
good life condition,

106
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,520
it received a story about someone
who has a really angelic, wholesome,

107
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,980
wonderful form of life,
so they were told,

108
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,750
Maria is the mother of three children
who all really love her. In fact,

109
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,910
they couldn't imagine having a better mom.

110
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,910
Maria usually stays pretty busy
taking care of her children.

111
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,570
She often finds herself rushing from
one birthday party to the next and it's

112
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:37,870
always going to pick up some groceries
or buy school supplies. Well,

113
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,610
Maria has been preoccupied
with her children.

114
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,820
She does get to see her old friends
occasionally, almost every night.

115
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,240
She ends up working on some project for
the next day or planning something for

116
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:47,110
our children's future.

117
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,110
And then these participants were
given some information about Maria

118
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:54,280
psychological states in particular that
they were told that she has a whole lot

119
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:56,890
of positive effect,
very little negative effect.

120
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,060
And then she has a great
deal of life satisfaction.

121
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,380
And then just to make sure
that participants really
accepted this information,

122
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,290
they were given some simple
reading comprehension questions,

123
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,600
just true or false questions
in which they're asked.

124
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,290
Is it really the case that she
has a lot of positive effect,

125
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,320
very little negative effects
and very high life satisfaction.

126
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,670
And just as you might guess,

127
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,840
participants overwhelmingly answered
true to all of these questions and then

128
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:23,930
came the real question.
Given all this information,

129
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,150
is it right to say that Maria is,
how can you,

130
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,560
so this first kiss might seem
like a relatively simple one,

131
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,010
probably you don't feel very conflicted
as far as you find yourself trying to

132
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:34,850
answer this question,

133
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,350
but participants in the other condition
got a story about another and Maria,

134
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,590
what a very different form of life.
So in this condition,

135
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,850
participants were told Maria wants to
live the life of a celebrity in La.

136
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,450
In fact, she has even started
trying to date a few famous people.

137
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,390
Maria usually stays pretty
busy trying to become popular.

138
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,200
She often finds herself rushing from
one party to the next and there's always

139
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:59,300
going to pick up some alcohol or address.

140
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,410
Maria is so preoccupied with becoming
popular that she's no longer concerned

141
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:07,970
with being honest or nicer old friends
unless they know someone famous almost

142
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:11,990
every night she ends up either drunk or
doing some type of drug just like the

143
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:13,990
famous people. She wants to be like, see,

144
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:18,440
this life was described in such a way as
to make it as Vapid as meaningless and

145
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:22,520
as callous as possible.
And then after this information was given,

146
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,780
participants were told about
Maria psychological states
and what they were told

147
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:29,750
was just exactly the same information
as in the other condition.

148
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,560
So participants were told that she
has a whole lot of positive emotions,

149
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,190
very little negative emotions, and then
she's highly satisfied with her life.

150
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,770
Just can't even imagine anything
that you'd rather be doing.

151
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,320
So participants in this next condition
then received again the exact same

152
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,020
reading comprehension questions
is the first participants.

153
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,810
So once again participants were asked,

154
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,460
is it really the case that she
has a lot of positive effects,

155
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,910
very little negative effect and
high judgment of life satisfaction.

156
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,210
And once again prisons overwhelmingly
answered yes to all of these questions and

157
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:04,610
now comes the key question. Participants
in this ladder at Quinn condition,

158
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:08,210
we're asked is it right to
say that Maria is happy?

159
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,830
So participants have just indicated
that Rhea has high positive affect,

160
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,890
low negative effect,
high judgments of life satisfaction.

161
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:20,060
So if the fact that all there is to being
happy, they should obviously say yes,

162
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,310
of course she's happy,
that's just what it means to be happy.

163
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,570
But if the philosophers are right that
something is more is going on here,

164
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,240
then participants answer might
actually be slightly different.

165
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,680
And if you look at the results,

166
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,880
will you find is that that's exactly what
occurred in each of the cases where a

167
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,560
person described as having a good life.

168
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,970
Participants overwhelmingly agreed
that that person actually was happy.

169
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,180
But if you turned out to the case in
which the person was described as having a

170
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:46,880
bad life,
you find this strange kind of reluctance.

171
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Even though the person's described as
having all of their psychological states,

172
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,410
we'd associate with happiness,

173
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,940
people are giving that person a happiness
ratings right around the mid point you

174
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,640
who that person is unhappy nor
that the person is truly happy.

175
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,300
So what is going on here?
Why is this occurring?

176
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,850
Why is it that when
someone has a bad life,

177
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,370
people say that she's not truly happy.

178
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,450
So we were really puzzled by this result
and it's still very difficult to figure

179
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,720
out why it's happening. We wanted to
try out one particular possibility.

180
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,490
So in particular I teamed up with George
Newman from the school of management

181
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,960
and Paul Bloom from
developmental psychology and
we tried to test out the idea

182
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,410
that maybe the effect here has something
to do with the notion that people have

183
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:29,750
a kind of true self,

184
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,760
I kind of essential self or self
or they have really deep down.

185
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,020
So the hypothesis here is maybe people
think of the sophos having certain kinds

186
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:39,300
of layers on the surface of the self.

187
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:42,120
You might think it's something
like the superficial stuff,

188
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,690
just the way that yous people seem to be
feeling if you just looked in the most

189
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:46,524
superficial way,

190
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,480
but then maybe people think there's also
something deeper that fundamentally at

191
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:54,300
the kind of core of a person's
being like something further,

192
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,580
something that we might
call the true self.

193
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,590
And in particular we thought that maybe
people's moral judgments seem to have an

194
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:05,010
impact on our intuitions about
what's going on at this deeper level.

195
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,740
So suppose that at a superficial level,

196
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,460
a person seems to be really happy
with things that are totally bad.

197
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,330
So even though they're doing something
that's really wrong or cruel to others,

198
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,250
they seem to be completely
satisfied with it.

199
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,290
We thought maybe people think that in
such a self there's some deeper core

200
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,500
fundamental essence that's calling
on them to do something good.

201
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,510
But importantly we thought that this
would affect would be asymmetric if on the

202
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:32,430
surface someone was doing something good,

203
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,330
we thought people wouldn't think
deep down at the core of their being.

204
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,880
There was something calling
on them to be more a bad.

205
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,630
So we tested out this hypothesis
with a simple experiment.

206
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,220
They used a three by two design.

207
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,270
So participants in one condition got
a whole mix of different stories.

208
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,090
Some of our people who are on the surface,
we're doing something bad.

209
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,540
Some of our people who on the surface
we're doing something good and some of our

210
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,550
people who are doing on the
surface doing something neutral.

211
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,590
Then participants in the other condition
just got their reverse of each of those

212
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:06,030
stories. So the bad stories, by reversing
them, it turned into good stories.

213
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,690
The good stories when they reversed
turn it about stories and the neutral

214
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:11,520
stories when reversed remained neutral.

215
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,660
And then in each of these
cases participants were
just asked whether there was

216
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:18,180
some fundamental layer
of the person's self.

217
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,940
There was calling that person to do
something different than what these seemed

218
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:22,920
to be enjoying doing under surface.

219
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,320
So just to give you a sense
of how this experiment worked.

220
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,820
Here is an example of one of the bad
vignettes. Participants were taught,

221
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,820
Bill has always mistreated his employees.

222
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,170
He often yells at them and
publicly embarrassing them
for minor infractions and

223
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:40,920
has never expressed any interest in
trying to impede in to treat his employees

224
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:44,790
better. And then participants were asked
how much do you agree with the following

225
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:48,900
statement even though he might not
acknowledge it to other people or even at

226
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:50,850
himself and his very essence,

227
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,150
there's something deep within bill calling
him to stop mistreating has employers.

228
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,660
So you can just try thinking this question
over for yourself and see whether you

229
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:00,400
strongly disagree with this statement.

230
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,040
Strongly agree or whether you're
sort of somewhere in the middle.

231
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,510
Then participants in the good condition
would receive something like a reversed

232
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:12,220
version of the bad case. Bill has
always treated his employees very well.

233
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,240
He never yells at them or does anything
to publicly embarrassment and has never

234
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:18,580
expressed any interest in
treating his employees poorly.

235
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,480
And then they just got the same question.
Do the agree the,

236
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,360
even though he might not acknowledge it
to other people or even in soft and his

237
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:26,200
very essence,

238
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,950
there is something deep within bill
calling him to start mistreating his

239
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:32,950
employers.
And finally in the neutral case,

240
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,010
participants would get stories that
we're completely neutral in their moral

241
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:39,130
Vance. Jim has been a red
wine drinker for many years.

242
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:43,120
He only drinks red wine and has never
expressed any interest in drinking white

243
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:44,470
wine.
So what do you think?

244
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,550
Is it the case that even though he might
not acknowledge it to other people or

245
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:50,950
even himself and his very essence,

246
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,280
there's something deep within him that's
calling him to start drinking red,

247
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,400
white wine? Or in the
reverse case, if there,

248
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,040
if on the surface he's
drawn to drinking red wine,

249
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,340
is there something deep within him calling
him in the opposite direction toward

250
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:07,840
white wine? So we can now
look at the results and we're
looking at these results,

251
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,850
not for each separate vignette,

252
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,660
but pulling together all of the vignettes
that were had this character of being

253
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:14,110
good.

254
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,810
All the ones that are the character of
being neutral and all the ones that on

255
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:18,760
the surface had the
character of being bad.

256
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,620
And what we see here is a
linear progression where
if someone's on the surface

257
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:24,454
being good,

258
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,460
people are very disinclined to say
that there's something deep within that

259
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:30,850
person calling them to be bad.
If someone's on the surface being neutral,

260
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,060
it's at least possible that there's
something deep within him calling him in a

261
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:36,100
different direction.
But most of all,

262
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,470
when someone on the surface
is doing from the bad,

263
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,920
people are very inclined to think there
might be something deep within that

264
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,640
person calling that person to
do something that's more good.

265
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,060
So it's this idea that we want
to capitalize in. What follows,

266
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,320
we thought maybe this could be the
explanation of the effects that we saw

267
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:55,720
earlier in people's
judgments of happiness.

268
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,870
So recall the basic idea
behind those effects.

269
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,220
We looked at people had a good knife and
people had a bad life and we found this

270
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:06,280
difference that when people
are having a good life,

271
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:09,970
people are more inclined to say that
person was happy then where people were

272
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:12,130
having a bad life,
even holding fixed.

273
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,120
All the information we provided about
that person's psychological states.

274
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,920
So why is that happening?

275
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,180
One explanation would be that it follows
from something about the way people are

276
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:25,600
construing the true stuff.
So in the good life case,

277
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,770
the information being provided says
that that on the surface the person is

278
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:33,700
really happy with her life and
because she's having a good life,

279
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,880
people seem to be assuming the deep down
the view that she's feeling having you

280
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,560
sort of concordance with the
view that she has on the surface,

281
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,960
that she really does feel deep down.

282
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,480
That same thing that she appears
to be filling on the surface,

283
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,020
that this wholesome, angelic life
she's living really is a good one.

284
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,170
But now suppose we turned to
the bad life case. In that case,

285
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,550
participants are again told that on the
surface she has all of these positive

286
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:01,730
states, positive emotion,
very little negative emotion,

287
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,710
lots of life satisfaction.

288
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,620
But if this kind of theory
about the true self is right,

289
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,210
maybe participants think that deep down
at her core she is actually feeling

290
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,050
something very different.

291
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,280
The deep down there's something within
her calling her toward a different way of

292
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:17,360
life,
a way of life.

293
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:20,210
There would be different fundamentally
from the one that she's been living so

294
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,060
far.
So to test out this theory,

295
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,570
we presented people with
exactly those same vineyards.

296
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,970
There were used in the original
study to study happiness.

297
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,510
So some people were told about
someone who has a really angelic list.

298
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,410
Some people were told about someone who
has this much more vapid and meaningless

299
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:39,800
life,
but then we ask them additional question.

300
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,480
So first that each participant was asked
that same question that they received

301
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:48,440
in the original case. Is it right to
say that this agent is happy or not?

302
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,440
But there was also a further variable.

303
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,710
Each participant was also
asked whether the agreed there.

304
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:59,570
Deep down this agent actually feels very
differently about her life from the way

305
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:00,860
she feels on the surface.

306
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:06,130
So now within a single experiment we can
measure both people's intuitions about

307
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:10,670
happiness and their intuitions about
the true self and we could look at the

308
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,920
relationship among these
different variables.

309
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:18,140
So we have for each participant whether
that participant was in the bad life

310
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:18,974
condition or not,

311
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,510
whether the participants said that the
agent was experiencing true happiness or

312
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:24,320
not,

313
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,070
and whether the participants thought
that deep down there was something within

314
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,920
that person's true stuff,
calling her to lead a different life,

315
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,490
we can now look at the relationships
among all these different variables.

316
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,730
What we find first is just
replicating the earlier study.

317
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,970
When participants hear story
about 200 is a very bad life,

318
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,060
they're less inclined to think
that that person is truly happy,

319
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,900
but we're also getting this other effect.
When someone has a bad life,

320
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,950
there are more inclined to say that
the person that feels very deeply

321
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,040
differently deep down in their true south.
And finally,

322
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,740
if you look at this variable and this one,

323
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,210
you find that the more participants think
that deep down in someone's shoes off,

324
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,460
there's something calling them
towards a different way of life,

325
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,070
the more they think that the
person is not truly happy.

326
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,810
So we can now use a statistical technique
called mediation analysis to examine

327
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:13,370
the impact of all these variables.

328
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:18,170
And what we find is that the impact
of the bad life on people's happiness

329
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:22,310
judgments is mediated by true
soft judgments. In other words,

330
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:26,510
what seems to be happening is that
when you hear the tone is a bad life,

331
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,660
you conclude that there's
something deep within that person.

332
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,900
The person's choose off that's calling
them to live in a different way.

333
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,500
And it's that that makes you think
that that person's not truly happy.

334
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,550
So to recap now that path of
the whole discussion so far,

335
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,530
we saw that philosophers have thought
that there's an impact of morality and

336
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,490
judgments of happiness.

337
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,280
And in particularly as the thought that
if someone's living a life that's really

338
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,960
immoral,
it'd be wrong.

339
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:55,140
And somehow it seems strange to see
that that person is truly happy.

340
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,470
We wanted to do is to
test that hypothesis.

341
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,510
Do people actually feel that way and to
figure out why people feel that way if

342
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:07,500
they do? So, first of all, we found that
people do seem to have that intuition.

343
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,430
They think that if your life is
morally bad, you can't truly be happy.

344
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,030
And now we seem to be getting some
insight into at least one possible

345
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:16,380
explanation of why it might be a crime.

346
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,130
Maybe what's happening is that people's
ordinary understanding of happiness

347
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,370
isn't just an understanding
of feeling positive emotion,

348
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,790
not feeling negative emotion,
having a lot of life satisfaction,

349
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,640
but rather involves something
sort of deeper, more fundamental.

350
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,040
Maybe it involves a certain
kind of contentment,

351
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,480
not just on the surface of the self, but
deep down at the level of the truce off.

352
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,763
Thanks so much.

353
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,260
So thank you so much for that.
Fantastic guests lecture, Josh.

354
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,680
Now what we're going to do is move
to our takeaway questions for today.

355
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:49,210
So our takeaway questions from our very
special guest lecture by Dr Josh Nobe

356
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,950
are as follows.
First,

357
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:55,600
what are the three components of happiness
that were discussed today? Second,

358
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,500
what were the key distinctions made
between the good life and the bad life and

359
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:04,210
yet that were depicted today and how
did these distinct moral yet influenced

360
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:08,710
participants' descriptions and
understanding of happiness? Finally,

361
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:12,820
can you describe the true self theory
discussed today and what where it relates

362
00:19:12,821 --> 00:19:14,620
to our understandings of happiness?

363
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,150
And now I'd like to conclude
with our expert interview.

364
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,280
This is part of our experts in emotion
interview series today for our experts

365
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:27,010
and emotion interview.
We'll be speaking with Dr. Daniel Gilbert,

366
00:19:27,011 --> 00:19:31,860
a professor of psychology at Harvard
University on happiness. Dr. Gilbert, um,

367
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,740
is a professor of psychology and has
won numerous awards for his research and

368
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:36,490
teaching,

369
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,060
including the American Psychological
Association's Distinguished Scientific

370
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:44,110
Award for an early career contribution
to psychology. And in 2008,

371
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:46,900
he was elected to the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences.

372
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,840
Here's 2007 book stumbling on happiness.

373
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,340
Spent six months on the New York Times
bestseller list has been translated into

374
00:19:54,341 --> 00:19:59,341
30 languages and was awarded the Royal
Society's General Book Prize for the Best

375
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,640
Science Book of the year.

376
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,990
In 2010 he hosted and cowrote the
award winning Novus television series,

377
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,830
this emotional life, which has been
seen by more than 10 million viewers.

378
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,980
He's also a contributor at a time,
the New York Times,

379
00:20:11,981 --> 00:20:15,820
and NPR is all things considered and
has been a guest on numerous television

380
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:19,990
shows, including the today show, Charlie
rose 2020 and the Colbert report.

381
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,490
So finally,

382
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:26,550
his first head talk on happiness is now
one of the 15 most popular of all time.

383
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,450
So I now turn to our very special experts
in emotion interview together with Dr.

384
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,350
Daniel Gilbert on happiness.
