1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,190
We have the pleasure of
speaking with Paul Ekman,

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,870
who's going to share his perspective
on the evolution of emotion and whether

3
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:10,060
emotions are culturally universal.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,860
So Dr. Paul Ekman is a professor emeritus
of psychology at the University of

5
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:19,861
California San Francisco and has authored
or edited 13 books most recently as we

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,810
showed earlier in the course
emotions revealed. Um,

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,730
and he's also the coauthor with the
Dalai Lama on emotional awareness,

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,840
overcoming the obstacles to
psychological balance and compassion.

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,190
Paul Ekman has consulted with federal
and law, local law enforcement,

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,760
national security,
corporate sales and negotiations,

11
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,780
health and education professionals
and animators at some of the largest

12
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:46,720
animations Siri studios in the world.
Um,

13
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:50,080
some of you might know the show lie to
me and he was one of the consultants

14
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:55,081
there to sort of teach them how to detect
a facial expressions of emotion being

15
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:58,030
also the founder of the
facial action coding system,

16
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:00,280
which we talked about
earlier in the course. Um,

17
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,850
Paul Ekman has received
countless awards and honors.

18
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,740
I couldn't even list all of them today.

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,070
Some of them include the distinguished
scientific contribution award from the

20
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:11,590
American Psychological Association.

21
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,890
And his work has been discussed in the
New York Times. Washington Post, some,

22
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:19,030
some Smithsonian magazine
psychology today,

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,470
and the New Yorker Time magazine not
surprisingly selected him as one of the

24
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:27,060
hundred most influential people in 2009.
Um,

25
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,890
he's appeared on numerous sort
of media outlets as well, uh,

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,800
for live interviews including 48 hours,
dateline.

27
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,820
Good Morning America,
2020 Larry King, Oprah,

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,770
Johnny Carson, and many
other TV programs. Um,

29
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,250
so it's an honor today to have this
amazing experts in emotion interview with

30
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,490
what is perhaps the founder of emotion
as we know it today with Dr. Paul Ekman

31
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:58,270
discussing the topic of our
emotions culturally universal.

32
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,290
So welcome Doctor Ekman.
Thank you for speaking with us today.

33
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,420
You know, as really the pioneer that
got the study of emotion, you know,

34
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:14,860
put on the map in the first place.
I'd love to hear a bit about,

35
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:18,430
for you, what got you interested
in studying this topic?

36
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:22,930
Sort of how did you come about to
land on the science of human emotion?

37
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:27,590
Yeah,

38
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,830
better than maybe the true reason cause
I don't know that we always know the

39
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:32,620
reasons or choices.

40
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,160
A long time ago and I was an undergraduate

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,400
that goes back to the
1950 [inaudible] early.

42
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,420
I thought that the answers are the
world's hills was psychotherapy

43
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,700
you really important places.

44
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,930
Individual psychotherapy we would
take to the law was group therapy,

45
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,370
just getting pretty popular.

46
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,510
And so I started observing through a
one way mirror therapy sessions and the

47
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:12,541
issue wasn't forced high would prove its
effectiveness and the only tools around

48
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:16,900
for measuring what people were doing
and group therapy dealt with their words

49
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,330
but only one person speaks at a time.

50
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,970
But the others react with your posture,
with your gaze,

51
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,350
facial expression and this is
being ignored. And I thought, gee,

52
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:34,090
we need to measure that if we're really
going to improve the effectiveness of

53
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,223
therapy.

54
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:40,260
So all take on developing the methods
and the concepts for dealing with what I

55
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:44,020
then call non verbal behavior.

56
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,860
Everything other than the speech itself.

57
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,210
And a little did I realize as I started,

58
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,970
you know how there wasn't much there,

59
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,320
there weren't tools already
available that could be employed.

60
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,770
I would have to develop the tools and
there wasn't much conceptually it was very

61
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:06,740
relevant.
Um,

62
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,130
after eight or 10 years I
found Sylvan Tompkins and, uh,

63
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,430
he gave me a lot of help in showing me
where he was getting me information face.

64
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,630
But his theory I didn't find very useful.
So it was a lot to do.

65
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:27,130
But I liked that because it was an empty,
pretty much empty field.

66
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,473
Uh,

67
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,830
and so there wasn't a lot of the kind
of rivalry and backbiting that often

68
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:36,950
occurs in hunter fields
in psychology. And, uh,

69
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,540
also it meant using cameras and I was
making half my living when I first got my

70
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:45,190
phd as a photographer.

71
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,250
And so the idea of bringing
the two together, uh,

72
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,680
I'd use cameras to understand
people. I liked that. And also,

73
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:00,150
and it became clear that in order to
sell the most fundamental question,

74
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:03,340
which is,
is not her behavior,

75
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:06,850
a culture specific language,

76
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:11,600
lung phenomenon or is it more
product or our evolution?

77
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,790
We're biologically, if he was in
universal in order to answer that,

78
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,700
you'd have to travel for a lot
of different places. Oh my God.

79
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:22,870
I wanted to travel and
so I bought g Agri News.

80
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:27,871
Cameras are getting to travel and nobody's
going to be competing with me because

81
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,600
at best, I mean actually I was told
repeatedly you're wasting your time.

82
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,190
There's not the year. That was the
opinion of academics psychology.

83
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,170
The former head of NSF,

84
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,370
we recently also retired as
head of all 10 UC systems.

85
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,420
Told me the 1960s don't you know,
this is a dead end.

86
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,130
Why are you wasting your time with it?
I recently saw him and he said, Oh,

87
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:59,131
who were the suspected that you
are able to certainly not yet

88
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,590
have you start off by clinicians.

89
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,140
They knew eras information there.
Uh,

90
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,750
not the accurate in sorrow
and those days and I made,

91
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,120
she was willing to take a risk.

92
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,590
I was doing high risk research area.
No one hit.

93
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,410
So far we've been successful.

94
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,250
Have you support for 30 years.
Every grant that I wrote was worth it.

95
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,853
Hmm.

96
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,930
That's an amazing story because I mean,
since then,

97
00:06:33,931 --> 00:06:38,931
I mean your work has just been pioneering
in developing what we know to be the

98
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:43,260
most, you know, rigorous and widely
used tool for coding, you know,

99
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,170
expressions of human emotion in the face,
you know,

100
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:48,920
your facial action coding system.
Um,

101
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,100
and I wonder if you could say a little
bit more about the development of this

102
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:53,920
system,
sort of what,

103
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,270
what were the first initial steps and
what do you see as some of the most

104
00:06:57,271 --> 00:07:00,210
important applications
of this coding system?

105
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,800
Low is a giant task to undertake and I
didn't want to be cognitive of you taking

106
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:12,520
it if I read your license or degree
eight years, cause I got one,

107
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:14,350
I only had a grant for five years,

108
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,200
I thought I'd get done from start to
finish five years. Silver talkers.

109
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,120
So I mean not to charge to Prophylax
I've ever succeed and yeah.

110
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,733
Uh,

111
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,070
after our one major false start,
uh,

112
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,200
I realize that what you're seeing is
really a mechanical system and their

113
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:42,550
muscles underneath that skin and those
muscles are pulling the skin from one

114
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:43,390
place to another.

115
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:48,890
And if you can learn the anatomy and
how these muscles are creating each

116
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,344
expression,

117
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,500
you could dissect the expression it
just from looking at video or film,

118
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,660
you don't need to average the faceless.
Ooh.

119
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,390
Uh, so you had your truck
freezing and our reason,

120
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,910
and I worked together 25 years,

121
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,830
we were just recently cars learning
about how did we managed to work together

122
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:19,831
for 25 years and I can argue very clear
division of labor of who did what work

123
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,313
beautifully.

124
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,240
At the end of five years I was nearly
out of money and I was almost there.

125
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:39,470
All right. [inaudible] take one more
year and I wrote her a big move.

126
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:42,910
It's already be in there.
Imh three years, 20 years.

127
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,770
And they said, ah, no more honey. Oh No.

128
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,920
See you didn't build this.
Doulas talk down.

129
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:53,800
We're not going to put what we've are
starting to put more money into it

130
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,740
just by accident.
I was contact.

131
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,770
Why Robin,

132
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,790
you lion or tiger who then we're
running a small foundation,

133
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,530
this small Guggenheim
Foundation and they called me.

134
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:14,160
I haven't fostered were in town. Your
work. We'd like to give you some money.

135
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,910
This is why I'm tired. I said her mom,
you are, you're pulling quite late.

136
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,970
Tiger walks if you want
to give me no, no, no.

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,830
They said we're really serious. So really
you just for a drink down charm? I did.

138
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,240
And they gave you that money.
He should get it.

139
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,780
Justin drove a block. I'd be wise, I
would have been hanging out a shingle.

140
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,650
They tried to do psychotherapy,

141
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:42,190
which I doc activity somehow.

142
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,870
Yeah. It's amazing how much happens
just by serendipity. Like you're,

143
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,190
you're telling him that story.

144
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,650
You guys,
I was a,

145
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,710
I asked her a few years ago or do you
give a truck to the medical students about

146
00:09:56,361 --> 00:10:01,250
my career? I was the first year this
all I science to see if it's successful.

147
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:06,251
The Korea and I titled the Jaw
Zera Deputy Perseverance a time.

148
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,751
That was,
I said,

149
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:16,370
we're in order for any one of those
less than figure out how you're going to

150
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,950
turtle. So things fell into my lap. Oh,

151
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,670
why did I start with this? I got
back from uh, the work in your day.

152
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,670
It was an hour afterwards.

153
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,480
Solid evidence for the fact that Darwin
really was right around expression.

154
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:37,530
I use your gestures or not are totally
different. They're a coaches specifically.

155
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,640
Russians seem to be universal
issue. Sir, I taught she,

156
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,720
we've gotta be able,

157
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:49,721
or Tom kids can go up to the screen and
show me where are you as needing anger,

158
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,650
where he was the fear I should be
able to develop an, which is awesome.

159
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,820
So that was the inspiration and I didn't
realize how hard it was going to be,

160
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,570
how long it was going to change.

161
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,080
And yet it still remains the gold standard
and it's a lot of progress has now on

162
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,900
automating it.
If you use facts,

163
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,030
you know you are about an hour to
score one minute if you behave.

164
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,410
So it's a slow process are very precise.
Well,

165
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:25,310
soon a 70 or 80% of what
people do get scored.

166
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,110
That would be a big time saver.
Being a fax coder myself, you know,

167
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,160
you'd be a big truck.

168
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,090
Is all little movies left for you or
the things that the carding automated

169
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:41,590
cutting systems having problems.
So it'll hop down,

170
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,563
uh,

171
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,800
more risk and increase the number
of people who are using facts.

172
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,400
Am I colleague Robert Levinson.

173
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:56,930
We'll do hard collaborating or years
looking at the relationship that you

174
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,410
express your physiology,

175
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,110
awkward cheese and iceberg says that's
going to really beat you bad cause then

176
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,901
all equal,

177
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:07,150
we're in a rush and her started using
vaccines will be a lot of trashy research

178
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:12,270
right now the people will use facts
after the very committed because it's a

179
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,593
process.

180
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,950
So I wanted to ask you then,

181
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:19,000
what do you see as some of
the applications of facts
both within the laboratory

182
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,960
and outside the laboratory and these kind
of real world applications that I know

183
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,270
you've been taking a
large part in as well?

184
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,080
Well, we've developed separate tools, uh,

185
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,250
for people who watch to
spot it seals emotion.

186
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,023
And

187
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,950
you're here to learn facts.

188
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,940
You don't taste with your 50 and
900 hours to learn the first five,

189
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:45,430
since I've retired and not your two hours,

190
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,190
you've been marked your recognize
conceals emotions. Uh, that's an injury.

191
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,380
I'm sure 109,000 people.
I've learned it already.

192
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,540
We just want our line and Margaret people
from all over the world with all kinds

193
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:02,620
of purposes in my back's
remains and the researchers

194
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,073
for example,

195
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,590
how many synonyms are there drag or uh,

196
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,550
we know there are a lot of different
ways over 80 different ways show anger.

197
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:19,210
Well, what's your, those are relevant.
Just sulking. Which Jane indignation,

198
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,490
which do exacerbation,
which their Curie,

199
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,850
which an annoyance and how many of them
show a type of Agora that we don't have

200
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,420
here.
We have to name shine.

201
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,170
You only have a functional words
for different types of Agora.

202
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,770
That's your anymore expressions.

203
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:41,210
So are they expressions just simply
synonyms or are they naming things that we

204
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:46,351
have not given her words or words
or representations of emotion?

205
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,313
They're not an emotion.

206
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,820
I think his argument with other people
in the field or the people who are you

207
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:56,180
with me? I stopped arguing
rocks. I answered the device.

208
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,450
That's actually, but there are people
who were really concerned with the words.

209
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,530
Really each emotion has its own
narrative and underlying store.

210
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,380
So anger has to do with protecting
yourself against threats or insults there.

211
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,340
That has to do with it in some way.
That's the underlying story.

212
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,533
I was very,

213
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,670
very different than the underlying story
of sadness switches has to do with it

214
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:25,504
this morning.

215
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,503
Hmm.

216
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,310
It should be just, there are many
reasons why you could be disappointed.

217
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,860
You're going to be disappointed
in yourself that you
didn't really act the way

218
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:35,860
you wish you had active.

219
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:41,160
You can be disappointed via a lover who
rejects you are fat you year to get an

220
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:43,350
article published.
There are many different ways,

221
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:46,620
but they all have to
do with disappointment,

222
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,860
feeling sort of lovely rejection.

223
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,360
At least that's the same story.

224
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:57,240
So to represent our emotions
with a single word like sadness,

225
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,940
anger, seals, a lot of these differences
have facts, measures everything.

226
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:05,810
You could do yours in anything you can
do with a very slick blacks can't give

227
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:08,620
you a way of describing
and then it's up to us,

228
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,630
the scientists to find out
what these things sick.

229
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,250
Why in the world with nature give us
80 different ways of displaying anger.

230
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,450
He were all senators be waste of time.

231
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,540
We have to do with different nuances
and those would be interesting too.

232
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:30,210
I've covered. All right. Another thing I'm
most interested in at the moment, yeah,

233
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,370
is a great long shot Andy North for
some shot because it's such a long shot,

234
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,960
although it happy,
nervous benefit,

235
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,280
say Mars are so far from the last 10
years have not been able to get any

236
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:48,650
government agency to support it.
Maybe they will.

237
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:54,010
I was a recent event that's this tragic
event I had a kid has made violence arch

238
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:56,841
were saying,

239
00:15:56,841 --> 00:16:01,670
so what I'm interested in and what
I have some leads for is what it,

240
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:06,230
is there a signal that warns
us of impending violence?

241
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:11,950
Is there something you can see 20 or
30 seconds before the violence versus

242
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,150
stripes orange you hear about too,
if there was

243
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,910
intervention,
say bars,

244
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,050
you can save the life of the violent
person because most of these people been

245
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,540
themselves after they go go.

246
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,310
What do you see as some of the potential
hypotheses about what might be some of

247
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:37,570
the micro expressions that might occur
immediately before violent behavior

248
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,653
strikes?
Yes.

249
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,840
Reservists game here,

250
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,730
but you go more than a
hundred assassination.

251
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,760
If you're someone who was shooting the
arteries that should even be heard.

252
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:54,650
Your camper either a hamburger or a
newsperson and then suddenly a weapon and

253
00:16:57,151 --> 00:17:01,220
fears her stripes and it's,

254
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,440
I could see the expression on his face
or I try 20 surgeons, the borders,

255
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,320
the same expression,

256
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,100
scattered reports drop serious crime,

257
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:18,150
five country Western, aren't you?
Sorry, I have some really good leads.

258
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,500
I'm not going to tell you what
they are because I am not certain.

259
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:25,380
I want those who are,

260
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,870
you know what it is they need to
suppress. Sure. Well, let me ask, I ask

261
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,930
a question about something
you brought up earlier,

262
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:37,190
which is you're really groundbreaking
work on the universality of emotion

263
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,290
expressions and recognition of emotions
and I wonder if you could describe what

264
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:46,790
some of these initial insights were in
your early work that really gave you

265
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,080
clues to,
as you said,

266
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,110
that Darwin was really on to something
in his initial observations of emotion

267
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:52,944
expressions.

268
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,770
Well,
just by luck,

269
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:01,320
I ran into a program officer
and the Defense Department,

270
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,230
what was that called?
The advanced research projects agency,

271
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,180
and he was married to a woman from
Thailand and they were having some marital

272
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:13,140
problems and he thought maybe they were
misunderstanding each other's emotions

273
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:17,850
and expressions. So he said to
me, I wasn't liked to go out find.

274
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,720
What's your, is it Brittany that
universal or is it all culture specific?

275
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,840
I want you to do basic research on this.

276
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,250
I'll give you as much
money as you need and uh,

277
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,590
find out Margaret mead writers,
Darwin, right? Or are they both? Right.

278
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:41,430
So we have a proposal in the next week
or a video dollars sounds right now this

279
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:46,431
was 1960 $5 is all lot of 65,

280
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:52,530
it would be like 10 to 20 million now.
So I went back,

281
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,640
is that what you start? I started, I of

282
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:02,340
you called me and he said, where's the
proposal? I said, I'm not going to do it.

283
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,690
He says, I'll see you
tomorrow. [inaudible] sister.

284
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,650
And he wrote the proposal.

285
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,620
So I then talked to all of
the experts I already do to.

286
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,970
I got Margaret needs to be willing
to talk to me. She wasn't very here.

287
00:19:20,971 --> 00:19:25,400
I talked to her, talked to her,
well I talked to Charles Oscar,

288
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:32,070
you watch the dude there thing that you
really need to do is you need to find

289
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:32,400
division.

290
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,940
We isolated group couldn't have been
influenced by the media or our son.

291
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:43,490
And by a stroke of luck I sound medical
scientists who had been working with a

292
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,750
isolated group,
the beginning,

293
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:55,090
find out what was causing
a grain disease. Cool. Kurt

294
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,630
[inaudible] and he had been
wise enough to recognize it.

295
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:05,631
As important as the work he was doing is
just documenting life in the stone age

296
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,890
option.

297
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:12,890
So he hired a fulltime cinematographer
and he shot [inaudible] shot a hundred

298
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,820
thousand feet,
just social life.

299
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,050
I of course he had never looked
at Dr. Thompson fee and he said,

300
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:23,600
we want to take a look,
I'll give you a cop.

301
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,940
So sock checked her coffee recently and
I spent a year so I was ahead of all of

302
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,623
this.

303
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,300
So that's true.

304
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,750
And that's where I found out
with a story where I was,

305
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:40,260
because I never saw an
expression I hadn't seen before.

306
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,740
If he was the right guy, I should
see things on a basis I'd never see.

307
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,420
And when I could tell from happened
before or afterwards in the episode,

308
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,630
my interpretation was right.

309
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,170
So no one's going to hold the
year was the proof. But that's,

310
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,090
I can't put that film and
drew take Earth Science,

311
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:06,490
I have to figure out how can I
possibly do research on this.

312
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,190
And I went to this medical
designers and I said,

313
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,320
I want to come to your area a new day
and look at these people and figure out

314
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:18,820
what kind of experiment I can do.
Why? And he said it. So I went,

315
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,120
I had funds. Do you do
anything I wanted? I got

316
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,640
the funds if that were administered by
the state of California and they wanted

317
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:32,930
her to receive her. Every penny
was, it was smacking. And I said,

318
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:35,070
these people don't have their free lyric.

319
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:39,130
They don't write check at your receipts.

320
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:45,450
I have to get a lesson.
We would a project from a Buddha doctor,

321
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,650
you won't be off to the writer of
seafood here. All hard material goods.

322
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:57,390
So I went to Johnson and robbed the
first time the evidence was not there.

323
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,630
I was telling stories to
these people and asked them

324
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,070
point that first year to do that,

325
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,040
I would show them a photograph of him.
Emotion.

326
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,130
I've never seen her photograph before.

327
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,810
I had no trouble recognizing they
had never seen her newer. Hmm.

328
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,153
Really

329
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,090
attraction. Sorry. Sure, sure.
All right, so tell me the story.

330
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,090
What was happening before?
What's after you now?

331
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,340
What else you could see square
ordering off the I want,

332
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:37,300
I've never asked them to
do such a strange thing.

333
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,260
It's not like it's story about this thing
that they'd never seen before and they

334
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:44,380
recognize me.

335
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,010
They record black making after the stories
and when I got the stories and their

336
00:22:49,011 --> 00:22:53,270
stories were a reasonably consistent
reach your emotion, right.

337
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,670
I didn't have a big sample.
Hated doing.

338
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,720
So I did publish the results in science,

339
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,860
but they weren't really robust and they
were based really on 30 40 50 feet.

340
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,710
I came back here like,
God I just did or how to crack this,

341
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,800
that by luck I remembered a paper.

342
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:25,801
I read rise apologist for
drop job Dashiell if he had
worked for three and four

343
00:23:27,111 --> 00:23:29,450
year olds,
are they going to have a written by?

344
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,270
So it was his idea.

345
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,860
Where he would do is he read
shogun couple of photographs,

346
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,130
each run of a different emotion.
He was telling of the story,

347
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,560
why are these people is
out to fight friction?

348
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,720
One of these people or
a child who's pitching,

349
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,070
what are these goofballs see brands.

350
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:55,250
And we really liked working with
Christian Arthur. Oh my God, he's,

351
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:01,040
so I went back to New Guinea and I use
that procedure and we got closer jolts

352
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:07,060
shoulder and we got almost
10% of your child culture.

353
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,620
Or of course I went back
the second time they do,

354
00:24:12,621 --> 00:24:16,640
I was just a harmless person
and the word 50 strike,

355
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,010
this was really easy. And I give
them a bar of soap. You're going to

356
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,303
bars,
sir.

357
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:29,060
So people I didn't have
to hike to remote villages

358
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,580
and every morning stood online

359
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,630
basketball and then they were off.

360
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,510
So it was wonderful.

361
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:47,020
Now why formulation is how sure
her VA's even single system.

362
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:55,511
And so it influences exactly what triggers
the emotion and influence is what I

363
00:24:57,951 --> 00:24:59,240
call the spray rules.

364
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,260
The chimps advantage in most instances
it already [inaudible] how are you your

365
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,910
attitudes about having recently,
uh,

366
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,790
edge what you're likely to do?
So it isn't,

367
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,600
this is a response is

368
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,840
culture plays no role what it is,

369
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:26,100
right or wrong overlay on
a universal signal system.

370
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,610
Charles Darwin's word.
Sure.

371
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,513
Oh Man.

372
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,820
So as someone who's been a pioneer and
really understanding human emotion and

373
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:39,480
extent to which it says,

374
00:25:39,481 --> 00:25:44,250
you're saying universal and then having
this veneer of cultural influence above

375
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:48,390
it, where do you see the future
of emotion going from here,

376
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,940
sort of on the horizon?
What's next?

377
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,970
No,
I'm not a good forecast.

378
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,550
I didn't write everything just sort of
dropped into my lap. It isn't, is it hard?

379
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,310
Well,
what's the most important for you?

380
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:07,910
Do you understand the nature of
impression or you have to actually take

381
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:12,620
advantage of opportunities. So it's
really good. Japan with the opportunities,

382
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,120
I believe that we should stop spending
so much time showing people emotion.

383
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:26,070
And Archie measure emotional
behavior and you need to get out.

384
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,690
It's not as if this is
something of term three years.

385
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:31,700
I tried to get people
to go to the funerals.

386
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,960
I never was able to bring just a
student. She had arose. Weddings,

387
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,960
confirmations are all of these type of
situations. Correct. Tense, emotional,

388
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:46,961
just raising sure as well as it
first in the bedroom and the kitchen.

389
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,340
It's harder to get in there,
but still you can.

390
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,060
John Gottman is a friend or colleague
for many years studying marijuana

391
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:02,490
directions where a steady
apples are having trouble. Uh,

392
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,240
he's also studied couples
who are having trouble.

393
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,590
It's not that they don't have
disagreements. Every one of your chapters,

394
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,130
disagreement seat.
Yeah.

395
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,490
Or even very lucky person doesn't mean
you're going to agree with him about

396
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,460
every aspect of how to live your
lives together and separate.

397
00:27:19,461 --> 00:27:22,890
But the issue is how you
handle those disabilities.

398
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,140
Your handles them out.

399
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,933
Uh,

400
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,550
anger your answer anyway.

401
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,613
Harmful.

402
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,670
No, I've developed a new online
tools to try to help people do that.

403
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:39,460
It's called mapping your anger.
Rough law to go through it.

404
00:27:39,461 --> 00:27:41,770
You're just rubber by moving.

405
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:46,771
Spiders are cuter screening the unique
ways in which you experience and how that

406
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,290
differs or ready to
work as it should have.

407
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,990
You can look at each other and
how you perceive each other.

408
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,050
That should be online I April or, right.

409
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,470
Fantastic. I'm sure a lot of couples
will find that a useful tool.

410
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,440
It is. It's fun. Also, if it isn't fun,

411
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:14,860
you're no longer has to be enjoyable.
As it says tedious,

412
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,180
I'm learning vocabulary
or foreign language.

413
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:24,040
That's just memorization.
Really tedious thing. Yeah.

414
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,880
Uh Huh.

415
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,250
Learning about emotion,
raw motivated. Let's take,

416
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,440
we would most likely be able to do

417
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,620
this to be able to chew.

418
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:42,490
What would you be comfortable sharing
about and choose how we behave would be

419
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,870
our approach now. Nature didn't want
you to have either of those choices,

420
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,560
so you respond

421
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:58,540
most people and you respond
not necessarily the way
that it's going to be most

422
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:03,710
useful to this situation.
What's built into you?

423
00:29:03,711 --> 00:29:07,790
What was really useful in
living in a tribal society?

424
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,380
We don't anymore. We live in
very, very different contexts,

425
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:16,500
so, but there are skills. Oh,

426
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,710
did she can learn her.

427
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,220
Describing one of my books were the
exercises and you're actually booger.

428
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:27,110
You'll start to increase
your awareness of emotion.

429
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:32,090
You're having the emotion. Just to realize
afterwards, oh my God, I lost my head.

430
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,400
You say I lost my head.
What are you saying?

431
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,980
You're saying my head
was not really involved.

432
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,400
I wasn't really funny to show my emotions
running the show and I only got in

433
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:44,374
afterwards.

434
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:48,610
Are you willing to give you right
at the beginning you want from her?

435
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,220
Recognize that involves
the trauma emotional and be
able to choose wherever you

436
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:57,790
want to act on Azure and dry.

437
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:02,890
My last [inaudible] who was the Dalai
Lama calls emotional awareness events.

438
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,580
She is awareness.

439
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:13,670
It's early in the episode as you can
and that will require it worked on.

440
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:18,781
It is your dog new exercises and new
brain circuitry that will allow you to

441
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:24,661
monitor what you're actually doing as
you're doing it and you will develop are

442
00:30:24,871 --> 00:30:29,740
what the Buddhists call a watcher part
of yourself that is observing yourself.

443
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,340
Then you're a lot more choice.
This is what we go a lot.

444
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:40,420
So when you talk about learning
emotion and you know twice as well,

445
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:44,630
I mean these are important questions
that students or people in the community

446
00:30:44,631 --> 00:30:48,620
who want to learn more about emotion
might come and ask you about how can I

447
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:52,180
learn more about emotion or what choices
do I have, any emotions I experienced?

448
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:57,181
And what kind of advice do you give people
who come to you asking about how can

449
00:30:57,351 --> 00:31:00,110
I get involved in wanting to study this?
You know,

450
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:04,790
fascinating but complex and sometimes
ambiguous phenomena. That's emotion.

451
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,970
Well,
there's a number of things you could read

452
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,600
their jewels, you get Jake, then
we'll make you a more acute observer.

453
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:22,320
I've just putting another online
training tool that helps you learn how to

454
00:31:22,321 --> 00:31:25,810
respond to what others versus
emotions in the most effective, right?

455
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,720
Cause this is my to know now
you're concealing it. Perfect.

456
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,440
All right, you're not
supposed to work. We're,

457
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,390
how do I respond to
that most effective way?

458
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,240
And this new tool teaches
you how to do that.

459
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:46,700
So we can teach you online
how to recognize the emotion.
Either respond to it,

460
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,020
but what we don't yet have an online,
more water is working on it.

461
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,740
She's here.
Your Phd

462
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:03,860
is developing their momentary
awareness as the impulse psoriasis.

463
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,610
I, for some of us, that's going
to be a really easy for us.

464
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:12,710
You have her brother's gradual slope of
emotional arousal and your others are

465
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:18,270
lucky attack dogs of emotion.
They go from zero to maximum.

466
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,780
That's going to be much harder.
It's paradoxical,

467
00:32:23,781 --> 00:32:28,070
but people need to learn. This is the
most or argued the hardest so far.

468
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,610
He goes, let's go to their
system is fast responding.

469
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:38,300
Didn't say you're merged,
your moderated,

470
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:43,030
so they'll have more chores. Those
are exercises, those exercises.

471
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,233
All right.

472
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:49,870
I like to use the example of chairs or
you can even watch the game of tennis on

473
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,110
TV.
Any sense of it?

474
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,240
If you don't know the rules and you
could read with the rows are 10 or 15

475
00:32:59,241 --> 00:32:59,861
minutes on our,

476
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:03,840
everything you need you to have that
will make you a good observer. Okay?

477
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:09,710
Where'd you won't care it while over in
the hat for that practice and the coach,

478
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:10,943
she's trying

479
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,590
why little copy read their book
shops to drug each that we ever,

480
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,220
or some emotional skills.
It's four days long.

481
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,620
There's a lot of exercising and I practice
jade brown or it's like getting your

482
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,130
GP, you get the ball longer
than that in immersion snaps.

483
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,900
It gives you all the tools you'll need,

484
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:40,180
which if you Virginia to use the really
increasingly have choice about your

485
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:41,534
emotional.

486
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,400
That's what we're really lucky.

487
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:45,531
Well,

488
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:49,580
I mean this has been wonderful speaking
with you as someone who so revered in

489
00:33:49,581 --> 00:33:51,360
the field and I know many,

490
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:55,510
many people including myself were inspired
by when I was first a young student

491
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,700
thinking about, you know, trying
to understand what emotions were.

492
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,480
So I just want to thank you so much
doctor acne for speaking today and being

493
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:03,560
part of this series

494
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,751
pleasure.
You know,

495
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:10,751
I frown that injuries are really enjoyable
is you have a smart interviewer asks

496
00:34:12,031 --> 00:34:15,740
great questions. If you
did, you'd be deadly.

497
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,590
Someone hasn't done their homework or
just know how to ask the questions ready.

498
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:24,230
It's April process, but this,
as you can probably see,

499
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,250
I like talking about this area of work.

500
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,360
Thank you so much.
Um,

501
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:36,160
so this will conclude our experts in
emotion interview with Dr. Paul Ekman from

502
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:40,030
the University of California,
San Francisco and the Paul Ekman Group.
