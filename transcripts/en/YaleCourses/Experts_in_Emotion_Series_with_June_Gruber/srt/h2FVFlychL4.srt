1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,570
As part of our experts in
emotion interview series.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,160
We have the honor of speaking
with doctor John Kasey, Opo. Um,

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,350
he's going to speaking to
us about psychophysiology,

4
00:00:09,351 --> 00:00:13,580
both the scope of psychophysiology and
the promise it bears for emotion research.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,650
So Dr Casio Opo uses a
variety of psychophysiological
methods in his research,

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,750
including Autonomic
Neuroendocrin, Fmri, EEG,

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,260
Erp, as well as quantitative genetics. Um,

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,860
Doctor Casio Opo is the Tiffany and
Margaret Blake distinguished service

9
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:33,380
professor at the University of Chicago.

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,010
He's the director of the University of
Chicago Center for cognitive and social

11

currently in an an associate
editor of social neuroscience.

35
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,040
So I'm very honored to now turn to our
experts and emotion interview with Doctor

36
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:05,890
John Kasey. Yotpo. Welcome John.
Thanks for speaking with us today.

37
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,303
Okay.

38
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,990
That's what I thought we might get started
with is asking you a bit about sort

39
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:13,300
of what first got you
interested in this field,

40
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,520
sort of worded things first begin for you

41
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,330
the assumption that most

42
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,280
rational abrogate luck or economists
aren't interested in predicting individual

43
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:32,860
behavior. They're interested
in predicting the notion.

44
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,440
Boston humans aren't completely rational.
You just a little rational,

45
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,410
but they're randomly irrational when
you some across individuals to a society

46
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,270
level,
you get pure rationality.

47
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,510
But I knew that I was
systematically irrational.

48
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,080
That made me interested in emotions are
and in biological proxies that might be

49
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,670
underlying those emotions.

50
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:57,750
And so that led me from economics
to graduate school in Psychology.

51
00:02:57,751 --> 00:03:02,170
And so I've been interested since I was
700 graduate basically because of the

52
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,990
misinformed assumptions
underlying economics.

53
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,930
Excellent. So irrationality drew
you towards studying emotions,

54
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,150
you an irrational act. But uh,
but one that I'm happy with.

55
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,320
So I'd love to move on to ask you some
questions about your research now.

56
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:20,740
So I mean you are widely known for really,
you know,

57
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:24,100
playing this pivotal role in founding
the field of social neuroscience,

58
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:28,570
which is devoted to trying to understand
social processes, including emotion,

59
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,620
you know, through the lens of
these different physiological
tools. And you know,

60
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:34,090
as the pioneer of this field,

61
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:38,080
I wonder what you see as some of the most
exciting discoveries that have emerged

62
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,610
from social neuroscience.

63
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,630
Science is a,

64
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,290
a really interesting and unique
perspective to them and it's always,

65
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,940
it's always struck me that we're
fundamentally social animals and we're

66
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:51,750
fundamentally biologic class.

67
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,610
And when I first started
working in the field,

68
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,140
social and biological perspectives
were actually quite divided.

69
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,870
Uh,
my phd mentor friends,

70
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,130
instead of be persistent on
pursuing this biological approach,

71
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,390
I won't help you get a job.

72
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,420
It was active antagonists and the
neuroscience courses I was in at lab,

73
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,710
I worked in [inaudible] for social
factors were irrelevant because there were

74
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:20,180
recent evolutionary developments.

75
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,170
They on real basic implication for
structural function, even if they were,

76
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:28,150
they were too complicated to
understand, so not worth studying. Uh,

77
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,330
and it,

78
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,170
it just seemed obvious that the
comprehensive explanation is required both

79
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:38,171
perspectives and they required both
perspectives because behavior emotions are

80
00:04:38,331 --> 00:04:42,290
complicated. By complicated, I mean
that they have multiple causes.

81
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,630
I might eat because I'm hungry.
Biologic cost I might eat because Uri,

82
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,780
because people around me are eating
or be conscious of the time of day,

83
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,860
more social costs. Oh, cultural causes.

84
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,630
And so if we're going to have come
up with comprehensive explanations,

85
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,460
we can't rule out half of the
causes is irrelevant. And so that,

86
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:05,060
that was something that attracted me
early. And of course we're all Mona's,

87
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,070
we're all the terminus
and Mona says scientists.

88
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:11,120
So if we're going to understand these
processes are an important avenue for

89
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:13,540
understanding these psychological
and social processes,

90
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,190
do you see is through the material based
through which they express themselves

91
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,290
and clearly work on emotion system as
advanced because we paid attention the

92
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,930
biological mechanisms which
emotions are expressed?

93
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,380
Oh, I couldn't agree
more with you. I mean,

94
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:29,200
I think some of the most
fundamental discoveries especially,

95
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:32,350
you know in the past decade has been
through understanding biological,

96
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:34,420
like you're saying
processes and mechanisms.

97
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,500
One of the, uh, yesterday dances,

98
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,140
one of the interesting advances are it's
just how important simple connections

99
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:44,300
are.
We,

100
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,810
we started looking at social isolation
because when we first used the term

101
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:52,490
social neuroscience 20 years ago, um, I,

102
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,650
in the very first draft of the
manuscript in which I wrote that term,

103
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,670
I put the term and I put a color man,

104
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,240
put an oxymoron question mark because
I knew that my neuroscience colleagues

105
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:07,010
would say these two terms just
don't fit together. But in fact,

106
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,110
social organisms, social species, by
definition, creates support. I mean,

107
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:11,990
there's four structures.

108
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,360
Those structures evolve because
they help those individuals survive,

109
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,790
reproduce,
and care for their offspring long enough.

110
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:24,791
But they have a genetic legacy and those
structures have genetic say that our

111
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:28,910
neural hormonal mechanisms
that support that.

112
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,360
So we'll work on prefontal cortex or
on a mid to lower on oxytocin or all

113
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,590
samples of biological or targets that
we've now found to be instrumental in

114
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,050
construction or maintenance
of these sorts of factors.

115
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,150
If you look at any social
mammal human down to in Burger,

116
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:49,700
it's Blackburn's in fruit flies,
any social animal of its isolated,

117
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,780
they die at earlier when isolated them,

118
00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:53,060
when they're allowed to live in the group.

119
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,800
So there's something really interesting
going on about those connections we just

120
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:00,770
take for granted because we
live in that if you will,

121
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,550
global environment as part
of our everyday exist.

122
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,060
So it seems invisible because
it's unchanging from our
perspective. And I mean,

123
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:08,350
yeah,

124
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,310
big part of your work that you were
just talking about is really, you know,

125
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,520
looking at the role that things like
loneliness or social isolation can impact

126
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:19,210
and, and play on our physiological
responses. And I just wondered, you know,

127
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:22,660
what you think and your work has spoken
to if the implications this might have

128
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:25,210
for both our physical
and mental wellbeing.

129
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:25,871
Well,

130
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:30,290
we've actually been doing longitudinal
research and experiments to examine that

131
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,970
when we're looking at short term effects,
like whether it makes you sad.

132
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:37,960
We do experiments and indeed if I
make you feel isolated you get sadder.

133
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,350
But we've also looked
longitudinally using cross panels,

134
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:45,690
fretful equation models to rule
out alternative interpretations.

135
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:50,110
And what we find is when you, uh,
for whatever reason become only your,

136
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:55,030
over time you actually become more
depressed as a result of a feeling lonely.

137
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,540
We've ruled out social sport,

138
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,790
our objective stressors
or perceived stressors or
hostility or a number of other

139
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,010
alternative interpretations
for that effect.

140
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,350
So it really looks like
the lonelier you get,

141
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,230
the more depressed you're likely
to get your at risk for that.

142
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,480
And the other direction.

143
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:15,130
Being depressed doesn't necessarily
impact a tendency for you to become an on

144
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,330
there. It seems to be driven by
loneliness making you more depressed.

145
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,990
Interesting. And I know you've also
done some work showing that it uh,

146
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,670
loneliness also impacts just
some of our most basic, you know,

147
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:28,200
physical health functioning.

148
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,840
We've shown everything unless you show
higher levels of cortisol in the morning

149
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,770
and then you show ladder diurnal
cycles of cortisol, the stress hormone.

150
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,150
And that's the case both when we
look across p Oh and when we look

151
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:45,310
longitudinally, but then a person
looking at the same cross legs,

152
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,370
Russia equation modeling approach.
As I mentioned,

153
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,820
we're looking at depression the moment
that seems to also increase if you both a

154
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,640
height limit, but Twitter, adrenal
cortical access, it's very stress system.

155
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,420
Interestingly, it doesn't affect
the stress systems writ large.

156
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,730
We don't get increased
sympathetic activity,

157
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:06,510
generally we don't get increased catechol
and one or JV sympathetic Katrina

158
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:07,620
mentioned already activity.

159
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,680
It's really seemed to be of
us favor in the HPA axis.

160
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,590
So that's something that's
not exactly a stress response,

161
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:18,270
but a more specific if you will,

162
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:23,271
metabolic response to the dangers of
finding yourself as a member of a social

163
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:26,520
species.
But in an isolated context

164
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,460
mean what's really fascinating here
is you've established all these robust

165
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:33,430
affects, you know, looking
at loneliness for example,

166
00:09:33,431 --> 00:09:37,450
and its impact on different physiological
parameters that relate to our mental

167
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,800
and physical health wellbeing.
And at this point, I mean,

168
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,500
I feel like social neuroscience has just
grown and blossomed as a really strong

169
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:49,000
field. What do you see moving forward is
some of the biggest challenges it faces?

170
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:49,820
Okay.

171
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,960
Uh, it's a great time to be a
social neuroscientist. They,

172
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,310
what we've seen him at the last couple
of decades is that a real gravitation to

173
00:09:57,311 --> 00:10:00,250
more important question sees
these complicated questions.

174
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,480
Both of us social scientists
and neuroscientists
required either just a very

175
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,360
molecular analysis. By
molecular, I mean in,

176
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,800
in the neuroscience side,
literally a molecular approach.
And the social science,

177
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:17,200
I mean, uh, an isolated approach.

178
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:20,380
And that we would only consider the
situational factors because those were

179
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:21,840
something we can do something about.

180
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,600
Now we're understanding that you
fully understand how situations impact

181
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:26,434
individuals.

182
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,360
We need to understand something about
the brains of those individuals and how

183
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,860
those brains are collectively
influencing one another.

184
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,390
And so this social neuroscience
approaches being used globally, um, we've,

185
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:41,710
we traveled a good bit. We
have collaborations and Latin
American nation, Europe,

186
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,930
and we see this approach really big,

187
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,530
used to take on a number of social
problems around the world. And so I,

188
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,700
there isn't a interesting question
that's being asked that was social

189
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,720
neuroscience approach might tell us
something about all of the global problems

190
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:59,980
that we're facing. A fundamental a
here left and all the social problems.

191
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:04,981
And so it's being used increasingly to
try to improve the world we live in,

192
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,430
in the coming decades.

193
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,340
So it sounds like right now for those
who may be interested in embarking and

194
00:11:10,341 --> 00:11:14,270
social neuroscience, it's just
this burgeoning time get on board.

195
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,360
That's right.
Like interesting and complex questions.

196
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:19,380
It's definitely be approached to consider.
Okay.

197
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,790
I mean, in speaking of complexity,
I mean your work, you know,

198
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:27,170
has impressively drawn from this diverse
range of physiological parameters

199
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:29,240
ranging from Fmr, I. E, g,

200
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,960
e r p neuroendocrine response
and quantitative genetics,

201
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,740
and taking this really impressive
kind of multimodal approach.

202
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,700
What do you see at this point is some
of the most effective tools in your own

203
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,010
work for studying emotion per se?

204
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,800
I, the breeding the chick is clearly a,
a development that gives us great, uh,

205
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,140
a greater grip on what
I'm bringing processes,

206
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,530
response to these social
structures and social challenges.

207
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,890
And so we're doing more of it that
we're increasingly using both electrical

208
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,450
neuroimaging procedures that give you
spatial and temporal information and,

209
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,980
and the functional brain
imaging metabolic procedures,

210
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,930
but the quantitative genetics,

211
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:15,260
the epigenetics is really quite exciting
and it's something that we showed a

212
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,650
couple of years ago.
Then they feeling isolated,

213
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,060
connect to affect which
genes are turned on and off.

214
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:22,390
We've replicated and extended
that finding and, and in fact,

215
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,210
contrary to what most thought 40,
50 years ago,

216
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,890
it's the oldest cells that are active
in modulating the social environment.

217
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,140
I in a way that makes perfect sense.
Bacteria were the first, uh, uh,

218
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,180
pathogens on the immune system,

219
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:40,840
a mock balled the oldest
cells that community a ball
to protect against bacteria

220
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,040
and is in fact those cells that are most
sensitive to your social environment

221
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,420
changes in the social environment.

222
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:49,790
So these genes are being turned on
off to help protect you against, uh,

223
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,290
the differences in packages to which
you're likely to be exposed if you're

224
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:58,060
around others and an half
I'm social circumstances or
if you're around others in

225
00:12:58,061 --> 00:12:59,710
a hostel social circumstance.

226
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,130
That's really fascinating.
I mean, so you know,

227
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:06,220
you think about all these complex tools
and the ones that are likely to bear

228
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:09,400
some of the most fascinating implications
right now for understanding social

229
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:12,880
processes. What do you see
as some of the sort of, um,

230
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,140
kind of next critical a methodological
next steps in this field?

231
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,720
What are the tools that we
need but we don't yet have?

232
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,620
I think it's really the perspective
going down from the molecular to the

233
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,510
cultural, all those levels together.
And those, those titles are large,

234
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:32,480
the computational tools.
And so for instance,

235
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:37,130
one of the things in which we're working
is with the high performance computing

236
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:38,990
when you used to be called
supercomputing center.

237
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,790
So then we're able to bring more
computational power to looking at these

238
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:48,140
mechanisms both within most of
organization but also understanding the

239
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:50,930
mechanisms linking across
the levels of organization.

240
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,010
That's partly what I
think is important and uh,

241
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,990
we'll be real opportunities in the future.
A second,

242
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,990
interestingly enough is
conceptual philosophical.

243
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,120
There are simply, um, philosophical,

244
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,410
um,

245
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,410
obstacles still to how we're
making progress on a brain
image can be incredibly

246
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:17,390
compelling in terms of its appearance.
But it's fundamentally correlation.

247
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:22,460
And there had been far too many
conclusions drawn policies,

248
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,780
established publications and high profile
science journals because the images

249
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,680
appeared to be so compelling rather
than the logic experimental design.

250
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,850
And so there's,

251
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:36,830
there's work in that domain about how
do we go about making these translations

252
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:39,760
of specific mechanisms
across lots of organization.

253
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,700
And that in part is greater
computational part. And part,

254
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,910
how are we using that computational power
to gain the greatest leverage on the

255
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:50,480
questions that are being asked.

256
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:54,710
So we also working with some philosophers
of science on just basic inferential

257
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:57,560
structure underlying this
kind of scientific approach.

258
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,881
It's fascinating.

259
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:02,810
I mean when you think about then where
sort of the face of the future's headed

260
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:05,960
when we think about social neuroscience
and how it can inform emotion.

261
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,140
You've already talked about a lot of
really important steps of looking across

262
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,320
multiple levels of bringing in people
from different disciplines like you know,

263
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:16,280
philosophers of science to sort of have
them bring their own sort of analytic

264
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:20,060
tools to bear. Where do you see
them, the face of the future headed?

265
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:21,170
Is this where we're going?

266
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,070
Oh, that's great question.
When I started, yeah,

267
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,040
I did research and
built my own electrodes.

268
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:30,820
We did everything ourselves in
our laboratories. That period,

269
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,580
uh, is a little bit like when we
think about yesterday, you're,

270
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,520
it's kind of a fun memory, but it's not
something that we're likely to return to.

271
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,560
The question seven are not being asked
are sufficiently complicated and they go

272
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:49,510
across enough disciplinary fields that
increasingly we're seeing scientific

273
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:52,060
teams very much like when
I was just describing.

274
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:56,830
So the study of motion in it's full
of flavor requires a lot of different

275
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:57,431
perspectives,

276
00:15:57,431 --> 00:16:01,330
a lot of different disciplinary expertise
and no single individual can have the

277
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:04,510
kind of expertise that's necessary
across all those disciplines.

278
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,620
So increasingly what I see or scientific
teams coming together that are

279
00:16:08,621 --> 00:16:11,230
interdisciplinary in
nature and the duck tab,

280
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,260
a leader and everybody else's,
the follower,

281
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,350
if you and I represent to dis the men,
are you catching her teeth?

282
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,440
And we're going to work in a synergistic
fashion. I can't be the leader.

283
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,990
You're the follower. We both are
going to argue. We're both bands,

284
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,000
the intersection and
our parent disciplines.

285
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,170
And in so doing we're going to transform
out. Each of us think about the problem.

286
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,660
And so I think are also mean ass,
um,

287
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,710
administrators as grant funding agencies
and entities think about scientific

288
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:44,550
awards. We need to stop
asking for who's the leader,

289
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,290
who's the author of this publication,

290
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:52,291
but rather to what extent was it a
synergistic output of a collective group?

291
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,290
To what extent was everybody a leader?
Is everybody responsible?

292
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:59,410
If you and I are producing more than
a hundred percent that's perfectly

293
00:16:59,411 --> 00:17:00,880
plausible through synergist and stuff.

294
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:05,500
Neither one can take credit for even their
portion because it's a product of the

295
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:09,880
interaction and that's something I think
that we need to try to build in those

296
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:14,110
sites to be teams and we need trying
to try to reward the next generation of

297
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:16,200
scientists aren't faced
with the obstacles.

298
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,660
That partly just one big evaluated
for tenure and promotions.

299
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:20,711
I mean,

300
00:17:20,711 --> 00:17:23,920
I couldn't agree more and I think really
thinking more about the collective as

301
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:25,330
you're saying as opposed
to the individual.

302
00:17:25,331 --> 00:17:27,670
I mean that's going to make
better science altogether.

303
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,540
That's right.

304
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,980
It allows us to ask these more complicated
questions and very sophisticated

305
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:36,970
fashion rather than pretending that we
act to have all the expertise needed or

306
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,580
Archie the question in a way that we
can answer it, but calling it the whole,

307
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:42,820
when we're only looking at a
very small passionate problem.

308
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,070
So then when you think about,
you know,

309
00:17:45,071 --> 00:17:47,350
students who are going to
be a big part of, you know,

310
00:17:47,351 --> 00:17:49,150
making the future of the field,
you know,

311
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,650
as it moves forward and you have
students come to you asking for advice,

312
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:54,840
you know, they're thinking
about embarking in this field.

313
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,840
What kind of advice do you
typically give students?

314
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,980
Well,
the common core

315
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:07,410
and the answer I give is becoming
an expert in a dish. And first,

316
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:12,730
I mean I don't think students understand
that will spend 40 to 50 years.

317
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,330
I have four, five, six
years for Grad School,

318
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:22,940
maybe of York two on post doc, then six
years for tenure and then my career set,

319
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,760
they're still very, very early.
It's Brown, all of that very,

320
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,500
very early in their career. And
as you both know, as a faculty,

321
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:35,070
you never stop learning. As a scientist,
you're always learning something new.

322
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:39,750
And so you can't contribute meaningfully
to an interdisciplinary team if you

323
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:44,220
have no disciplinary expertise.
So it's to learn the discipline well,

324
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,300
but recognize the importance of
related disciplines. You know, we can,

325
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,040
sonics is a collective effort.
It's not a solitary inch across.

326
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:57,060
I think we really need to appreciate if
we can work and talk to other scientists,

327
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,860
they can be your best tutors. You can
be their students, they're your student.

328
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:04,710
And together over time you
acquire more and more expertise,

329
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,480
but you don't use syrup the experts
in a privileged position within that

330
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,230
collective team. And I think
that's, that's the way to
become interdisciplinary.

331
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:14,850
It's an awareness of its importance,

332
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,280
a humble nuts about what you know and
what you can know and a willingness to

333
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:21,480
learn from others.

334
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,640
Well thank you so much. This was a
great opportunity to speak with you.

335
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:29,000
And I think that's some of the best
advice a student could have, you know,

336
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:33,680
sort of recognizing their own role that
they can play, but seeing themselves as,

337
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,430
you know, sort of in a very humbling
way, part of a bigger mission and group.

338
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,160
Thank you. It's been a real
pleasure. Thank you so much.

339
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:44,870
So this concludes our experts in emotion
interview with Doctor John Cassiopeia

340
00:19:44,871 --> 00:19:49,130
from the University of Chicago. Thanks
again for speaking today. Thank you.
