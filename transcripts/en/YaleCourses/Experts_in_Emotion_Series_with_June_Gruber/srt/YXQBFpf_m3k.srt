1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,170
For experts in emotion interview.

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:06,950
We'll be speaking with Dr. David
Watson on personality and emotion.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,250
Dr. Watson is the Andrew Mckenna
family professor of psychology at the

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,130
University of Notre Dame,

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,970
Dr. Watson as a personality psychologist
with particular expertise in

6
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:18,110
personality assessment.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,620
His work investigates the structure
and measurement of personality,

8
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:25,940
mood and psychopathology as well as
examining how personality traits relate to

9
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:27,050
clinical disorders.

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,450
He works in a variety of substantive
areas within psychopathology,

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,430
including depression and the anxiety
disorders, personality disorders, skizzy,

12
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:37,700
tippy,
and the sleep and associated disorders.

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,780
The longterm goal of his work
is to develop comprehensive
taxonomic models that

14
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:46,400
integrate normal range and pathological
processes into a single overarching

15
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:51,200
scheme. Dr. Watson has published more
than 100 articles in the top journals in

16
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:54,770
psychology, including the Journal of
personality and Social Psychology,

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,360
the journal of abnormal psychology,

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,500
psychological bulletin and psychological
assessment and he's currently serves as

19
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:03,230
editor and chief of the
Journal of abnormal psychology.

20
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,760
So I now turn to a very special experts
and emotion interview with Dr. David

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,860
Watson on personality and emotion.

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,890
So I want to thank you for
speaking with us today. David,

23
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,380
welcome.
Thanks for having me.

24
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,373
Fantastic.

25
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,850
So one of the questions I wanted to start
a asking you was really where this all

26
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:26,470
began for you. So what first sparked
your interest in, got you. You know,

27
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:29,350
started in studying processes of emotion.

28
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,950
Oh, well, I don't know if my
answer is typical or atypical, uh,

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,800
but it's was completely
serendipitous. So, uh,

30
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,870
the backstory is my future wife got a
Fulbright fellowship to study in Japan,

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,520
uh, and I wanted to go with her.
So I was talking to Alcatel Hogan,

32
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:54,600
who was my graduate advisor,
uh, and he said, well,

33
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:58,470
if you're going into the Japan, why
don't you do a mood study over in Japan?

34
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,600
And I said, okay. That became
my dissertation. So, uh,

35
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,660
as part of this, I started
reading up on the mood literature,

36
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:11,360
which was actually pretty small
back then. And I really, you know,

37
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,300
I fell in love with it,

38
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,500
but I can't say before that I
had the slightest interest in it.

39
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,770
Hmm.

40
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,290
I never would have
anticipated going into it.

41
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,610
So it's one of those serendipitous
discoveries into the world of emotion.

42
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,850
Yeah. And, and you know, the world
was very different back then. Uh,

43
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,830
there was not much of an
emotional literature. Uh,

44
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:35,510
the mood literature was quite small. I
really mastered it, I would say in a week.

45
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,650
Hmm.

46
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,210
Um, it was, it was not, it was not the
golden age of emotion research back then.

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,540
Do you know what sort of
kept your attention going in,

48
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,180
in the world of emotion and
mood once you got hooked?

49
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,020
Well, the thing I liked about it
was that it was so pliable. I mean,

50
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:57,760
you could, uh, you know, you could study
biological processes, you could study,

51
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,300
like facial expressions,
could study situational factors.

52
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:05,530
So in some of our early work, we
looked at exercise, social activity,

53
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:09,290
caffeine, uh, weather variables. Uh,

54
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,780
it had obvious connections
to psychopathology. And
then, you know, finally,

55
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,790
of course it was related to personality.
So, you know, I think it was, uh,

56
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,650
it was really an expansive topic.
What did,

57
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,580
which you could take in a lot of
different directions rather than being

58
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:28,540
restrictive. And you know, back then it
seemed like it was completely wide open.

59
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,960
I mean you, you know, there was so
little research that was done, uh,

60
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,480
than almost anything you
did, uh, was innovative.

61
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,890
Hmm. That's so interesting. So I mean,

62
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,420
since then you've done just a wide number
of innovative things and actually had

63
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,010
trouble finding just,
you know,

64
00:03:43,011 --> 00:03:46,580
one small cluster of questions I could
ask you about because there's just so

65
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:49,490
many things on, could talk
with you about. Um, the,

66
00:03:49,491 --> 00:03:53,540
one of the things I thought I might start
by asking you about is just about your

67
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:57,890
work. Um, so you're widely known for your
influential work on the development and

68
00:03:57,891 --> 00:03:59,330
assessment of personality.

69
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,670
And I wondered how you think research
on aspect and emotion can improve our

70
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:08,030
understanding of variation
in personality traits?

71
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,720
Well, I think in a, in a couple of
ways. So first of all, what, uh,

72
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:17,720
when people started doing research
on an affect and emotion, uh,

73
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,940
I think the conventional wisdom was that
most personality did not have much to

74
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:25,980
do with emotion.
I think going back to Isaac,

75
00:04:25,981 --> 00:04:30,390
most people thought that neuroticism
was about negative emotion. Uh,

76
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,350
but if you read about traits such as
conscientiousness and extraversion,

77
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,110
um,
the,

78
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,070
the focus was on cognitive behavioral
processes, social processes,

79
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:42,480
not emotional processes.

80
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,910
So I think the emotion research is
fundamentally changed the way that we've,

81
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,690
we view these traits, I
think. But in terms of, uh,

82
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,520
the major traits or personality,

83
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:57,510
maybe something like intellect or
openness doesn't have a strong emotional

84
00:04:57,511 --> 00:05:02,010
component, but pretty much everything else
does. Uh, and so I, and I think this is,

85
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,630
this has really changed the way
that we view personality traits. Uh,

86
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:09,540
when I started in the field in the 1970s,

87
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:14,310
the field was primarily
descriptive. Um, and now, uh,

88
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:16,530
I think linking personality too,

89
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:21,531
emotional research has also clarified
the biological bases for these things.

90
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:24,420
I mean, you know, uh, inhibition system,

91
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:27,270
the approach system and how they're
related to traits like neuroticism,

92
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,920
extraversion.
Uh,

93
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:33,120
I think the next generation of research
is going to be to try to understand, uh,

94
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,650
their particular emotional signatures
of different traits. So, uh,

95
00:05:37,651 --> 00:05:41,800
I think one of the challenges we're
working on in my lab right now, uh,

96
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,820
is conscientiousness as a personality
trait has surprisingly strong connections

97
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:50,190
to depression and the anxiety disorders.

98
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,870
And I suspect a lot of that again,
is emotionally based,

99
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:56,960
but we really don't understand
that very well right now. Hmm. Mm.

100
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:57,980
How do

101
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,670
you think we might use some of this
information to better inform our clinical

102
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:03,950
assessment of personality disorders?

103
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,170
Well, personality disorders, uh, I think
offers some interesting challenges,

104
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,640
um, particularly, uh, in the
assessment of positive emotion.

105
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,950
I think because,
uh,

106
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,750
you have disorders such as
avoidant personality disorder,

107
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,340
a borderline that seemed to be
associated with deficits in positive

108
00:06:26,341 --> 00:06:29,480
emotionality, but then there's
good evidence that, uh,

109
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,660
there are the disorders such as
narcissistic personality disorder,

110
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:37,530
Histrionic personality disorder that are
associated with elevated positive mode.

111
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,830
And in fact, when you
start looking at, uh, uh,

112
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,960
specific aspects of personality
disorders, um, many, uh,

113
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,370
aspects of the related to
positive emotionality and
extroversion actually can go

114
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:54,210
both ways.
So you have people who are dependent,

115
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,390
overly dependent on
others, uh, who, uh, are,

116
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,820
are, have, are more,

117
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,580
almost clingy and dependent
on other people, uh,

118
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:08,820
that are afraid of being abandoned.

119
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:12,160
And then you have people
who are extremely aloof, um,

120
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,700
and our colon and
different to other people.

121
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,710
So I think that dimension in
particular has a lot of potential for

122
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:24,030
differentiating different types of
clinical conditions and you know,

123
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,960
and try to figure out, you know, why,
why we see such wide ranges in behavior.

124
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,180
Yeah,

125
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,560
that's fascinating.
I mean,

126
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,250
one of the other things about your work
that I found particularly exciting is

127
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:39,251
that you've also scientifically
demonstrated how we can
use measures of positive

128
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:42,920
and negative effect to
differentiate among, you know,

129
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,440
anxiety and mood disorders,
um,

130
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:48,050
in ways that we just didn't
understand previously.

131
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,800
And I wondered if you could just say a
bit more about what you found to be some

132
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:55,430
of the most important or
exciting discoveries here.

133
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,830
Well, probably our first major
discovery was in the area of depression,

134
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,800
uh, which, which seems to be,

135
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,470
we've now looked at a
wide range of disorders,

136
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:08,540
not everything but a
wide range of disorders.

137
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,960
And depression seems to be associated
with a particularly strong deficits in

138
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:19,490
positive emotionality.
And an extreme case is it seems to be a,

139
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:24,110
an inability to experience normal
levels of positive emotion,

140
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,240
uh, and just really
differentiates, uh, depression, uh,

141
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:33,440
from some other disorders,
even a disorders such as
generalized anxiety disorder,

142
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:37,280
which is strongly Comorbid with
it and strongly related to it. Uh,

143
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,910
and I think one of the things that's
striking from some of our recent symptom

144
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:45,911
work is that a positive
emotionality is actually a better,

145
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,920
more specific symptom of depression,

146
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,420
even though it's not part of the
formal symptom criteria for depression.

147
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,790
Then many of the current depression
symptoms are, so for example,

148
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:00,750
insomnia tends to be a
more nonspecific symptom,

149
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:04,830
which is pervasive in
clinical populations. Uh,

150
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,930
so it's an interesting system as symptom,

151
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:10,100
but it doesn't really differentiate a
depression from other consortia. So I,

152
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,360
you know, I've been writing
about this in recent years.

153
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:17,190
I think the implication is that we need
to be building a positive emotionality

154
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:19,430
criteria into more clinical syndromes.

155
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,770
I think that we're really would
improve diagnosis and assessment.

156
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,930
And I wanted to ask you a bit about that.

157
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,320
So in what ways do you think we
can leverage this information,

158
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:32,010
especially related to positive effect
as you just pointed out in the case of

159
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,680
depression? Um, to aid in, you know,

160
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,630
differential diagnosis or developing and
refining treatment interventions that

161
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:43,080
are really focused on these, you
know, aspect related symptoms?

162
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,723
Yeah, well, you know,

163
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,220
having studied a diagnosis and
assessment for a number of years in,

164
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,940
in some ways it's impressive,
but I,

165
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:55,330
I think that a clinical
assessment is biased yeah. Uh,

166
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,520
toward,
uh,

167
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:01,090
an assessment terms towards convergent
validity or if you prefer to posit toward

168
00:10:01,091 --> 00:10:03,640
positive symptoms. So I think, uh,

169
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,700
clinicians have been very
adept at identifying problems
that patients complain

170
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:13,930
about. Um, you know, so they can't sleep,

171
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:17,260
they're having trouble
eating, they're unhappy. Uh,

172
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,410
but I think they've
underrepresented deficits,

173
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:24,870
so things that should be there
but aren't, and quite often, uh,

174
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,120
positives about positive emotional
symptoms, symptoms are related to that.

175
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:30,760
So when we don't,
we don't see normal levels of happiness,

176
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:32,530
we don't see normal levels of engagement.

177
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,690
Those types of symptoms seem to be
underrepresented. Uh, and I think that,

178
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,560
uh,

179
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,560
clinicians in diagnostic criteria tend
to under represent a more specific

180
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,640
symptoms. So I quite
often they overweight, uh,

181
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,070
problems and symptoms that are common
to all kinds of conditions. Um,

182
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,691
and so again,

183
00:10:52,691 --> 00:10:57,691
I think that's why the positive system
is particularly interesting because you

184
00:10:57,821 --> 00:11:00,070
see the large deficits in some disorders,

185
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,250
a few deficits in many disorders,

186
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:07,480
and then you see elevations in positive
and so like excessive approach behavior,

187
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,150
overconfidence, uh, in other conditions.

188
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,250
Well this relates to the last question
I wanted to ask you about your work. Um,

189
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,840
so as you're saying,

190
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:20,100
a lot of your recent work has focused on
the assessment of positive emotionality

191
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,400
using the eye das to scale and how it
relates both to personality on the one

192
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:28,470
hand and psychopathology.
On the other hand,

193
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,970
and I wonder if you could tell us a bit
more about the specificity of positive

194
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:35,610
emotion dysfunction that you've
been showing in your work,

195
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,900
especially since this is
really a relatively new
field to begin to sort of on

196
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,930
earth in the realm of
both, you know, emotion,

197
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:46,920
just studying positive emotion more
generally and applying it clinically.

198
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:51,810
We know almost nothing about positive
emotion and how it tells us about unique

199
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,220
features of different
psychological disorders.

200
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,650
Yeah. So then that's another
serendipitous finding. I,

201
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:02,651
I kind of got dragged into the assessment
of a excessive positive emotionality,

202
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:07,740
particularly in the context of a
bipolar symptoms of bipolar disorder.

203
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,250
Uh, it does, I wouldn't,

204
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,740
I would not say it's completely
specific to bipolar disorder.

205
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:18,480
They seem to be a similar elevations
in narcissism, for example.

206
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,490
Uh, but the specificity is,
is really remarkable. Um,

207
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,040
we're still struggling to understand
that because in some cases we have

208
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,170
measures, we've developed symptom
measures that seem to be similar. Uh,

209
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,600
empirically they're correlated
with each other. Uh,

210
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:41,601
and yet one measure shows deficits and
depression and other one shows elevations

211
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:47,340
in mania. So what exactly
differentiates the two from each other?

212
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,570
Uh, you know, we, we've developed some
hypotheses. We're getting some data.

213
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,530
It seems that, uh, in, uh,

214
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,470
disorders that are associated
with elevated positive
mood seem to be associated

215
00:12:58,471 --> 00:13:00,670
with excessive activation,
uh,

216
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,830
with overconfidence that leads
to impulsivity and recklessness.

217
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,850
Um,

218
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,720
but I think we have a long way to go to
figure out exactly what differentiates

219
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:13,650
that, you know, from more normal
adaptive forms of positive aspect.

220
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,410
And that's what I was going to ask you.

221
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:19,580
Do you think there's any glimmers of
ways in which we can use this scale?

222
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:22,550
The I'd to, to try to
tease apart, you know,

223
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:26,870
more maladaptive from adaptive
variations of normal, positive mood?

224
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,380
Are there ways that we can look forward
to try to make those rarely difficult

225
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:31,250
distinctions?

226
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,150
Uh, yeah. I, I think, uh, right now worse,

227
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,240
we're stymied to some extent by
limitations in our thinking and in our

228
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:41,880
assessment approach.
So again, we, you know,

229
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:45,390
we didn't necessarily
expect these things. So, uh,

230
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,890
one of the things we're trying to
do now is just to understand, um,

231
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,300
the specific type of positive
mood that's, that's, uh,

232
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,880
elevated in, um, for example,

233
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:59,430
bipolar disorder in general,

234
00:13:59,431 --> 00:14:03,720
one of the problems that you face in
studying positive mood is going back to

235
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:04,554
Darwin.

236
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,300
They're well developed classification
systems for negative mood. I mean,

237
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,030
if you were to ask emotion theorists,
everyone would recognize anger.

238
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,260
They would recognize fear and
they wouldn't recognize discussed.

239
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,910
But when you get into positive emotions,
we don't really have a good taxonomy,

240
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:25,590
a good classification system. Uh,
people talk about amusement, joy,

241
00:14:25,591 --> 00:14:30,400
interest, curiosity,
energy, vigor. I mean, um,

242
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,470
what are the basic positive
emotional states and how
they differ from each other.

243
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,830
I think that's going to be part of the
next generation is to figure out what's

244
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:38,664
going on there.

245
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,500
So thinking ahead then
about the next generation,

246
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:46,190
where do you see the future of emotion,
emotion research headed at this point?

247
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:52,170
Well, speaking for myself, I,
I think what we're seeing and,

248
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:56,690
and uh, I think this is going
to be the wave of the future,

249
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,540
uh,
is just complete integration.

250
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,050
So I'm asked to write a number of,
you know,

251
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,620
chapters and papers on
personality and emotion,

252
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,280
personality and psychopathology.
Uh,

253
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,200
but I think we're reaching the point
where you can't do this x and y kind of

254
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:19,340
thing, that they're all part of
the same systems. So what one week?

255
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,320
When I think of psychopathology,

256
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:25,010
I think primarily in terms of emotional
dysfunction, that's not all of it,

257
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,770
but that's a lot of it.
When I think of personality,

258
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:32,000
I think the variations and
emotional processes, when I study,

259
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,930
affect and emotion, there's obviously
very strong dispositional component to it.

260
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,320
Um, and I, you know,
integrating these things,

261
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:42,470
particularly in a biological context,
uh,

262
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:46,250
is going to be a crucial, uh, funding.

263
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:50,510
Now through an Imh, uh,
there are doc, um, system.

264
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,170
I think it's an explicit recognition of
this. Uh, so they're, you know, uh, and,

265
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,250
and Imh is moving away from a DSM
diagnostic categories and more in terms of

266
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:05,090
these underlying bio
emotional behavioral systems.

267
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,510
So I think integration,
full integration is the next step.

268
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,470
And a lot of the next step of course
involves not just current researchers in

269
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:18,190
the field, but also students who are
training to become the next generation.

270
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,510
And so when students your own or
others come to you and ask for advice,

271
00:16:22,511 --> 00:16:26,200
sort of where, where should they
be putting their time and energy,

272
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:27,910
or what should they be focusing on?

273
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,630
What kind of advice do you have for
students just embarking in the study of

274
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:32,464
emotion?

275
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,550
No, I'm not sure. I'm very
good at giving advice. Um,

276
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,130
my advice is to, uh, is to,

277
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,320
is to find whatever is interesting to you,
uh,

278
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,070
and pursue that. Uh, I think my,

279
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,900
my career is somewhat different from many
of my contemporaries and that I really

280
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:56,530
resisted doing one type of thing.
Um,

281
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,640
I started out primarily as a mood
researcher. I did some clinical research.

282
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:04,870
I did some personality research,
uh, within the clinical world.

283
00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:08,740
I studied probably a wider range of
disorders and just about anybody.

284
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,930
Um, but I, I follow, you know,
I just try to solve problems,

285
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,960
uh, that interest may,
and, uh, one of the,

286
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,700
I've gotten a lot of mileage
out of revisiting, uh,

287
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:27,150
areas and issues and realizing that I
was stymied at some point that I couldn't

288
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:34,621
figure out an answer to something and
that motivates me to continue on it.

289
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,970
And, um, I, at times I resist this. I say,

290
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,650
I can't solve this problem,
but eventually I go back to it.

291
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,120
And why can't I solve this problem? You
know, why are things the way they are?

292
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,250
That's about all the advice I can give.

293
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,520
That's really good advice.

294
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:55,230
Thank you so much for the advice and
