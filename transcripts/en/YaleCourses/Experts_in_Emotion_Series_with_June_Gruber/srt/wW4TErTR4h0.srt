1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,310
Hi,
welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,060
Today we're going to talk about the way
in which emotions shape our judgements

3
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:06,930
and decisions.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,710
And in particular we're going to look at
how they shape those decisions when it

5
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:15,270
comes to money. So can emotion really
shaped the way we spend our money,

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,920
shaped the way we think about our money
and shape how important money is to us.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,780
So in essence,

8
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:25,020
we're going to be returning
to the question that we
actually address in our very

9
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:29,640
first lecture. Does our wallet
actually reflect our feelings?

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,500
Can money buy happiness?

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,300
And how emotions influence our everyday
consumer decisions that we make from how

12
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:38,910
to spend money,
whether or not to donate to charity,

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,630
how to manage our purse strings
during difficult economic times.

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,130
And importantly perhaps how to even
save for our future emotional self.

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,380
So this will be our first module in
a three part module and judgment and

16
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:53,310
decision making.

17
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,000
And today what we're going to do is look
into a broad framework that will help

18
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:59,970
guide our thinking called the
appraisal tendency framework.

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,080
And by doing this we're going to start
to answer the question of can ceiling

20
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:08,350
really shape our choices and in particular
shape the kinds of economic choices

21
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:10,020
they make and everyday life.

22
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,070
And in this we will be answering some
of the biggest questions that you know

23
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,610
behavioral economists grapple with today
as well as emotion researchers too.

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,410
We're going to do this by first going
over what is the appraisal tendency

25
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:25,590
framework and in what way is it relevant
to the way we think about making

26
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:27,870
judgments and especially
when it comes to money.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,340
Then we'll look at some of the important
or supportive empirical evidence for

28
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:36,360
the appraisal tendency framework followed
by our takeaway questions and expert

29
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:39,270
interview with one of the most
renowned scholars in the field.

30
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,780
So let's start with the
appraisal tendency framework.

31
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:46,620
What exactly is this and who
originated it in the first place?

32
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,960
So here we turned to the work of Dr
Jennifer Learner at Harvard University who

33
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:56,610
pioneered this idea of what we now call
the ATF for appraisal tendency framework.

34
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,421
So I'm,

35
00:01:57,421 --> 00:02:01,110
what I'm going to do is walk you through
some of the core components of what

36
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:05,520
this framework says in terms of how
emotions shape the kinds of judgements and

37
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:08,730
decisions that we critically
make in everyday life.

38
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,210
So the first principle of this model,
again,

39
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:19,320
which is a framework to help understand
how exactly emotions influence consumer

40
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:24,321
decision making suggests that indeed
there are two different types of emotional

41
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:27,690
influences on judgment and choice.

42
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,870
And these are called integral
and incidental emotions.

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,670
So integral emotions are the subjective
experiences of emotion that are relevant

44
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:38,910
to the present judgments and
choices that we make. For example,

45
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:42,510
think about the amount of fear that one
experiences and how that influences how

46
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:46,980
much you're willing to gamble, right?
This is compared with incidental emotions,

47
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:51,060
which are the influences of emotions that
we think should be a relevant or have

48
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:55,170
nothing to do with the kinds of judgments
and choices we make. So, in other words,

49
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,250
think about the emotions that are produced
when listening to music or you know,

50
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:04,060
bad weather and just how the emotions
may actually shape things that seem

51
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:05,290
totally unrelated,

52
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,160
such as the kind of music you choose to
listen to or the kind of judgements you

53
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:11,470
have about weather.
And so in other words,

54
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:15,520
the appraisal tendency framework here
is actually focusing on these incidental

55
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:16,770
emotions are again,

56
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,410
the kinds of emotions do you think should
have nothing to do with the everyday

57
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:23,050
choices and judgments that we make.
And in fact,

58
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:26,950
most people would deny that these
kinds of incidental emotions actually

59
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:28,510
influenced decision making.

60
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,210
Now what we're going to see as we
walk through it is that they actually

61
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,670
profoundly shaped the
way that we make choices,

62
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,010
especially when it comes
to economic choices.

63
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,350
So the second principle here of this
framework is this idea that it goes beyond

64
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:45,070
valence. So this framework
doesn't just focus on the valence.

65
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:48,940
So that is whether an emotion
or is positive or whether
an emotion is negative,

66
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,810
but instead looks at what we have talked
about earlier in the course as the

67
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:57,640
underlying cognitive appraisal dimensions
that are associated with emotions.

68
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,140
In other words, what are the kinds of
evaluations or thoughts? In other words,

69
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:06,250
that kind of cognitions you have when
you're in a particular emotional state.

70
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,170
Do you have appraisals of feeling that
you have more certainty over your world

71
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:12,550
and more certainty over the future?

72
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:15,340
A sense of control or a
relative lack thereof?

73
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:18,460
And we'll go through different emotions
that really vary depending on these

74
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,180
really vitally distinct
cognitive appraisal dimensions.

75
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,220
The third component of this appraisal
tendency framework focuses on what is

76
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:30,070
called appraisal tendencies.
So as you can see here,

77
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,260
it suggests that emotions give rise to
specific cognitive predispositions or

78
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:37,300
ways of evaluating the environment.

79
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,290
So an appraisal as we talked again about
earlier in the course when we looked at

80
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,790
different theories of emotion,

81
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,380
we know that appraisals are associated
with an emotion and will predict how it

82
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:50,410
influences both the content and depth,

83
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,270
whether it's sort of more shallow or deep.
Of the kinds of judgments we make.

84
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,110
Then we have this, uh, you know,

85
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,260
component called the
match matching constraint.

86
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,880
So here the appraisal tendency framework
really focuses again on incidental

87
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:07,331
emotions,

88
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:11,200
the kinds that we don't think should be
relevant to everyday decision making.

89
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,000
And again, the kind that wants, again,

90
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:15,850
most people deny that these
influenced decision making.

91
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:19,420
So here we're going to look specifically
at this category of emotions.

92
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,190
And finally there's this idea
of deactivating conditions.

93
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,600
So the effects of emotions on
decision making. Really Wayne,

94
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:32,770
when the emotion deintensify intensifies
or deactivates, and by contrast,

95
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:37,771
the effects of emotion should intensify
when the emotion activates or or

96
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:39,430
increases in magnitude.

97
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,300
So this is the appraisal
tendency framework that
Jennifer learner put forward to

98
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:47,530
really understand how emotions and
in particular incidental emotions,

99
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,400
profoundly shaped the kinds of everyday
decisions and judgments he make.

100
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,830
So what is the evidence in support of
this framework and how can it be relevant

101
00:05:56,831 --> 00:06:00,290
to the of economic decisions that
we make in our everyday lives?

102
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,710
So here we're going to do is turn to
our second point on the roadmap where we

103
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:05,110
look at evidence.
Um,

104
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,780
and in what way evidence does support
this framework we just walked through.

105
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,630
So these are some really fun empirical
studies. Um, and one of the studies that,

106
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:14,870
uh,

107
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,650
Jennifer Learner and colleagues did that
was an empirical test of the appraisal

108
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:23,360
framework tendency model is testing
this idea of what's called the carryover

109
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,270
idea or carry over effect.
And again,

110
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:31,271
this suggests that incidental or
unrelated emotions may actually quote,

111
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:36,581
carry over to influence the way in which
we spend our money and make important

112
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,450
economic decisions.

113
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,950
So you'll see here in this article
by Jen Lerner and colleagues, um,

114
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,670
that she really looked at this idea, um,
called heartstrings and purse strings,

115
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:53,600
the carry over effects of
emotions on economic decisions.

116
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,080
And this is one of your readings and
we'll walk through some of the main

117
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:58,010
findings right now.

118
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,070
Precisely what way do emotions really
sort of have this carryover effect on our

119
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:04,820
economic decisions?

120
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,540
So what this study did is
it was first focused on,

121
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,150
um,

122
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,080
really leveraging off one of the most
robust principles and behavioral economics

123
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:18,080
that's called the endowment
effect. So, in other words,

124
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:23,081
people often place a higher value in
objects they own versus those they don't.

125
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,090
So an example is that people might,

126
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,810
will often demand a higher price on a
coffee mug that's given to them as opposed

127
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:33,380
to one that they did not own in
the first place. So in other words,

128
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:38,090
we put higher value on things that are
endowed to us versus those that really

129
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,670
are not endowed to us are
those which we don't own.

130
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,770
So this is the endowment effect.

131
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:48,070
And so Jen Lerner took this endowment
effect one step further and in her study,

132
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,910
as you can see here,

133
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,980
what she did is she looked
at three different kinds
of emotions and she studied

134
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:55,860
them,
um,

135
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,720
by eliciting them through some of the
most validated kinds of emotional homes

136
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:02,750
that we talked about earlier in our
lectures on emotional dissertation.

137
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,440
So she elicited a relatively
neutral or nonemotional state,

138
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,020
a disgusting state in a state of sadness.

139
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,350
And then what you see here in these
two different columns are two different

140
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:13,184
conditions.

141
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,030
So the first that you see here is what
she called the choice condition, right?

142
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,390
So the choice condition was,
um,

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,470
a condition in which participants were
shown an object which they did not own

144
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,490
and they were asked what price would
they prefer to buy this object for?

145
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,180
This was compared with
the cell condition here.

146
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,070
This is where the participant by contrast
was endowed with or given an object

147
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,930
and then asked again, what price would
they prefer to sell it back for? So again,

148
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:42,950
the choice condition,

149
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:46,130
they were shown an objects they didn't
own and asked how much they would buy it

150
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:51,131
for and the cell condition they were
endowed with or given an object and then

151
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:53,270
ask what price they would
prefer to sell it back for.

152
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,230
So these are some of the films
that she used to elicit, um,

153
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,990
the sad and discussing emotion
that were shown earlier.

154
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,110
And these are widely Lee's films
that we saw earlier in the course.

155
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:08,160
The sad film is a film from the champ
where it's a young boy crying over the

156
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:09,330
death of his father.

157
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,710
And the discussing film is from the
movie trainspotting where a man is going

158
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:15,210
through and digging through this,

159
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:19,380
like really discussing like feces
infected toilet. While he's gagging.

160
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,310
So these are films that have been
reliably shown to illicit both sadness and

161
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:26,370
disgust. So, um,

162
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,060
you can see just a little sample of the
film here for the disgusting film where

163
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:35,470
he's going to the toilet.
Pretty disgusting, right?
And he's digging through it,

164
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:40,770
gagging and most people weren't high
intensity or degrees of disgust.

165
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,040
I won't make you watch any more,
but you get the, you get the gist.

166
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,870
So what happened when she had people
view these different films and they were

167
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,160
assigned to either the choice or
the cell condition? In other words,

168
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:59,161
the questions she tried to ask in this
study is how can emotions elicited in the

169
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:01,410
lab using films?
Actually quote,

170
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,420
carry over to influence seemingly
unrelated economic choices, right?

171
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,840
How would that have anything to do
with these kinds of choices we make?

172
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:14,250
How much we're willing to buy or sell
an object? So here's what she found.

173
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,220
So this idea here, if we walk through, um,

174
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,001
in other words,

175
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:25,380
it's the question really quickly of in
what sense the era's depicting here.

176
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:29,910
Do these emotions literally carry over
to influence these seemingly unrelated

177
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:33,630
economic choices in both the
twist condition or sell condition.

178
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:39,030
So here's one thing that the authors
had specific predictions about when they

179
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:42,330
were testing this model about exactly
how emotions would influence this

180
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,530
endowment effect.

181
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,850
So they hypothesize that this emotion
of disgust that was elicited using that

182
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:51,900
film clip you saw brief from
trainspotting, um, would
have the following effects.

183
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,380
So discuss has this core
appraisal theme of, you know,

184
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:58,860
being too close to some sort
of indigestible substance.

185
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,430
And so as we saw earlier and we were
walking through some of the basic emotions

186
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,440
in our course, we saw that, you know,

187
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:08,160
the associated behavior of discussed is
really to expel objects away from the

188
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:11,730
self,
right and avoid taking a new objects.

189
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,740
So the prediction that
learner in colleagues made
is that after eliciting this

190
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:18,240
kind of emotion of disgust,

191
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,420
what they would predict to
see is reduced selling prices.

192
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:26,421
So trying to expel the object away
and reduced choice or buying prices.

193
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:29,400
So avoid taking in.
So for sadness,

194
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:32,700
we know the core appraisal theme is
a theme of loss and helplessness.

195
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,540
And the associated behavior is a
desire to change one circumstances.

196
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,140
So it learner and colleagues predicted
is that you would see reduced selling

197
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:44,100
prices and increased buying prices.
So again,

198
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:47,880
this is this desire to
change when circumstances and
really sort of remedy these

199
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:52,620
themes of loss and helplessness. So
here's what they found. So again,

200
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:57,621
we have the neutral condition in white
disgust and yellow and sadness and blue.

201
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,600
And what if you look at disgust in the
middle of what you see is that consistent

202
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:06,280
with the idea that discussed is associated
with expelling objects regardless if

203
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:10,840
you are buying or selling them discussed
really wiped out this traditional and

204
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:15,040
well established endowment effect in
behavioral economics by showing reduced

205
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:19,570
prices overall and creating no statistical
difference between prices in dollars

206
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:24,070
between the cell and choice conditions.
If you look on the far right though,

207
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:26,680
by contrast and the sad condition in blue,

208
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,300
consistent with the idea that sadness is
associated with a desire to change your

209
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:33,610
current circumstances,
sadness,

210
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:38,350
decreased prices in the selling condition
and increased prices in the choice

211
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:40,030
condition.
In other words,

212
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:44,440
individuals following a sad film
induction sold for less money.

213
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,450
And offered more money to buy or choose
the object. This is really a sense,

214
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:49,960
um,

215
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,500
you could think of it as
they'd be reversed or opposite
of the endowment effect.

216
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,790
So what you're seeing here is that
emotions can dramatically shift this well

217
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:02,200
established endowment effect that's
associated with both how we buy and how we

218
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:05,980
sell seemingly unrelated
objects. Um, you know,

219
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:08,800
that seemed to have nothing to do with
our current emotional state of feeling

220
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:10,090
disgusted or sad.

221
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,350
So we walked through the
appraisal tendency framework.

222
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,830
We looked at some evidence, some really
striking evidence that suggests that,

223
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,860
you know, discreet emotions,
even of disgust or sad,

224
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:25,861
can radically change the way we both
sell and buy our money and even reverse

225
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,560
some of the most well
established principles and
behavioral economics looking at

226
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:30,550
the endowment effect.

227
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,480
So now we're going to turn to our takeaway
questions to summarize some of the

228
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,510
main questions that you should
glean from this first lecture.

229
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,790
Thinking about judgment
and decision making.

230
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:45,640
So the first question focuses on what
are the core principles of the appraisal

231
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:49,300
tendency framework that we
went through today. Second,

232
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,580
what is the distinction between these
integral and incidental emotions,

233
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,600
disgust and which of these two emotion
categories is most central to the

234
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:01,960
appraisal tendency framework.
Finally,

235
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:05,260
what is the empirical evidence that we
discussed towards the end of our lecture

236
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:09,820
today and sport in support of this
model and what distinctions are rose for

237
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:12,070
discussed versus sadness.

238
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,590
And now we'll turn to our expert
interview with the true founder of this

239
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:22,120
appraisal tendency framework as part of
our experts in emotion interview series.

240
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,470
So today we'll be speaking
with Dr Jennifer Learner,

241
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,150
a professor of public policy and manage
management at the Harvard Kennedy School

242
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,800
of Government on emotion and judgment.

243
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,190
Dr Lerner is a professor of public policy
and management at the Harvard Kennedy

244
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:38,590
School of Government,

245
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,100
as well as the founder and former
director of the Harvard Laboratory for

246
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:45,730
decision science.
This interdisciplinary laboratory,

247
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:49,780
which she cofounded with two economists,
draws primarily on psychology,

248
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,140
economics and to study human
judgment and decision making.

249
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,340
Dr Lerner publishes her research
widely and scientific journals,

250
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,910
summaries of which appear in popular
print, such as the New York Times,

251
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,970
as well as broadcast media
such as good morning America.

252
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,780
She also serves on the editorial boards
for the Journal of Personality and

253
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:13,190
social psychology, organizational
behavior and human decision processes,

254
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,920
and the Journal of
Behavioral Decision Research.

255
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,160
She's received numerous
awards for her research,

256
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,090
including the presidential early career
award for scientists and engineers,

257
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,860
and in a White House ceremony,

258
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:28,730
the National Science Foundation and the
president of the United States annually

259
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:33,080
confer this award as the highest national
honor for investigators in the early

260
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:35,570
stages of promising research careers.

261
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,190
So I now turn to our experts and emotion
interview on emotion and judgment with

262
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:41,450
Dr Jennifer Learner.
