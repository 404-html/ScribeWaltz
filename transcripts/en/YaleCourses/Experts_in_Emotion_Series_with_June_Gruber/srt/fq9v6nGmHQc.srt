00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,700
You series today for our
experts in emotion interview.

2
00:00:03,701 --> 00:00:05,570
We'll be speaking with Dr. Daniel Gilbert,

3
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:10,270
a professor of psychology at Harvard
University on happiness. Dr. Gilbert, um,

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,330
is a professor of psychology and has
won numerous awards for his research and

5
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:15,050
teaching,

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,650
including the American Psychological
Association's Distinguished Scientific

7
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:22,670
Award for an early career contribution
to psychology. And in 2008,

8
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:25,460
he was elected to the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences.

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,430
His 2007 book stumbling on happiness,

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,520
spent six months on the New
York Times bestseller list,

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,290
has been translated into 30 languages
and was awarded the Royal Society's

12
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:40,190
General Book Prize for the Best
Science Book of the year. In 2010,

13
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:43,550
he hosted and cowrote the award
winning Novus television series,

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,420
this emotional life, which has been
seen by more than 10 million viewers.

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,540
He's also a contributor to time,
the New York Times,

16
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:54,410
and NPR is all things considered and
has been a guest on numerous television

17
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:58,550
shows including the today show,
Charlie rose 2020 and the Colbert report.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So finally his first head
talk on happiness is now one
of the 15 most popular of

19
00:01:04,491 --> 00:01:05,324
all time.

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,040
So I now turn to our very special experts
in emotion interview together with Dr.

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,800
Daniel Gilbert on happiness. Welcome,
Dan. Thanks for speaking with us today.

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,740
Thanks for asking me to do this June.

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,970
Oh, thank you. Um,

24
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,420
one of the things I thought might be a
nice way to start our conversation today

25
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:25,870
is to hear a little bit about
where your journey began,

26
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:30,070
sort of what first got you interested
in the topic of emotion and happiness.

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,760
Right.
You know what's funny?

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,530
I never thought of myself as an emotion
researcher in most ways. I still don't.

29
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,400
I began my career as a science fiction
writer before I was a psychologist.

30
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,510
I wrote science fiction.

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,860
And so my obsession has always been with
how human beings think about the future.

32
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,760
But if you ask why human
beings think about the future,

33
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,900
the main answer is so they can get
to good ones rather than bad ones.

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,220
What's a good future?

35
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,550
A good future is one in which we're
experiencing positive emotions.

36
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,690
So very quickly,

37
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:03,230
if you were interested in why and how
human beings think about the future,

38
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,000
you become a student of emotion.

39
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,590
We're looking into the future so that we
can find more happiness, more pleasure,

40
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:10,424
and less pain.

41
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,210
So you very quickly get into the
psychology of those particular emotions.

42
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:15,440
And that's what's happened to me.

43
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,470
So serendipitously you came across
happiness by thinking about the future.

44
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,800
Exactly.
Right.

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,100
Awesome. So I want to ask you then a
little bit about your work on this topic.

46
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:30,120
So I mean you're widely known for
your New York Times bestseller book,

47
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:31,890
stumbling on happiness.
Um,

48
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,730
that's now been translated into over
20 probably even more at this point,

49
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:38,910
you know, different languages.
Um, and in your book,

50
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,320
Adn and Australian is two separate ones.
It's been translated into many

51
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,470
Australian has a different dialect.
I mean,

52
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,021
in your local,

53
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:54,330
it's really interesting and fun here is
that you really challenge this idea that

54
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:55,111
many of us have,

55
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:59,620
that happiness seems to depend on getting
what we want or sort of having go as

56
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:00,454
planned.

57
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,790
And I wondered if you could say a little
bit about how our sort of everyday

58
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:08,791
beliefs about what makes us happy might
actually be wrong or sort of steering us

59
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,100
in the, you know, perhaps
less correct direction,

60
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,310
right? Will, you know, most people
have a basic theory about happiness.

61
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:19,430
And this is the theory people have had
about happiness for thousands of years.

62
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:22,580
As long as they've been writing,
the theory goes like this happening.

63
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:25,850
This is what happens when I get what I
want. And I usually don't get what I want.

64
00:03:25,851 --> 00:03:29,810
So I'm not always happy. But if I couldn't
get what I want done, I would be happy.

65
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,440
So happiness is just the
product of achieving our goals.

66
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,780
But now for the first
time in human history,

67
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:39,230
we have large populations of people
living on the face of our planet who

68
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,110
actually have everything they want. And
guess what? They're not always happy.

69
00:03:42,111 --> 00:03:46,250
So you know, there's another beautiful
theory shutdown by an ugly fat.

70
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,270
It can be the case that happiness is
what happens when we get what we want.

71
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,220
So why are we ever unhappy? The answer I
think is we often want the wrong things.

72
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,480
We are, uh, chasing things that
will not actually provide happiness,

73
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:04,481
avoiding things that will not provide
as much a pain or displeasure as we

74
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:05,324
anticipate.

75
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:10,340
So I've been really quite taken with our
inability to look into our own future

76
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,220
and figure out what will make us happy,
how happy it will make us,

77
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:17,330
and how long that happiness will last.
Um, my colleague and collaborator,

78
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:22,250
Tim Wilson and I have really spent the
last 15 years trying to understand what

79
00:04:22,251 --> 00:04:27,080
human beings do wrong when they try to
imagine the future and figure out what

80
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:27,914
will make them happy.

81
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,260
And I think the errors we make
come in two basic kinds. First,

82
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:37,430
there are errors of imagination.
Imagination is a wonderful capacity.

83
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:40,630
We're the only animal on the
planet that has anything alike.

84
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,230
The ability to close our eyes and imagine
futures that haven't yet happened.

85
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,690
And yet it's still kind of
in Beta testing. We've only
been able to do this, uh,

86
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,260
for a couple of billion years.
So imagination is flawed.

87
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,860
And when I ask you to imagine what it
would be like to get married or have a

88
00:04:57,861 --> 00:05:01,880
baby or win the lottery,
or get tenure or eat a cupcake,

89
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,970
you do a pretty good job
but not a perfect job.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And the ways in which you do an imperfect
job had been fascinating to me and Tim

91
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,410
Wilson.
So there are areas of imagination.

92
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,920
The other reasons that we chase the wrong
things in our pursuit of happiness is

93
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:19,430
that we're members of a culture where
members of a society where members of

94
00:05:19,431 --> 00:05:23,930
families in every one of us is
surrounded by a, a, you know,

95
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:28,610
a big herd of 'em aunts and uncles and
rabbis and priests and philosophers and

96
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:30,830
grandmothers and bartenders
and taxi drivers.

97
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,580
And they all will tell us what kinds
of things we need to do to have a happy

98
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:37,940
life. It turns out that some of
that cultural wisdom is right,

99
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,070
but some of that cultural wisdom is wrong.

100
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,000
So we make errors when we think about
what will make us happy because our own

101
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:47,300
imaginations fail us. And in a
sense, our mothers valence too.

102
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,720
So when you talk about imagination,

103
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:54,620
I know you've done a lot of work of this
sort of imagining our future emotional

104
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:58,490
selves or you know,
engaging in what you call of forecasting.

105
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,970
And I wonder if you could say a little
bit about just how our imagination goes

106
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:05,210
awry and we try to project how
we're going to feel in the future.

107
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,180
Will our bench when the several different,
uh,

108
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,590
independent errors when we
try to imagine the future,

109
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,820
but surely one of the ones that
I've been most intrigued by is our,

110
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,340
our inability to realize
quite how adaptable we are.

111
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,640
Human beings get used to almost anything.

112
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,260
And that's really good when the thing
you're getting used to is the loss of a

113
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,260
loved one,
a or physical handicap.

114
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,830
And it's really bad when the
thing you're getting used to is a,

115
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,980
a new love affair or a promotion at work.

116
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,790
But human beings quickly adapt
to almost any circumstance. Uh,

117
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,240
that's not remarkable to me.

118
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:47,150
What's remarkable is we don't
seem to know this about ourselves.

119
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,430
And so if you ask people questions like,

120
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,060
how happy would you be if you want
$1 million? I said, oh my gosh,

121
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:54,590
I jumped for joy.
And they're right.

122
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,580
But if you ask how happy will you be
a year later, they mainly said, well,

123
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:02,930
I'd probably still be jumping quite as
high, but jumping, and they're wrong.

124
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,260
Within a year, they're going to
adapt to that new level of income.

125
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,090
So one of the mistakes we make,

126
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:12,050
one of the key mistakes we make is not
realizing the speed with which we will

127
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:14,450
adapt to virtually any circumstance.

128
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,910
Interesting. And when we
think about, you know,

129
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,030
the sense of which were
sort of more adaptable,

130
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:23,820
more malleable than we give
ourselves credit for, perhaps

131
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,810
that's absolutely true. Well,
you know, in the negative case,

132
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:31,860
we are a species that picks itself
up by our, uh, by its bootstraps.

133
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,530
Um,
you know,

134
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:38,310
we think of ourselves as kind of this
field of fragile flowers that has to go

135
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:40,800
running to our therapist every
time our shoe laces break.

136
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,630
But the truth is that human beings,
whether virtually every circumstance,

137
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:50,610
if you look at the literature on
trauma and tragedy, people are indeed,

138
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,720
uh, they, they feel bad when bad
things happen. Don't get me wrong,

139
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,660
it's not good to uh,
lose a loved one.

140
00:07:57,661 --> 00:08:00,150
It's not good to lose
the use of your legs.

141
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,440
But what's remarkable is how quickly
we overcome these circumstance.

142
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,560
Not everybody, but almost everybody. Now,

143
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,740
I'm just fascinated by the fact that
we don't know this about ourselves.

144
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,930
Human beings are famous in
the psychological literature
for overestimating how

145
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:17,580
good they are at all sorts of things.

146
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,730
This is something we're really
good at and we don't know.

147
00:08:20,731 --> 00:08:22,860
We have this remarkable hidden talent.

148
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,460
And another fact, I mean that you've
talked about when it comes to, you know,

149
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:31,900
our own knowledge about happiness and
how we're going to feel in the future as

150
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:35,590
this idea of natural versus
synthetic happiness, right?

151
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:38,410
And sort of our knowledge about the kinds
of things we think are gonna make us

152
00:08:38,411 --> 00:08:41,680
happy. And I wonder if you could
say just a little bit about that.

153
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,021
Well,
you know what,

154
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:46,840
these terms are just terms I use to
describe the kind of happiness we get when

155
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:47,890
we get what we want.

156
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,360
That's natural happiness and the kind of
happiness we manufacturer for ourselves

157
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:56,760
when we don't get what we want and that
I've referred to as synthetic happiness.

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,050
I don't think there's actually a big
qualitative distinction between the two.

159
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,410
And what's remarkable to
me is that people are very,

160
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:08,850
very good at manufacturing happiness
when they don't get what they want.

161
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,051
Um,
you know,

162
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:13,860
the moment your fiance throws
that engagement ring back
in your face and starts

163
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:17,910
walking out the door and she's leaving,
you're looking at her going, you know,

164
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,650
she was never really that cute.
And you know,

165
00:09:20,651 --> 00:09:24,120
we never really had that much in common
and this is actually a pretty good

166
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:26,880
opportunity for me to start a
whole new life. No, I'm kidding.

167
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:29,430
Of course you don't do
that the minute it happens,

168
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,490
but it's remarkable how quickly the mind
starts to look for ways to make things

169
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:39,780
better. No reality is ambiguous. Social
realities, particularly ambiguous.

170
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:43,560
There are lots of ways to
think of something. Um, yes,

171
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,950
I lost my job and that means I'm
going to have trouble paying my rent.

172
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,550
But the other way to think about this
as a whole new opportunity to become a

173
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:54,810
poet. There's good and there's
bad ways to frame almost anything.

174
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:57,830
And the mind is very good
at finding the good way.

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,160
Now if you are selling that, you call
it coping. If you're carrying that,

176
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:04,620
you call it rationalization.
If you're studying it,

177
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:08,520
you call it cognitive
dissonance reductions, but
it's all basically one thing.

178
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:13,200
It's the mind finding ways to see the
world that will make the person who owns

179
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:14,880
the mind feel better about it.

180
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,350
That's what I mean by
manufacturing synthetic happiness.
We're really good at it,

181
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,020
most of us,
and we don't know we're really good at it.

182
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,990
So how do you think then we can
harness these facts about our minds,

183
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:27,190
things we may be aware of,

184
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:30,790
and some of the things you point out
that we're less aware of or maybe

185
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,380
appreciate less than we ought to.

186
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,820
How can we use this knowledge to really
find the true secrets of happiness?

187
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:39,100
Something so many people are,
you know,

188
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,060
so zealous about wanting
to attain and find, you

189
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,460
know, I love the phrase the
secret of happiness. Yeah,

190
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,460
because it's like the phrase to me,
the secret of weight loss,

191
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,100
there's no secret.
Okay.

192
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,630
The second law of thermodynamics tells
you that if you take in fewer calories

193
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:59,690
than you expend, you lose
weight. It's not a secret.

194
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,850
The same is true for happiness.

195
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,510
We've known for a long time through
folklore what kinds of things bring

196
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:10,511
happiness and science has by and large
shown that the things we suspected are

197
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:15,110
right. So there isn't a secret to
happiness. But if you asked me, you know,

198
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,830
what kinds of things, uh,
has science taught us, uh,

199
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,300
even if it's reaffirmed things we
already knew, um, I would say it comes,

200
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,550
there's a few things we
probably know about happens.

201
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:29,690
First is don't expect to live their
happiness is a place we visit.

202
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,580
It's not a place we move into.
Emotions are meant to be labeled,

203
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,730
are meant to change.

204
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,180
Your emotions are a compass that guide
you through your journey of life.

205
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:41,360
And a compass that's always stuck
on north is pretty much useless.

206
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,370
So nobody should want to get into a
state of permanent, uh, happiness.

207
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,690
Um, if you accept me happy all the
time, you will be very unhappy.

208
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,830
The second thing I would say is
to watch other people, you know,

209
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:57,700
imaginations of fickle friend betrays
us in many ways when we look into the

210
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:00,250
future and try to figure
out what will make us happy.

211
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,410
But we've discovered in
our own research though,

212
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,250
one way to know what will make you happy
is to look and see what makes other

213
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,930
people happy.
You know,

214
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:10,690
we have this illusion that we're quite
unique in that the things that make

215
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:13,720
others happy probably won't make us happy.
Hogwash.

216
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,290
We're almost all exactly the
same when it comes to happiness.

217
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,830
If an alien from Mars knew exactly what
made anyone randomly selected human

218
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,300
being on our planet,
happy,

219
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,650
it would know 90% of what there is to
know about everybody else. Um, you know,

220
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:32,020
would you rather a punch in the
mouth or chocolate ice cream,

221
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:36,070
gallbladder surgery or a weekend in Paris?
These are, you know, one item Iq tests.

222
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,600
Everybody answers them the same.

223
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,920
So other people's experiences can tell
you a lot about what will make you happy.

224
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,290
Finally, um, you know,

225
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:48,940
there's a big tradition in psychological
and sociological and economic research

226
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,610
of just looking at the
correlates of happiness. Uh,

227
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,180
what are the things we know about the
people who seen happiest on our planet?

228
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,930
And there's lots of things,
you know. Yup. Money is a,

229
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,970
is useful to have health matters. Um,
you know, freedom and security, blah,

230
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:06,530
blah, blah, blah, blah. Is there
one thing that matters most?

231
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:10,360
Just there is where the social
animal and it's our relationships.

232
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:14,590
And if you could only tend to one thing
in your life and improve it and expand

233
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:16,390
it in order to make yourself happier,

234
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,210
I would suggest it be
your social relationships,

235
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:21,850
your family relationships
in your friendship network.

236
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,240
People who have close family members and
close friendships are rarely seriously

237
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,510
unhappy people.

238
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,033
Hmm.

239
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,330
So it's really all about connecting with
others and making a meaningful social

240
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:35,680
life in many ways.
Right?

241
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,900
I mean, it sounds trite, it sounds like
something off a hallmark card and we go,

242
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:43,220
yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, what's the
secret of happiness is already,

243
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,890
that's like the second law of
thermodynamics. That's the secret.

244
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,840
That's what, that's a wonderful way
to think about it. You know. Um,

245
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,960
I often think of some of my
favorite songs that say, you know,

246
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:55,750
all you need is love, right? Okay,

247
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,610
you don't even need low.
Um,

248
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:05,510
looks great but you can get a big boost
just out of conversation. You know,

249
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,870
we know that one of the things that makes
people unhappy is mind wandering when

250
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:12,830
the mind wanders to often wanders to bad
things and even when it wanders to good

251
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,750
things,
it doesn't usually improve our mood.

252
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,580
But one of the things that holds us in
place keeps us in the here and now is

253
00:14:19,581 --> 00:14:21,920
human interaction.
As I'm sitting here talking to you,

254
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,610
I'm not kind of thinking
about that dentist appointment
next week are wondering

255
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:29,330
am I really should have said the thing
I said to my wife earlier this morning,

256
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,950
my mind is here.

257
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,810
One of the ways in which
social interaction it keeps
us happy is just by keeping

258
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:39,800
us in the moment so you
don't even have to have love.

259
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,310
You can actually just have a good chat
with somebody at Starbucks about what

260
00:14:43,311 --> 00:14:47,330
happened in politics the day before and
it's likely to make you happier and keep

261
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:50,050
you present. Focus to
present focus. Right.

262
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,070
So of the other things that

263
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,740
I really love in the work you do
among so many things is that, um,

264
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,370
some recent work,
um,

265
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,580
where you found that people systematically
underestimate how much they're going

266
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:08,330
to change in the future when it comes
to personality traits, personal values,

267
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:10,190
and even, you know, preferences.

268
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:14,150
And it sounds like from
your work at people come to
believe that they've changed

269
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:18,080
more, you know, in the past 10 years
and they will in the upcoming decade.

270
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,790
And I just wonder,
you know,

271
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,690
what do you think this suggests about
our understanding of ourselves and who

272
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:27,970
we're going to be in the future
and what we're going to want? Will,

273
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,950
the phenomenon you're talking about
is something we've called the history

274
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:31,990
illusion,
this kneeling,

275
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
but people have in every age from 18
to 68 that they've changed a lot in the

276
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:41,150
past, but they're pretty much done
changing. They finally become the person,

277
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,210
they will pretty much always be,
yes, I'll have less hair. Well,

278
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:47,750
for me that's not possible.
Uh, and more pounds as I age,

279
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,420
but I'll still be fundamentally the same.
Dan Gilbert,

280
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,000
I do feel that now at the age of 55,

281
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:55,760
but I also felt that at the age of 25.

282
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,170
So what we've established is that this
is actually a widespread illusion among

283
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:01,490
people of all ages.

284
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,190
But I think it's part and parcel of
a bigger piece of our psychology. Um,

285
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,700
we're very much prisoners of the moment,
uh, as, as you've said in your own work.

286
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,530
Uh, we're stuck in time.
We're here now and our,

287
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,060
our perceptual reality,

288
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,450
the here and now is quite palpable and
quite powerful and it's very difficult

289
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:25,070
for the mind to escape the moment and
travel to the future or travel to the

290
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:25,880
past.

291
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,410
So I've referred to this phenomenon is
presentism the 10 our tendency to be kind

292
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:35,150
of stuck in now, when you try
to imagine yourself in 10 years,

293
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,740
it's really hard to do.
That's a very difficult cognitive process.

294
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:43,270
Who will I be in 10 years? What will
I be? What will I be doing? Well,

295
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,350
I want how might my values change?

296
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,850
And I think what happens is when we
have trouble imagining ourselves being

297
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:54,470
different, we mistakenly conclude
that that means we won't be. Actually,

298
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,530
what it means is that imagining yourself
in the future is a hard thing to do.

299
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,240
We should scratch their heads and go,

300
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,270
I just can't imagine myself 10 years
from now. And so I'm uncertain.

301
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,840
But instead we say,
I can't imagine myself 10 years from now.

302
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,080
I guess that means I'm going to
be the same guy. I'll always be.

303
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:14,710
The problem with this of course is that
by overestimating the stability of our

304
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:18,050
current selves, of our personalities,
values and preferences,

305
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,610
we can make bad decision making errors.
So for example, we asked them one study,

306
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:24,100
we asked people to uh,

307
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:29,290
how much they would pay to see their
current favorite band play a concert in 10

308
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:32,960
years. And I average, they
told us about 130 bucks.

309
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,070
But when we asked them how much they would
pay to see a concert right now by the

310
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:41,510
band, that was their favorite 10 years
ago. They said only about 80 bucks.

311
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,310
So people recognize that they still don't
now love the band they use to loan 10

312
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:50,340
years ago quite so much, and yet
they're very confident that in 10 years,

313
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,820
Radiohead is still going to be the
band that they really want to see.

314
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,900
So you can see that this end of
history, illusion, but can the devil,

315
00:17:57,901 --> 00:17:58,860
our decision making,

316
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,160
well, when it comes to radio
head, perhaps that's timeless.

317
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,500
10 years from now, let's get back
together and see how you [inaudible].

318
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,040
Yeah, I feel, I mean
in some ways, you know,

319
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,910
what it suggests is that we're more
comfortable sticking in this sort of more

320
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:14,511
pleasant,

321
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:19,220
comfortable present as opposed to a more
uncertain and perhaps anxiety ridden

322
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:23,150
future where we don't know what's going
to happen. Things are out of our control.

323
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,500
Unpredictable.

324
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,100
I do think it's comforting to
believe that you finally arrived.

325
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,670
The development is a process.
It's tumultuous, it's hard,

326
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:34,880
it's revolutionary and evolutionary.
Finally,

327
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,250
I'm done on finally fully formed.

328
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:41,870
It's delivered me to this moment and I
can be this Dan Gilbert for the rest of

329
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:45,200
my life. I do think most people
take some comfort in that.

330
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,860
So I think that's probably one of the
things that causes the end of history.

331
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,120
Illusion.
Personally.

332
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,930
I'm rather glad to know that I'm
going to completely transform.

333
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,370
I plan to be a six foot tall, blonde
Swedish man, right, about 10 years.

334
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,610
He, you know, you never
know. Right? Odds are small.

335
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,620
I mean, I'm just wondering what kind
of implications do you think this has?

336
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:11,990
You've talked a little
bit about, um, you know,

337
00:19:11,991 --> 00:19:14,870
the kinds of things we think we're
going to invest money and in the future,

338
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,550
but the sense of,
you know,

339
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:20,330
our future selves being relatively
stable versions of our current selves.

340
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,230
How do you think this will affect the
kind of choices we make? You know, um,

341
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:28,370
in terms of saving money for a trip or
putting, you know, time and money into,

342
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:30,920
you know, investing for College, um,

343
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,280
how does this change the kinds of choices
you make in terms of what we think is

344
00:19:34,281 --> 00:19:35,360
going to make us happy?

345
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,500
Because much of our time is spent building
towards this future self is going to

346
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:40,334
be happy.

347
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,421
Well,

348
00:19:41,421 --> 00:19:45,350
I think it suggests that we're going to
make mistakes in an even suggest what

349
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,030
kind of mistakes we're going to make.

350
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:52,330
We're going to tend to build futures that
are current cells like that our future

351
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:55,430
selves don't. But it's the
classic example is the Tattoo.

352
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,940
A tattoo was a commitment to a piece of
art on your body for the rest of your

353
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:04,970
life. Now, you know, they
can mostly be removed,

354
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,680
but it's long and arduous. By and large,
when you get a tattoo, you're saying,

355
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,370
not only do I like this now,
but I will always like this.

356
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,180
And I see young people walking around
all the time with these very cool tattoos

357
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:20,810
and they locked extraordinarily up and
they're not going to look extraordinarily

358
00:20:20,811 --> 00:20:22,670
up when their grandparents or were,

359
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,290
they're the CEOs of large multinational
corporations or when they're soccer moms.

360
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,510
But they believe that a young age that
if I get a tattoo now all always like it.

361
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,500
No, we make fun of young people because
we think they don't have much foresight.

362
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,630
They don't realize that
they're going to change.

363
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:40,220
And what I love about our researches,

364
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,640
it turns out their grandparents make the
same mistakes, just not with tattoos,

365
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,890
but 50 year old people
vastly underestimate how
much they're going to change

366
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:51,460
between 50 and 60. So this isn't
just an error for young people.

367
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:55,630
It's an error we fall.
Make. How can it change?

368
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:59,610
How can knowing about this change our
decision making? I think probably the, um,

369
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,830
uh,
the watchword is options.

370
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,100
That is to the extent that you realize
you are likely to change much more than

371
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:12,670
you would intuitively think.
But change in ways you can't predict.

372
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,740
You leave your options open.

373
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,970
You don't make serious commitments
to things in the long term. You know,

374
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:20,770
most choices are not just for the moment.

375
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:24,100
I decide what to have for lunch right
now and I'm deciding what will make me

376
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:26,350
happy now.
But when I go grocery shopping,

377
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,560
I'm deciding what will make
me happy for the entire week.

378
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,880
Most decisions are decisions about
what our future cells will want.

379
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,690
If we recognize that our future selves
are likely to be different than our

380
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:40,900
current selves in ways we can't predict,
we leave our options open.

381
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,840
So we shot for three
days instead of 30 days.

382
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,890
We signed up for a six month
gym membership instead of
a 10 year gym membership.

383
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,370
We get the a Henna Tattoo
rather than decline.

384
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,320
But it has to be removed with a laser.

385
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,010
I mean, it makes you think too, um, and
some of the professional goals that,

386
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,150
you know, uh, academic
scholars like yourself pursue,

387
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,490
we're constantly pursuing these
long longterm goals, right?

388
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,060
And we're sort of set up in a profession
that's having us work towards goals

389
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:13,780
that in many ways perhaps we don't know
if there is there going to be the same

390
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:16,780
goals that we're going to want
in two years or five years.

391
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,880
That's right.
And you know what I'm saying?

392
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,970
I don't need to be suggesting we
should all live for the moment.

393
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,890
Forget about the future far from it.

394
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,470
I'm a big believer in
longterm future planning,

395
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,180
but I think what we have to do is make
a plan for the future knowing that our

396
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:33,850
future selves might not
be very happy with it.

397
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,730
And so there are exit
strategies all along the way.

398
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,130
We allow ourselves room to grow

399
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,600
and as we sort of think about
growing and into the future,

400
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:47,380
it makes me think of a question I'd
love to hear your thoughts on which are,

401
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,000
you know, you've done such wide reaching
work on happiness, mind wandering,

402
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:54,250
this idea of our future selves,
how we're going to feel,

403
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:56,500
how we're going to imagine
our future selves to be.

404
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,460
And when we then think about the
future of the field of emotion.

405
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,980
It feels funny to ask you this
question now, sort of, well,

406
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,090
where do you think it's headed?

407
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,420
Well, I mean, first of all, um,
I hope it's headed for oblivion,

408
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,900
which is to say almost any interesting
field should transform so that 30 years

409
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:21,400
later it's not recognizable.
Emotion is an artificial category.

410
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,490
Emotion is a English word in English.

411
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:28,540
Words don't carve nature
at its joints. Um, know,

412
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,800
think of words like, um, time and
space. They're very different words.

413
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:34,610
And so we thought they
were very different things.

414
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:36,640
And Einstein came along and said,
you know,

415
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:40,660
these two categories you have of time and
space, it's an artificial distinction.

416
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Time and space are
actually the same thing.

417
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,930
Four dimensions of the same thing.
I think that's instructive right now.

418
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:50,450
We think there's a study
of a thing called emotion,

419
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,070
but emotion is just some dimension
of our subjective experience.

420
00:23:55,071 --> 00:24:00,071
Subjective experiences have this quality
of being good or bad of feeling a

421
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,750
positive or negative.

422
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,350
They have other valence and we should
be very interested in that fat.

423
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,940
But it's not a fact that somehow separate
from all the other facts about us as

424
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:15,800
human beings. I mean, when are we, when
are we not experiencing an emotion?

425
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,850
When are we not having an emotional
experience? I think we always are.

426
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,420
So I think as we come to
understand more about the body,

427
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,520
about the brain and about the mind,

428
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,760
this distinction between emotion and say
cognition is really going to disappear.

429
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,570
Um,
with that said,

430
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:36,080
you've asked me to make a prediction about
the future of my field. And you know,

431
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:39,050
if you go back and look at scientists
making predictions about the futures in

432
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:42,860
their field, they're almost
always wrong. If that's,

433
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:45,680
because if I actually knew what
the future of my field would be,

434
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:48,980
I'd be doing that. I'd be there. So

435
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,110
for somebody who studies
how bad predictors are, I'm
going to sit back and say,

436
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:57,650
the only thing I predict about the study
of emotion is that it's going to be

437
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,580
really, really exciting. That's
a pretty good prediction.

438
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,380
Stiff can't go wrong there.

439
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,560
So, I mean, related to this then,
when you have students coming to you,

440
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:13,360
undergraduates or graduate students or
just general interested people wanting to

441
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:18,280
pursue topics like emotion or happiness,
what kind of advice do you give them?

442
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:25,100
Well, I think for somebody who is
starting out in the study of emotion,

443
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,340
um, first of all, it's a bravo.

444
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,180
You are studying the single most
important thing about human beings. No,

445
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,780
he sounds self serving,
but it really isn't.

446
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:39,710
Think about what Plato said this.
He said,

447
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:45,170
when we say something is good or bad,
what are we really saying about it?

448
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:50,050
Except that it brings pleasure or pain to
human beings by studying hid Dominic's,

449
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,940
by studying what makes
us feel good or bad.

450
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,930
You're studying the essence of what
we're doing here on earth. I mean,

451
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,750
to me emotion defines value,

452
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,900
which is to say nothing is good or
bad in the world except because of the

453
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:08,810
emotions or feelings that
it brings to human beings.

454
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:13,370
And so I think you're studying the
single most central aspect of the human

455
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:17,390
condition. So congratulations.
Um, practical advice.

456
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,120
Certainly.
Uh,

457
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:24,340
you need to understand physiology and
you need to understand neuroscience.

458
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,850
This is where lots of exciting things
are happening in the study of emotion.

459
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:33,530
Connecting our deep understanding of
it as a subjective experience to our

460
00:26:33,531 --> 00:26:37,100
understanding of how the body and
the brain producing modulator.

461
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:41,660
So I think anybody only understands
the physiology or only understands the

462
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:44,280
psychology is going to be
left out of the future.

463
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:47,610
I think the future belongs to those who
really are going to understand how to

464
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:52,470
put these two things together. But I
suppose my, my watch word would be,

465
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,420
don't forget that what matters about
emotion is subjective experience.

466
00:26:57,421 --> 00:27:00,960
What matters is that we
feel that and if we didn't,

467
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:02,610
we wouldn't care very much about them.

468
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,850
I think it's going to be very
easy in the future as we,

469
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,710
particularly as we gain expertise,

470
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,740
more expertise in the neurosciences to
lose sight of the experiencer of the

471
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:16,410
person who's having the emotion.
And I think if we do that,

472
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:19,710
we've lost sight of why we're
studying emotion in the first place.

473
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,520
Well thank you so much for speaking today.
It was a pleasure.

474
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,213
Mine too.

475
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,820
So this concludes our experts in emotion
interview with Dr. Daniel Gilbert from

476
00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:32,050
Harvard University.
