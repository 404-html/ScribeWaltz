1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,210
Welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,530
Today we'll be talking about the
relationship between emotion and hormones

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,030
delving into the neuroendocrine system
and all its glory and mysteries.

4
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:12,110
As you can see here.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,830
And in particular what we're going to
be doing by concluding with our third

6
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:20,831
segment on emotion and health is looking
at in what way do hormones actually

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:25,160
make us emotional? So when you think
of this as a common expression,

8
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:27,020
that hormones make you emotional,

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,700
but to what extent is empirical science
in the world of emotion actually support

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,710
this sort of lay notion?

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,950
Do emotions actually lead us to be more
hormonal and do hormones make us more

12
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,930
emotional?
So let's talk about hormones.

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,710
Let's first start by defining what
is a hormone in the first place.

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,310
So here you can see in Greek
hormone means to excite.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,560
So stalling was the first of formally
define hormones as the chemical

16
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:55,370
messengers,

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,480
which speeding from cell to cell along
the bloodstream may coordinate the

18
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:02,450
activities and growth of
different parts of the body.

19
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,860
What is the function of hormones?

20
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,090
So we know that hormones bind to
specific receptors located throughout the

21
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:15,040
organism and they're involved in various
bodily processes such as reproduction,

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,610
digestion, growth, metabolism, mood,

23
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,620
cell death or survival,

24
00:01:20,621 --> 00:01:24,700
as well as immune responsivity among
the whole broad host of functions.

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,300
So what's important to know is that
there's three main categories or types of

26
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:33,730
hormones,
so we have steroid hormones,

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,340
androgen estrogens and glucocorticoids.

28
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,750
We have peptide hormones such as
Vasopressin, oxytocin and insulin,

29
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,920
and then we have monoamine hormones such
as norepinephrine and epinephrine. Okay,

30
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:48,970
so steroid hormones, peptide
hormones, and Mondo mean hormones.

31
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,740
What evidence do we have though,

32
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,400
for interactions between
hormones and behaviors? Right?

33
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:59,610
Especially those we're going to think
about as we delve into this lecture today

34
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:01,650
that may be relevant to emotions,

35
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,100
so we know that hormone only dependent
behavior should disappear when the source

36
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:08,910
of the hormone disappears,
right?

37
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,400
We should also see that when you restore
that missing hormone or hormone source,

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,350
then that should restore the behavior.

39
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,940
We should also see that the
hormone concentration and
behavior frequency should

40
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,700
positively correlate with one another.
In other words,

41
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:27,720
is the hormone concentration goes up.
The frequency of that given behavior,

42
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:31,110
we think to be associated with
the hormone should also increase.

43
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,170
So we've talked about what a hormone is,
what its function,

44
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,940
what are the different types of hormones,

45
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,360
and what evidence we should see a
scientist to suggest that there is a

46
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:42,300
relationship between a hormone,
any given behavior.

47
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,190
But how do we collect hormone data?
So there's three different ways we do it.

48
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:51,360
And the bottom line here is that many
of our common bodily fluids contain

49
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:52,194
hormones.

50
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:57,060
So the most common way to collect
hormonal data is to do it through saliva.

51
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,290
And this is most commonly done of ease.
Um,

52
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,810
so participants will spit saliva into a
tube and you'll then be able to look at

53
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,900
its contents for different kinds
of hormone level concentrations.

54
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,210
The second method is blood collection,

55
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,840
though it must be collected with a
sterile needle and done by a certified

56
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:16,130
technician or phlebotomist.
Um,

57
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,570
so it's a bit more complicated when it
comes to the feasibility of collecting

58
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:22,840
these particular types of data.
The third is urine,

59
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:27,370
so it's similarly reliable to
blood, um, but it's cheaper, easier,

60
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,420
and noninvasive.

61
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,080
So how do you store data
once you collect it?

62
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:37,070
So what's really important when it comes
to collecting hormone data is that it

63
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:40,310
must be frozen quite
soon after you collected.

64
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,140
And the storage temperatures
are incredibly cold, so
negative 20 degrees Celsius,

65
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,100
and then you must analyze it
within four months of freezing.

66
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,870
So you've got to put it
in the freezer right away,

67
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:54,350
keep it cold and then analyze
it pretty quickly. Um,

68
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,060
interestingly you also see what are called
super cold or super low freezers that

69
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:01,220
are negative 80 degrees Celsius.

70
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,450
And these are used if you need to keep a
particular sample longterm or what they

71
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:09,310
call archival storage. And if you
do this, you have no limit on,

72
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,580
on storage length.

73
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:12,900
Yeah.

74
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,840
And then the idea of scoring
hormones or an assay.

75
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,730
So hormone levels are determined
if you're looking at saliva,

76
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,640
blood or urine by a process
called Radio Immuno Assay.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,750
So unless your lab is
certified for benchwork,

78
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,950
you have an entire lab
devoted to this process.

79
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,990
Most psychology labs we find often will
ship these frozen samples to independent

80
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:35,220
labs to score them.

81
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,670
And what you'll get and once you send
your samples out is you'll get a nice

82
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:42,900
spreadsheet back with numbers that are
ready to conduct statistical analyses on

83
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:44,160
your hormone of choice.

84
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,590
So I spent some time going through
background of what is a hormone,

85
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:51,360
what is the function,
you know,

86
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:54,840
how do we relate it to behavior and how
do we collect it and score it so that

87
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:57,210
now we can be in a better
position to start our roadmap,

88
00:04:57,211 --> 00:05:00,300
where we're going to talk about two
broad domains of hormones that's in

89
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,250
critically important
for emotion functioning.

90
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,040
This includes stress
hormones and sex hormones.

91
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,310
So we'll go through these two categories
today and then we'll conclude with our

92
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:10,380
takeaway questions and expert interview.

93
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,020
So let's start first now
with stress hormones.

94
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,320
Okay,

95
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,320
so stress,
we talked about this in a recent lecture,

96
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:19,150
but let's revisit what is stress?

97
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,020
So stress has been defined as the degree
to which people have to change and

98
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:27,100
Rayanne readjusts in order to
maintain their sense of homeostasis.

99
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,600
So stress can be either psychological
or it can be physiological and it can

100
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:32,560
either be acute,

101
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,630
so very time limited and brief or can be
more chronic sort of spanning a longer

102
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:41,950
duration of time.
When it comes to psychological stress,

103
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:45,910
it is defined as the degree to which
people have to change and readjust their

104
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,220
lives in response to an externally event.

105
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,700
And as we spoke about and
one of our earlier lectures,

106
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:55,030
stress need not be necessarily
associated with a good or bad event,

107
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:58,910
but we can see stress occurring in all
kinds of situations ranging from is

108
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,760
widely from weddings to funerals,
to graduations,

109
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,140
all of these types of events or sources
of potential psychological stress.

110
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,520
When we think of physiological stress,
by contrast,

111
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:15,470
it's been defined as the degree to which
your body has to regulate its processes

112
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:19,160
in order to maintain a type
of physical homeostasis. Okay,

113
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:23,570
so these are two different broad types
of stress and when we think of stress we,

114
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:26,600
there's kind of two different
kinds of major stress axes.

115
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,070
So we have the hypothalamic pituitary
adrenal access or what's called the HPA

116
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:31,904
axis.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,680
So the HPA access releases glucocorticoid
such as cortisol in response to

118
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:41,120
stress. And you also have what's called
the Sam access or the sympathetic adrenal

119
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:45,200
Medulla Larry Axis. And this releases
catecholomines in response to stress.

120
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:49,100
So these are kind of our two main
kinds of stress axes or systems.

121
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,830
Let's start with cortisol.

122
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:55,730
So this is one of the most widely known
unpopular I stress hormones that's been

123
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,630
utilized across a whole variety of
different types of studies in the field of

124
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:03,980
psychology and specifically in
the field of emotion. So Cortisol,

125
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:05,090
what is cortisol?

126
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,040
So it's a catabolic stress
hormone regulated by the
HPA axis that we just talked

127
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,800
about a moment ago.
And in terms of action,

128
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:17,030
what it does is it helps metabolize
lipids and muscle tissue in order to help

129
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:18,230
release glucose.

130
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,610
And what it can measure then when it
comes to psychological parameters is acute

131
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:23,444
stress.

132
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,160
So you can look at Cortisol reactivity
by looking at what are called phasic

133
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:30,830
changes from one time point to another.

134
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,340
So from someone's resting
baseline measured by saliva.

135
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,660
And you can also then look at these
levels of saliva that reflect cortisol

136
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:40,430
released 18 minutes earlier.

137
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,120
So you can see phase it changes in
reactivity from baseline in response to a

138
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:44,954
stressor.

139
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,470
But what's really important to know is
that cortisol doesn't react right away.

140
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,040
And then what you're likely to see in the
saliva is reflecting cortisol that was

141
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,710
released approximately
18 to 20 minutes earlier.

142
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,150
You can also look at chronic
stress through the use of cortisol.

143
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,210
Here you can look at what's called
the cortisol awakening response.

144
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:06,530
So you can look at the trajectory of
Cortisol and hour upon waking. Um,

145
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,310
and you can also look at what's
called hair cortisol. So these are,

146
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,500
if you actually sample someone's hair,

147
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,730
you can see their average cortisol
levels over the previous four months.

148
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,980
So it's almost crazy to think that we
show signs of stress physically in our

149
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:26,840
hair and that it's a marker of how much
stress we've undergone the previous four

150
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:30,320
months of our life simply by
looking at a strand of hair.

151
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,470
Now I want to move to d. H. E. So
this is an anabolic stress hormone,

152
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,500
also released by the HPA access and
it's action is to protect against tissue

153
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:45,800
damage caused by cortisol by
promoting healing and tissue growth.

154
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,010
So it measures reactivity of sulfate
of Dha, EPA, also known as Dha,

155
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,860
EPA posture, be s and that phasic
changes. You can look at from baseline,

156
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:57,300
also measured in the saliva.

157
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,290
And similarly it's reflecting levels
that were released 18 minutes earlier.

158
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,590
And you can also look at what's called
the anabolic balanced by looking at the

159
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,770
ratio of Dh s to cortisol as well.

160
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,510
And then there's the alpha amylase.
So here,

161
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:16,890
this is a catabolic stress
hormone released by the Sam
access as opposed to the

162
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,470
HPA access. And what this particular
stress hormone does is it met,

163
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,440
helps us to metabolize starches in
the blood as well as brain sugars.

164
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,550
And the key measure is often looking
at reactivity in this particular stress

165
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:32,670
hormone. So again, you can look
at phasic changes from baseline,

166
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,610
measured in the saliva,
but here you've got a shorter time window.

167
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:37,180
So when you look at levels of saliva,

168
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,740
you're seeing amounts of the stress
hormone that were released five minutes

169
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:41,574
earlier.

170
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,450
So we've talked a bit about stress
hormones and what I want you to take home

171
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:49,290
here is that cortisol has been the most
popularized of all of them thus far and

172
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,480
is typically measured
using saliva samples.

173
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,560
And you can look at it both to measure
acute stressors. So sort of Phasic,

174
00:09:55,561 --> 00:10:00,210
reactivities stressors in a lab situation
as well as more chronic or longterm

175
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,860
stress by looking at the cortisol,

176
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:06,330
awakening response and even measuring
hair related cortisol releases.

177
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,570
What I want to turn now though,
is to look at sex hormones.

178
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,310
So we have three different categories of
stress hormones. We have testosterone,

179
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,440
we have extra dial as well as oxytocin.
So let's walk through each of these.

180
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,330
So when we start with testosterone,

181
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,140
we know that testosterone is an anabolic
sex steroid synthesize in both the

182
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:26,280
testes and ovaries.

183
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,620
And we know that tonic or sort of baseline
levels of testosterone are related to

184
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:33,990
dominant behavior.
So this is really interesting.

185
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:37,830
We think about emotion because my
Disney associated with socially dominant

186
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:40,140
categories of emotion,
like pride for example.

187
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,920
It's also associated with the
regulation of the HPA stress,

188
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:46,140
access during dominance related tasks,

189
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,100
and of course as related as many of us
think about in terms of sexual libido,

190
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:53,610
both for men and women. Interestingly,
when we think about, again,

191
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,340
emotional behavior and in the
realm of social dominance,

192
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,580
we see phasic increases in testosterone
after people win competitions.

193
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,730
So we might think about this as an index
of dominant related behavior. And again,

194
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,620
I think of the discrete emotion of pride,

195
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,280
which is associated with displaying
one's elevated status within a social

196
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:12,114
hierarchy.

197
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,070
So can we think of testosterone is helping
us gauge specific kinds of emotions

198
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:21,780
that are related to elevating one's
sense of self status or experiencing some

199
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:26,250
sort of social class distinction of
one being more socially dominant than

200
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:29,880
another. These are some
interesting questions that
are currently being explored.

201
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,390
What we have seen when you look at
testosterone in situations of social

202
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:38,130
competition is that you see phasic
changes in testosterone after competition.

203
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,820
So while winners of a competition show
an increase in testosterone losers show a

204
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:44,844
decrease.

205
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,230
So we're seeing also testosterone change
in terms of whether people experience,

206
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,630
you know,
rewards or losses as well.

207
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,040
So it's sensitive to the type of stimuli
that is emotionally laden as well as an

208
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,861
environment too.

209
00:11:56,861 --> 00:12:00,100
So reward we've talked about in this
course as being associated with a whole

210
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:04,840
type of positive approach related emotions
and loss as being associated with a

211
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:07,720
type of negative withdrawal
related emotions as well.

212
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,020
Now here we think of estrodial.

213
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,790
So this is an antibiotic sex steroid
metabolites from testosterone and tonic

214
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:20,791
levels are related interestingly to
positive mood and lower levels are related

215
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,970
to the experience and
severity of mood disorders.

216
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,480
Now interestingly,
if we turn to Oxytocin,

217
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,590
we also see that head has wide reaching
implications for emotion as well.

218
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,540
So oxytocin is a neuropeptide that doubles
as a hormone and there's been a lot

219
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:42,100
of research on oxytocin as what they
call the love hormone or the attachment

220
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:42,934
hormone.

221
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,140
So we see it associated with a whole
host of affiliate of types of behaviors

222
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:51,070
between people. So it's really set these
kind of key social attachment events.

223
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,690
So sexual climax,

224
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:56,200
but also childbirth and nursing
in a monogamous mammals.

225
00:12:56,201 --> 00:13:00,760
It coworkers with dopamine receptors
in the brain and it actually increases

226
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:02,320
trust among strangers.

227
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,250
So there's been experimental studies
showing that if you can manipulate the

228
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:10,330
levels of oxytocin people experience
sometimes their intra nasal spray,

229
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,760
they'll actually trust other people more.

230
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,660
So it's a sense in which it sort of
brings us and binds us socially to other

231
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:19,300
people.
So hence has been called the love hormone.

232
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,020
And if we think about how might this
be relevant to our emotional lives?

233
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:26,470
Well we've talked about a whole variety
of different distinct classes of

234
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:27,550
emotions thus far.

235
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,840
And you might think about some of the
socially relevant or prosocial emotions.

236
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,010
And to what extent do motions
like compassion, love,

237
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,420
maybe even gratitude.

238
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,530
To what extent can we look at these in
conjunction with levels of oxytocin?

239
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,350
So these are some of the exciting
empirical questions that are being

240
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:46,660
investigated by aspect
of science researchers,

241
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,950
is how can we look at some
of these hormones we've
talked about today and relate

242
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:55,180
them to some of the key kinds of emotions
and they're distinct functions that

243
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:57,010
we've talked about thus far in this class.

244
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,860
And how can we think about the
measurement of hormones through

245
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:04,780
neuroendocrinology as a really important
and novel tool in our repertoire?

246
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,300
So we've talked about
subjective reports of emotion,

247
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:10,600
outward displays of expressive behavior,
neuroimaging.

248
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,590
To what extent can we now think about
leveraging insights from our understanding

249
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:19,570
of hormones and human behavior to even
better understand our emotional wellbeing

250
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:21,670
and regulation on another level.

251
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,630
So I talked about hormone state because
it's an exciting new methodological tool

252
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,830
that only recently have people in the
field of human emotion really tried to

253
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:31,570
grasp onto and to leverage,

254
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:36,100
to gain insights into how it might help
us understand our own emotional makeup.

255
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,210
So with that, we've talked a
little bit about stress hormones,

256
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:41,770
a little bit about sex hormones,

257
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,240
talked at the end about what kinds of
potential empirical insights we can gain

258
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:47,140
from this.
And again,

259
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:51,080
these are sort of novel cutting edge
tools that were only recently beginning to

260
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:52,610
apply to the study of emotion.

261
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,660
So want you to think about as a student
or someone who's interested in emotion,

262
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,960
how might you use these tools to better
understand emotions ranging from pride,

263
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,860
compassion,
gratitude,

264
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,790
as well as social bonding and how
emotions help subserve that function.

265
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,940
So with that, I'm going to turn
now to our takeaway questions.

266
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,380
Our first question asks,

267
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,280
what is a hormone and what are the
specific types of hormones that were

268
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:21,200
discussed at the beginning
of our lecture today?

269
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,530
And in what way can you try to conduct
data collection if you're someone

270
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:28,070
interested in scientifically measuring
and collecting these data samples.

271
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,750
Second,

272
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,780
what are the distinct stress hormones
that were discussed today and what does

273
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:34,610
each of their respective functions?

274
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:35,920
Okay,

275
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,160
what are the distinct sex hormones that
were discussed today and what does each

276
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:41,260
of their respective functions as well?

277
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,233
Yeah.

278
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,380
Now I want to turn to
our expert interview.

279
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:51,010
This is part of our experts in emotion
interview series today for experts in

280
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,560
emotion interview. We have the honor of
speaking with doctor [inaudible] Mehta.

281
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,850
So Dr Mehta is currently an assistant
professor of psychology at the University

282
00:15:58,851 --> 00:15:59,684
of Oregon.

283
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,040
He received his Ba from Williams college
and his phd in social personality

284
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,620
psychology from the
University of Texas at Austin.

285
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,560
Before starting at the
University of Oregon as faculty,

286
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,040
he completed postdoctoral
fellowships as a Columbia University,

287
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:17,270
as well as Erasmus University and the
Donders institute in the Netherlands.

288
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,470
His research examines the psychological
and biological processes that help

289
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:24,110
regulate status,
hierarchies and decision making.

290
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,150
So I now turn to a very special experts
in emotion interview together with Dr

291
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:33,680
[inaudible] Mehta on emotion and hormones
and upcoming and very exciting field.
