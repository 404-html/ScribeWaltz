1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,050
So today for our experts in
emotion interview series,

2
00:00:03,051 --> 00:00:06,890
we'll be speaking with Dr. Michael
Norton on consumerism and emotion.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,030
So Dr. Norton is an associate professor
of business administration and the

4
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:14,690
marketing unit and a Marvin Bower
fell at the Harvard business school.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,800
He holds a BA in psychology and English
from Williams college and a phd in

6
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:20,690
psychology from Princeton University.

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,060
Prior to joining the
Harvard Business School,

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,040
Dr. Norton was a fellow at the MIT media
lab and Mit Sloan School of management.

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,110
He's the coauthor along with Elizabeth
Dunn of the Book Happy Money.

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,850
The signs of smarter spending.

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,270
His work has been published in a
number of leading academic journals,

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,810
including science, the Journal of
personality and social psychology,

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,570
Psychological Science,
and the Journal of consumer research.

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,020
His work has also been covered in
media outlets including the economist,

15
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:51,110
the Financial Times, the Wall Street
Journal, and the Washington Post.

16
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,160
Dr. Norton has also appeared
on the national public
radio and written op eds for

17
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:57,920
the New York Times,
Forbes and the Los Angeles Times.

18
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,700
His research has twice been featured
in the New York Times magazine year in

19
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:06,170
ideas issue in 2007 for his work
on ambiguity promoting liking.

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,440
And in 2009 on the counter if itself his
the Ikea effect when Labor leads to lab

21
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,780
was featured in Harvard Business
Review's breakthrough ideas.

22
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,810
In 2009 in 2010 he won the theoretical
innovation prize from the Society of

23
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:21,920
personality and social psychology.

24
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,270
In 2011 he won the Sage Young Scholars
Award from the foundation for social and

25
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:27,590
personality psychology.

26
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,750
And in 2012 he was selected for wired
magazine's smart list as one of the 50

27
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:34,400
people who will change the world.

28
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,840
So I now turn to our experts and emotion
interview with Dr. Michael Norton on

29
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:42,960
consumerism and emotion.
Welcome Mike.

30
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:44,400
Thanks for speaking with us today.

31
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,470
So I'd like to begin by speaking with
you about how you got started studying

32
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:53,130
emotion. So could you tell us a little
bit about what first got you interested in

33
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:53,964
emotion?

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,011
Sure thing.

35
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:59,690
So I was working at the time with
my frequent collaborator Dan Ariely,

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,700
and Dan is an Israeli Jew.

37
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,170
And I am an Irish Catholic and we made
a bet which was who was more miserable,

38
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,270
uh,
Catholics or Jews.

39
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:12,620
And the way we decided to test it was
to send some undergrads out to different

40
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:17,450
places of worship all over Boston and
get pre and post ratings of happiness

41
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,400
before and after religious services.

42
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,570
And we wanted to see the paper was
going to be called any given Sunday.

43
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:27,410
And the idea was if you had to pick
one religion to go to on any given day,

44
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:31,130
which one you should you go do to get
happiest. So it really started as a,

45
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,060
and I won't tell you the answer
because it was controversial, but yeah,

46
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,780
I would really started as a bet,

47
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,680
which was if we think about daily
things that we can do in our life,

48
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,390
what are little things that we could do?

49
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:44,720
So not like how do you get a
better job or increase your salary,

50
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,290
but literally if you've got an extra hour
of time and you wanted to do something

51
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,390
vaguely religious,
what should you go and do?

52
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,480
And then we started to look at also
things like going to the gym and going to

53
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:57,320
yoga. So what are the best little
activities that you can do to improve your

54
00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:57,890
happiness?

55
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,780
And that really was the interest along
was the little things that you might be

56
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:05,180
able to do rather than sometimes the
big global things we often think about.

57
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,670
Wow,
that's really interesting.

58
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:09,130
And how long ago was that
first project that you did?

59
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,110
We did that in probably 2003
or four or something like that.

60
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,030
We've actually published a paper related
to those data, which, which was about,

61
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,340
uh, the fact that religion
makes you really happy,

62
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:25,720
which a lot of people have shown, but only
if you believe a lot in your religion.

63
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,381
So in fact,

64
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:30,940
if you look at people who say that they're
Catholic or say that they're a Muslim

65
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:33,130
and then they don't believe
that much in their religion,

66
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,610
they're actually less happy than people
who don't go to church at all or don't

67
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:37,600
go to services at all.

68
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:41,710
So it looks like there's a point at which
it's better to be believe in nothing

69
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:44,120
than to believe a little bit and
whatever religion you belong to.

70
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,960
Thanks. That's really interesting. Um,
what I'd like to ask you about now,

71
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:52,230
it's just some questions about
your current research. Um,

72
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,350
so we've all heard the expression,
you've heard it many times,

73
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:57,890
I'm sure that money can't buy happiness.
Um,

74
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,530
but your recent research suggests
that this is not entirely true.

75
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,310
So in what ways can money
actually make us feel happier?

76
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,940
Yeah, I think that this, uh, um, a lot
of kind of religions have this phrase of,

77
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:14,810
you know, money can't buy happiness and
a lot of self help gurus have it as well.

78
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,040
And I think the sentiment behind
it is true, which is that, uh,

79
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,030
money isn't the only thing that can buy
you happiness or maybe even more of that.

80
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,190
The key to happiness isn't just money.

81
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:28,190
So if you think that the only thing you
should do with all your time is get more

82
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:31,400
money and that's what will make you
really happy, you're probably wrong.

83
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,780
But at the same time,

84
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:36,590
that doesn't mean that the way that you
use your money can't really impact your

85
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:40,010
hat happiness a lot.
So when Liz and I started this research,

86
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:44,660
the idea was basically maybe money can
buy you a little bit more happiness than

87
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:45,560
it does right now.

88
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,200
And the reason it doesn't right now
is it because we don't spend it well?

89
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,050
And if you think about what
we and I spend our money on,

90
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:53,540
usually it's things like
stuff for ourselves.

91
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:58,541
So we buy a bigger TV and a nicer car
and a bigger house and those things are

92
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:00,560
all great and they're nice to have.

93
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,320
But research shows they don't
really make us that much happier,

94
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,870
are just nice to have.
And we thought, well,

95
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:08,900
what are things we could get people to
do with their money that are different

96
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,710
than kind of buying stuff for themselves?
And the original idea really was,

97
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,980
well what if we just radically changed
the focus of who you're spending on?

98
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,550
So maybe if you stop spending on
yourself all the time and being selfish,

99
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,980
but spent a little money on
somebody else for a change,

100
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,020
that it might actually
make you a lot happier.

101
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,180
They'd get happier for sure
because they're getting a present.

102
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,900
But it might actually make you happy or
a result of engaging in what we call pro

103
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:30,734
social spending.

104
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,090
Very interesting. So you know, related to
that, you know, your book with Liz Dunn,

105
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:38,640
you know, it's talking about
the science of smarter spending.

106
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,650
So I wonder your thoughts on how can we
balance both spending our money wisely

107
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,450
but also trying to be happy as well. How
do we balance those two things at once?

108
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,210
Yeah, it's, it's very hard actually. So I
mean, one of the things that we don't do,

109
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,210
not clearly in general with our
money to save it, uh, so, uh,

110
00:05:56,211 --> 00:05:59,630
savings rates in are very,
very low compared to other countries.

111
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,110
It actually gone up a little
bit since the 2008, 2009.

112
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,980
It looks like they're going back down
again now. Uh, and saving is good.

113
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:10,250
Not just because it's why
I've just financially and
interest rates and all those

114
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:12,650
sorts of things.
But because if you save now,

115
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:16,040
you're basically guaranteeing
yourself some happiness later in life.

116
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,700
So having no money when you're 65 and
is not pleasant because you have to

117
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:22,070
somehow when you retire.
But again,

118
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:26,090
those are kind of big longterm decisions
that people make and those are really

119
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:28,070
important to make.
But would we want it to look at,

120
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:32,060
are these everyday little behaviors that
you could do right now? So literally,

121
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:34,130
if you have an extra $5 today,

122
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,900
what should you do with the $5 to
make yourself happiest with that $5?

123
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:43,010
And it's things like literally rather
than buy yourself a coffee by somebody

124
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:44,420
else, a coffee. Yeah,

125
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:47,690
you don't get the caffeine and the
optimum Starbucks thing for yourself,

126
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,490
but giving it away to somebody else and
we have data that that supports this

127
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,490
will make you happier than spending
that little amount of money on yourself.

128
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,960
Sounds like a great book.
I'm looking forward to reading it myself.

129
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,400
Happy money that signs a smarter spending.
Um,

130
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,650
what I thought might be fun to talk
about in our last question is some of the

131
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:07,960
work that you and I've
been doing together, um,

132
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,920
where are we find that sort of the
greater abundance and variety of emotions

133
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:15,850
that people experience shows that they're
actually better off both mentally and

134
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:17,950
physically.
And I think this brings up the question,

135
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:22,570
is it really better to have more emotions
overall? Uh, even negative emotions?

136
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,250
What are you thinking about this?

137
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,970
Yeah, definitely it comes to mind. So I
think it's, it's pretty counterintuitive.

138
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:31,410
I think even even for us,
that,

139
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:33,930
that having more negative
emotions on any given day,

140
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,460
you're feeling ashamed and sad
and fearful and things like that,

141
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:40,100
that could possibly be
better for you. Hmm. Uh,

142
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,170
but I think if you think about what
the counterfactual universities,

143
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,830
it makes a little bit more sense.
So for example, imagine all day,

144
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:51,060
every day you felt really happy, every
minute of every day you felt happy, happy,

145
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:52,770
happy, happy. I think,

146
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:55,020
and we don't have the data for this
cause no one really feels that way.

147
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:59,430
I think you'd probably go crazy if you
felt the same exact positive thing all

148
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:03,300
the time. And if you didn't go crazy
from feeling happy, happy, happy, happy,

149
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,520
you might also just get
used to feeling happy.

150
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:09,660
And we know that things like adaptation
happen over time, so happy is great,

151
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,130
but we can get weirdly tired of happy
and we can wish that we were something

152
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:15,270
else other than happy.

153
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,350
And in those cases it might be great to
feel proud instead of happy or another

154
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:20,184
positive thing,

155
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,390
but it might be the case then it's
sometimes good even to feel scared or sad

156
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:28,260
instead of happy just to disrupt
the sameness of everyday life.

157
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,300
And I just actually was reading
some interesting research about um,

158
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,110
people who have generalized anxiety
disorder. And one of the issues is that,

159
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,780
that um, the research was suggesting
is that they, if they have,

160
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:44,850
if they have depression and anxiety,
they don't want to be depressed anymore.

161
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:48,750
But the idea of doing anything different
provoked so much anxiety that they'd

162
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:51,720
rather stay depressed then
take the risk of some change.

163
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:53,550
That might be very anxiety provoking.

164
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,300
And if you think about how that out
with the diversity of your emotions,

165
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,470
it might be better to feel, not just
depressed all the time, but maybe scared,

166
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,740
at least scared is different from feeling
depressed and that might prompt you to

167
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:05,700
have higher wellbeing.

168
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,200
That's so interesting because if,
you know,

169
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:11,650
this work is saying that a different
variety of emotions is going to sort of

170
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:15,310
open our mind to new kinds of experiences
and actually be healthy for healthier

171
00:09:15,311 --> 00:09:16,840
for us.
But at the same time,

172
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:19,990
some of the people who need that the most
like people suffering from generalized

173
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:24,700
anxiety disorder having the hardest time
doing it. That's right. Yeah. Interesting.

174
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,530
So you know, this is this work on
emotional, uh, diversity and variety.

175
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,170
Do you think there's any way you can
link it with the work on spending?

176
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:36,250
So should we be trying to spend our money
on very different kinds of emotional

177
00:09:36,251 --> 00:09:40,810
experiences to sort of buy different
kinds of variety for ourselves in our

178
00:09:40,811 --> 00:09:41,650
emotional life?

179
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,350
I think so. I mean, I think if you look
at at some of the research, uh, on,

180
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,030
on how to spend your money to get happier.

181
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,840
So Liz and I and our colleagues have
done research on spending money on other

182
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,910
people as a way to make yourself happier.

183
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,310
And that's a thing that we don't often do.

184
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:59,880
So if you think about what we do
every day and how we feel every day,

185
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,790
just the act of spending money
on someone else is different.

186
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,580
And that difference in that
diversity might be enough.

187
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,240
Tom Gilovich and leaf and Bowen and
their colleagues have shown that spending

188
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:13,500
money on experiences instead of stuff
for yourself is also associated with more

189
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:17,490
happiness. And again, you can think that
buying different experiences, again,

190
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,760
we'll increase the diversity of your
emotions and that might be part of the

191
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:22,890
reason why buying
experiences makes you happy.

192
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:26,250
So it could be part of the reason that
spending your money differently makes you

193
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,760
happier is simply because doing
different things make you happier,

194
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,860
which I think is what our
research tends to suggest.

195
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,180
That's really interesting.

196
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:36,390
So we should be spending our money on
other people and spending it on different

197
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:37,740
kinds of experiences.

198
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,670
All right. And ideally both
at the same time actually.

199
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,490
So experiences with other people
is kind of a the perfect storm.

200
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,350
Excellent. Excellent. So I mean,

201
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:49,770
you've done such interesting research
on spending and happiness and emotional

202
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:53,910
diversity. So if you think about
the face of the future for emotion,

203
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,750
what do you see in store? What do you
see as the next steps on the horizon?

204
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,471
To me,

205
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:04,471
I think one of the most important next
steps and the reason that it unimportant

206
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,180
next step is because it's very hard to do,

207
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,740
is to look at how these interventions
that that I and lots of other people have

208
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:14,890
been coming up with to change your
happiness in the moment might lead to

209
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:17,710
sustained changes in
your overall happiness.

210
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:22,000
And we know from lots of research by
Dan Gilbert and other people that in

211
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:25,720
general we have this hedonic treadmill
where once something good happens,

212
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:29,620
but then we kind of get used to it and
we end up a little bit closer to where we

213
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:31,240
were when we started then we'd like to be.

214
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,510
But thinking about how the
kinds of interventions that um,

215
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,440
behavioral scientists are coming up with
can not only make you happier today or

216
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:41,710
this week, but really change
your happiness over time. And,

217
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,730
and both in regular people, you
know, just making you feel fine,

218
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:46,960
but we could make you a little happier.

219
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:50,480
But I think especially in clinical
populations where you have, you know,

220
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,550
severe depression,

221
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,360
are there interventions that scientists
have come up with that can change their

222
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:58,630
wellbeing? Again, not just
for a day or an hour a week,

223
00:11:58,631 --> 00:11:59,830
but really in the longer term.

224
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,863
That's great.

225
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,290
And so when you think about the
future and a big part of the future,

226
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:10,291
our new students and people wanting to
embark and new directions and emotion,

227
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,180
if they came to you, Mike, and
they said, what advice were you,

228
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,290
what'd you have for us as we're thinking
about, you know, embarking on this new,

229
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,000
uh, you know, area of emotion, what
should I do? What might you say to them?

230
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,570
That's a hard one. I think one of
the key things for any academic,

231
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:29,900
I still work on new things. And so, uh,

232
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,990
which is terrible advice to someone
and she was working on something new,

233
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:34,700
but don't tell them what the new thing is.

234
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,450
But I think if you think about
the way emotion goes, you know,

235
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:41,810
there are different researchers working
on different aspects of emotion.

236
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,950
And often the biggest impact research
is people who take an entirely new

237
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,710
approach to how emotion works
in everyday life. You know,

238
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:52,100
whether it's looking at different
populations or coming up with new

239
00:12:52,101 --> 00:12:54,260
interventions,
whatever those things might be,

240
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,790
there's a tendency to kind of iterate
and as you know and academia on,

241
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,290
now that we know this one thing,
let's really unpack it and that's very,

242
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,190
very important for science because we
need to understand what's going on in

243
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,990
great detail.
But for a new researcher,

244
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,560
which you're really trying to push for
is what is a new area of emotion that we

245
00:13:12,561 --> 00:13:16,700
haven't studied and my sense is that
there are a million things that we don't

246
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:20,060
know about of all the great work that's
been done by people in the field.

247
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,330
There are a million things that we
don't know. So just as one example,

248
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,220
a graduate student of mine,

249
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,390
the lean to nick and I started a project
on the feeling of being talked about,

250
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,160
which is I think,

251
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,250
and if you think about how you would feel
if two people went into a room and you

252
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:36,830
knew they were talking about you and
you had to sit there and wait until they

253
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:40,130
came back. It's a weird
aversive, unique feeling.

254
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:44,240
I think it's probably a actually an
important human emotion because gossip and

255
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:47,930
reputation are so fundamental
to how humans work, and we know,

256
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,610
I'm not saying this is the
most important emotion,

257
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,200
but we know nothing about that feeling.

258
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,110
It probably drives a lot of
social behavior and other things.

259
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,220
I think there's lots of emotions and
people disagree on how to define what an

260
00:13:58,221 --> 00:13:58,791
emotion is,

261
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:02,600
but there's lots of these really just
street emotional experiences that are very

262
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:05,450
fundamental to being human
that we know very little about,

263
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:07,250
and they're just waiting
to be studied by somebody.

264
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:08,801
That's interesting.

265
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:11,440
I guess we'll have to wonder what people
are going to say about our interview

266
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:15,280
today. You know, we're not
watching. Well, thanks.

267
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,500
It can be ugly. It can. It's a
discrete emotion experience. Hmm. Well,

268
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:22,240
thanks Mike for Speaking with us today.

269
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,920
This concludes our expert and emotion
interview with Dr. Michael Norton from

270
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:28,000
Harvard University.
