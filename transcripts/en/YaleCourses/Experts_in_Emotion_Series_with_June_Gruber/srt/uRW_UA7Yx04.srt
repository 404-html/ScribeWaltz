1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,780
Our experts and emotion interview today
will be with Doctor Matthew Hurts and

2
00:00:04,781 --> 00:00:09,370
sign. He received his phd from the
University of California Berkeley and he's

3
00:00:09,371 --> 00:00:13,570
currently an associate professor of
psychology at de Paul University where he

4
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:15,970
directs the touch and emotion laboratory.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,200
So his research is
conducted with students, um,

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:25,230
in three areas including touch and the
communication of emotion as well as the

7
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:28,540
prediction of emotion
and emotion and infants.

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,610
His work has received widespread
media coverage including NPR,

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,110
the New York Times,
ABC News,

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,190
BBC scientific American
mind and psychology today.

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,610
So I now turn to our experts and
emotion interview with Doctor Matthew

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,443
Hertenstein.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,050
So what I thought we could start off
I'm talking about is just a little bit

14
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:53,860
about hearing your story of what first
got you interested in the topic of

15
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:54,694
emotion.

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,810
I mean,
really briefly,

17
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,530
the thing that really got me in
emotion was studying babies. Um,

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,600
as you might imagine,

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,640
a emotions are the primary means
of communication for events.

20
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,890
They don't obviously have language.
Um,

21
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,050
and so babies are really
where it started for me.

22
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,400
And I still study infants as day,
but I also study in dogs as well.

23
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:20,370
So these are really what got
me started down the road.

24
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,041
Fantastic.

25
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:25,370
So I want to ask you now a little bit
about your journey down the road of

26
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:29,030
emotion and sort of some themes about
some of the really exciting research that

27
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:30,170
you've done in this domain.

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,700
So you're well known for
this really exciting and
influential work on the nature

29
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:39,620
of touch and emotion. So to begin, for
those who may not have heard of this work,

30
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,950
how can touch function as
a mode of communication in
general and human species?

31
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,940
Great question. Um, it's a question
that we're, we're getting a handle on,

32
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:54,540
but were there still a lot to learn? There
are a lot more questions than answers.

33
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,771
Um,
but you know,

34
00:01:55,771 --> 00:02:00,600
we see touch in our relationships
with other people. Um,

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,100
you know,
with our kids,

36
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:06,600
with our siblings that we might
have our intimate relationships.

37
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:10,380
So it bonds us to other people.
Um,

38
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,600
talk is really important in power,
a hierarchy. So you see different,

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,760
ah, facets of touch being used
depending on who was powerful,

40
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,080
less powerful. So those differential
relationships you see touching, um,

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,900
touched increases liking of other people,

42
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:32,100
usually as long as it's obviously used
appropriately and in con proper contacts.

43
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,270
Um, so we see it there. Uh,
compliance is a big one.

44
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,380
There's been a lot of research shows
that when we touch other people,

45
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:44,130
when we ask them for something or
for help or something like that,

46
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,520
touch really increases compliance. So, um,

47
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,450
well known study where a
medical practitioner touches
his or her patient while

48
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:58,020
telling them that it's important to
take their medicine. And sure enough,

49
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:02,040
the people who are touched, um, take
their medicine more frequently and w uh,

50
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,580
as instructed versus the people who in a
control condition, you aren't, I still,

51
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:09,070
compliance is also a big,
big deal,

52
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:13,540
but what I focus on and it's the how
touch communicates emotion in our

53
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,374
relationships.

54
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,280
So how can touch communicate emotions?

55
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,000
Well, no, there's a variety of ways.
We're just learning about this. I mean,

56
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:25,220
one of the ways is,
you know,

57
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:29,000
there are specific receptors
within the skin that are, you know,

58
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,030
no susceptive or another way,

59
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,330
fancy way of saying is just induces
pain pretty easily. Right? So there's,

60
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,060
so some touches just inherently negative,

61
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,970
but then also some touches
inherently positive, right?

62
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:45,290
So just in terms of the tactile
receptors we have in our skin,

63
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,880
um, they're called, those are
steaming lane will influence how,

64
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,280
what emotions we perceive
through that put a lot of it, um,

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,630
is potentially learning. I mean, like I,

66
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,380
I talked to before about
babies and emotion,

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,930
I mean touches fundamental to the
relationship between parents and their

68
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:04,220
offspring.
Um,

69
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:08,990
so from almost day one were being poached
and stroke and cuddled and all this

70
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:12,710
sort of stuff, even though by the way
it goes away, um, and most of our,

71
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,180
and adolescents in our adult life,

72
00:04:14,181 --> 00:04:17,450
which we can have a whole nother
discussion about. Okay. Um, but anyway,

73
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:20,900
so there's a lot of learning and it goes
on because that can mean that language,

74
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:25,140
so to speak, up of touches the,
to us early in line. And then I'm,

75
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,550
I have no doubt that through some sort
of evolutionary underpinnings to a lot of

76
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:32,350
this, um, and you know, we can
see a lot of this too, and we,

77
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,290
when we studied chimpanzees or whatnot,
um, so it's a of a combination,

78
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:40,490
but teasing these things
apart and understanding how
they interact is sort of,

79
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,500
you know,
a future researchers dream.

80
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,670
So one really exciting thing about the
work you've done in this domain is you've

81
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:50,690
developed this really innovative paradigm
for studying the communication of

82
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,670
touch in a laboratory setting.

83
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:55,400
And I wonder if you could share
a little bit about this. Um,

84
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,300
I know that the work we've done together
has used your fantastic paradigm and

85
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:02,570
it's just such an elegant
and a unusual way.

86
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,600
And some people might think of
learning, uh, how we can study,

87
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:06,800
touch in these contexts.

88
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,230
Yeah, I mean, actually it's
pretty deceptively simple. Um,

89
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,430
we've done it a variety of different
ways. The first time, and we did this,

90
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:18,990
we had two people I'm sitting across
from each other at a table and that's a

91
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:22,940
barrier between the two
people. Um, I clock barrier,

92
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:24,630
so they couldn't see each
other that didn't know.

93
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:26,460
You didn't know if a male or a female,

94
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,060
Liz sitting across from you to
know their age. They never spoke.

95
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:31,350
So you've been telling you that.

96
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,940
And then one person was randomly
assigned to put their arm underneath the

97
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:40,800
curtain and the other person basically
was told to communicate a variety of

98
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:45,540
different types of emotions
just on the arm. And, um,

99
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,610
the question that we're asking is how
accurate are equal at perceiving those

100
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:54,570
emotions. Um, and so we
borrowed methodology, um,

101
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,620
from other researchers. You've
studied the face, the boys.

102
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,060
And so this was all on our
own, um, whatsoever. Um,

103
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,560
and essentially we found that sure enough,
uh,

104
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,510
touch communicates you specific emotions.
Um,

105
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,630
I'm the white, the face and the
voice, although some different ones,

106
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:14,690
which we can talk about. Um, but you know,

107
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,640
before we did the studies,

108
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,380
some researchers tended
to think that I'm not all,

109
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,440
but some researchers tend to think that
touch might communicate positive or

110
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:28,550
negative emotion,
but nothing specific or the street.

111
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:31,080
So it's this research line,
uh,

112
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,140
kind of debunks that idea and
shows that we're actually,

113
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:38,960
it's touches a really sophisticated means
by which we communicate our emotions.

114
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,310
And did you find

115
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,370
specific patterns of touch for
distinct kinds of emotions?

116
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:44,540
You could say a little bit about,

117
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,550
I wonder if people in the
audience are wondering.

118
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:50,180
So how does something like anger
look different from love for example?

119
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,260
Right. That's a great question. I mean,
here's the take home message about,

120
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,520
uh,
Bob not,

121
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,820
is there is far more
diversity in how indicate uh,

122
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:06,150
via touched then there are
specific patterns. So we,

123
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,460
I'm working on,
we,

124
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,480
my collaborators and I are working on
coming up with clinical prototypes for uh,

125
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,230
or refer the tapes of how we might
communicate stinky emotions be attached,

126
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,520
but there's nothing, uh, it's very
difficult to come up with that.

127
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,520
I'm partly because of the
methodology is very, um,

128
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,950
rudimentary right now in
terms of measuring touch.

129
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:29,680
And so I wouldn't say easy to
measure a facial expression,

130
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,600
but there was a system out there,
right, that we all know that, um,

131
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,790
I'm sure other speakers in
your series discussed. Um,

132
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,310
but there is no such standardized
system and be able to touch.

133
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,970
So we're trying to come up with one of
those so that we can better get a grasp

134
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:48,450
on what exactly the question
you're asking. Sorry.

135
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,480
I mean your work on touch and emotion
is also revealed some really important

136
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,080
individual differences, right.
In how we perceive, you know,

137
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:00,650
this touch signal from other people,
sort of what it communicates to us.

138
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,180
And for example,

139
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,510
I wonder if you could say a little bit
perhaps about how men and women may

140
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:06,530
differ,
you know,

141
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:09,950
and how they perceive or utilized
touches to communicate emotions.

142
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,280
Well, just for a second, let me back up
and say that in our herd and we, that we,

143
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,050
we'd done both with the arm and then
we've got a whole body touch. Sure. Wow.

144
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,300
And we found that men and women can
communicate a variety of different emotion

145
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:30,130
like fear or sadness or discuss
low gratitude, sympathy.

146
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:34,930
All of these are above chance levels that
are common between both men and women.

147
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,600
And notice, by the way, that somebody,

148
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,080
these emotions are the same as what
is communicated, um, accurately.

149
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:44,290
In the face and the voice. But some
of those emotions are different, um,

150
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,260
in the face and the voice.
And I think that's a good opportunity for,

151
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,470
for future researchers to
have to kind of tackle that.

152
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,040
So he gets to your question
about men and women. Um,

153
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,910
I really wish we were in the
founding differences, frankly, um,

154
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,130
because they sort of support these
stereotypes that some people have. Um,

155
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:04,970
so I wished we went found gender
differences, but we did and you know,

156
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,820
I have to go where, where nature
and so we found, you know,

157
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,250
in our, in our paradigm, right,
you can have a male, female,

158
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,520
female and touching a male or it can
have two males where you can have a few

159
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:20,840
females so you can have every
gender a combination possible CSP.

160
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,630
And we found the only gender combination
that was unsuccessful at communicating

161
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,830
anger where all female died. So, um,

162
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,350
if you get two women together and you tell
one to communicate anger to the other,

163
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,300
um, they're not above chance doing
that. If you have a male involved,

164
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,280
um, in, in that grouping,
um, they are able to so,

165
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,173
so that,

166
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:53,290
so anger seems to be not as easy
for women communicate as men.

167
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,520
And then the other emotion, again,
I wish I didn't find these funny.

168
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:04,530
I know one of the ones that
we found was a sympathy.

169
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,640
And as you might guess,
um,

170
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,790
meaning we're much
better at this than men.

171
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,530
When you got to have two men together,

172
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,450
they couldn't communicate that above
chance levels. Um, so again, I wish,

173
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,650
I wish I wouldn't have found those,
those gender differences. Um, but I,

174
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,930
you know, we, and we can only take
guesses as to why. I mean is it,

175
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,430
I believe it's near harder, the origins,
our evolutionary heritage in that,

176
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:37,350
um, you can look to the animal
butcher and see some of that. Um,

177
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,090
but obviously socialization,
you playing a huge role. Um,

178
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:44,540
and I don't think I would want to
discount that at this point know.

179
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,340
So one other area of individual
differences that I know
you and I have talked a

180
00:10:49,341 --> 00:10:53,450
little bit about is the
role of communicating and
proceeding touch and emotional

181
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:55,040
disorders. So, for example,

182
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,610
I know you've done some
work in individuals with a
history of mood disorders

183
00:10:58,611 --> 00:10:59,480
like mania.

184
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,410
And I wonder if you could say a little
bit about how their experience of touch

185
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:04,940
and the way that they,
you know,

186
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,960
perceive touches might be different
from the rest of the population.

187
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,740
That's a great question. Oh, we're just
beginning to get a bead on that. And,

188
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,760
um, one of our art, it's an
a really nice finding, um,

189
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:22,230
that our group was actually
done is basically looking
at people with people who

190
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:26,540
are prone to high degrees of positive
emotion. And those people are,

191
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,660
we meet,

192
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,660
I'm somewhat more accurate overall at
perceiving these distinct emotions.

193
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:38,010
Um, in the paradigm I discussed
with you. And I'm not only that,

194
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:41,080
but they tend to over attribute,
um,

195
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,820
positive emotions to all the touches
they, they perceive home, um,

196
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,580
uh, people. So this is over
attribution of positive emotion,

197
00:11:49,581 --> 00:11:53,770
sort of under attribution of negative
emotion. So, you know, I don't,

198
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,840
we don't fully understand that completely,

199
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,480
but we know that there is this
individual difference that's,

200
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,970
that's coming out of the data.
Um,

201
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,650
so everything feels good,
right?

202
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,480
Everything feels good and, and
they're, they're more accurate,

203
00:12:06,481 --> 00:12:11,340
which is pretty surprising in some
ways. Um, but maybe it's got another,

204
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:14,040
so, so yeah, there's, so there's
that individual, their friends,

205
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,750
the gender is really interesting.

206
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:20,670
One and a team in London actually
published a paper last year,

207
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,060
maybe two years ago,
um,

208
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,340
showing that romantic relationship
status influences perception of touch.

209
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:31,670
So they found that,
um,

210
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,690
strangers could not communicate
embarrassment to each other via touch,

211
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,550
but romantic couples could.

212
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,350
So there's a nutso relationship status
is also seem to play a role. So I think,

213
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,000
I think that's the individual difference
question is right. Or investigation.

214
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,640
So I wanted to ask you about one other
theme in your work and this has all been

215
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:55,430
really interesting hearing
you speak about it. Um,

216
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:00,020
one other area in your work has really
looked at the way that touch can be used

217
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:04,310
to actually regulate or shaped the
emotions that people experience.

218
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,610
And I wonder if you could say a little
bit about what do you see as the most

219
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:11,450
important discoveries here about how
touch can actually serve a regulatory

220
00:13:11,451 --> 00:13:12,284
function?

221
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:18,050
Well, I mean, this is, that's a great
question. I would say it honestly,

222
00:13:18,051 --> 00:13:22,100
it's too early to really get
a good sense of that. Um,

223
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:26,060
I've studied that in those infants.
Um,

224
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,240
and I think some of the bus working
you've been with the infants,

225
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:32,840
honestly like using a touch,

226
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,370
caregivers touch with infants to
help them understand, you know,

227
00:13:37,371 --> 00:13:40,790
what is good and what is bad in the
world and how they should understand the

228
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:45,140
world. Um, so if you introduce an object
that the baby doesn't quite understand,

229
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,520
um, in front of him or her and around
the age of one year old or whatnot, um,

230
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,340
and you touched them positively,

231
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:56,180
there'll be much more likely to go
approach that, that toy, that object.

232
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:59,090
And if you touched them, sort of
an, a negative, abrupt manner,

233
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,080
the much more loaning to kind of
retract and not willing to touch that.

234
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,640
And so you're literally influencing their
perception of the objects around them,

235
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:11,960
the world around them, and perhaps
their emotional state during that. Um,

236
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,470
you know, in terms of adults, um,

237
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,890
there's been some work on that
question, but honestly, not a lot. Um,

238
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,010
one of the kind of promising areas is
honestly is looking at sort of this a

239
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,730
touch therapy,
which I'm not as involved in in my lab.

240
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,550
I'm a woman named Tiffany field,
done in Florida,

241
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:34,310
has a lot of this work and
she's finding they're really,

242
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:39,230
really powerful effects on mood and
mental state and astro stock with,

243
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,590
you know, this massage therapy or
therapy. So it's really great for

244
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,590
really fascinating.
So I mean,

245
00:14:45,591 --> 00:14:49,160
I know today we've talked about the role
that touch touched in communicating,

246
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,560
you know,
emotions and the work that you've showing.

247
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:55,910
They can actually communicate really
distinct types of emotions and can be used

248
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:59,960
to sort of regulate emotions as well.
So I wonder as you sort of, you know,

249
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:03,440
moved in this field and really made
some landmark discoveries here,

250
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,100
where do you see the future
of the field moving forward?

251
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,200
Great question. I mean, I, I think, um,
uh, a number of ways I can think about it.

252
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,200
Number one, looking at physiological
underpinnings of all of us. So yeah,

253
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,950
I think that's a natural question. Wide
Open for investigation. Um, and I mean,

254
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,850
you know, central nervous system,
autonomic nervous system. Um,

255
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,350
so I think that's wide open and
we've got some work going on, um,

256
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:31,941
on that question.

257
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:36,941
But I mean it really is wide open and
obviously that work has been done for

258
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:41,480
years and the face looking at
facial expression of emotion, um,

259
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,940
and some of it on the voice,
um, but very little touches.

260
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,570
I think that's one area.
It's wide open.

261
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:52,820
Another one is just looking at how
the context of real world situations

262
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:56,990
influenced how pouch is communicated.
So a lot of it, uh, my work,

263
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:59,050
especially at the none allow,
um,

264
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,250
but I think next step is
to take it out of the lab,

265
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,840
look at this and the real world
has some more ecologically valid,

266
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,780
uh, um, procedures to use, um,

267
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,930
to look at how it touches you
used to communicate in watching.

268
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,080
So I think that's wide open
individual differences. I still,

269
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,370
I mean even though we discovered some
new bit of differences in terms of, um,

270
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,020
how well people patch out perceptions of
that touching when I think that it's a

271
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:25,640
lot to be discovered in that area.

272
00:16:25,641 --> 00:16:29,690
And then finally looking at
the person as a whole. Right?

273
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:33,290
So we can talk about touches and modality,
if he can be Katie,

274
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,300
if we can talk about the
faces and modality can be
Kate or the voice or gesture

275
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:42,980
or whatnot. But how do all of these
come together in the real world,

276
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,480
um,
to communicate emotion,

277
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,720
which ones are really driving the
communication of emotion and how do they

278
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:52,440
interact with each other?
Um,

279
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,790
we're just beginning to get a
sense of of that and I think,

280
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,310
you know, in the next decade or so, um,

281
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,390
we should be making some
big strides in that area.

282
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,800
So when you have students come to
you asking you for advice, you know,

283
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:09,320
who are thinking about embarking
in this field of emotion,

284
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,660
what kind of advice might you give them?

285
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:16,860
Big Question. I mean, just in general,
in the end, beyond my specific area.

286
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,390
Um, I think honestly
asking important questions,

287
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,420
I'm just really working hard
to think about, you know,

288
00:17:24,421 --> 00:17:27,330
what you want to put your time
into because our time is precious.

289
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:30,720
Resources are precious and you
can ask questions and answer them.

290
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:34,280
But the question is, is, are,
is what you're studying Wharton,

291
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,930
is it really going to make, um, uh,

292
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,150
impact on the field? So I would
answer important questions, um,

293
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,850
because it's just seen so many people
ask questions that really don't out too

294
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:51,120
much or maybe a bit, but I mean,
if you're gonna spend your time,

295
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,170
might as well spend your time on a big
question or a set of big questions.

296
00:17:54,171 --> 00:17:58,830
So I would, I would definitely
give that advice. Um, it's,

297
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,740
it's the bonus, I'd
say. Uh, not imperative,

298
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:06,000
but a bonus if you can study things
that not too many other people studying,

299
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,410
um, having room to make
some of these discoveries,

300
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,530
um, I think is, is wonderful.

301
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,800
So you've done that and other
people we know have done that.

302
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,360
And so I think studying things that not
a lot of people that are involved in,

303
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:23,190
maybe you don't want to
be the only one of course,

304
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:28,191
but why I try to study some of the things
that you can make a discovery and help

305
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:30,260
further the field.
Um,

306
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:35,450
another one is integrating multiple
methods I think is always a great thing.

307
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,220
In almost any field in psychology.

308
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:42,510
So using physiological measures of self
report, measure behavior, all measures,

309
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,680
all of these. And trying to bring them
together to answer your question, um,

310
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,610
in different research designs I think
is really important. And then finally,

311
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:53,700
you know, when, when you are in
graduate school or what you are doing,

312
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:58,701
your boss doc find to find people that
study emotion using these different

313
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:01,650
tools, you know, having great team, um,

314
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:04,780
so that you can really learn from the
box I think is really important to you.

315
00:19:04,781 --> 00:19:06,630
So asking you to important questions,

316
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,800
studying something that ideally
nobody knows too much about. Um,

317
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,700
integrating multiple methods and then
finally finding those people that can help

318
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:15,950
you learn those tools,
I think are,

319
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:21,430
are some of the keys to see who pretty
providing some good solid research in the

320
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:22,860
field and moving along.

321
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,630
Well,
thank you so much.

322
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:28,110
That's excellent advice cause I just
want to thank you again for joining us

323
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:28,740
today.
Matt,

324
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,060
this concludes our experts in emotion
interview with Doctor Matthew Hertenstein

325
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,530
from de Paul University.
