1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,990
Today for experts in emotion interview.

2
00:00:02,991 --> 00:00:05,540
We have the honor of speaking
with doctor [inaudible] Mehta.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,830
So Dr Mehta is currently an assistant
professor of psychology at the University

4
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:10,664
of Oregon.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,050
He received his Ba from Williams college
and his phd in social personality

6
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:18,920
psychology from the University of
Texas at Austin before starting at the

7
00:00:18,921 --> 00:00:20,540
University of Oregon as faculty.

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,530
He completed postdoctoral fellowships
at the Columbia University as well as

9
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:28,250
Erasmus University and the Donders
institute in the Netherlands.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,480
His research examines the psychological
and biological processes that help

11
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:35,090
regulate status here
arkies and decision making.

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,130
So I now turn to a very special experts
in emotion interview together with Dr

13
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:44,660
[inaudible] Mehta on emotion and hormones
and upcoming and very exciting field.

14
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,300
So welcome prawns. Thanks for
speaking today. Thanks for having me.

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,440
It's always a pleasure.
Um,

16
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,320
what I wanted to start out asking a
little bit about is what first got you

17
00:00:57,321 --> 00:00:58,520
interested in emotions?

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,030
Well, I think just by nature
of being a person, you know,

19
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:05,180
we all have emotional
experiences and so we're all,

20
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:07,610
I think in intrinsically
interested in emotion,

21
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:12,230
but specific to my work when I'm finding
compelling about emotion is I'm trying

22
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:14,430
to understand the process. So, um,

23
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,590
how our biology feeds
into the things we do,

24
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:23,480
how we think, um, and then
how, um, our behaviors and our,

25
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,340
um, in our environments can influence
our biology. And I think that's why,

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,540
um, recently I've been really interested
in emotion as kind of the psychological

27
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:36,470
process by which our biology
piece into our behavior. So,

28
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,210
yeah. Cool. Very cool.

29
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:41,090
I actually want to ask you then a few
questions about your research in this

30
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:43,370
domain. So I mean, first of all,

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,080
I mean you are so well known already
for your pioneering work that's helped

32
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:49,970
found this brand new field,
you know,

33
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:53,330
referred to as social
neuroendocrinology and as a field,

34
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:56,700
I wondered if you might share with us what
you see as some of the most, you know,

35
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,550
fundamental discoveries thus far
about hormones and social behavior,

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,633
etc.

37
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,773
Absolutely.

38
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,800
So I think one of the important things
to recognize is that research item,

39
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,030
uh, hormones and behavior in
humans, it's relatively new.

40
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,360
So a lot of this work on pioneering
work was done in animals.

41
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:19,830
And so just the fact, uh, over the
past, uh, decade in particular,

42
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:23,670
there's been a resurgence and research
on an interest in studying, uh,

43
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,080
hormones in social behavior in humans.
So just by nature of doing the work, um,

44
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,000
I think that's pioneering ended up itself.
Um,

45
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,480
but we've also learned a few things.
Um,

46
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:37,530
so a few things that we
do know now is that, um,

47
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,230
there's a, this, this hormone cortisol,

48
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:44,970
which is released by the HPA axis that
plays a really important role in stress

49
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:49,480
responses in humans as well as
animals. So we do know that, um,

50
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,680
that's pretty clear.
We also know that, uh,

51
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,830
the steroid hormone
testosterone, which is, uh,

52
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,790
which exists in both men and women,
um,

53
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,310
plays an important role in behaviors
linked to status, such as dominance.

54
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,530
And we're also learning a lot
about oxytocin's role, um,

55
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,930
in social behaviors specifically.
Uh,

56
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:14,730
it seems to be involved in a
lot of pro social behaviors. Um,

57
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,430
so I think those are the basic
discoveries that we've made and,

58
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,810
but what's really exciting is kind of
the nuance that we're adding as a field.

59
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:27,290
That these kind of simplistic views
of testosterone, dominance, cortisol,

60
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:27,911
stress,

61
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:32,911
oxytocin bonding are being uprooted in
some ways and suggesting that there are

62
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:37,910
other kind of processes
depending on the context. Um,

63
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,440
and depending on the kind of person
you are that are dictating how these

64
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:45,610
hormones work. Um, so the fact what
we do and our emotions as well.

65
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,560
So really exciting. I wonder
too, you know, how do you

66
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:53,160
thank this field might be moving forward
in terms of next steps to really try to

67
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,330
leverage, you know, this methodology to
better understand emotional behavior.

68
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,271
Yeah.

69
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:02,320
So I think there's a number of cool things
that are going on in the field right

70
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,690
now. The first one is, um,

71
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,720
this idea of I'm mechanism or process and
I think that's where emotion really is

72
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,630
an important domain to start, is to
start looking at process. So, um,

73
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,350
one domain we've looked at is the brain.
Of course,

74
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:21,820
we know that hormones like testosterone
and cortisol cross the blood brain

75
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:26,350
barrier and bind to receptors
and influence, um, uh,

76
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,060
activity in the brain. Uh, but we also
know that there's, uh, an experience,

77
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,300
a psychological process that is going on,
um,

78
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,970
that might trap with what's
going on in the brain of course,

79
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:38,830
but that needs to be
studied independently.

80
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:42,180
And I think that's really an exciting
new direction, uh, that we're,

81
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:46,960
we're taking as a field is some
when your testosterone levels rise,

82
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,520
you know, how are you feeling? Um,

83
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,300
and similarly when your testosterone
levels drop or your cortisol called

84
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,690
cortisol levels rise as well. Um, so that,

85
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:59,080
that's one step is getting a mechanism
and process and I think emotion is going

86
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:03,720
to play a critical role in that.
Um, the other thing is, um, uh,

87
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,290
more about this idea of nuance.

88
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,960
And what I'll be a little bit more
specific about that is that I'm,

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
there seem to be contextual cues that
effect when hormones such as testosterone

90
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,270
or cortisol are released in a
predictable way. So, for example,

91
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:22,480
we know that, um, when we
threatened people status,

92
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,780
that's really when testosterone,
Roland social behaviors strong,

93
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,490
but under normal conditions when
status threat isn't really relevant,

94
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,600
we're not getting a profound effect.

95
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:37,060
So kind of understanding these
context depending, qs is really,

96
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:41,410
really an important critical next
step that we're taking as a field.

97
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,760
And the other thing is not just context
dependence but person dependent.

98
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,650
So how do you see yourself?

99
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,120
What's your personality like and how
does hormones such as testosterone

100
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,130
influence say someone who sees themselves
as really dominant person versus

101
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,130
someone who doesn't?

102
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,090
And what we're seeing is
really drastically different
effects depending on these

103
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:05,750
kinds of self perceived,
um, personality processes.

104
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:10,430
So I think there's just a lot more
to do in terms of mechanism and uh,

105
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,310
and nuance. And that's kind
of where the field is heading,

106
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:18,260
is debunking kind of these age old
myths about just these simple views and

107
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,870
really trying to understand
them in a more systematic way.

108
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,280
And I think emotion research is in
a play a important role in this new

109
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:28,590
resurgence of research on
hormones and social behavior. So

110
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,150
well, it's exciting to have you
here at the forefront, you know,

111
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:35,850
leading this work at probing mechanism,
steeply, understanding the nuances. And,

112
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,760
and related to this, I mean, I think about
how you've already started to do this,

113
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,241
you know,

114
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:44,380
with your dual hormone hypothesis where
you really examine really carefully this

115
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,910
interrelationship between cortisol on the
one hand and testosterone on the other,

116
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:49,390
you know,

117
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:53,800
predicting a wide range of behaviors
already from social status to decision

118
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:56,650
making. And I wonder if you
could just tell us a bit more,

119
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:59,530
what do you see as some of the
most exciting discovery so far?

120
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,270
Yeah, sure. I'd be happy to share
that. So, um, as I sort of mentioned,

121
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:08,950
we've sort of had this view that cortisol
is the stress hormone and testosterone

122
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:13,120
is the dominance hormone.
And for the past a hundred years,

123
00:07:13,121 --> 00:07:14,980
both in humans and animal work,

124
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,520
it's been these systems that have been
studied pretty much independently.

125
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:23,521
So you'll see long tradition of research
on Cortisol's role in social behavior

126
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,630
and you'll see a similar parallel
line of work on testosterone,

127
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:32,950
swollen social behavior. But if you look
deeply and critically at the literature,

128
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,920
what you'll find is a lot of mess.

129
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,930
So you'll see Messi findings at sometimes
see a fax and sometimes you won't, um,

130
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,050
across really similar behaviors such as,
um,

131
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:48,220
stress related processes or motions or,
or decisions like you're saying.

132
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:52,170
And so what we wondered based on some,
um,

133
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:57,100
biology evidence is one of these
two systems could interact that is,

134
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,260
might the influence of testosterone on
behavior depend on whether someone is low

135
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:03,580
or high in cortisol.

136
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,720
And what we're seeing in now
about 10 studies is this,

137
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,020
this seems to be the case in a
number of different domains. Um,

138
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,810
so for example, someone high in
testosterone and low cortisol, uh,

139
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,430
they tend to have a more
challenge response to threats. Um,

140
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,160
they tend to have a more approach
oriented and resilience style.

141
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,560
So dealing with a threat
in the environment,

142
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,490
whereas someone high in
testosterone and high in cortisol,

143
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:36,010
they seem to have a more negative effect
or distress related response to these

144
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:38,080
kinds of threatening situation.
So we're,

145
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,930
we're really trying to
understand these profiles,

146
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:45,280
not just understanding one hormone,
uh, independent of other homo system,

147
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:46,910
but these profiles,
uh,

148
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,190
specifically in this case testosterone
and cortisol and we're finding is some

149
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:55,090
counterintuitive new new directions
for the field of social VR.

150
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,050
Um, specific to, um, the
study of emotion is, um,

151
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,580
an interesting finding related to train
anxiety or trait neuroticism in that is

152
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,570
that people high in testosterone and low
cortisol, they tend to have a more calm,

153
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:12,180
cool, uh, style, uh,

154
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,730
with dealing with stressors in the worlds.

155
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,260
And this actually makes them perform
better in positions of leadership is what

156
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:19,801
we're finding.

157
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:24,801
So I just saw some low cortisol
people are low in trait anxiety.

158
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,340
In contrast,
people,

159
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:31,070
high testosterone in high in cortisol
seems to be really high in trading side.

160
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,830
And like I said, they have
threat related responses, uh, uh,

161
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,870
to stressors in the environment and
they tend to not make as good leaders.

162
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,610
And we think it's because of this,
um,

163
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,230
these feelings of anxiety and
distress that they're feeling.

164
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:51,590
So I think that's one segue into how
this kind of dual common approach might,

165
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,160
um, might provide insights into
emotion research in particular.

166
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,570
It's really cool to hear how you're
mapping these profiles onto domains

167
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:03,530
relevance to aspect as well as clinically
relevant kind of emotion profiles are

168
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:07,340
talking about anxiety and neuroticism.
So it's just,

169
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:10,940
it's wonderful to see this work happening.
So I think like you're hinting at,

170
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:14,750
it's going to yield so many important
discoveries in the years to come.

171
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,120
Yeah,
I think so as well.

172
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:20,780
So it's specific to your point about
clinical utility that's an exciting new

173
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:25,460
direction that, um, that we're
hoping to take in the next few years.

174
00:10:25,461 --> 00:10:30,170
So specifically, like you said, it's
hinting at that, um, for, for example,

175
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:34,950
we know that neuroticism is
a, is a predictor of, uh,

176
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,000
aspect of disorders,
clinical aspect of disorders.

177
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,010
And so we just have some of
the first evidence of that. Um,

178
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,040
but we need to do a lot more work so
we know that I'm studying emotional

179
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,660
experience in the real world.

180
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:51,260
So these were just one time
measures of emotional experience,

181
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:55,490
but really studying and mapping these
hormone processes on to real world

182
00:10:55,491 --> 00:11:00,250
emotional experiences and important on
direction for future work. And really, um,

183
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,240
some of the studies that I've
talked to you about emotion,

184
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:05,810
we really looked at just a little
snapshot of the Neuro neuroendocrine

185
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,390
specifically looking at maybe one sample,
um,

186
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,930
to provide a window into
how the system works.

187
00:11:11,931 --> 00:11:14,750
But we know that the system is a
lot more complex. Specifically,

188
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:17,540
we know that there's, um, diurnal curve,

189
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:21,470
so cortisol and testosterone are highest
in the morning drop throughout the day.

190
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,000
Um, and so understanding the slopes and
shapes of these curves are going to be an

191
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,080
important and exciting way to go
specifically in the land of emotion.

192
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,250
Excellent. Well, my final question about
your work really touches on, you know,

193
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:39,990
the ways in which you're exploring just
innovative approaches to utilizing tools

194
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:44,190
of neuroendocrinology to inform and
enhance our understanding of psychological

195
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:48,330
disorders, which you just hinted that
including mood disorders. And I wonder,

196
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:50,580
you know, we've just talked
about this clinical application,

197
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:54,010
but do you think that there's
some division of, um, you know,

198
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:57,810
the potential clinical utility that
these methods might bear for maybe

199
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,250
understanding emotional
disorders that you've alluded to,

200
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:04,180
but maybe even more accurately
detecting them or treating them?

201
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,590
Do we think this might be a possible
translational approach as we move forward?

202
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,240
I definitely think so. June. Um,

203
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,470
I just think we need to do the basic
science to understand what we're trying to

204
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:20,410
predict. So, um, so I absolutely think
that this type of clinical application,

205
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:25,170
so like I said, if, if we're finding
that there's a specific profile, um,

206
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,800
neuroendocrine profile that's
associated with risk factors for a,

207
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,140
a social anxiety disorder,
um, uh, clinical depression,

208
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:37,370
it would be really important obviously
for clinicians to know this information.

209
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,210
Uh, I think the first step is we really
have to be kind of confident that this is

210
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:44,510
what's going on. And, um,
like you said, we need,

211
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,460
we need rich or methods for studying,
uh, the neuroendocrine system. So,

212
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:54,170
um, for example, uh, we've
of course brought people
into the lab, are really, uh,

213
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,130
tracking people and their daily lives is
one important domain. Uh, another, uh,

214
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:02,230
important way to study the
neuroendocrine system is, um,

215
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,320
by giving people hormones are changing
their hormone system to exoticness

216
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:08,980
administration. So we're
working on studies, uh,

217
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,750
where we give people
testosterone for example.

218
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:15,800
So you might've seen commercials
on Androgel, um, that come on.

219
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,170
And really this is a, a, uh,

220
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,620
a way for researchers to sort
of study the causal processes.

221
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:25,850
So the causal links between hormones
and emotion. Um, and so yeah,

222
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:29,900
I think there's a lot of exciting,
uh, new directions that people can go.

223
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,790
And I think ultimately there,

224
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,790
these will have translational
and clinical applications.

225
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:35,671
So,
I mean,

226
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:38,490
you've really nicely alluded to like
where you see the future of the field

227
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:42,300
headed, which sounds really exciting.
And I wonder, as part of this, you know,

228
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:45,690
when you have students come to you and
ask you for advice or they're thinking

229
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,280
about embarking in this domain,

230
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,940
what advice do you give them when you
think about their future and where the

231
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:52,230
future of the field is headed?

232
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,730
That's a great question. I think, um,

233
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,580
one of the privileges of being in a really
young field is that there's a lot of

234
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:03,720
questions that are in some
ways low hanging fruits for
students because they'll

235
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:08,430
have this idea, they're interested in the
topic, let's say race bias and emotion,

236
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,950
um, or prejudice. And
so for example, in my,

237
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,410
one of my student's job is
interested in this topic,

238
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,410
but if you look at the research on this,

239
00:14:16,411 --> 00:14:20,580
there's no work really that's looked at
the neuroendocrine processes that might

240
00:14:20,581 --> 00:14:22,290
be related.
Um,

241
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:26,360
and so I think at least for
students right now in the field, um,

242
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,310
I think just sort of going
with what your passion is,

243
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:31,740
what the psychological question is and um,

244
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,270
and it seems to be the case that for a
lot of these questions there just hasn't

245
00:14:36,271 --> 00:14:39,450
been the work done to study the hormones.
So that's one thing.

246
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,490
But even in the cases where there are,

247
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:46,491
I think just thinking about things in
a slightly different way or approaching

248
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:51,000
the question in a slightly different
way is going to be the key to sort of

249
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,360
contributing to the
bigger science process.

250
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:54,980
There's a number of ways you can do this.

251
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,940
Sometimes we just kind of
combine different ideas from
different fields and this

252
00:14:58,941 --> 00:14:59,631
can be a new way.

253
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:03,500
Sometimes we have a new method that we
approached the question with. So I think,

254
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:07,010
um, I think this is a great time for
students to get involved in social

255
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,590
neuroendocrinology work
just because it's so young.

256
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,790
Well, thank you so much for speaking
today. Primes. It was wonderful,

257
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:17,420
and your insights are just very
inspiring and really opened up a lot of

258
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:19,550
questions for this newly emerging field.

259
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,040
You know that I see you
as at the forefront of

260
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,770
thanks so much for having me.
It was a great, great time.

261
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,940
So this concludes our experts in emotion
interview with doctor [inaudible] Mehta

262
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:30,640
from the University of Oregon.
Thanks.
