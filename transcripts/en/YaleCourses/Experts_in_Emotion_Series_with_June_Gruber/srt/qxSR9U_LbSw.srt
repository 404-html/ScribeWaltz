1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,120
Our experts in emotion interview.
Uh,

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,290
we have the honor of
speaking with Dr Marion,

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,300
the France to consider the question of
whether men and women emotionally differ.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:14,650
So doctor La France is a professor of
psychology and of women in gender studies

5
00:00:14,651 --> 00:00:19,300
at Yale University where she teaches
courses in social psychology and gender

6
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:22,990
psychology as well as
nonverbal communication.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,320
So her research focuses on how emotion
and power are transmitted in these subtle

8
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:30,970
emotional communication cues.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,190
Some of her recent work has focused in
particular on the human smile examining

10
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:39,850
questions such as why do when
men smile less than women?

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,300
Why do women smile when being sexually
harassed and to whom do babies show a coy

12
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:48,130
smile?
Um,

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,090
this work has received widespread
attention and various media outlets,

14
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:55,150
including NPR, BBC, NBC,

15
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,670
The New York Times among many others.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,560
So I will now turn to an interview
with my local Yo colleague, uh,

17
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:04,300
Dr Marion La France.

18
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,880
One of the things I'd love to speak
with you about as we get started is what

19
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,420
first kind of captured your interest
in emotion in the first place?

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,990
Kind of where did it all begin for you?
Well,

21
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,010
I think if I can go right
back to the beginning,

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,020
one of the things that I remember
my mother saying to me and my Sibs,

23
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:29,440
which is pay attention
to how people say things,

24
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,340
maybe even more than what
they're actually saying.

25
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,780
So facial expression,
eye contact, gesture.

26
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,050
So she said it matters
how things are said.

27
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,330
And that was a really intriguing notion,

28
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:48,331
which is if it's how then it means that
it's not verbal and if it's not verbal

29
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:52,060
than it must be nonverbal.
And the what becomes,

30
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,330
what is it that they're really
communicating and that's emotion.

31
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,470
So that's I think,
the,

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,870
the core routes that's so fascinating
because many of what captures our

33
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:06,190
attention and emotion, our own
early experiences and observations.

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,960
Absolutely. I infect dedicated
my dissertation to my mom who,

35
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,200
and I said to my mom whose ability to
tell what was going on between people was

36
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:19,540
the wonder of my childhood.
That's wonderful.

37
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,180
So that sparked your interest in emotion.

38
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:26,350
And so I'd love to ask you a few questions
now that the many things you've done,

39
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:30,070
you know, since then, um, you know,
in trying to understand emotion,

40
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:34,900
gender and we'll talk about the smile as
well. Um, so some people believe that,

41
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:37,210
you know, men and women are
profoundly different. You know,

42
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:40,000
we've heard that they might
even be from different planets.

43
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,070
And I guess the question
I have for you is,

44
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,150
is this really true in terms of our
men and women really from different,

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,320
you know, emotional planets. Um,

46
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,340
do we see evidence to suggest
that might be the case?

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,320
I'm going to do the academic thing
and say yes and no, but mostly no,

48
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,220
that is, it is clear that there's
a profound belief that men, women,

49
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,930
girls and boys are different.

50
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,320
And the assumption usually is that
it is something essential that the

51
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:12,910
differences are not learned,
that the differences are not layered over,

52
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:15,940
but in fact come at
core from our genetics.

53
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,580
It is true that there
are some differences.

54
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:21,850
We clearly have different
organs and different bodies,

55
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,630
but most of what makes us male or female,

56
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:30,070
masculine or feminine comes much
later. We acquire it, we learn it,

57
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,830
we specialize in it will
become experts in it.

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,580
And the thing that's so
interesting actually is if
you take little kids and you

59
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:40,780
say, what is your, you've just say do a
little boy. What is your mommy look like?

60
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,940
You say, do a little girl.
What does your daddy look like?

61
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,210
They posturely and
expressively will do it.

62
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,640
It will be recognizably gendered.

63
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:53,080
So the very nature of how we sit,

64
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,760
how frequently we, or
how quickly we blink, um,

65
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,840
many of these things we acquire by
virtue of observation and Instruction and

66
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,350
learning. I mean that sounds
like from what you're saying,

67
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:09,880
it's not so much that men and women
are born different emotionally,

68
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:10,391
but at that,

69
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:14,860
at something over time they learn and
they're almost socialized in ways to maybe

70
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:19,390
show emotions differently or maybe
even talk about emotions differently.

71
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,080
Absolutely. And I think it's all of those
things. That is whatever emotion is,

72
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,130
it's multi layered. It is. Multicomponent.

73
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,570
So we talk about expressive cutty,
talk about subjectivity,

74
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,200
talk about physiological,
talk about brain kinds of things,

75
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,950
and at every component that we study,

76
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,300
gender is more or less large or small
and then more or less variable cross

77
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:48,100
situation. So to say that women
are more emotional than men.

78
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,480
True in the sense of either self report.

79
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,680
So you get women, are you emotional?
Yes. Women say they are more emotion,

80
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,690
but if you do online kind of coding
that is, you asked at this very second,

81
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,910
what are you feeling and how
intensely are you feeling it?

82
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,290
Then the gender differences and emotion
tend to dissipate. Oh, that's fascinating.

83
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,850
So what do you think that as we try to
understand gender and emotion moving

84
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:15,190
forward, what do you think are
some of the most, I don't know,

85
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,510
challenging puzzles we're going to face
as we try to really tease apart the ways

86
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:22,990
in which men and women are similar,
are different.

87
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,680
There are a lot of interesting questions.
A lot of data has been collected,

88
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:34,660
but we still don't know a lot about
under what circumstances are women more

89
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:35,680
emotional than men?

90
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,160
And is it more expressive than subjective?

91
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,053
That is,

92
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,540
if we measure only gender
differences in say physiology,

93
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,540
there's not much there that suggests
that there are profound differences.

94
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,870
But if you ask men and women,
if you watch men and women,

95
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,150
women are much more expressive with
their faces, with their voices,

96
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:03,290
with their gestures.
It is part of women to be expressive,

97
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,710
to be communicative to
if you will reach out.

98
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,600
And part of masculinity, at least
in our culture is to damp it down.

99
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,790
Keep it under wraps.
Be stoic. Yes, exactly.

100
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,711
So interesting.

101
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,730
So one of the things you've also looked
at that's relevant to this is, you know,

102
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:24,080
the human smile,
you know,

103
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:26,690
and that's something that
we're all really interested in.

104
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:29,990
Sort of why do we smile? You
know, who do we smile too?

105
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:32,930
What are the rules that govern
different kinds of smiles?

106
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,960
And you wrote a really compelling book
lipservice talking a bit more about this

107
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:42,860
and I just wonder if you could share some
of the observations that you detailed

108
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:47,630
in this book is to why do we smile and
is this something that can also help us

109
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:51,890
better understand gender differences in
emotion by just looking at something as

110
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,000
simple as the smile.

111
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,540
Smiley is fascinating for several reasons.

112
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,780
One is there is not a culture or a area
or historical period in which smiling

113
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:09,110
has not been found. So babies
come to birth smile. In fact,

114
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,120
we know from studies of babies in the
womb actually in letter stage trimester

115
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,780
babies are smiling now they're not smiling
cause they're having a grand old time.

116
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,030
Well, they might be, but
we don't know that yet.

117
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,280
What happens then is
layers of socialization,

118
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:26,240
layers of culture,

119
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:30,140
layers of exposure to different
contexts and different social roles.

120
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,210
So everybody smiles,

121
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,710
but then the question becomes who
smiles more under what circumstances?

122
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,680
We do know cross many,
many,

123
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:44,210
many studies that women
reliably smile more than men,

124
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,320
but those differences are very,

125
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,410
very much a function of what age.
For example,

126
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:55,190
you're talking about the largest sex
differences in smiling with women's

127
00:07:55,191 --> 00:08:00,140
smelling more than men occurs between
the ages of about 17 and 23 huh?

128
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,430
After that,

129
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:06,431
the differences basically disappear so
that by middle age they're not really

130
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:08,570
profound sex differences.

131
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,760
There are also really substantial
within sex variations,

132
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,340
so some men smile more than other men.

133
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,420
Some women smile less than other women
and that variability is really quite

134
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,254
substantial.

135
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,650
Smiling appears to be in part a
signal of underlying positive ethic,

136
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,600
but smiling is a lot more than that.

137
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,360
Smiling in fact is the all purpose mask.

138
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,010
When people were feeling anything
but happy, they often will smile,

139
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,870
so it covers, it allows people
to regain their composure,

140
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:49,850
if you will. It holds people off
it the flex too much attention.

141
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,260
So smiling is,

142
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,410
I've sometimes referred to it as a
Swiss army knife of interpersonal

143
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:57,150
relationships. It is multiple. He useful,

144
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,250
it can establish connection.
It can stand is an apology.

145
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,380
It can suggest that one
is willing to cooperate.

146
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,590
It can indicate allegiances,

147
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,550
so people who smile at each other across
the proverbial crowded room or saying,

148
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,680
Gotcha. See you were in
this, we're a special. Um,

149
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,720
so that there are many social functions
that smiling serves besides being a

150
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:28,410
readout of underlying positive emotion.
That's so interesting.

151
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:31,180
I mean it makes smiling, you know, TV,

152
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,460
this complex and multifaceted thing
that happens just in a blink of an eye.

153
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,880
But that in ways is just,
you know,

154
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,820
subtly navigating our everyday
social exchanges. Absolutely.

155
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,260
Navigating I think is a terrific way
to characterize it because we smile at

156
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:47,910
strangers,
not a lot,

157
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
but smiling is one of the
facial expressions that
tends to be reciprocated by

158
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:53,970
strangers.

159
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,940
If I frowned at you and we don't know
each other and were passing each other in

160
00:09:56,941 --> 00:10:00,420
the street, you're not likely to frown
back at me. But if I smell it you,

161
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:05,421
there may be a very quick recognition
and doing it likewise so that it gets us

162
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:10,260
through a lot of social situations
where words would take too much time,

163
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,090
too complicated, too ambiguous,
smiling, smooths things out.

164
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,740
Let's us go through without a lot
of tension or conflict or ambiguity.

165
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,020
And do you think that there are certain
kinds of smells that maybe, I don't know,

166
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,060
more socially effective than other styles
or it's actually great question and I

167
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:31,680
think that's where the research is going.

168
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,710
One of the distinctions
that researchers have made,

169
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:36,930
which I think has some terrific validity,

170
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,100
is the distinction between what is
called the Duchenne after a French

171
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:43,950
physiologist,
the Duchenne smile,

172
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:48,510
which is apparently the really
legitimate sign of genuine, spontaneous,

173
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:53,511
positive emotion and to facial features
are involved with the genuine smile.

174
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,710
That's the mouth and but
it also involves the eyes.

175
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,030
It's actually a muscle.

176
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,020
That circumference is the
eye socket which squeezes,

177
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
so it causes the eye to close
a little bit. It raises,

178
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,060
there's a little pouching
of the lower lid.

179
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,820
There's a little crinkling
of the outer eyes.

180
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,850
There's a little lowering of the upper
lid on the outside that is hard to do

181
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:21,420
deliberately. This, that is the mouth is
really easy. We all learn how to do that.

182
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:25,530
All someone has to do is imma cameras
and say, smile. We know what to do.

183
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:29,520
We may think it's awkward and it's
silly and it's you know, authentic.

184
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,440
So there are genuine smiles,
but there are many other kinds of smiles,

185
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,910
smiles that have often say,

186
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:41,040
if I'm trying to mask negative effect,

187
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,840
say I'm feeling actually really sad at
the moment and I don't want to impose

188
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:49,860
that on you. I don't want you to
know, I don't want to express it.

189
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,670
So my mouth may say happy,
happy, smile, smile.

190
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,470
But if I look at the, at the inner
brows, I see maybe some tension.

191
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:00,820
I see some other actions.

192
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:05,821
So there are smells like that smiles also
that come on the face really fast and

193
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:07,180
go off really fast.

194
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,180
Often you can see this and people who are
in public and they don't think they're

195
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:10,931
being observed,

196
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,950
but then there's somebody
to catch somebody's eye and
the smile comes on and the

197
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,810
people go away,
small drops off.

198
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,490
So the timing of his smile distinguishes
between a genuine and a non genuine

199
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,230
smile.

200
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:27,230
There are also smiles that are purely
to convey a sense of let's get through

201
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:33,640
this, let's just move along. But
smooth things out and that smile.

202
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:37,000
Everybody knows to be polite or social,

203
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,380
but it's not about emotion or at least
it's not about a readout of what's really

204
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:42,220
going on inside.

205
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,480
It's almost like a social regulator
is absolutely that interesting.

206
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,120
One of the things he said that I
thought was interesting thinking,

207
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:53,050
smiling to gender differences is that
there seems to be this critical period

208
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:56,470
where men and women do different smiling,
but then after that period,

209
00:12:56,471 --> 00:13:00,610
I think he said it was
17 to 23 it disappears.

210
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,810
What do we think is going on?
Uh, why do we start smiling?

211
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,290
It's converging in our smiles.
I guess it's a terrific question.

212
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,160
There are those of a
evolutionary psychology band
who would say when mating is

213
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,570
most critical,

214
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:22,240
the sexist should be the most different
so that there's no confusion about who

215
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:23,680
you're going to engage with.

216
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,820
Others suggest that that's when the
social pressure is at its maximum to

217
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,780
indicate that one is
appropriately masculine and
feminine and there is no better

218
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:39,460
way to indicate femininity than smiling.
In fact,

219
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:43,030
it's at that age that young men who smile,

220
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,940
especially if they are
seeing this smiling too much,

221
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,690
the too much means there's something
odd about their masculinity,

222
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,070
so we questioned their inherent
masculinity. If there's too much smiling,

223
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,450
it also appears to be the case.
That's when gender roles,

224
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,950
in terms of occupations, in terms of
vocations, in terms of preferences,

225
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,370
gender roles really are really quite
paramount and there are a lot of

226
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:11,371
occupations and jobs and roles that are
really gendered still that is women tend

227
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:13,900
to be more care givers.

228
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,270
They tend to be more in public relations
kinds of occupations which require a

229
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:23,410
lot of smiling, so we know for example,
if you put men in those same occupations,

230
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:25,450
Lo and behold, they're
smiling. Rates go up.

231
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,530
If you put women in more traditional
masculine occupations, Lo and behold,

232
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,180
they're smiling drops off,

233
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,420
so it's less maybe at certain ages than
it about gender than it is about the

234
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:41,290
separation into social roles
that are related to gender. Yeah.

235
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,080
It sounds really like it's
all about social context.

236
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,730
Social context matters a lot.

237
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:49,720
Smiling is probably the most
variable facial expression.

238
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,440
I think when we look at expressions
associated with anger, distress,

239
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,560
a disgust, sadness, and the like,

240
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,800
I think then the expressions are often
more authentic readouts of what the

241
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:07,340
underlying effect is. Smiley is
the great question mark. In fact,

242
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:11,240
Darwin when he talked about facial
expressions was a little mystified with

243
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:15,140
smiling cause it didn't appear
to be functionally adaptive.

244
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,140
It didn't appear to arrive from some
bodily or some core notion of survival.

245
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,040
So what it is is actually
still a bit of a mystery.

246
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,940
So interesting.
I wanted to ask you a little bit further.

247
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:32,240
I mean a lot of your work too,
it's looked more broadly,

248
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,960
other kinds of nonverbal communication,
the smile being being one of them,

249
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,220
and just how these subtle communication,
uh,

250
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,580
pieces of information can actually
communicate really important information

251
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:47,960
about things like social power,
which seems really, really profound.

252
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,790
I mean, how is it that we
can convey things about our
gender identity, you know,

253
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:57,770
personal allegiances simply through, uh,
these nonverbal acts or in other words,

254
00:15:57,771 --> 00:15:59,540
without saying a single word,

255
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:05,230
nonverbal communication is something
that humans need because it is simple.

256
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,850
It's efficient. It is, if
you will, off the record.

257
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,290
So if you say something
to me of a unkind sword,

258
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,160
I can say Jew. What was that
about? Why? Why did you say that?

259
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,980
But if you do a little
kind of scowl at me,

260
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,010
if you bodily turn away from me,

261
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,570
if you indicate by certain
other kinds of cues,

262
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,770
vocal tone, that you're really
disinterested, I can't say, Hey,

263
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,290
what was that tone of voice
thing? It's, it would sound,

264
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,930
maybe bordering on the paranoid
would sound kind of bizarre. Well,

265
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:43,040
I see a psychologist unless
you're a psychologist in
which we do it all the time.

266
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,120
Um,

267
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,120
so nonverbal communication
is a multilayered way of
establishing relationships,

268
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:53,840
of indicating you've mentioned power,
who's on top and who's not,

269
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,390
who's striving to move up, who's
worried about moving down? So smiling.

270
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,860
Another uh, example, there's some data,
there was some controversy on this,

271
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,390
but there's some data that suggests that
the lower power person person with less

272
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:12,320
standing the status in a relationship
is the one who smiles more.

273
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,150
And the high power person,
theoretically smiles list. Now,

274
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:21,530
what we find in our research is
it's a little bit more complicated,

275
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,220
but it can come down in some sense
to the following lower power.

276
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:30,020
People may smile more because they have
to. In fact, we find that lower power,

277
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:34,190
people say they smile when they
do because of the need to please.

278
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,040
They don't want to offend. They don't
want people to think ill of them.

279
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,520
Higher power people tend to smell when
they feel like smiling and don't smile

280
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,990
when they don't feel like it gets,
they don't have to,

281
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,740
they don't have to sort of
show affiliation. Exactly.

282
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:52,530
They don't have to be,
be pleasant.

283
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,510
They don't have because
they've got the standing,

284
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:58,590
they've got the status and other people
need to rise to them rather than they

285
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:03,591
need to somehow or other
be compliant or um,

286
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,920
differential or submissive. That's not
part of the high power rural often. Right.

287
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,860
I'm sure people in their everyday
lives can imagine situations like job

288
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:14,640
interviews where they're finding that
they may be smelling much more frequently

289
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:17,250
than they normally would.
For example. Um, you know,

290
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:19,320
to sort of please the higher power person.

291
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,520
But that's often some
of a double edge sword.

292
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:28,200
So interviewees are often
told, smile, make eye contact,

293
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,870
smile,
indicate you're engaged by smiling.

294
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,700
But often the smiling
then heads into too much.

295
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,230
So often what comes across is the sort
of greenness and you know sometimes in

296
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:43,020
those positions I'm smiling too much,
I got to stop,

297
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,800
but I can't because you know they're
there. I am with with my smile.

298
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,160
So smiling too much
happens fairly quickly.

299
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:57,710
That is to say that one can smile too
much without meaning to or wanting to and

300
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:03,561
it can then take the evaluation of the
person from competent and socially adept

301
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,550
into why are they greeting like that
when we're talking about these series

302
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:13,170
matters. So it can be almost too much of a
good thing. Absolutely. In fact, we find,

303
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:18,120
especially in studies of women
interviewees and men interviewees,

304
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,000
women smile a lot, a lot, a lot,

305
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,540
and they are seeing often is warm and
pleasant and altogether really nice

306
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:27,744
people.

307
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:32,400
But then too much smiling sometimes is
correlated with two little competence.

308
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,390
So if a person smiles too much,
they go overboard in one thing,

309
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:40,440
which suggests it may be that other
dimension of being smart and competent and

310
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,000
Rudy intellectually skilled,
some questions can be raised right.

311
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:49,500
So it brings their sort of social power
down even more. Exactly. Fascinating.

312
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,940
So I mean this has been really great to
talk about all your work on, you know,

313
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:57,210
nonverbal cues,
smiling gender and emotion.

314
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,560
And so when you think about all the
work you've done and sort of the puzzles

315
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:05,730
that remain, where do you see the
face of the future going in emotion?

316
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,100
Oh Wow.
What a question.

317
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,590
I think the thing that's wonderful about
emotion and emotion research is that

318
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,760
there are so many directions.
So we talk about,

319
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,960
we haven't talked today about it,
but huge differences culturally,

320
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:27,270
which raises a lot of basic questions
about his emotion. Universal.

321
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,480
Is it something that we
all share? Well, yes,

322
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,680
but if we say look at cross
cultural differences and emotion,

323
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,790
the rules for how much one
expresses under what circumstances,

324
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,920
what emotions are fostered,

325
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:46,220
what emotions are encouraged
to be damp down to go away,

326
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:52,020
issues about where in these massive
brains that we have our emotions located,

327
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,510
it's likely to be multiple.
He located the,

328
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:03,630
one of the questions about emotion I
think has to do with in some sense what is

329
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:09,070
it, I mean we assume, we know it's
everybody knows when emotion is,

330
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:14,071
but I think what researchers are finding
is it is a really complex phenomenon in

331
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:19,231
its own right and as we proceed into
the broader social world culture,

332
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,250
a nation,
his history,

333
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,930
we will also be proceeding in a more
micro level into the brain and there's so

334
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:32,500
many questions to ask and answer have
answered about those connections.

335
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,490
I mean it feels almost
like I would thought you're
saying the face of the future

336
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:39,250
has also, it got us started
in emotion in the first place.

337
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:44,140
Kind of questioning the core,
you know, I dunno. Bottom,

338
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,860
bottom up issue of what, what is
emotion, you know, in the first place.

339
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,540
It is a really interesting question.
Yeah.

340
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,330
And lots of work still remains to be done.
So in terms of lots of work,

341
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:58,480
I mean some of it, you know, we'll,
I'll try to do in our generation,

342
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:02,440
but a lot of it too will remain for
future scholars and students of emotion to

343
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:06,460
try. Absolutely. I think it's
one of those areas in which we've

344
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,820
come up with a lot of interesting data,
some really interesting findings,

345
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,750
but the questions are as
extensive as they ever were.

346
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,010
So what advice would you have for students
who are just embarking in this study

347
00:22:21,011 --> 00:22:25,300
of emotion or maybe thinking
about dabbling with it?
What might you say to them?

348
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:30,320
Well, maybe eat, start with
an emotion that mystifies you,

349
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,040
um, makes you angry, makes you
sad, uh, gets under your skin.

350
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,880
Start with some behavior that
you've noticed in yourself.

351
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,210
Say blushing for example.
We know very little bit about blushing,

352
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,920
which is related to emotion.
If you come from some other part of the,

353
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,960
of the world of the rural, urban, west,

354
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,390
east, south, north, um, you,

355
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,860
you named the location of your origin,
you may be fascinated with,

356
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,990
it seems to work different here than
it does in some other kind of place.

357
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,580
So start with something that
is interesting, aggravating,

358
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:13,330
fascinating.
Something that says,

359
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,440
I need to know more about this.
Really? Hmm. That's a great,

360
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,610
that's a great place to end. Thank you so
much for speaking with us today, Marian.

361
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,420
Great.

362
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,650
This concludes our experts and emotion
and our view with Dr Marion La France

363
00:23:26,651 --> 00:23:30,040
from Yale University.
Thank you again for speaking with us.
