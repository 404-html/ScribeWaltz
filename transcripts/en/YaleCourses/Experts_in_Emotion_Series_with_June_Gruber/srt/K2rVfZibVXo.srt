1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,860
Yeah.

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,610
Okay.

3
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,230
Welcome back to human emotion.

4
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,940
Today we'll continue to
focus our discussion on the
elicitation of emotion by

5
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:12,530
learning about all the exciting and
really cool tools and methods that one can

6
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:15,080
use to both understand
and quantify emotion.

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,340
So think of yourself as a laboratory
scientist trying to probe the mysteries of

8
00:00:19,341 --> 00:00:20,174
emotion.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,210
Okay,

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,410
this will be our second part in this
exciting module focused on how do we

11
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:27,510
trigger emotions and once we trigger them,

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,450
how do we measure them in the first place?
In other words,

13
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:33,330
we're really trying to get at the
question of what makes us emotional.

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,000
So today we'll continue our discussion
of the different tools and methods that

15
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:41,220
researchers use to elicit emotion.

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,870
And then we'll conclude with our takeaway
questions and another fantastic expert

17
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:47,220
interview in this field.

18
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,600
So let's jump right in with the second
part of the tools and methods that are

19
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:53,640
the coolest things.
As a scientist,

20
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:56,070
when you get into how do
you trigger an emotion,

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,230
how do you get people to feel emotional?

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,430
So you might remember these three core
processes we talked about in our last

23
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:06,540
lecture, including emotion,
reactivity, emotion regulation,

24
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,820
and emotion understanding.
So again,

25
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:13,821
these are the three big processes that
we try to get at as researchers when

26
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:17,190
we're developing tools
to tap into emotion.

27
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,510
So these were the eight domains
of emotional dissertation tools.

28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,960
We talked about the top four in our
last lecture. And as you can see here,

29
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:33,730
highlighted in the lovely color red.

30
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,640
We're going to be talking about these
four bad boys here at the bottom.

31
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,780
So we'll start talking about music and
singing, the acoustic startle reflex,

32
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,520
startle, eyeblink modulation,
and the directed facial
action task. So let's begin.

33
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:49,840
What might be perhaps the most intriguing
to all of you now music and singing.

34
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,300
So how do we use this to elicit emotion?

35
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,680
So we all know that music
elicits strong feelings, right?

36
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,630
Some of us feel the most emotional when
we listened to our favorite song or song

37
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:04,390
that reminds us of a really
important time in our life.

38
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,780
So researchers have tried to leverage
this everyday experience to use music as a

39
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:13,090
way of getting people into
a certain emotional state.

40
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,980
So one approach that's used by Eric Eich
has been to bring people into the lab

41
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,760
and have them listen to different
kinds of classical music.

42
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,570
And he's had them listen to classical
music that's used to elicit both happy

43
00:02:25,571 --> 00:02:28,240
feelings and sad feelings.
Okay?

44
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,730
So by using these tools,

45
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:33,820
he's found that people can actually
get them into the emotional states.

46
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,540
Now what about singing? This is
intimately tied to music, right?

47
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,040
And when we think about singing, how
can they use singing to elicit emotions?

48
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,780
So the way that my lab has approached
this is by using singing to try to elicit

49
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,760
self conscious emotions. So perhaps we've
all had our fair share of, you know,

50
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:53,770
embarrassing Karaoke moments.

51
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,400
I won't ask you to describe them
now and I won't share mine with you,

52
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,410
but if we think about Karaoke,

53
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,170
we know that it elicit
something pretty strong in us.

54
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,120
And so researchers have taken hold of
this idea and actually brought karaoke

55
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:10,540
sets into the lab, right? These
are some of the most, you know,

56
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:15,370
Rad labs you can think of in the world
where they try to use this tool to elicit

57
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:19,090
and understand self conscious
emotions like embarrassment.

58
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,540
So what you have people do is you use
a well validated tacit goes as follows.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,900
So people come into the lab and they're
asked to remain seated quietly while you

60
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:30,460
acquire a resting baseline.

61
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:34,540
Sort of getting what their current
emotional state is that day in the lab.

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,200
Next you tell them,
okay,

63
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:41,680
well we're going to do is have you
participate in this study where we look at

64
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,630
your emotional responses to singing.

65
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,140
And in my lab we've used
this task using the song,

66
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,320
which is a favorite of mine is
the Beatles Song Twist and shout.

67
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,100
And while participants are singing along
with this song wearing headphones, um,

68
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,170
they're being videotaped
unbeknownst to them later on,

69
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:04,090
after completing a series of unrelated lab
tasks, Bam, up on the computer monitor,

70
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,520
they get to watch this
video of themselves.

71
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,810
The best part of it though is
that there is no background music.

72
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:14,890
So literally all they're hearing is
their own voice. Sing along to the song.

73
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,480
And as you can see here,

74
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:21,370
this is the period of the study that
we know reliably elicits the emotion of

75
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:22,204
embarrassment.

76
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,590
And at the end we have people self
report their emotional experience,

77
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:28,450
not only how embarrassed they feel,

78
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,020
but how positive in general and how
negative in general did they feel.

79
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,830
So I'll show you an example of one of
my colleagues here at Yale University,

80
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:41,350
Laurie Santos, participating
in this study. So again,

81
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,580
she was asked to sing along to
the Beatle Song, twist and shout.

82
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,503
Well,

83
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,693
okay,

84
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,830
come on mom. Mom. Mom Pay man. Come on.

85
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,060
Well yeah, no,

86
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:11,920
you look so good.

87
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,420
Yeah,

88
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,310
yeah. You've got make Darwin. Nah,

89
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,120
just like I knew you would.

90
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,110
Well I'll shake it up a
statue.

91
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,620
Come on baby

92
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,500
God on and work it all out.
Yeah,

93
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:40,360
we had twisted a little
girl. Yeah, no, yeah.

94
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,000
Twice a fun. Yeah, no,

95
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,920
not twist a little closer.

96
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:50,150
Now I know that you're mad.

97
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,070
And another

98
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,220
video that I'm very excited to share
with you of one of our most favorite

99
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:05,000
laboratory participants
completing this task is John Lutz,

100
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:09,410
who's a television writer who's written
for both Saturday night live and 30 rock.

101
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,410
And you may know him as playing
the character. Let's on 30 rock.

102
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,820
So now I'm very excited to show
you a video of John Lutz. Indeed,

103
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:20,030
even as you know, a
famous writer, an actor,

104
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:24,530
he too experienced embarrassment when
having to sing the song, twist and shout,

105
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,620
and then have the video of
himself presented back to him.

106
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,320
So in summary,

107
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,100
when we think of music and singing
as a tool for eliciting emotion,

108
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,060
we see that it's very good at eliciting
emotional processes like reactivity.

109
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,020
And the advantages are that it's
relatively simple, effective.

110
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,040
And as you saw by some of the
video demonstrations engaging.

111
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,920
The disadvantages though
can be that for one,

112
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:57,930
when you use music to elicit emotions,

113
00:07:57,931 --> 00:08:01,290
it's really difficult to match the
musical tastes to the participant.

114
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,740
So I sewed you Eric,
I x technique of using classical music,

115
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,720
which doesn't fit everyone,
right?

116
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:09,540
So you want to try your
best to standardize music,

117
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,700
but also match it to the
people who come into the lab.

118
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,930
And as you saw in some of the videos,
um, by both Laura Santos and John,

119
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:17,910
let's from 30 rock and
Saturday night live,

120
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,350
there can be some part of Smith discomfort
when you ask them to sing in front of

121
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:24,480
the camera and then
present it back to them.

122
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,860
So now we're gonna move on to
the acoustic startle reflex.

123
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,420
So that startle reflex has three parts.

124
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:36,420
And this is something that we all are
ingrained with and built with us human

125
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:40,920
beings. So first, if we hear
some stimulus, some loud,

126
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,960
just Bam noise in front of us,

127
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,040
we have an initial response and
this occurs within 500 milliseconds.

128
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,000
And it consists of a stereotype
pattern of sematic and muscular actions

129
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,860
associated with physiological responding.
So we all just kind of shutter jolt,

130
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,140
right? This is something we all do. Now,

131
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:01,530
the part that's relevant for emotion
researchers is what comes, comes after,

132
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:03,690
which is a secondary emotional response.

133
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,830
So essentially what you're getting is
a person's emotional response to having

134
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:10,920
been startled.
And this varies widely across individuals.

135
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,200
It can take place in
the form of amusement,

136
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:16,650
sort of laughing at yourself for
having been startled, embarrassment,

137
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:18,210
and even anger or fear.

138
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,530
So Acoustic startle reflex as a
methodology is really good at eliciting

139
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:29,280
reactivity as you saw across
the wide variety of emotions.

140
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,090
It has the advantage of being
relatively simple, unobtrusive,

141
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,860
and you can get these both
automatic primary responses
as well as more secondary

142
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,330
emotion responses to having been startled.
The disadvantages though,

143
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:46,020
or is that it's often limited to measuring
just the general defensive kind of

144
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:47,340
reflects of response.

145
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,570
So you can't really tap into more
specific emotions very easily.

146
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,270
So you can use it for
some kinds of responses,

147
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:58,350
but you can't use it to measure the
whole wide variety of our emotional,

148
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,700
you know,
repertoire.

149
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,370
So we'll move from acoustic startle
reflex to what's called startle eyeblink

150
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,130
modulation.
And I'll explain what this means now.

151
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,820
So startle eyeblink modulation is
a really interesting phenomena.

152
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:16,680
So essentially what you're measuring is
how big of an eye blink did you make?

153
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,100
Right? It was at a very big, I
blink or really tiny. I blink.

154
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:23,850
And you may wonder how the heck is
that relevant to emotion at all?

155
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,900
I certainly remember thinking the
same thing when I joined the lab as an

156
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:31,680
Undergrad student and they were having
me code the magnitude of how big a

157
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,850
person's blink was.

158
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,570
But what's really cool about
startle eyeblink modulation
is it actually can tell

159
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:41,010
us a wide variety about emotion
that's less susceptible to demand

160
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:45,240
characteristics or people trying to guess
what the experiment is about or rate

161
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,490
what they think they ought
to be feeling in that study.

162
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,040
So what we do with startle eyeblink
modulation is you attach a variety of

163
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,810
electrodes to the person's face,

164
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,830
and these electrodes can be used to
measure the amplitude or how big the eye

165
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:02,970
blink is. Now, this may seem
pretty wild to you at first sight,

166
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,160
but larger eye blinks are an indirect
indicator of negative emotions,

167
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,460
whereas smaller eye blinks are an
indirect indicator of positive emotions.

168
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,320
So I was like this analogy
that helps illustrate this.

169
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,030
So imagine you're walking down a dark
alley and something startles you, right?

170
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,850
You're likely to have a
very big reflexive response,

171
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,100
including a very big eye blink.

172
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,240
So that's because you were probably
anxious or a little nervous.

173
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,380
So in a way your eye blink
actually provided a window
into how you were feeling.

174
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,610
Now contrast this with walking down a
sunny beach, right? It's a sunny day.

175
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:42,630
The skies are clear and
again, out of nowhere someone
comes out and startles you.

176
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,370
Now you're going to still blink,

177
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,360
but how big you blink is actually going
to be attenuated or it's going to be a

178
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:49,440
smaller eye blink.

179
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:53,380
So what you're really getting at is
how much people respond to startles.

180
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,420
So while people are
wearing these electrodes,

181
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:57,400
you present a brief noise over there,

182
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:02,380
headphones that causes them to blink and
whether they blink of a large magnitude

183
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:06,040
or small magnitude in response
to watching a series of prompts.

184
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,280
I apps photos that we talked about
in our last lecture positively,

185
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:14,281
negatively or neutrally balanced or
watching emotional films actually highly

186
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:18,010
correlates with people self
reported emotion experience,

187
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,490
but does it in a way that's more indirect
in a way that some people might say is

188
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,380
an actually more reliable
indicator of their emotion state.

189
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:31,390
So the eye and perhaps the eye blink can
be a window into a person's emotional

190
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:32,980
soul,
surprisingly enough.

191
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,540
So when we think about
Acoustic startle reflex,

192
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,480
what we're getting at our
processes and emotional reactivity,

193
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,830
how much your eyes quote blink in response
to feeling negative or positive when

194
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:46,470
startled.
The advantages are that it's simple,

195
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,360
unobtrusive and less subject to demand
characteristics as we just spoke about.

196
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,810
But the disadvantages are you really
only get broadly at positive and negative

197
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:57,030
leave valence behaviors.

198
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,300
You can't really get into complex emotions
like pride or embarrassment or shame.

199
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,300
So you have a less rich Rhett
repertoire of emotional behavior.

200
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,550
But if your question is really focused
on how positive or how negative is that

201
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:15,930
person feeling in the moment, it can be
a useful tool for that specific purpose.

202
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:21,180
So now I want to turn to our final
tool in our emotional toolbox,

203
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,540
which is the directed facial action task.

204
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,200
So this is a really cool task and one of
the first that was used in the field of

205
00:13:31,081 --> 00:13:34,380
emotional dissertation.
So for the directed facial action task,

206
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,140
I'm going to ask you to
engage in an exercise with me.

207
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,580
What I'd like you to do is to first
get out a sheet of paper and a pen.

208
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,310
So now you're sitting at your
laptop watching this video.

209
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,110
So I'd like you to just for a second,

210
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,920
kind of go old school and go get out
an actual piece of paper and a pen.

211
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,750
And then I'm going to ask you to follow
some instructions along with me. Okay.

212
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,800
So let's assume you now have a piece of
paper and a pen and I want you to do the

213
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:01,350
following. Okay? So take one

214
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,730
I'd like you to do is pull the
corners of your mouth downward.

215
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,770
Now as the corners of
your mouth stay downward,

216
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,550
raise your eyebrows up
and pull them together.

217
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,730
Kind of bring them towards
the center of your face.

218
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,830
Now squint your eyes slightly as
you're doing all these things.

219
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,430
Okay?

220
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,660
And hold this for 10
seconds. So one, two, three,

221
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,130
four, five, six, seven,

222
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,950
eight,
nine and 10.

223
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,000
Now I'd like you to write down
how do you feel this was take one.

224
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,710
So very negative over here at the left,
negative four to zero,

225
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:51,800
which is neutral to positive is four.

226
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,220
So pick one of these numbers here
right now to indicate how you feel.

227
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,033
Okay?

228
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,900
Now we're going to do take two.
So follow my instructions again.

229
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:09,120
This time I want you to pull your eyebrows
together towards the center of your

230
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:09,954
face,

231
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:11,760
okay?

232
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,970
Why didn't your eyes by
pooling your upper eyelid ups?

233
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:18,840
So kind of try to get your eyes big,
pull up your eyelid,

234
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,940
get those eyes nice and big.

235
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,400
Press your lips together.
Hold him really tight.

236
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,590
And as you have your eyebrows together,
your eyes are widened,

237
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:37,120
your lips are pressed. Try to
tighten your lips and raise them up.

238
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,400
Now hold this for 10 seconds and
we'll count together. So one,

239
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,770
two, three, four, five, six,

240
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,870
seven, eight, nine and 10. Okay.

241
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,430
Now I'd like you to rate how you
feel now. Negative four, negative,

242
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,800
zero, neutral, all the
way up to four positive.

243
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:10,030
And now take three. And thanks for bearing
with me. So let's try this together.

244
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,300
Pull the corners of your
mouth upward this time.

245
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,180
Okay,

246
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,760
now take the corners of your mouth
as they're up and pull them outwards.

247
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:23,550
So away from the center of your
face as much as you possibly can.

248
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,840
Squint your eyes slightly
and hold this for 10 seconds.

249
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,490
All right, so let's count
one, two, three, four,

250
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,870
five, six, seven, eight,

251
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,350
nine and 10.
Okay,

252
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,600
so write down how you feel

253
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,900
negative four all the way up to four.

254
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,680
And let's try to guess.
So for take one,

255
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,130
this was the facial configuration
that's associated with sadness.

256
00:16:56,131 --> 00:17:00,420
So most people report feeling more on
the negative spectrum of that scale you

257
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:03,500
saw on the negative number range.
So these are the facial muscles,

258
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,190
the muscles associated with sadness.

259
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,870
And we find that when people sort of
basically put their faces in the muscle

260
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:12,780
configurations that are associated
with the display of sadness,

261
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,240
we actually report feeling
more negative or more sad.

262
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,500
What would you guess for take two?
What kinds of emotions did you feel?

263
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:25,250
Well you were correct for the day and can
get extra credit if you guessed anger.

264
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:26,451
So again,

265
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:30,410
you probably should've seen that your
emotions were being rated as more negative

266
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:35,020
as well here. Now finally for take three,
what would be your guests? What do you,

267
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:40,030
what kind of emotions did you
experience and rate? Well, here you go.

268
00:17:40,031 --> 00:17:45,031
What we had you do is put your face in
the configuration that's associated with

269
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:48,400
feeling joy and happiness.
And we find that when people do that,

270
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,520
either through the
instructions I gave you,

271
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,900
or even simply by at being asked to put
a pen and hold it here on their lip,

272
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,690
that we find that people
actually report feeling happy.

273
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,820
So there's some sort of feedback loop
between the muscles in your face signaling

274
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:07,200
and emotion state to your brain that
then in turn actually helps engender the

275
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:08,610
emotion experience itself.

276
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,910
So people will say this expression
like turn that frown upside down.

277
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,170
Well to some extent there's truth to that.
If we actually try to make our faces,

278
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,960
you know,
show an expression of joy or happiness,

279
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:23,190
we may actually in turn subjectively
feel more positive and happy.

280
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:29,010
So you can do this task both explicitly.
The way we did it today in class,

281
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:32,280
instructing people to move
facial muscles in the take one,

282
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:33,630
two and three we just went through,

283
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,780
or like I was indicating
with the pen implicitly.

284
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:41,460
So just ask people to move their facial
muscles for what seems to be a seemingly

285
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:42,900
unrelated or different tasks.

286
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:47,100
So holding a pen on their lip or putting
a pen in their mouth said sort of

287
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:50,790
elicit the kinds of muscles involved in
happiness display because you can see it

288
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,160
causes the corners of her mouth to go up,
for example.

289
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,330
And for some people it might even cause
this sort of a raising of the cheeks or

290
00:18:57,331 --> 00:19:01,110
crows eyes, the squinting that's also
associated with a Duchenne smile,

291
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:04,050
which is an indicator of happiness
we'll talk about later in the course.

292
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,570
Okay,

293
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,440
so summary here.
So the processes,

294
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,580
you can list it with the directed
facial action task or reactivity.

295
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,020
You can get people to feel emotions.
It's also as in terms of its advantages,

296
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:19,100
simple, unobtrusive and less
subject to demand characteristics.

297
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:23,540
But the disadvantages are you can't really
assess reactivity to external stimuli.

298
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,820
What you are able to assess is how
much people respond when their face has

299
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:33,410
changed, the muscle configurations that
are associated with prototypical emotion

300
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:34,220
displays,

301
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,640
but you can't get sort of how they're
responding to events occurring in the

302
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:38,451
world around them,

303
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:42,080
either on the computer screen or
when interacting with another person.

304
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,500
Yeah.

305
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,160
So we've gone through eight broad
domains of tools and methods. Um,

306
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,870
the latter for we touched on today.

307
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,510
So now I'd like to move
to our takeaway questions.

308
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,303
Yeah.

309
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,190
The first question asks,
well,

310
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:59,940
what were the four emotional
dissertation tools covered today, Aka,

311
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,990
or are you paying attention when we
went through the lecture today? Second,

312
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,760
which of the three key emotional
processes, so reactivity, regulation,

313
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:12,840
and understanding did each of the two
four tools discussed today? Target.

314
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,551
And finally,

315
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:18,120
what were the strengths and limitations
of each of the four tools discussed

316
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:20,250
today?
And with that,

317
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:24,420
we'll turn to a wonderful expert
interview in the domain of emotional

318
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,640
elicitation and measurement.
And again,

319
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:29,640
this is part of our experts
in emotion interview series.

320
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,390
Today we'll be speaking with doctor
Gregg Siegal on emotion elicitation.

321
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,130
Dr Siegel received his PhD degrees
from the San Diego State University and

322
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:42,150
University of California San Diego joint
doctoral program in clinical psychology.

323
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,840
He also completed a clinical internship
at the center for addiction and mental

324
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:49,900
health in Toronto and an NIH postdoctoral
fellowship in clinical cognitive

325
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:52,630
neuroscience at the Western
psychiatric institute and Clinic.

326
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,400
He's currently an associate professor
of psychiatry at the University of

327
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,610
Pittsburgh School of Medicine,

328
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,790
where he directs the program and
cognitive aspect of neuroscience.

329
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,900
Doctor Siegel's research program
examines brain mechanisms of depression,

330
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:07,210
anxiety,
and recovery from these conditions,

331
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,440
as well as using tools of neuroscience
to predict responses to treatments and

332
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:12,880
guide novel Treatment Development.

333
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,890
Dr Siegel has authored over 90
publications and 13 book chapters and has

334
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:19,120
received several honors,

335
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:22,870
including the Western
psychiatric institute and
Clinic Young Investigator Award

336
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,970
and the junior faculty scholar award.

337
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,500
So I now turn to a special experts and
emotion interview with Doctor Gregg Segal.
