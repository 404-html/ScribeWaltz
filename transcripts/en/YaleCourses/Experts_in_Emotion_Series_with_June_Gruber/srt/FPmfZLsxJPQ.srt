1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:01,621
Today,

2
00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:05,550
I'll be speaking with doctor Jo Anne
Bakar Roski professor of psychology at

3
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:09,630
Vanderbilt University where she
directs the Vocal Acoustics Laboratory.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,670
Her work there focuses on laughter and
other domains of vocal communication

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,040
including the vocal expression of emotion,

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,810
infant directed baby talk as well
as speech acoustics more generally.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,530
Um, she's previously served as an
associate editor for the journal,

8
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:29,520
cognition and emotion and has
received several awards for her work,

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,320
including grants from the NSF
as well as the an IMH. Her work,

10
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:38,490
not surprisingly on laughter,
has been widely discussed in the media,

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,010
including the BBC La Times,

12
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:45,900
Scientific American and discovery.
Um, just as a mere example.

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,120
So with this work on laughter,

14
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:53,121
I'm excited to now turn to our experts
in emotion interview with doctor Jo Anne

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,980
Bakar Roski from Vanderbilt
University on laughter.

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,650
So welcome Joanne. Thanks for speaking
with us today and thanks for having me.

17
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:04,500
I'm excited about this.
I'm excited to. Um,

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,160
so I wanted to start by asking you a
little bit about what first got you

19
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:12,960
interested in studying emotion.
I actually stumbled on it by accident.

20
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:17,070
I was studying in post with behavior
and I was looking for some sort of

21
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:20,640
physiological correlate that would go
along with the state of being impulsive.

22
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,740
And a colleague suggested that I record
people's voices and that turned into

23
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,760
vocal expression of emotion and
I really got interested in voice.

24
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:33,360
And what came along with that was
understanding emotions as well.

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,640
So it was a good accident. I mean gotta
love serendipitous accidents, right?

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,050
Yes. So I wanted to then
ask you about your work.

27
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:46,190
So I mean it's really exciting
and you're widely known,

28
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,990
especially for your influential work on
the acoustics of laughter and if we've

29
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:52,580
even developed a comprehensive
laughter dictionary.

30
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,160
And I'm wondering if you could tell
us a little bit about some of the most

31
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:56,450
exciting discoveries here.

32
00:01:56,451 --> 00:02:00,320
I know all of us are really curious about
what is laughter and can there really

33
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,850
be different kinds of laughter.

34
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,370
I think it's one of the most
fascinating behaviors that we engage in.

35
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:10,750
And I think one of the surprising things
to learn is how readily people laugh.

36
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,370
And so we can bring people into the lab
and have them do pretty much anything.

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,700
And as long as they are in pairs
of people or groups of people,

38
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,390
then they'll laugh a lot.
So that was really surprising to me.

39
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,790
Another surprise was just how rich
laughter is as a behavioral repertoire.

40
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,893
And so,

41
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,110
well as listeners we can categorize these
all is kind of falling in a laugh lump

42
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:35,320
of sounds.

43
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,830
There are surprising acoustic very
variations in the sounds and the acoustics

44
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:44,110
themselves or just markedly different
than we see in typical speech.

45
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:49,111
And so we have things like the pitch of
laughter goes wildly all over the place.

46
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,020
We also sometimes produce what are
called acoustic nonlinear charities,

47
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:56,170
which are very unusual in
normal voice or normal speech.

48
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,020
And we see them in laughter a
good proportion of the time.

49
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,700
So that's been really exciting.

50
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:05,230
And then another thing that interests
me is the occasions when we don't laugh.

51
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,550
Like what is it about our social partner
that would lead us to not laugh or even

52
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:11,110
inhibit our laughter.
Wow.

53
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,250
So can I ask you a question then about
this? So in what ways would you say are,

54
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,320
you know,
sort of not all laughs alike?

55
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,950
I think that one of the most important
distinctions is whether laughs or voiced

56
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:23,784
or not.

57
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,050
So we kind of lump laughs into these
voiced and unvoiced categories.

58
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,890
And what it means to be a voice,

59
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:34,891
to have a voice blast is that the vocal
folds are important in the production of

60
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:38,460
that sound.
And so when we produce a voice sound,

61
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,690
it has a periodicity to it because the
vocal folds are operating in synchrony

62
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:45,480
with each other.
When we produce an unvoiced sounds,

63
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:47,220
either the vocal folds
aren't involved with,

64
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:51,690
they're involved more chaotically
and unvoiced sounds are noisier,

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,220
they're more turbulent.

66
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:58,490
And so things like grunts and snorts
are often very rich vocabulary.

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,840
Reid Branson snorts are often unvoiced
and we'll snorts or necessarily envoys

68
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,230
cause they're coming through the nose.
And um, and voice sounds of what we,

69
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,210
I think of as prototypical laugh sound.

70
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,200
So we think about these kind of
song like qualities to laughter.

71
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,910
Those are voiced laughs.

72
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:22,260
And what we've learned about those laughs
is that they are much more likely to

73
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:25,320
elicit positive emotion in
the people who hear them.

74
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,430
So listeners to hear voice laugh,

75
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:32,190
say they're sexier than unvoiced laughs
that they're more likely to want to meet

76
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:33,750
the person who produced the laugh.

77
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,050
They think it's better for a laugh track
and they're saying it makes them feel a

78
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:41,610
lot better than unvoiced sounds or
unvoiced laughs and unvoiced lasts can

79
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:44,610
actually elicit negative
emotions in people.

80
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:47,430
So kind of begs the question of
why we produce so many of those,

81
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:49,860
but we do their prior
to hire our repertoire.

82
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,450
So speaking of that,

83
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:54,630
I mean you've alluded to some important
individual differences and laughter

84
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:57,810
profiles and I wonder if you could say
a little bit about some of the really

85
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:01,100
fascinating gender differences that
you've found here when examining these

86
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,360
different acoustic laughter profiles.

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,100
I think the gender differences are just,
they're fascinating. So yeah, one thing,

88
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,240
we don't get the standard.

89
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:13,110
I think people expect that women laugh
more than men and we've never seen that.

90
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:17,800
So we've now conducted boy at least a
half dozen behavioral studies with a

91
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,190
substantial number of
people in each study.

92
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,970
And we've never found that women
laugh overall more than men do.

93
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,050
But it really depends on who our social
partners are that drive laughter.

94
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,440
So for example, people laugh
more, and this isn't surprising,

95
00:05:31,441 --> 00:05:34,560
but we find that people laugh more when
they're with somebody than when they're

96
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,000
alone. And then they also laughed more
with friends and if they're paired with a

97
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:42,240
stranger. But the most interesting
finding with these, um,

98
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:46,050
sex differences is that what
male subjects do I think?

99
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:50,490
And that is that when males or with a
friend, especially with a male friend,

100
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,060
they laughed more and they
produce higher pitch laughs,

101
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,610
they produce longer laughs and it's,

102
00:05:56,611 --> 00:06:01,611
they're these kind of over the top laughs
that I think that we expected ahead of

103
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:04,370
time that women would actually
do with their women friends.

104
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,880
But it's actually the guys who were doing
it with their guy friends and they'll

105
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,860
do it with female friends as well.

106
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,370
And they will rarely produce these
laughs when there was a stranger.

107
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,410
And that all gets it notions about what
kinds of sounds do you want to produce

108
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,960
with someone who you know
versus who you don't know.

109
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:24,080
So she think about males.
Um,

110
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,190
they can actually work to kind of
reinforce an ongoing relationship.

111
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:31,640
If they produce these voice lasts
that make other people feel good,

112
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,010
but that might be too much acoustic
information if the mail hasn't met the,

113
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,510
the stranger male with a
stranger, females. So if you
can imagine it as a female,

114
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,190
if you were to be at a party and a male
who you've never met before came up and

115
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:49,960
just laughed really loud and long
and I pitched, you'd be like, Whoa,

116
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,960
that's too much information. It's kind
of like, you know, too much overload.

117
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,640
It is overload.
It's too much.

118
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:57,950
I'd like too much eye gaze
of too much physical contact.

119
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,810
So males don't produce those
kinds of laughs with a stranger,

120
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,930
but they produce them a lot
when they're with a friend,

121
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:07,460
especially with their guy friends.

122
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,660
Interesting. I mean,
speaking of friendships,

123
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:14,010
I know you've also looked at this really
intricate kind of temporal dynamics of

124
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:16,680
laughter and the ways that it
can differentiate, you know,

125
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:19,050
close friends from just acquaintances.

126
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,820
I wonder if you could say
something about that too.

127
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,300
Yeah. We looked at, um, what
we call the intifada laughter,

128
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:26,980
which essentially just
means back and forth.

129
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:31,510
Laughter and friends are much more likely
to produce laughs within like a second

130
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:34,870
or two of their other,
the friend that they're being tested with.

131
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,200
We're strangers or just
discoordinate in their laughter.

132
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:41,510
It's almost like a random event.
Um,

133
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,830
what's even more interesting is that
the friends are more likely to have this

134
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,550
antipasto or synchronous
laughter for voice laughter.

135
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,770
So the idea is that if voice laughter
makes other people feel good,

136
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,550
the idea with friends is that they can
have a learned emotional response to the

137
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,570
laugh acoustics of the
friend who they know.

138
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:03,730
So they've been with
this person repeatedly,

139
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,820
they've shared a lot of good times
together. They say their friends.

140
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,660
And so when one person produces
this voice laugh sound, yeah,

141
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:12,100
the person has this very quick,

142
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:16,240
rapid kind of learned response that
includes laughter and in response to the

143
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:17,470
initial friend laughing.

144
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,620
So interesting. You know,
social relationships.

145
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:24,770
I mean you've also uncovered these really,
really,

146
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,790
I think just like groundbreaking
insights into sort of the distinct social

147
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,090
consequences of different laughter
types that you've spoken about today.

148
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,730
And I wondered if you could
say a little bit more about,

149
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,320
in what ways do these voice versus
unvoiced laughter elicit different social

150
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:40,760
responses from other people?

151
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,860
I think, um, I don't want to correct
your question, but I want, go ahead.

152
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,750
We actually haven't studied directly
social consequences and I think that is a

153
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:54,890
really key question and it's one that
we're like directly underway starting to

154
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,550
Estin lab. So it's really exciting and
I think that's critically important.

155
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:03,080
What we've done is studied laughter
in an almost disembodied way.

156
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,440
So people come to the lab,

157
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,250
they're in a perception study essentially
they come into a sterile environment

158
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:09,840
and they hear these labs over headsets,

159
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,710
but they're not interacting with the
person when they're making judgments about

160
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:17,700
the laughs. And if tested
people in the social situations,

161
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,930
we haven't yet analyzed data that we have.
On what,

162
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,770
how much did you like your partner if
they were producing lots of voice laughter

163
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:27,420
versus how much did you like your partner?

164
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,240
They weren't producing those sounds
that they weren't laughing a lot.

165
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,740
And so we're just really at the beginning
stages of being able to address that.

166
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,610
But I think it's really the most important
kind of question we can be asking

167
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,540
about the sounds,

168
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,810
well I can't wait to hear what your
findings, you know, on earth. I mean,

169
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:46,180
do you think in any way some
of these findings, I know some,

170
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:49,000
it sounds like it's at the forefront
of where you're working right now,

171
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,290
but I wonder if you know, where at any
point to have a sense of, you know,

172
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:57,250
how we ought to laugh, you know,
in society and social interactions.

173
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:02,020
I think the results have
implications for that. But the, um,

174
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,600
I don't think we have a lot
of control over our laughter.

175
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,020
So when we try to shape it,
it's actually a challenge.

176
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,660
And if we want to really
shape it for our lifetime,

177
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,850
we really have to kind of work at that.

178
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:17,090
So we might have to work at making her
laugh less loud or making sure to laugh.

179
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:21,520
So whatever. I think we do though
to the course of development,

180
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,500
learn a whole lot about what kinds
of sounds work in what circumstances.

181
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,520
Um, I think that the same way we learn
things like I mentioned earlier about eye

182
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:34,700
gaze and, and physical proximity.
We learn what works in,

183
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,200
in with different kinds of people
and different kinds of circumstances.

184
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:39,910
And I think we do the
same for our laughter.

185
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,200
And then I think that we
actually run into pretty, um,

186
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,600
I don't want to say dramatic,

187
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:51,601
but I think people really can have social
difficulties when they use laughter in

188
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:55,480
the wrong way or in the wrong
sorts of circumstances. Um,

189
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,620
and so people talk anecdotally about
that and we haven't directly studied that

190
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,970
either at this point.

191
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,470
But I do think that in the absence
of using laughter effectively,

192
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,950
people really can have challenges
in their social relationships.

193
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,780
So when you say that about sort of
where your path is taking you, you know,

194
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:17,830
into the world of emotion,
kind of serendipitously
and now becoming, you know,

195
00:11:17,831 --> 00:11:19,630
the laughter expert,
you know,

196
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,810
and all the discoveries you've made
in the directions you're going.

197
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,920
Where do you see, looking ahead,
sort of the future of emotion headed?

198
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,450
What are the important directions?

199
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,290
I think,
um,

200
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,220
well actually I was reminded of this all
today when the New York Times announced

201
00:11:34,221 --> 00:11:36,650
that Obama was about to spend many,

202
00:11:36,651 --> 00:11:40,340
many millions of dollars to understand
the brain. And I thought, well,

203
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:44,180
surely there'll be an important role
for emotions and psychology in this.

204
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:45,920
And I think that,
you know,

205
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:48,860
on the one hand we are traveling
and understanding the brain more,

206
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:53,800
but I think it's also important to kind
of hang on to behavior and that really

207
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:57,640
what's most important down the road is
to make links between brain behavior

208
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:01,390
relations and a more naturalistic way
then we've done with some of our lab

209
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,420
paradigms to date.
Um,

210
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:06,340
and I think another thing that's really
exciting coming down the road with

211
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:10,210
emotions we search is being able to
use behavioral genetics techniques to

212
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:13,900
understand, especially disturbances
and dysfunctions in laughter.

213
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:18,490
And they really see the next 10 years
is exploding in both of those frontiers.

214
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,673
Okay.

215
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,400
So my last question for you then is what
advice do you typically give students

216
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:25,110
who come to you and ask,
you know,

217
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:29,520
your thoughts on should I embark in this
field and what are important? You know,

218
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:32,490
ways that I should be thinking about
becoming an emotion researcher.

219
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,890
I think, um, what I see
with a lot of students is,

220
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:41,430
is a really get revved up about emotions,
which is great.

221
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,390
Um,

222
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:47,370
and if they get caught up in technique
a little bit too much and or tools.

223
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,850
And so they want to learn imaging or
they want to learn eye tracking and they

224
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:52,410
want to learn psychophysiology.

225
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,550
And so what I try to shape students to
really understand is that those tools and

226
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:59,410
techniques are always going to be
there. So behavioral genetics, right?

227
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:03,030
It's going to be the next of,
of those tools that we can use.

228
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,710
But the most important thing they can do
is to identify some core questions that

229
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:12,690
they're passionate about that really tell
us something about the heart of what's

230
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:17,070
going on with emotional processing.
And if they can get, you know,

231
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:20,490
just develop those important questions
and follow through, then then yes,

232
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:22,770
they can learn imaging and yes,
they can learn all these things,

233
00:13:22,771 --> 00:13:24,990
but the questions themselves
are the most important.

234
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,470
Well, thank you so much for
speaking today. It's been
such a pleasure. Thank you.

235
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:34,180
So this concludes our experts and emotion
interview with Dr Joann background ski

236
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,550
from Vanderbilt University.
Thanks again.
