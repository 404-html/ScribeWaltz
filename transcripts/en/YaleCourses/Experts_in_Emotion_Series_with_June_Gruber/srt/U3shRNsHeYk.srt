1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,270
Today for our experts
in emotion interview.

2
00:00:02,271 --> 00:00:05,900
We'll be speaking with doctor Barbara
Fredrickson on positive emotion.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,850
So doctor Fredrickson is a distinguished
professor of psychology and director of

4
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:15,080
the positive emotions and psychophysiology
lab at the University of North

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,560
Carolina.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,000
She's a leading scholar studying positive
emotions and human flourishing and her

7
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:24,200
research on positive emotions
and lifestyle change is
funded by the u s national

8
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:25,220
institutes of health.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,750
Dr Fredrickson has published more than
100 peer reviewed articles and book

10
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:34,751
chapters and with the publication of
positivity in 2009 and love 2.0 and 2013

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,230
she's written about her research
for general audiences as well.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,460
Doctor Frederickson's contributions have
been recognized with numerous honors,

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,250
including the American
psychological associations,

14
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:48,320
Templeton prize and positive psychology,

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,310
and the society of experimental
psychology, his career trajectory award.

16
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,900
So I now turn to a very special experts
in emotion interview together with Dr

17
00:00:56,901 --> 00:01:00,110
Barbara Fredrickson from the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,690
So welcome Barb. Thank you so
much for speaking with us today.

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,753
It'd be here.

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,050
I thought what might be a fun way to kick
this off is by asking you a little bit

21
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:13,570
about what first got you
interested in emotion.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,340
Yeah. Um, that's a great question.

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,460
When I started in graduate school,

24
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:22,700
there was really hardly
any work on emotions.

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,100
And ironically,
I,

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,570
I looked back at the first project
that I was involved in as a first year

27
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:34,370
student in college and it was somebody
doing in their senior thesis on emotions.

28
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,090
And I remember thinking, what are
emotions? How could, you know,

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,040
it was just that confusing to me.

30
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:45,430
And even as I was part of the very
first cohort of the NIH motion postdoc

31
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,410
program that,
um,

32
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,730
Richard Lazarus and Paul
Ekman put together at the
time and we had a year long

33
00:01:52,731 --> 00:01:53,930
seminar on emotions.

34
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:57,470
And I think I was still halfway through
that thinking and what are we talking

35
00:01:57,471 --> 00:02:01,210
about? You know, you kind
of had this sense, you know,

36
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,390
there's something important here,

37
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,340
but there was so little science
on it beyond face expressions,

38
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,940
um,
and a little bit of stress and coping.

39
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,930
So there really wasn't a fleshed
out of view of it. And you know,

40
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,480
that actually might have a lot to do with
the sort of stoic upbringing I had as

41
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:24,640
a family when the, nobody talked
about emotions. So, you know,

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,270
maybe I was coming at it very much from
the outsider's perspective, but um,

43
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,853
it's,
I,

44
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,920
I very much only came to understand
emotions from an academic angle.

45
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,380
And then I feel like I became
more fully human after,

46
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,040
after understanding more about emotions.

47
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,130
I didn't come from it
being fully human first.

48
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,150
And so by studying emotions you
become actualized in some way, right?

49
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,790
You've been doing, you know, I feel
like that's been my own personal.

50
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,733
Uh Huh.

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,820
So what I'd like to ask you a little bit
is about the really groundbreaking work

52
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:04,690
you've done in this area, especially
on positive emotions. So, I mean,

53
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:08,890
you're known widely for this pioneering
work and really delineating the

54
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,110
functional significance
of positive emotions.

55
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:14,880
You've published numerous articles and
you have several major books, you know,

56
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,950
love 2.0 and positivity.
And in particular,

57
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:20,980
what I wanted to talk with you about
today is your theory, you know,

58
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:23,470
the broaden and build
theory of positive emotions.

59
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,290
And I wonder if you could just say a
little bit more of sort of what are the

60
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,570
central principles behind this model?

61
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,920
Right. Um, the theory
first emerged from a,

62
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,770
a puzzle and intellectual puzzle of um,

63
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,610
trying to understand
how emotions involved.

64
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,600
And at the time when I got on the scene,

65
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,610
the main story about how emotions evolved
all hinged on the idea of specific

66
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:53,510
action tendencies that um, you know, uh,

67
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,100
kind of a fight or flight response and
emotions get you to do what's going to

68
00:03:58,101 --> 00:04:00,260
save your skin in that moment.

69
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,680
And the kinds of things that had been
identified for the positive emotions

70
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,070
really were not specific
and often not actions.

71
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,220
So the, this sort of, um,

72
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:19,210
keystone concept that was our ability
or wealthy of understanding why emotions

73
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,140
involved just didn't fit at
all for the positive emotions.

74
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,150
And so when I was doing my postdoc
with Bob Levenson at UC Berkeley,

75
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,780
I started working on an
idea that he had had,

76
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,490
which he had written about casually in
a chapter before then. And I thought,

77
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,620
that's interesting.
I want to study that thing.

78
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,640
And his prediction was that well,

79
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,380
maybe positive emotions don't have their
own physiological signature or really

80
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,470
kind of a weight thing that they're
trying to do to the body or yes as you to

81
00:04:53,871 --> 00:04:57,650
do, but maybe undo, um, negative emotions.

82
00:04:57,651 --> 00:05:00,110
And so that's where I started with,
um,

83
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,470
with Bob in Bob's lab working on tests
of this undoing effect of positive

84
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,124
emotions.

85
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:12,430
I presented it at a major
emotions conference a couple
of years later and got a

86
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:17,921
lot of heat for saying that undoing
was the function of positive emotions.

87
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,390
And that kind of sent me
back to the drawing board to
read everything I could on

88
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:26,570
evolutionary perspectives, how to
make a proper evolutionary argument.

89
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,700
And I decided in the end that undoing
is not a function of positive emotions.

90
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:36,470
Undoing is a byproduct of one
direct function, which are really,

91
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,350
it comes in two phases.
Um, broaden and bill,

92
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,100
which happened on very different
timescales from each other.

93
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,340
Thing is what positive
emotions do in the moment.

94
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,090
They literally changed the way
your brain works along with you.

95
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,550
Taking more for the nation in
your peripheral vision expands.

96
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,030
Um, you're more creative. You connect, uh,

97
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,650
connect the dots to see the
bigger picture. And that's a,

98
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:05,120
a momentary cognitive change that occurs
while you're experiencing a positive

99
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:09,200
emotion. Now the other part of the theory
is the, so what, why does that matter?

100
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:13,040
How could this save your skin? Um,

101
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,100
and the key is that it
doesn't save your skin.

102
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:20,240
And the same way that negative emotions
might have led to a quick and decisive

103
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:25,040
action that would get you away from
a Predator, a positive emotion, um,

104
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,500
that broaden mindset,
um,

105
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,810
experienced frequently
allows your, um, you,

106
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,210
you're, you're, uh,

107
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,750
resources to accumulate and compound
and puts you on a positive trajectory of

108
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:39,380
growth.

109
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,380
So the key is the reason positive emotions
we're adaptive for our ancestors is

110
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,940
that by repeated experiences
of positive emotions,

111
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:54,420
we built up more social support, more, um,

112
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,490
resilience, better environmental
knowledge, better physical health.

113
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,010
That's where most of our
work is going these days.

114
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,790
And that you basically
become a more resourceful,

115
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,140
a better version of yourself in a way
that allows you to address future threats

116
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,920
and future challenges.

117
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,630
So the benefit of positive emotions
isn't in the moment that you experienced

118
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:18,140
them.

119
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,140
The benefit of them is having them as
a steady diet overtime so that you can

120
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:28,280
grow and become a more resilient,
resourceful person over time. So,

121
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,293
um,

122
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,130
broaden and build as a
process isn't one thing.

123
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,020
There's broadening that happens in
the moment that happens over time.

124
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,940
Um,
but uh,

125
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,870
together it kind of forms this
upward spiral that puts people on a,

126
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,880
on a positive trajectory of growth.

127
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,510
So what do you see as some of
the most central, you know,

128
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:55,200
empirical findings that have flowed
from this model? You know, I,

129
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,410
I,
I think we've,

130
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,490
in my lab we've done some interesting
studies on how positive emotions broaden

131
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:02,001
awareness,

132
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:06,230
but my favorite studies on broadening
awareness come from other people's labs

133
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,670
securely.

134
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,650
Like the work that Adam Anderson
has done where he's shown that,

135
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,910
um,
uh,

136
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,970
at very early stages of encoding people
are seeing more of the peripheral vision

137
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:24,500
has expanded.
And that's happening at a,

138
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:27,680
it's not something that
people report on later.

139
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:32,540
It's really happening at an
intake level that people,

140
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,620
when they're feeling good,

141
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:37,400
it's like they can't help but take
in more of the contextual surrounding

142
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,890
inflammation. And it's like, um,

143
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,400
it's like the door first of perception
are opened up and people taken theirs.

144
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,010
They're sponges for contextual and I
like how his lamb has also shown that um,

145
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,720
that more open visual perception
leads to more verbal creativity.

146
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,290
So going [inaudible] you see a connection
between different kinds of Broadman

147
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,460
and I've also collaborated with uh,

148
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,930
a kinesiologist and we've
looked at how emotion is

149
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:19,010
conveyed in body movements and we find
that there's broadening in the torso to

150
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,130
wow them with positive peoples also is
expand in ways that reflect the way their

151
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:31,350
mind is expanded and their visions of
their social relationships are expanded.

152
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:32,580
So um,

153
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:38,010
this broadened awareness or this
expansive way of being in the world is

154
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:41,820
something that comes through in
comportment and as embodied as well.

155
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,630
So those are some of the things,

156
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,150
things that I think are exciting on the
broadening side, on the building side,

157
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:52,350
I have to say the thing that I'm most
excited about right now is working on

158
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:55,290
changes in gene expression
in the immune system.

159
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,270
And we're doing a large scale study where
we're teaching people different skills

160
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:05,271
for a self generating positive emotions
and drawing blood before and after.

161
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:07,500
And then, uh, you know,

162
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:12,501
as long term follow up to see if we can
see chain ges and gene expression person

163
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,890
that track there, um, efforts to, um,

164
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,210
experience more positive
emotion and David for life.

165
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,780
It's fascinating.
I'm really excited to see where it goes.

166
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,990
Yeah, that's um, we've got very,

167
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,310
we've got some cross sectional
data that are very suggestive.

168
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,420
The tune on data are coming in soon.
Wow.

169
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,350
So one thing I always wonder,
I mean I love your model.

170
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:45,000
It's so beautiful and elegant and
having come from a discrete emotions

171
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:46,770
perspective, you know, myself, I,

172
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,670
I wonder to what extent you think this
model applies equivalently across states

173
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:54,780
that ranged from, you know, pride,
very self focused to gratitude,

174
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:58,920
very other focused or just reward
related feelings of enthusiasm and joy.

175
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,420
Do we know this at this point?

176
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:05,800
You know, we really don't know
this, that this by, um, uh,

177
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,320
we
and the,

178
00:11:09,321 --> 00:11:12,720
the data are murky in my own studies.
We measure,

179
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:15,210
I mean I come from a discrete
emotions per se, the two,

180
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,370
and to measure people's self reports
of about 10 different discrete,

181
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:21,520
positive emotions.

182
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,750
And so far we find no distinctions
between them that are interventions,

183
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:31,380
which are specifically around kindness,
love and compassion.

184
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,670
They raise all the positive
emotions. Yup. Yup. Said pride,

185
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,690
even interest.

186
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:41,691
I mean that could mean that people's
self reports are just completely not fine

187
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:47,061
tuned enough to pick things up or it could
mean that people co experience these,

188
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:51,780
that they, they are positive
emotions are um, uh,

189
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,240
experienced as in,

190
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,150
in very overlapping in a
blended capacities. Um,

191
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,150
it could be that the way
people conceptualize them.
And I'll also, you know,

192
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,870
currently very influenced by Lisa Feldman,

193
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:08,890
Barrett pissed and then close to views
on how conceptualization matters.

194
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Especially now that I'm offering a new
conceptualization of love and how people

195
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,090
seem to react to that when they say,
oh, I never thought about love that way.

196
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:22,740
And then they start experiencing it
a little bit differently. So, um,

197
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,960
it's not like, uh, um,

198
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,180
I don't think the kinds of data
that I've collected can, um,

199
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,600
actually say anything about
whether emotions are discreet or,

200
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,830
or not in terms of the way that debate
has been going on in terms of are there

201
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,860
discreet brain circuits.
Um,

202
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,350
discreteness doesn't always seem
to be honored in people's, um, uh,

203
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,770
self reports of the experience. And, um,

204
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:56,190
actually I sat down with Lisa Feldman
Barrett some some time ago and she said,

205
00:12:56,561 --> 00:13:00,430
yeah, I was thinking about how
my work might relate to yours.

206
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,090
And she and I both kind of scratched
our heads and said they don't,

207
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,930
uh, neither one contradicts the other. Um,

208
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:15,010
so I think that's a great way to push
the field further is to really try to

209
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:19,700
understand where the boundaries between
those two and where does it matter and

210
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:20,570
where doesn't it matter?

211
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,400
One thing you alluded to in your response
that I wanted to ask you more about

212
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:27,480
that. I think so interesting as this
work you've done on intervention.

213
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:29,920
So really conducting these important,
you know,

214
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:34,420
translational approaches that look at
how we can cultivate positive emotion.

215
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:36,210
And I know you've done this among Indian,

216
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,630
those individuals even
suffering from severe mental
disorders like schizophrenia.

217
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,050
And so I wondered if you could say a
little bit more about the promise of this

218
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:45,260
as a potential,
you know,

219
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,150
intervention towards a building
and cultivating positivity. Right?

220
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,630
You don't want them. What's
interesting about it is that I, um,

221
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,830
I never thought I was doing
translational research or um,

222
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,840
develop the intervention.
It's just that the,

223
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:06,070
the side of the shape of
the bill hypothesis in the
broaden and build theory,

224
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,890
you can only test it if you look at,
well,

225
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:12,670
what happens if someone's
daily Diet increases over time?

226
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,950
How do they change over time?

227
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,500
And started test that got
me into a zone that, um,

228
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,600
looks like interventions
kicked up some interventions,

229
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,690
most certainly. Um, and we've
worked particularly with the,

230
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:33,420
the actually, when I first started
trying to test this part of the theory,

231
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,480
I had a number of failed interventions.
Hmm.

232
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,800
And then I realized I didn't
need to recreate the wheel
and build one on my own.

233
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:46,080
I came across this ancient technique
of meditation called loving kindness

234
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:48,270
meditation and realize,
you know,

235
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,280
my a big light bulb went off and I
thought I could use that test my theory.

236
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,430
So I wasn't really doing
research on meditation.

237
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,550
I was doing research on
emotions using meditation. Um,

238
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,540
but it certainly points out the,

239
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:05,570
the power of mind any as a way to
learn how to regulate one's emotions.

240
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,290
Um,
one of my colleagues here,

241
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:14,291
David Penn works on schizophrenia and
he heard me give a talk and saw that one

242
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,070
of our findings with our
normal subjects was, um,

243
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,960
that it's a learning,

244
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:25,961
loving kindness meditation helps
people anticipate or saver.

245
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,430
It's your positive events, which is, as
you know from an cranes were very much,

246
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,190
um,
at issue with schizophrenia and the,

247
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,350
especially the negative
symptoms of schizophrenia.

248
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:41,650
So we ran a number of groups where we
taught the same exact class that we have

249
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,800
hot too,
um,

250
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,880
healthy community members to community
dwelling schizophrenia with negative

251
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,110
symptoms.

252
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:55,100
And one of the most surprising things
is that these people were selected for

253
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:59,180
their negative symptoms, which means
they, they don't feel like, um,

254
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,020
they're not very motivated, that
don't want to be social. They're not,

255
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:08,120
they don't really talk about emotions.
Um, we almost had perfect attendance.

256
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,930
Wow. Each thing in and of itself
is that they kept coming past,

257
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,560
really liked learning
this new skill. And, um,

258
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,280
we found that on self reports there,
um,

259
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,070
negative symptomatology was improved.
Uh,

260
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:30,071
so it seems to be holding some promise
to kind of wake up the positive emotion

261
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:35,120
system, kind of take it off
the floor and raise it. Um,

262
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,990
and I think that could be useful in a
number of different clinical disorders.

263
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:43,790
I'm starting to collaborate with another
clinician where we'll look at the

264
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:48,650
effects of, uh, of loving kindness
meditation on social anxiety. So,

265
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,720
um, you know, as a social psychologist,

266
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,910
I do all the clinical work
in collaboration with, um,

267
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,190
people who are better trained for
dealing with diverse populations.

268
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:02,390
But I'm really excited to see those
applications come, you know, come on into

269
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,450
a test.
I mean,

270
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:08,170
it's amazing research and it's very
timely and much needed in the fact that

271
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:11,020
you're saying you're getting these
results with some of, you know,

272
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:12,460
when we think of psychiatric disorders,

273
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:15,130
the most severe and chronic
of them all schizophrenia.

274
00:17:15,131 --> 00:17:18,430
I mean that's just so promising
and it makes me wonder, you know,

275
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:22,960
to what extent we can think about this
as a potential trans diagnostic type of

276
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:27,450
intervention, you know, to optimize mental
health more broadly across populations.

277
00:17:27,451 --> 00:17:30,580
I know you're looking at
social anxiety disorder, um,

278
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,970
and so I wonder to what extent you think
we might be cultivating some critical

279
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:38,440
ingredients here therapeutically that we
can apply broadly? Right. Well, you know,

280
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:38,790
my,
Hi,

281
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,790
I'm take from the theory is that
positive emotions help us become better

282
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:45,490
versions of ourselves.

283
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:50,070
I'm mostly testing it with
healthy adults and um,

284
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,030
you know, that goes trans
diagnosis, trans diagnoses.

285
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,420
And so I don't think that would be any
different when you go into the clinical

286
00:17:57,421 --> 00:18:00,390
domain since aspect of,
um,

287
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,510
dysregulation is so prominent across so
many different diagnoses that I think

288
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:09,240
that this is,
this is one that holds particular promise.

289
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,060
So having talked a bit about just
how you got started in emotion,

290
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,170
the really foundational work you've
done in positive emotion from you know,

291
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:21,170
this basic science per second aspect
of building one of the most, you know,

292
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:25,100
integral models we had to date and then
now looking at intervention research.

293
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,370
I wonder as you think about the path
that you've come through this far,

294
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,450
where do you think you see the future
of the field headed from this point

295
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:33,284
forward?

296
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,450
Yeah,

297
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,350
I think that it's going to be
more and more critical for, um,

298
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,890
emotion researchers.
And this is happening already,

299
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:47,190
but to work in team science with chemists
and a genetic guest experts and uh,

300
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,840
imaging expert.
I mean,

301
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,870
and see how far we can
understand the physical and um,

302
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,700
community effects of emotions.
I think that's, um, you know,

303
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:08,650
I'm originally trained as an experimental
social psychologist and our kind of

304
00:19:08,651 --> 00:19:12,640
bread and butter studies are small
laboratory studies, one time tasks.

305
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:17,050
And I think that we're ready
to take that out to two larger,

306
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,370
bigger, bigger timescales,
deeper into the body. And, um,

307
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,720
we can't do that. Um, as individual labs,

308
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,300
this needs to be done as
kind of a big team science.

309
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:33,570
So I see that as something that we
should all be heading towards as at least

310
00:19:35,051 --> 00:19:38,560
part of what we do. I mean,
I think there's, they'll
still always be a place for,

311
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:43,720
um, one time laboratory studies,
you know, to, to test ideas out,

312
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,640
but to,

313
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,840
to take it to a larger scale courses
depends on funding and things like that.

314
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:53,430
But, um, I think that's going to be a
really important funding priority too.

315
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,860
And then related,
I mean,

316
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,550
when you have students come to you asking
me for advice who are thinking about

317
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:02,670
embarking in this field,
what do you typically tell them?

318
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,850
You know, I think that, um, you,

319
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,090
everybody needs to find a part of the
fields that they're absolutely passionate

320
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:15,800
about because, um, I mean,
being an academic is, is, uh,

321
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,790
a tough job. And the payoffs
in terms of, you know,

322
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:23,540
when you get publications are
good news is few and far between.

323
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,060
So you need to be fueled
by your own passion.

324
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,500
And there are tons of great
questions out there. And, um,

325
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,020
just find the one that you
want to work on and dig it.

326
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,900
And don't worry if it
doesn't pay off right away.

327
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,650
There are a lot of people who
have very slow career starts.

328
00:20:39,651 --> 00:20:44,360
I will always be one of that. Um,
some, you know, sometimes that just,

329
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:48,070
it just takes a while to get it
going. Well, thank you so much

330
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,970
for speaking with us today. It's been
wonderful. Okay, thanks. Good to be here.

331
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,530
So this concludes our experts in
emotion interview with Doctor Barbara

332
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,900
Fredrickson from the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

333
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,960
Thank you again, Barbara. Okay, so.
