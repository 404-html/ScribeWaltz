1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,410
Welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,930
So today we're going to talk about touch.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,910
So touch is something that is woven into
our daily exchanges with other people.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,120
We have pats on the back,
handshakes,

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,320
hands resting on someone's shoulders,
a playful nudges.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,240
And one of my favorite things,

7
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:26,010
hugs and touch her is this funny
thing because we do it all the time,

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,990
but we've seen to barely notice it.

9
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:30,870
It just kind of comes and
goes in our everyday life.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,140
Yet we know that touch plays a profound
role on the kinds of feelings and

11
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:40,000
emotions we have,
but yet how precisely does it do it?

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,830
In what way can touch, not only
communicate our feelings to other people,

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,260
but actually being
touched by another person.

14
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:51,910
Change the way that we profoundly feel
about the world and about the people

15
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:56,560
around us. So what's in
a touch, so to speak, um,

16
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,610
touches something that seems not only
to be the fabric of our everyday life,

17
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:04,180
but something that is really pervasive
in a lot of creative works that we

18
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:08,650
generate. So we have songs, you know, by
one of my favorite bands, the Beatles, uh,

19
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:12,430
such as I want to hold your
hand. We also have, um,

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,280
other songs, um, that are, uh,

21
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,280
classics perhaps in a different way,
um, by Mc Hammer who said, you know,

22
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:26,020
you can't touch this, right?
So we see touches this topic
of many songs and music.

23
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,520
Um, we also have entire industries, um,

24
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,860
devoted exclusively to touch.

25
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:37,861
So such as this whole massage industry
where people will pay loads of money

26
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:42,820
simply to have someone rub their neck
and shoulders and these sort of luxurious

27
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:45,640
spa centered around
this phenomena of touch.

28
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,500
Yeah.

29
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,470
Right.
So really what is touch about,

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,030
so I'd like you to think about in this
touch reflection exercise we have here

31
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,170
about a time you can remember feeling
touched by someone close to you.

32
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,100
And I want you to think about what
was going on when this was happening.

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,160
So what sensations did
you have in your body?

34
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,830
What kinds of thoughts were
going through your mind?

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,100
What expressions did
you have on your face?

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,720
And did you notice after this touch,
maybe it was a hug like you can see here,

37
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,880
did you notice any changes in your
level of tension or stress? So again,

38
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:22,680
I want you to take out a piece of paper,

39
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,570
pause the video for a moment and write
down your thoughts to a time you can

40
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:30,450
remember feeling touched
by someone close to you.

41
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,990
And when you're done you can hit play
and we'll continue with the course.

42
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:37,320
And I want you to keep this example in
your mind throughout the rest of the

43
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:38,154
class today.

44
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,623
So today

45
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,520
we're going to really delve into this
idea of touch and is it some sort of

46
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:47,780
contact high?

47
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,280
Do we get this kind of rush of adrenaline
and excitement when we are touched by

48
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:55,820
others? Does it bring us close to
them and what does it do for us?

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,500
Okay,

50
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,210
we're going to go through this road map
today about touching by talking about

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,260
the function of touch,

52
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:06,070
that it's rewarding for us and that it
can actually sue this and calm our stress

53
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:10,600
levels. That it actually increases
cooperation between people,

54
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,880
that it helps us communicate our emotions
simply by touch without speaking or

55
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:17,140
doing anything else.

56
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,070
And we'll conclude with our takeaway
questions and our expert interview today.

57
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,480
So let's start with the ways in which
touch actually feels good for us.

58
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,560
So here we know that touch is actually
rewarding for us and there's a few ways

59
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:34,660
in which it is that is
actually this rewarding.

60
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,900
So one of them is that it
actually stimulates activity
in brain regions such as

61
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:44,530
the orbital frontal cortex that has
been scientifically demonstrated to be

62
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:46,990
associated with the encoding of reward,

63
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:51,991
value and greater activity in the
OFC is associated with people's self

64
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:56,680
reporting, feeling more pleasant,
um, and, and a sense of reward.

65
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,750
So touch actually gets your
brain activated to feel good

66
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,220
related to this.
Um,

67
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,180
studies have found that when you touch
someone on the arm with a velvety cloth,

68
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,340
something as simple as that or a light
hairbrush that it also activates or

69
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:20,780
triggers increases in activity in
the orbital frontal cortex as well.

70
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,850
So touch is rewarding in a very primitive
biological sense that it activates

71
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:27,830
neural regions that are,

72
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,940
we're sort of built and hardwired with
to tell us when something's rewarding or

73
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:35,990
when something feels good.
Touch is also soothing.

74
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:38,390
So it helps us sort of decrease stress.

75
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:43,340
It helps us calm down and in what
ways can touch actually be soothing.

76
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,090
So as you see here,
um,

77
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,550
touch a soothing insofar as it relates
to changes in hormones that are related

78
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:55,970
to our sense of stress or our
sense of love and connection.

79
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,890
So Cortisol is something that we've all
probably heard of and has been thought

80
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:05,720
of as the stress hormone. So Cortisol
is associated with increased reports,

81
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:09,980
a feeling negative effect, as well
as feeling stress. By contrast,

82
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:14,420
we have oxytocin and this has gained a
lot of popular media attention and is

83
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:17,090
thought of as the quote love hormone.
So had,

84
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:21,530
has been associated with feelings of love,
trust, and closeness with other people.

85
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,430
How does touch relate to
cortisol and oxytocin?

86
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:30,730
Will we actually find that when people
underwent a 15 minutes Swedish massage,

87
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,540
um, and during the massage they drew
blood while receiving this massage.

88
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:40,190
They found that even though you're having
blood drawn by simply going through a

89
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:44,120
15 minute massage, you see increases
in these hormone levels. Um,

90
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,710
it's particularly oxytocin, yet you
see a decrease in horror and cortisol.

91
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,450
So you see spikes up in a love hormone
and spikes down in a stress hormone

92
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,910
touches also soothing in other ways.

93
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,420
So here we turn to a different
brain region called the Amygdala.

94
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,640
So the Amygdala is located deep within
the medial temporal lobes of the brain.

95
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:13,150
And activation in this brain region of
the Amygdala is associated with stress

96
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,660
and negative emotional responses.
Again,

97
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,490
let's look at a study here
that was associated with
touch between two people. Um,

98
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:24,950
so this is one of my favorite
studies done by Jim Cohn,

99
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,970
who looked at individuals who are waiting
electric shock while they were in an

100
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,050
Fmri scanner.

101
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,090
So the participants were 16 married
women who came to the scanner and in the

102
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:39,560
scanner they were in one of three
conditions. They were alone by themselves,

103
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:40,940
all lonesome in the scanner.

104
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:46,400
They had a stranger holding their hand
while they were in the scanner and they

105
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:50,060
had or, or they have their husband
holding their hand in the scanner.

106
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,350
And what they actually found is
that having someone hold your hand,

107
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:59,530
decreased your activity in the Amygdala
more so than having no one holds your

108
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:00,440
hand.

109
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,120
So the having someone's literally hold
your hand decreases activity in this

110
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:09,440
brain region associated with emotional
arousal and sometimes stress.

111
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,620
And this was particularly the
case for someone close to you.

112
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,790
So the husband handholding was the
one that was associated with the least

113
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,670
Amygdala reactivity
compared to all conditions.

114
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,880
So when we think of the Beatle Song we
talked about the beginning of today,

115
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:24,530
if I want to hold your hand,
well,

116
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,780
there's a lot of good reasons
to hold someone's hand.

117
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,340
It actually decreases your stress
response to a variety of things, um,

118
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,460
in the scanner when you're
receiving an electric shock.

119
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:39,140
And you can imagine in everyday life to
helping you sort of combat and overcome

120
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,260
daily life stressors.
Okay.

121
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,220
So we also see an infants that touch
actually helps them overcome this very

122
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:51,950
painful procedure.
So when infants are young,

123
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:56,400
they do this extremely painful procedure
for sampling blood. So the infants,

124
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,680
while they sort of cut their foot
in a way to get this blood sample,

125
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:05,270
they studied this by having infants
who are either held or touched by their

126
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:09,140
mother during this procedure versus those
who were not held or touched by their

127
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:09,950
mother.

128
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,950
And they found that infants who were
touched by their mother cried 62% less.

129
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,400
They showed a decrease in the amount of
grimacing in their face by 65% and they

130
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:24,740
also exhibited a lower heart
rate during this procedure.

131
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,800
So touch also leads to better pain,
toleration,

132
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,260
even an extremely young infants.

133
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:36,200
So now we're going to turn to the way in
which touch also increases cooperation.

134
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,130
So here we find fascinatingly a study
that demonstrated how touch promotes

135
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:46,160
bonding and cooperation in groups.
So in this study,

136
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,550
participants are asked to sign a
petition supporting a local issue.

137
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,050
Those who are touched by the person
asking him to sign the petition.

138
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,140
A petition, um, had a higher rate
in which they actually signed on.

139
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:03,141
So 81% of people sign the petition who
were touched versus 55% who signed it

140
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:06,070
when they weren't touched.
Um,

141
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,640
another study looked at cooperation,

142
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,490
having people play what's called
the prisoner's dilemma game.

143
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,620
And in this game they can either cooperate
or compete with a fellow player and

144
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,310
the experimenter who uh, in the
condition, the experimenter,

145
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:23,850
either touch them on the back or
didn't before the game started.

146
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,960
And those participants were actually just
simply touched on the back. That's it.

147
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,170
Just a little touch on the
back by the experimenter.

148
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,470
Somehow that profoundly translated
into cooperating more on a completely

149
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,370
unrelated game.

150
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,720
There's also been additional work on
trust and cooperation by Dacher Keltner

151
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,900
who's looked at touch among NBA basketball
players and finding that basketball

152
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:51,510
players who actually touch each
other more sort of pats on the back,

153
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,340
things of that sort actually tend to
show better performance in a competitive

154
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:57,450
game situation.

155
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,550
So touch seems to increase and foster
cooperation among groups of people working

156
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:07,080
towards a common goal as well as
cooperation with unknown people.

157
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:10,980
So playing a game with someone you don't
know that you can cooperate or compete

158
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:13,950
with or signing a petition
with someone you don't know.

159
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,510
So touch is sort of the fabric that brings
us together as a society and helps us

160
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:22,590
cooperate. It's pretty amazing
what powerful things touch can do.

161
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,353
Finally,

162
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,290
I want to talk with you about some
really fun research that shows that just

163
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,650
simply touching someone's
forearm just like this,

164
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:36,450
that you can reliably communicate
distinct emotions. Wild,

165
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:38,760
right?
That without telling you how I'm feeling,

166
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:42,600
I can pat your arm or do a different
variety of gestures and you'll be able to

167
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,150
pick up on what emotion
I'm signaling to you.

168
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,380
So this is a study that
gain widespread attention.

169
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,860
You can see in the New York Times where
they say a simple five second touch can

170
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,930
convey specific emotions.

171
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,110
So I'll show you what this study looked
like. So here's the testing room.

172
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,460
So in this testing room,

173
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:06,330
there were two strangers who are asked
to sit down in the room across from each

174
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:09,960
other.
And as they sat down,

175
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,280
there was a black curtain that was drawn
in between them so that they couldn't

176
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:15,114
see each other.

177
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,570
But there was an opening here where
they could slip their arm under.

178
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,840
So one of the participants who was the
touchy was asked to extend his arm under

179
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:28,500
the curtain so that all this person
could see was the, the arm of the touchy.

180
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,140
Then this second person referred to as
the toucher was asked to think about how

181
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:36,120
you want to communicate the emotions.

182
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,300
The touches can take any form and last
as long as you think they need to try to

183
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:44,700
be expressive and as,
as possible in your touch.

184
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:50,090
So what happened is that
the toucher was asked to,

185
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,010
um, well there's the,
let's see how to put this.

186
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:58,250
So the touch one person put their arm
under the curtain, who was the, um,

187
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:02,980
toucher and then the touchy was asked
to sort of rate what emotion is this

188
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:05,290
person expressing. So, in other words,

189
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,070
it's two strangers sitting across from
another separated by a black curtain.

190
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,320
And the encoder,
so to speak,

191
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,410
touches the arm of the
decoder to express an emotion.

192
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,490
So one person puts their arm under the
curtain and the other person sees the arm

193
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:22,390
and asked to try to guess what that
person is trying to convey, right?

194
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,530
So when they're asked simply by looking
at the arm and someone touching it,

195
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:28,630
what emotion were they trying to convey?

196
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,820
You find powerful results that people
are able to not only convey an emotion

197
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:37,150
through a touch, but also pickup
what that emotion is. One,

198
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:39,580
another person is simply
touching their forearm.

199
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,300
And so what you find is people were given
a variety of emotions to convey, uh,

200
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,360
and also to try to perceive. So these
included negative emotions like anger,

201
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,650
fear, disgust, and sadness,
as well as more complex,

202
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:56,980
positive emotions like love,
gratitude and awe.

203
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,370
And what did we find
really quite fascinating?

204
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,990
So when they were asked to select which
emotion was being expressed by the touch,

205
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:09,720
and they had a variety, a
list of different emotions,
anger, fear, disgust, loves,

206
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:12,910
sympathy, gratitude, embarrassment,
pride and V, et Cetera.

207
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,690
When this person was asked to say
what was even being expressed,

208
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,200
they were able to profoundly and reliably
find touch to communicate distinct

209
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,344
emotions.

210
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,180
So touch communicates at least
six emotions including anger,

211
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,890
fear, disgust, love,
sympathy and gratitude.

212
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,030
And often some of the behavioral profiles
you see associated with these touches

213
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:39,400
are as follows.
So people would communicate,

214
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:43,060
touch on the forum by kind of doing
a trembling movement on the forearm,

215
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,120
or they would, um, communicate
love by simply say,

216
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:51,270
gently stroking the form of the other
person or gratitude by shaking their hand.

217
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,520
So we can convey emotions like gratitude
simply by touching someone's forearm,

218
00:13:56,981 --> 00:14:01,360
if you can believe that. Um, at the same
time it doesn't communicate all emotions.

219
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:05,260
So touching the forum alone
couldn't communicate more cognitive,

220
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:09,970
complex cell focused emotions
like embarrassment, envy,

221
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,953
or pride.

222
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:16,170
But my God like the fact that we can
communicate touch simply by contacting

223
00:14:16,661 --> 00:14:20,980
another person's arm without
seeing anything in their
face without your hearing,

224
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,900
any vocalizations is a profound,
uh,

225
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:28,230
example of the role of touch
in communicating, you know,

226
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,490
our everyday sentiments and feelings.

227
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:37,530
We've also found in our own work when
we've looked at touch and sort of clinical

228
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:42,520
or emotional disorders that not all
touches are alike. So, and work,

229
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,270
um, with some of my colleagues, Paul
Piff, Dacher Keltner and Amanda Purcell,

230
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,110
we wanted to understand whether people
who are characterized by heightened

231
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,570
positive emotionality.
So this is a clinical phenomena of mania,

232
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,640
whether they perceived touches using
the same paradigm in the same way or

233
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:01,910
whether people diagnosed are
prone to emotional difficulties,

234
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,190
actually perceived touches differently.

235
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,180
And what we found is that people who
have a history of mania or maybe prone to

236
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:09,380
experiencing mania,

237
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,880
I'm almost have these kind of rose colored
glasses in the way that they perceive

238
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,380
touches from another person.

239
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,560
So they are more likely to experience
emotions conveyed by the touches as

240
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:22,640
positive.
Um,

241
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,050
and they were less likely to experience
negative touches as negative.

242
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:31,430
So they felt more positive across all
touches and less negative across all

243
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:35,730
touches. And they were more
likely to attribute sort of um,

244
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,040
positive emotion even to negative
touches like anger or fear.

245
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,660
So although touch reliably communicates
emotions across most people,

246
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,990
we also want to think about the role of
individual differences of people with a

247
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:49,010
history of mania,

248
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,090
depression and anxiety for whom
communicating emotion via touch,

249
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,280
maybe slightly altered are different.

250
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,060
And this is something we'll return to
when we get to the module later in the

251
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:02,060
course where we talk about
emotion and psychopathology.

252
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,583
Okay.

253
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,340
And with that, I want to turn
now to our takeaway questions.

254
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,630
So from today I want you to think
about a few different things.

255
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,130
So first,

256
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,330
how can touch actually be a
source of pleasure or reward?

257
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:20,300
How can it feel good for us?
And likewise,

258
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,310
how can touch actually provide
soothing comfort in response to stress?

259
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:26,540
Okay.

260
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,370
Second, how might trust
increase or touch not trust?

261
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,880
How might touch actually
increased cooperation?

262
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,350
So provide an empirical example of
several that we spoke about in class.

263
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:40,550
Okay.

264
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,600
And then finally,

265
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,900
which specific emotions is touch most
effective in communicating to other

266
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:50,960
people? Simply by doing a
gentle touch on the forum.

267
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,110
What emotions can we signal
to other people around us?

268
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,420
And I want to conclude as usual
with our expert interview,

269
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,980
and this is part of the experts
in emotion interview series.

270
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,150
Okay.

271
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,320
So for this module of the course,
um,

272
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,680
are experts in emotion interview today
will be with Doctor Matthew Hurts and

273
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:17,270
sign. He received his phd from the
University of California Berkeley and he's

274
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:21,470
currently an associate professor of
psychology at Depauw University where he

275
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:23,870
directs the touch and emotion laboratory.

276
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,180
So his research is conducted with
students, um, in three areas,

277
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:34,210
including touch and the communication
of emotion as well as the prediction of

278
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:36,440
emotion and emotion and infants.

279
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,510
His work has received widespread
media coverage, including NPR,

280
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,840
the New York Times, ABC
News, BBC scientific,

281
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:47,090
American mind,
and psychology today.

282
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,180
So I now turn to our experts in emotion
interview with Doctor Matthew Hurtin

283
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:52,620
sign.
