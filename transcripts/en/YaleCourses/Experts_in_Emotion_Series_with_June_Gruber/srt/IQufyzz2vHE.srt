00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,310
Today for our experts
in emotion interview.

2
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:06,930
We'll be speaking with doctor
Steven pinker on violence
and emotion. Dr Pinker's,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,390
an experimental psychologist.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,060
I'm one of the world's foremost writers
on language mine and human nature.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,590
He's currently a Harvard College professor
and Johnstone family professor of

6
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:18,720
psychology as well at Harvard University.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,800
His research on visual cognition and the
psychology of language has won prizes

8
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:26,820
from the National Academy of Sciences,
the world institution of Great Britain,

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,510
the cognitive neuroscience society and
the American Psychological Association.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,600
Dr Pinker has also received
seven honorary doctorates,

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,680
several teaching awards at Mit and
Harvard and numerous prizes for his books.

12
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:40,470
The language instinct, how the
mind works, and the blank slate.

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,850
He's chair of the usage panel of the
American heritage dictionary and often

14
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:48,120
writes for the New York Times
time and the new republic.

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,900
He's been named humanist of
the year prospects magazines,

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,800
the world's top 100 public intellectuals,
foreign policies,

17
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:58,290
100 global thinkers and time magazines,

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,020
the 100 most influential
people in the world today.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,130
So I now turn to our experts and emotion
interview together with Dr Steven

20
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,550
Pinker. So thanks for speaking with us
today, Steve. It's great to have you here.

21
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,683
Okay,
good.

22
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,740
What I'd like to do is just start out by
asking you a little bit about what got

23
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,030
you interested in the topic
of violence and emotions,

24
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:19,540
sort of where did it begin for you?

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,970
Well,
I'm as a psychologist,

26
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:24,640
I'd be interested in human nature
and what makes people tick.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,750
And it's a hard problem to avoid
because one of the questions that people

28
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:30,850
naturally ask about human nature is,

29
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,720
are we naturally violent or are we
naturally peaceful and cooperative?

30
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,100
And I think the answer to the to
that question is both in neither,

31
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,151
but a,

32
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:43,330
it's not a question you could avoid if
you're interested in big questions about

33
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:44,470
what makes us what we are.

34
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,290
And speaking of that,

35
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,900
I'd love to ask you some questions
about just what makes us,

36
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,810
what we are by asking you a bit
about your work on this topic,

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,020
looking at violence.
So you've recently published a book,

38
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:57,000
the better angels of our nature.

39
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,840
And in this you powerfully demonstrate
a somewhat counterintuitive but

40
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:04,890
remarkable decline in violence
in human society over time.

41
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,250
And I wonder if you could just provide
us with a little bit more about this

42
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,270
really fascinating, but again,
somewhat surprising finding for many.

43
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,591
Yes.

44
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,730
It's one of the reasons it's surprising
is we get our sense of the world from

45
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:20,550
the news.
And the news is about stuff that happens.

46
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,050
It's not about stuff that doesn't happen.

47
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,470
And since rates of violence
haven't gone down to zero,

48
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,920
there are always enough violent
incidents to fill the evening news.

49
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,680
They're the three things that
blow up people who get shot.

50
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,320
And because of the availability heuristic,

51
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,270
namely that we estimate risk according
to how easily we can recall vivid

52
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:40,140
examples,

53
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,460
our sense of how dangerous the world
is is out of whack with the actual

54
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:48,640
statistics. So this is an argument
that depends a lot on statistics. Uh,

55
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,711
for example,

56
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:54,711
rates of a death in tribal warfare
among a hunter gatherer and hunter

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,320
horticulturalist societies who live,
uh,

58
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:01,030
without the rule of law firm,

59
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:05,590
the state control have rates of death and
warfare that are far higher than those,

60
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:07,230
even in our worst,
worse.

61
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,320
So that's something about the
transition from a kind of tribal living.

62
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:16,030
The characterized a lot of
our evolutionary history
to modern society brought

63
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:20,670
rates of violence down. Another decline
occurred since the Middle Ages, uh,

64
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,170
were,
uh,

65
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,310
homicide statistics suggest that a
contemporary European has about one 35th.

66
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:30,790
The chance of being murdered,
Gerd as his medieval ancestors.

67
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,270
A third change was in institutionalized
a barbaric violent practices like a

68
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:42,400
torture executions burning somewhat at the
stake or disemboweling them, uh, alive.

69
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,680
Uh, the use of capital punishment for
our trivial crimes like poaching and

70
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:52,410
counterfeiting and bad robbing a store I,

71
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:53,950
the institution of slavery,

72
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,040
the institution of debtor's prisons
throwing someone in jail because they

73
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,300
couldn't pay back a debt.

74
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,680
Those were all abolished in a span of
about 50 years to the second half of the

75
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:07,420
18th century. Then more recently
since the end of World War Two,

76
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,130
uh, big powerful countries have
stopped waging war against each other.

77
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,600
Germany and France, uh, we know aren't
going to go to war and Russia and Poland.

78
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,110
Uh,

79
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:22,110
and that's very unusual in human history
in which states and empires were almost

80
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:25,500
constantly at each other's throats.
Uh,

81
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,040
more subtly in the 20 years since
the fall of the Soviet Empire.

82
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,600
It hasn't just been big,

83
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:35,950
powerful developed countries that
have stopped waging war on each other,

84
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:41,190
but more and more the rest of the world
has stopped fighting civil wars and the,

85
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,150
and,
and rebel conflicts,

86
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,040
rates of death across the world and
all forms of war have seen a bumpy

87
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,580
trajectory, but a downward
trajectory. Then finally, the,

88
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:55,660
the various rights revolution, civil
rights, women's rights, gay rights,

89
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:56,560
children's rights,

90
00:04:56,561 --> 00:05:01,561
animal rights have all whittled
down various categories
of violence that used to

91
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:06,790
be with us for a, for Millennia.
Uh, domestic violence,

92
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,410
bullying, child abuse,
a lynching, pogroms,

93
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,550
um, uh, animals in blood
sports, gay bashing,

94
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:17,620
criminalization of homosexuality.

95
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,450
All of these are gifts of the various
rights revolutions of the last 50 or 60

96
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:23,690
years.
So those are the,

97
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,860
those are the empirical phenomena
that I sat out in the book.

98
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,630
So these are really interesting empirical
phenomena you're documenting and

99
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,770
people may wonder,
well,

100
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,400
why is violence declining and what role
could emotion play in this phenomena?

101
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,210
You know, are we becoming
a more prosocial, you know,
type of society experiencing?

102
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:45,180
And greater prevalence
or you know, uh, uh,

103
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:48,180
intensity of emotions like
empathy and compassion.

104
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,990
So does emotion play a role in this
decline in human violence? You think?

105
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,350
It absolutely does. Um, for one thing,

106
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,120
many categories of violence are,
are,

107
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,060
are emotional in the sense
that they are not just, uh, a,

108
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:07,310
a calculated predatory via
Ellen. Swear. We want something,

109
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,990
someone's in our way.
We get rid of them.

110
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,070
I mean that that is a big category of
violence and that you could consider just

111
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:17,780
purely cognitive or rational. But, um,
are there many other forms of violence?

112
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,790
Kind of what we think
of a senseless violence,

113
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:24,791
which is really driven by the passions
to men fight over a parking space and one

114
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:28,070
of them pulls out a knife and you've
got a body and a pool of blood.

115
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,920
A Nation feels that it is,

116
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:35,660
suffered a historic injustice and
conquers, uh, tries to conquer a few,

117
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,310
uh, rocky islands or more
patches of barren land, but
you can't grow anything on,

118
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:42,620
but it just a match
matter of national pride.

119
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,130
Or you have a sadism where a
serial killers or sometimes
entire societies bring

120
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:52,200
up the kids to wash a prisoner.
Uh,

121
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,100
Claude with iron hooks
are broken on the wheel.

122
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,360
None of these are particularly rational
in the sense of getting what you want.

123
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:02,660
So they were driven by emotions.
Then on the other side,

124
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:07,220
there are some kinds of violence
reduction that are purely cognitive.

125
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,860
We people figure out
violence is a bad thing.

126
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,010
Let's see if we could figure
out some way of reducing it.

127
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,080
But some of them are also emotional.

128
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,310
We feel greater empathy toward a larger,
uh,

129
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,560
category of living things.

130
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,770
So rather than just feeling bad about
our kids and cute little baby animals and

131
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:30,800
our best friends, uh, we
care more about strangers.

132
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,420
We find it less, um, fun
to see them. Disemboweled.

133
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,750
Uh, we find it painful in
fact to see them in pain.

134
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:44,420
A self control, I don't know whether you
want to call that an emotion or a, a a,

135
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,800
it certainly attracts with the emotions.
It,

136
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,360
it suppresses behavior that is
often triggered by the emotions.

137
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,050
And there a good argument that,
uh,

138
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,180
exercising our capacity for self control
is one of the ways that we reduce

139
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:01,600
violence. Somebody assaults
you, you may be mad as hell.

140
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,340
Well you may want to pull out a knife but
you count to 10 think the better of it

141
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,400
walk away and soft control
triumphs over emotion.

142
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,470
So it's really interesting and I mean
this begs the question of how we can

143
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:18,471
continue to foster these better angels
and sort of work towards promoting,

144
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:22,650
you know, ultimately the a
violence free society in many ways.

145
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,540
What recommendations would you have
to continue pushing this trend towards

146
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:31,020
decreasing violence and perhaps
greater empathy and compassion?

147
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,740
Uh, I think that a greater empathy and
compassion are, are good things up.

148
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:38,750
I don't think they are
enough, uh, because I,

149
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,780
I kind of doubt that you could really
get a person to empathize with all 7

150
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,730
billion people on earth. I mean,
no one has the emotional energy.

151
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,540
You get compassion fatigue and it
better not depend on, on that. Uh,

152
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,900
also there cases where empathy is
not such a good thing. Um, when,

153
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,740
when we talk about corruption
in the developing world,

154
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,850
what we're kind of talking
about is empathy in domains
where it shouldn't apply.

155
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,230
Like you give a job to your a knucklehead
brother-in-law because you feel bad

156
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:09,900
for him, uh, or your or your best friend.

157
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:12,840
You pay your best friend
out of a sense of gratitude.

158
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,610
We call that cronyism and nepotism.
It is driven by empathy as opposed to say,

159
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,090
giving a job to a perfect stranger.
How cold hearted is that?

160
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,470
But of course it is what you do
if you follow the rule of law,

161
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,580
which will ultimately make everyone
less violent than if it's one,

162
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:34,320
a clan of blood relatives fighting for
the perquisites of power against another,

163
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:37,530
each one empathizing plenty
within their own own clan.

164
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,150
So it's not to knock empathy, but it
isn't enough. You also need rule of law.

165
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:47,130
I think you need a, a, a government
that will penalize aggression,

166
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,590
that will not only make individuals, I
think the better of committing aggression,

167
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,540
but it calms them down because if they
know that their enemies are penalized by

168
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:01,350
the government, they don't have
to develop a belligerent, macho,

169
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,670
bad-ass stance to a
credibly assert deterrence.

170
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,310
So good institutions,
rule of law,

171
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,670
a democratic society
with a civil liberties,

172
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:15,840
but an effective police force
and bad judicial system. Uh,

173
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,870
certainly anything that expands empathy
such as cosmopolitan experiences,

174
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,760
you travel,
you read the words of others,

175
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,550
you're made aware of what life is like in,

176
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:30,000
at different times and places and
among people who are unlike yourself.

177
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,290
Also just the, the spread of, of reason,
knowledge of history, knowledge of, uh,

178
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,480
what kind of violence reduction
measures have worked in the past,

179
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,200
the setting aside of violence as a,

180
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,060
a problem to be solved rather than
as always a contest, uh, that,

181
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:48,960
that you have to win.

182
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,450
And finally taking advantage of our
sense of trade exchange fairness.

183
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,040
The idea that you can do
business with people, uh,

184
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,560
in an evolutionary psychologist
would call it reciprocal altruism.

185
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,290
When you trade favors with
people, you're bound to them. Uh,

186
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,650
they're more valuable
to you alive than dead.

187
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,370
You have ways of getting what you want
other than through via woods need me by

188
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,470
exchanging it for
something that they want.

189
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,570
So the cultivation of networks of
reciprocity I think has been another

190
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,050
historical development that
has reduced rates of violence.

191
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,990
So I think those are really all important
suggestions for thinking about how we

192
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:30,250
can continue to foster a society
where we see violence on the decline.

193
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,110
And so I wonder, although empathy may
not play, you know, the major role here,

194
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,240
when we think about what role can,

195
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:41,260
you know the study and understanding of
emotion play as we look forward into the

196
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:45,310
future, where do you see the
most important next steps here?

197
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:46,801
Well,

198
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:51,801
certainly expanding some of the things
that have worked in our society to other

199
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,920
that are, uh, have some catching up to do,

200
00:11:56,921 --> 00:12:01,510
particularly when it comes to the
rights of women and gay people and, uh,

201
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,640
children. Um, so the,

202
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:08,440
the idea that you don't throw pink gay
people in jail, let alone execute them.

203
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,970
Uh, we kind of, we kind of won that battle
that's not no longer alive issued here,

204
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:17,650
but it is a live issue in a
lot of it large part of the
world. The idea that, uh,

205
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:22,890
you don't try to settle scores
of national humiliation that uh,

206
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,450
our country, our, our race, our
religion has been humbled in the past.

207
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:31,020
We have to get our revenge.
And again,

208
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:36,130
getting people away from that tribal
group against group mindset toward a more

209
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:39,100
individual, a human
rights mindset. I mean,

210
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:41,320
we wouldn't really counts are men,

211
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:46,030
women and children and their happiness
groups are kind of abstraction to

212
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,000
concentrate. And this
relates back to your, your,

213
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,790
your emphasis on empathy
to think of the individual,

214
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,900
the actual thing that feels pleasure and
pain as opposed to the abstraction of

215
00:12:55,901 --> 00:13:00,901
the group is one of the big developments
that we've enjoyed in the west and that

216
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:05,680
the, um, uh, the rest of the world
could profit from a longterm.

217
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,380
So when we think then looking ahead
with some of the suggestions that you

218
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:13,610
offered and especially the students who
may be the next generation of conducting

219
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:16,520
these kinds of studies or
investigating these areas of inquiry,

220
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,510
what advice would you give to future
students who are thinking about embarking

221
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,410
on a study of emotion as it relates to
violence or just trying to understand

222
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:25,610
violence more generally?

223
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,760
Certainly to uh, appreciate, uh,

224
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,640
both the dark side and the
bright side of human nature.

225
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:36,650
I think a lot of psychology has tried to
paint a, a, uh, kind of Sunday school,

226
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:40,580
Pete Picture of human beings as
naturally peaceable and cooperative.

227
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,510
And while I, uh, I wrote a book
about how we do have that side,

228
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,200
we wouldn't need that side if we also
didn't have a lot of really nasty,

229
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:49,040
ugly motives.

230
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:53,780
And I don't think psychologists should
avert their gaze from the dark side of

231
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:55,220
human nature.
We can only,

232
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,120
we can only hope to control it if we
understand that the other is to take a,

233
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,360
an evidence based approach to violence.

234
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,110
It's often a topic of moralization.
We all deplore violence,

235
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,440
but how much do we understand about what
in fact actually increases or decreases

236
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:16,460
it? There I came across a lot of
cockamamie ideas that are why we held,

237
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:19,910
but for which there's no evidence and
some things that are not so obvious that

238
00:14:19,911 --> 00:14:22,340
turned out to be big
producers of violence.

239
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,690
So we should have an open minded
empirical evidence based mindset to

240
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:28,070
understanding violence.

241
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,370
Well, thank you so much for
joining us again today. Steve.

242
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,870
It's a pleasure to speak with you.

243
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,310
My pleasure.
Thanks for having me on June,

244
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,010
and this concludes our experts in emotion
interview with Doctor Steven Pinker

245
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,980
from Harvard University.
Thank you again.
