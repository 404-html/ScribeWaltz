1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,430
We'll be speaking with doctor Robert
Levenson from the University of California

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:06,264
Berkeley,

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,330
who is going to be speaking with us
about this question that's guided much of

4
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:12,960
our discussion today. Blood
tears, sweat and fears,

5
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:15,270
the autonomic nervous system and emotion.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,320
So doctor Levinson received his phd
from Vanderbilt University in clinical

7
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:22,860
psychology and he's currently a professor
in the Department of Psychology at the

8
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:24,390
university,
California Berkeley,

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,410
where he's a member of both the
behavioral neuroscience, clinical science,

10
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:30,900
developmental and social
personality programs.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,430
He currently serves as the director of
the institute or personality and Social

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,190
Research as well as the director
of the clinical science program.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,930
So Dr Levinson's research program is in
the area of human emotion studying the

14
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:46,800
Organisation of physiological,
behavioral, and subjective systems.

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,030
The way that these systems are impacted
by neuropathology normal aging and

16
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:55,260
culture and the role that emotions play
in the maintenance and disruption of

17
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:56,520
committed relationships.

18
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,320
Dr Levinson's research has been
supported by grants from the NIH and Nia,

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,940
and he is the past
president of the Society for
psychophysiological research and

20
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:09,060
the past president of the association
for Psychological Science.

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,310
So I now turn to a very special experts
in emotion interview with Doctor Robert

22
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,800
Levenson from the University of
California Berkeley. Welcome Bob.

23
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:20,240
Thanks for speaking with us today.

24
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:22,860
Okay.

25
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,693
Yeah.

26
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,020
So what I wanted to start out asking
you a bit about is really what got you

27
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:32,400
first interested in the study of emotion,
kind of where did it all begin for you?

28
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,280
Well,
actually this is one of these questions.

29
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:40,690
Where are you normally have an answer,
but I remember the exact moment.

30
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,673
Uh hmm.

31
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,610
I just started my first faculty
position at Indiana University and um,

32
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,770
I had been in the field at that time
was dominated by a Dick Lazarus,

33
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:57,400
Richard Lazarus.
His work on sort of stress and coping.

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,510
It really wasn't a feel of
emotion. It was, it was a really,

35
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,620
it was going to be another six or seven
years before it started to explode.

36
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,400
And um, in this, in the
models of stress and coping,

37
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,540
um,

38
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,830
you got the idea that there was a sort
of a stress response and everybody did

39
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:22,660
the same thing. If you, if you, uh,
provoke them in your laboratory,

40
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:25,420
everybody would pretty much
have the same reaction.

41
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,500
And people before Lazarus,

42
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,510
like Han Celia had described
the physiology of that
response quite elegantly.

43
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,323
Um,

44
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,670
one of the things that we're starting
to come into the field was greater

45
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:43,000
reliance on video recording and um,

46
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,080
we had just run a classic
stress study where we had, uh,

47
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,270
threaten people with electric
shock and we had had them gifts,

48
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,320
a self revealing speeches about
their weaknesses and you securities

49
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,613
studies.
Yeah.

50
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,190
When I looked at these video tapes to
see the started fixed action patterns

51
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:09,210
where everybody was doing the same thing
and it was just the opposite though,

52
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,810
it's just this incredible variety
of response. It was complex.

53
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:18,700
If I'm folding it over time,
it changed over time for different people.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,630
And some of it was quite counterintuitive.
This is gonna seem really dumb,

55
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:27,631
but the fact that people were laughing
when they were threatened with it,

56
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,570
it was real electric shock.
We actually shot them in those days.

57
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,090
You were allowed to do
that. Um, and, and you know,

58
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,640
it wasn't this sort of like general
negative stress response. It was,

59
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,230
it was this a rainbow of different,

60
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,380
different things that I realized that
this was very important and I have no idea

61
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:51,970
how to start again. I have no idea how
to measure it or quantify it. And, um,

62
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:57,090
and the behavior we only
deaf tied anything that I
could probably get at with a

63
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,160
self report measure or the physiological
measures that I was a news.

64
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,870
Right. So I, uh, I got interested
in that and, um, as a result,

65
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,040
I want to tell you the whole story,
but about three or four years later,

66
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,540
I was able to go,

67
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:18,460
come out to San Francisco to spend a
year working with these two crazy guys,

68
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:23,461
Paul Ekman and Wallace reason started
spent a decade focusing on how you measure

69
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:28,300
this very thing, you know, and, and, uh,

70
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,330
they were developing a coating system
or characterizing the full variety of

71
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:38,290
human emotional response. And so that's
how I got interested in. It's just,

72
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,200
it's just, it was compelling in, in the,

73
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,540
in what I was seeing that um,

74
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,900
something was going on here that was
much more differentiated than I expected.

75
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,630
Thank you for that.
I mean it's,

76
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,430
it's a really compelling story just by
observing a phenomena you saw something

77
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,450
that you didn't understand and that's
really what propelled all the research

78
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,710
that you're doing now.

79
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:06,760
And I mean really as a forefront
in this field of emotion as well as

80
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:10,580
psychophysiology. I mean, you do work
that inspires so many generations, um,

81
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,260
like myself and others to try to
continue to grapple with these,

82
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:17,800
these questions and phenomena that
we observe but we don't understand.

83
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,860
Well, I think that's the best
way to do research. I mean,

84
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:24,880
I know that's your last question
and we'll come back to it. Right?

85
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:30,290
You can over arching
research that's grounded in
fundamental curiosity about the

86
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:35,710
things that amaze and baffle you
is the research that, you know,

87
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,760
he's going to keep your interest
for a long period of time.

88
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,050
And I figure if you're lucky, you get, if
you, if you hit on good questions, it'll,

89
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,740
it will attract other people
through those issues. Um,

90
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,590
but curiosity is sort of at the core
of my sort of approach to research.

91
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,430
So I mean, when thinking about
curiosity, the realm of psychophysiology,

92
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:02,960
I mean you have really sort of taken
a lead in specializing in these really

93
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:07,610
complex, you know, psychophysiological
tools to study emotion. And I mean,

94
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:08,510
in your opinion,

95
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:13,511
sort of what do you see as some of
the most effective tools for trying to

96
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,440
understand and measure this really
complex? You know, rain boys, you call it,

97
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:19,970
of emotional responding?

98
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,423
Well,
I'm going to,

99
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,590
I'm going to give you an answer that's
probably a little strange change and that

100
00:06:26,591 --> 00:06:28,240
is that I think the best,

101
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,560
the best psychophysiological
tools are good, are good,

102
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:37,120
inappropriate research
questions. Uh, that is, um,

103
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,390
what I was first getting
involved in psychophysiology. Um,

104
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,300
one of the,

105
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,090
the dominant voices in the field was a
fellow named Paul Brest who was working

106
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:54,580
in the Department of Psychiatry at
the University of North Carolina.

107
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,410
Could have been Duke. No,
that's an important distinction.

108
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,350
That range. Yeah. But he was
always you MC. That's where I was.

109
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,320
And he was a curmudgeon,
the guy and a

110
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,610
fighter and he um,

111
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,900
he also championed young people
who are working in the field.

112
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,200
And his mantra was we need to know more
biology to understand the biology of

113
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:31,110
these measures and had a huge
influence on me. And, and to this day,

114
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,280
um,

115
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,280
I almost tried to think
the art of psychophysiology
is to ask a question that,

116
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,620
that for which these
measures are appropriate. Um,

117
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,090
I can't tell you how many people write
notes when they're applying to graduate

118
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:52,380
school and say, I run, I want to
use these measures in athletics.

119
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:58,790
It's like measure first and then
if I get a chance to talk to him,

120
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:03,960
I only saw the same unless the question
and a lot of questions in psychology are

121
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:06,870
not appropriate for these
kinds of methods and measures.

122
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,790
So that's the first thing.
Good.

123
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:13,140
Psychophysiology is based on good
questions and a good understanding.

124
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,670
These are not psychological measures.
Dick biological measures,

125
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,740
they aren't measuring personality
and the aren't measuring emotion.

126
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,170
You're measuring metabolic processes.

127
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,670
And adjustment of the
homeostasis in the body and,

128
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,390
and how we mashed them into
the psychological question.

129
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,610
That's part of good psychophysiological
research. And I think it's really,

130
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:40,620
really difficult and it's,

131
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,890
and it's easy to have a
mismatch where the measure,

132
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,920
no matter how sophisticated,
you know,

133
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,950
how down to the millisecond the
accuracy and the no fault is, it's,

134
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,810
it can be the wrong measure for,

135
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:59,560
for psychological question and then you
just get nothing. So, so that's, you know,

136
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,860
that's, that's the prelude. Um, I
know that's not exactly what you were,

137
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,490
you were getting at, but, but then I think
the getting to the measures themselves,

138
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,820
I think the challenge has always been,
you know,

139
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,380
how can we get from the behavior of,
of these target organs, you know,

140
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:17,214
the heart,

141
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:23,090
lungs and whatnot to the underlying
action of the nervous system because we

142
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:28,050
really want to understand it in terms
of sympathetic and parasympathetic.

143
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:32,820
And within these, you know, Beta
and Alpha adrenergic subsystems,

144
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,690
we really want to get a sense of what
part of the nervous system is active. And,

145
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,060
and that has been an area where there's
been enormous progress over the last 20,

146
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:42,900
30 years.

147
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,340
It used to be that we could
measure what Oregon's we're doing,

148
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,760
but we couldn't really infer what the,

149
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,950
what the activating mechanisms were.
And that's been a real powerful tool.

150
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,160
And you only turns out that
w that changes in heart rate,

151
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,720
let's say that there that are instigated
by parasympathetic action, um,

152
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,310
now founded very different psychological
constructs and ones that are instigated

153
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,570
by a sympathetic action.

154
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,990
And so it would be able to get that kind
of underlying mechanism to be reveal,

155
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,510
you know,
in our psychophysiological measures.

156
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,930
I think that's been a
huge advance in terms of

157
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,130
getting to the real core of
phenomena like emotion, you know, or,

158
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,293
or you know,

159
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:37,150
attachment or these big psychological
constructs where the physiology,

160
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:39,060
you can actually tell us
some very interesting thing.

161
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,650
So when you think about really trying
to probe under my underlying mechanisms

162
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:48,420
further, where do you see some of the
next most critical steps in the field of

163
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:51,270
psychophysiology moving
towards to be able to do this,

164
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:54,780
to get at some of these really profound
processes you were hinting like emotion

165
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:58,290
attachment and then like,
well

166
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,400
I hope this isn't self serving.
Uh,

167
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,010
but it's really worth thinking
about in the last couple of years.

168
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,293
I mean I've been,

169
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:11,380
I mean we're only interested in the
sort of the numeric side of physiology.

170
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,220
Um, you know, my own work
going back for a long time,

171
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,690
I constantly gotten attracted to
the ways that sort of physiology is,

172
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:28,330
um, is it provides a
measure of contagion. Um,

173
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,680
and it provides a way of characterizing.

174
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,260
We have shortly connection between people
who are interacting and an emotion.

175
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,070
You know,

176
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,710
it provides a way of
looking at a coherence,

177
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,790
coherence between different
aspects of your emotional response.

178
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,520
So to answer your question,

179
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,970
I think the era of the
mean is probably over

180
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,770
Aaron. I see that we're going to
have to go back to the, we are oh,

181
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,490
your physiology, which either
it is a time series, it's, it's,

182
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:11,610
it's something that unfolds over
time and has [inaudible] and uh,

183
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,250
it does have changes in levels if
that's just part of that pattern.

184
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:23,290
And I think the challenges is going
to be finding ways to characterize

185
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,060
physiology over time,

186
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,560
how it relates to other unfolding
phenomena in the individual,

187
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,690
like their subjective experience and their
emotional behavior and how it sort of

188
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,040
operates when two people
are in and the interaction.

189
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,930
And so how you are physiology
and my physiology and the,

190
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,480
and the kind of temporal
relationships between them.

191
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:51,190
He was close to the kind of psychological
connection that we're engaged in.

192
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,480
So I think that's the next frontier
and it's ending, you know, it's,

193
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,970
it's really um, challenging. Um,

194
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:02,080
I mean going back to the last few months
and we reading all this stuff I read

195
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:06,000
when I was in graduate school about
things like time series analysis for

196
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,470
analyses and water retention and whatnot.

197
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:10,900
Him and try and sort of come up with that,

198
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,350
a fresh approach for characterizing
some of these temporal relationships.

199
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,400
So it's what's on my mind these days.

200
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,540
Yeah, I mean, so I'm
thinking about, you know,

201
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:24,230
some of the original groundbreaking
work you did here where you identified,

202
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,681
you know,

203
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:29,030
distinct patterns of autonomic nervous
system activity with particular emotion

204
00:13:29,031 --> 00:13:29,864
states.

205
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,200
And on the one hand I wanted to ask
you sort of what do you see as the most

206
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:35,270
interesting discoveries
in that original work?

207
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,920
But what you're saying now makes me think
too sort of how can we move that field

208
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:43,430
forward of emotion specificity if
we're looking at these more dynamic

209
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:45,650
fluctuations and physiology over time.

210
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,140
That's what I'm thinking about.

211
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,200
I mean I I remember very clearly are used
to have a slide one slide and why I'm

212
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,690
jumping in one talk based on one emotional
elicitation in wanting individual,

213
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,350
it's actually two different emotions and
it was just looking at what happened to

214
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:03,110
heart rate,

215
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:08,110
second distraction when that person was
experiencing profound discussed versus

216
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:12,340
profound anger. And you know,
the differences were not,

217
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,600
oh you could see where the mean
differences came from. You know,

218
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,570
the fact that at the end of the day,
most of the time when you're angry,

219
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:23,920
your heart, it's going to accelerate
much more than when you're disgusted,

220
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,290
when you're disgusting, often decelerates
so you could see how you got there.

221
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,390
But the kind of the temporal path to
that was, was so different for these two,

222
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,150
for these two emotions and
in this one individual.

223
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,930
And you know how to characterize that
and doing it in a way that's meaningful

224
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:45,790
and not just descriptive, it's
in, can be scaled up to studies.

225
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,120
I think it,

226
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,290
I think that that is one of the really
important new frontiers in the study of

227
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:53,780
specificity.

228
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,350
And I think the same thing is probably
true if you're looking at the brain,

229
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,470
you know,

230
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,390
we really want to look at not only where
it ends up in terms of what the active

231
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,880
areas are,
but also how it got there.

232
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,470
And I think the brain people with
functional imaging to Barton much more

233
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,690
inclined to,
to work in that way.

234
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,900
Well, I mean, speaking of the brain,

235
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:17,650
I mean you've really uncovered some
additional fascinating insights about how

236
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:22,651
neurodegenerative diseases
like frontotemporal dementia
FTD profoundly impact,

237
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:26,110
you know, a whole host of different
emotional related processes.

238
00:15:26,111 --> 00:15:30,220
Right from you've looked at perception
reactivity as well as regulation,

239
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,720
both spontaneous and queued.

240
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,370
And I wonder as you're thinking about
psychophysiology in this realm, you know,

241
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:39,040
at the realm of sort of neural
systems in neurodegenerative diseases,

242
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:42,880
sort of what were some
discoveries you came up, you know,

243
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:46,780
in doing this research where
they surprising to you. Um, what,

244
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:49,450
what sort of struck you in
working with this population?

245
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,870
Well, you know, we started
with the observation that,

246
00:15:59,570 --> 00:15:59,871
you know,

247
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:04,871
here was a well characterized
neurological condition that was producing

248
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,920
something that looked very much like
psychiatric symptoms are not a real

249
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:17,690
clinical psychologist,
but I sort play one and my profession.

250
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,423
Yes you are.

251
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,700
I think one of the great gifts of graduate
training for me was being trained as

252
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:28,840
a clinical psychologist,

253
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,020
but how a pretty good sense of why your
clinical conditions and symptoms look

254
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:34,904
like.

255
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And I was really struck with
these patients who didn't
have icebox Perry's and

256
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,270
you know, little birth away
and didn't have, you know,

257
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,230
a psychogenic kind of
factors in your life.

258
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,700
The thing we're producing,

259
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:56,480
these kinds of symptoms that they'd look
very much like psychiatric conditions.

260
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,600
Um, and so as is typical of my work, um,

261
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:06,480
I was just struck by that and
became very curious as to, you know,

262
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,660
how it was that, um, damage
to these neural circuits.

263
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:11,811
I mean,

264
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:14,660
now we understand that
it's not [inaudible] it's
[inaudible] markets that are

265
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:16,190
really producing these changes.

266
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:21,260
Could we produce things that mimic
these kinds of clinical phenomenon? Um,

267
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,250
and it seemed to me that it could
tell us a lot about emotion.

268
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,640
It could also tell us a
lot about emotion based.

269
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,840
And so th that back to me was the kind
of a striking, there's surprising,

270
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,090
it was just how powerfully,
uh,

271
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,610
these teasers produced these symptoms.
When I was in graduate school,

272
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:48,910
the chapter on brain damage was
always just about cognitive,

273
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,290
with the exception maybe of Phineas gage.

274
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,720
And that was such a terrible case
study. You know, who knew what happened.

275
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,860
But as a result,
I was skipped it when I taught like uh,

276
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,150
clinical psychology cause didn't have
anything to do with this emotion.

277
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,860
The West surprise me is that
there's this whole set of, of uh,

278
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,260
of January of neurodegenerative diseases
that actually are like a silver bullet

279
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,180
into the heart of our
emotional functioning.

280
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,050
We only under described under appreciate,

281
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,480
I'm getting better now this,
the misdiagnosis just like that,

282
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,470
you know, he just, we call it dementia,
which which suggest, you know,

283
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:34,740
problems in mentation and never memory,
but you know,

284
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,280
here's this other set of disorders.
They're really quite different.

285
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,730
And then of course the reason for
that is that they hit very bad effect,

286
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,700
very different kinds of
circuits in the brain.

287
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:50,180
So the exciting thing for me was here was
an opportunity to really study emotion

288
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:54,970
in the brain without the
constraints of the scanner. We,

289
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,760
we didn't have this like only study those
emotional things that could occur too.

290
00:18:59,580 --> 00:18:59,971
We could do,

291
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:04,320
we get to study all the things that
happened in real life and linked them back

292
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,920
ultimately cause fairly well
characterized changes in the brain.

293
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,100
I just thought this was a great,
this was a great new playground.

294
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,690
What have you found,
you know,

295
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,040
in this research you've done with
this group of FTD patients and other

296
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,330
neurodegenerative diseases,

297
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,110
sort of what has it told you about the
role of the brain and sort of normative

298
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:24,400
emotion processing?

299
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,180
Yeah. Well, you know,
it's not a finished story.

300
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,360
I mean, you know, I, yeah,
it's kind of like a second,

301
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,710
like a second wind and in a career or
something, you know, it's like we started,

302
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,370
we started doing this work
about a decade ago and good,

303
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,980
good questions take decades to talk,
to lead to good answers.

304
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,510
And I sort of feel like
we're still mid stream. Um,

305
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,380
the thing that I'm really found myself
thinking about a lot and the people in my

306
00:19:56,381 --> 00:20:01,381
lab also gravitating to and the people
we collaborate with and it's really

307
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:02,464
ironic,

308
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,500
is the role of sort of the subjective
emotional experience and particularly the

309
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:13,561
contribution of visual perception
and visceral sensations to,

310
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:16,330
to our emotional lives.
Um,

311
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,590
we've trained and because this disease
targets predict circuitry are critical

312
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,540
for the processing of this visceral
information. We think that the, uh,

313
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,550
kind of the interior emotional life,
if these patients

314
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,300
ooze kind of the visceral quality,
you know,

315
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,030
the butterflies in the stomach and,

316
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,380
and probably some of the cinematic
qualities like tensions and whatnot.

317
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:48,620
This sensors have the sensor coolness
and warm tingling on the skin that all of

318
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:51,870
these things that are really,
you know,

319
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,940
I think we're coming to
understand critical parts of
how emotion influences our

320
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:59,060
behavior,
um,

321
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,520
are probably being diminished
and muted by this disease.

322
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,290
And then when you see people don't
have this part of their emotions,

323
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,220
you begin to realize just how they are.
Um,

324
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,580
and it certainly has made my,

325
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,880
my normal emotion research much
more focused these days on this.

326
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,170
Your perception,
uh,

327
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,680
trying to find ways of characterizing
that and measuring it didn't have

328
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,340
historically a very difficult
problem with field. Uh,

329
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,320
how do you characterize the,

330
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,660
the extent of a visceral awareness and
how do you monitor it moment to moment?

331
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,600
Nope.

332
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,760
Yeah. So I mean this
is fascinating. I mean,

333
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,060
just thinking about where you first
began in this field, you know,

334
00:21:47,061 --> 00:21:52,040
observing a phenomena that was mysterious
and exciting to being, you know,

335
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,730
forefront at the figure of the
field of emotion and as well as in

336
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,820
psychophysiological processes that,

337
00:21:57,821 --> 00:22:01,940
that help us understand emotional related
phenomena and sort of having seen the

338
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:06,320
field of emotion evolve over time.
I guess sort of taking a step back,

339
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,060
where do you see now the face of
the future and emotion headed?

340
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,780
What lies ahead?

341
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,900
Well, clearly the headlights
ahead. I mean, you know, uh,

342
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,550
emotion started as being started, the
province and the autonomic nervous system,

343
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,590
uh, you know, the older
models where that, uh,

344
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,510
linked cognition and emotion were all
top down and show, you know, in the,

345
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,400
in the early views,
emotions were sort of these irritating,

346
00:22:38,401 --> 00:22:42,840
nasty little things that had to be
brought under the control of rational

347
00:22:42,841 --> 00:22:45,390
processes. And now, you know,

348
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:47,850
I think that there's any question that

349
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,470
in turned upside down,

350
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,820
but now almost all of psychology
seems to be a balance.

351
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:59,510
The influence of emotion on other things,

352
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,370
including a whole range
of cognitive processing.

353
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,450
Probably most famously how emotions
influence our decisions. Um,

354
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,280
and, and sometimes you know, cause us to,

355
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:15,580
to decide things or don't appear to be
rational by sort of western standards.

356
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,040
But really our rational in terms of
ar I sort of reptilian standard that's

357
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,650
embodied cognition is another area
where this is really okay. So I,

358
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,030
so I think that one,

359
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:34,060
one clear future direction is the way
is this is the bottom up directions,

360
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,270
the way emotions,

361
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:40,530
what do we shape our thinking are our
memories that we should stop that we've

362
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:45,080
played with in the past.
But I think there's a lot of
good work that's necessary.

363
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:51,860
Um, the secondary is clearly
emotions and close relationships.

364
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,453
Hmm.

365
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,210
I think attachment theory is one of these,
it's like as a Jamie,

366
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,920
the James Lang theory of emotion
on Bowlby's attachment theory is,

367
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:04,250
is it great idea

368
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:11,110
that really needs to be looked at with
modern two goals and they think the way

369
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:16,140
emotions function in making these
lasting emotional some days.

370
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Last thing sort of interpersonal
bonds is really another critical area.

371
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,750
And then I think about the other one that
is kind of uh, interscape and is that

372
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,700
he grew up in an era where I think you
could say this is probably something

373
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,690
people would argue with.

374
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,790
I think you could make the case that
progress in to treat treatment of mental

375
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:44,740
illness and the understanding of it,
it's really hit a wall and that,

376
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,160
um,

377
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:50,160
both in psychiatry and in psychology is
really almost nothing significant in the

378
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,140
last decade or so.

379
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:00,760
It's made a huge difference in either
understanding or ability to treat.

380
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,870
We're recycling old ideas or there
are a few exceptions for that. You,

381
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,180
we don't know what will come with them.

382
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:11,800
Like deep brain stimulation
and things like that. Yeah,

383
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:16,110
very different approach. Maybe
something would come that. Uh,

384
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,210
so I think,
you know,

385
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:24,390
this is going to be a huge area
of growth in the coming decade.

386
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:25,840
You know,

387
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,840
really taking a fresh look at
emotion is notion dysfunction.

388
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:36,730
Um, in and to tobacco happened, a
number of things have to happen.

389
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,380
You're probably not going to have no
line is we have to do away with the DSM.

390
00:25:41,381 --> 00:25:46,381
You have to go back to much more molecular
way of looking at the symptoms might

391
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:47,914
be,
are

392
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:55,210
we only clear out all of the,
um, the interference life from,

393
00:25:55,211 --> 00:26:00,211
from the accreditation that chiefs of
progressive programs from we only training

394
00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:05,140
their students and the way they think
they should be trained and we have to

395
00:26:05,141 --> 00:26:08,230
learn how to talk to
now like psychiatrist,

396
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:12,010
but we have to with him talk to behavioral
neurologist and have a different kind

397
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:14,540
of understanding about the brain and,

398
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,470
and then sort of refocus on these issues.

399
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:22,990
I think that could be the most exciting
for the next generation. And I think,

400
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,650
you know, if we could get to
that point and just throwaways,

401
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,390
today's really the baggage or some
of the old systems and old ideas.

402
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,450
I think this could be the era of making,
you know,

403
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,950
we don't progress and understanding
and treating a mental illness.

404
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,530
So then we, we're thinking about
this next generation, right?

405
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:45,210
A big part of who is going to be at the,
our students right now.

406
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,760
So when the students come to you,
Bob,

407
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:50,620
and ask you for advice of
what they should do, um,

408
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,810
if you know wanting to embark in this
field of emotion, what do you tell them?

409
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,523
Okay,

410
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,003
wow.

411
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:06,430
Probably five things that you really
want to know a lot about our thing.

412
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:11,670
I think, why do you want to know if you're
gonna Spell your motion? You better.

413
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,190
You better learn how to observe behavior.

414
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,340
MMM hmm.

415
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:22,390
My opinion. Somebody disagree. You know,

416
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,970
most of the really exciting progress
in emotion has been made. Um,

417
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:32,570
at least kind of contact where people
directly observed emotional responding and

418
00:27:32,571 --> 00:27:35,960
they had ways of quantifying it.
And you know, you can really,

419
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,150
you can really parse emotion research
into those who look at behavior and those

420
00:27:41,151 --> 00:27:41,984
who don't.

421
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:46,920
So I think he needed need to
understand the behavior too.

422
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,000
You need to have a really
strong foundation in biology.

423
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,100
You don't understand the physiological
systems and increasingly these days that

424
00:27:55,101 --> 00:27:59,240
includes a genetic systems
in different systems as well.

425
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,460
Um,
and then I think,

426
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,060
I think you need to understand
what emotion looks like when it's,

427
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,390
when it's operating within normal bounds.

428
00:28:08,391 --> 00:28:13,300
And also when it's operating within these
sort of dysfunctional, abnormal values,

429
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:17,330
and we've all emotion researchers
need to have some exposure to emotion

430
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,630
pathology, whether it's a neural, uh,

431
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:27,010
but whether it's shut off by some sort
of neurodegenerative process or some sort

432
00:28:27,011 --> 00:28:28,390
of psychological process,

433
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,860
which you really have to understand like
what emotion looks like when it's not

434
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,840
there blunted or when it's
when it's hyperactive.

435
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,940
And you need to see that
and understand that.

436
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,120
And so I think those are the
kinds of things, you know, that,

437
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,910
that good emotion researchers are going
to have to, to know. And, you know,

438
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:52,090
we don't train students that way, we,
so we sort of train them in silos.

439
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:57,420
So clinical students do this
and neuroscience students
do that and aspect of

440
00:28:57,761 --> 00:28:59,950
science students, you
know, do something else.

441
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:06,060
But I think that good emotion research
is going to really require this behavior
