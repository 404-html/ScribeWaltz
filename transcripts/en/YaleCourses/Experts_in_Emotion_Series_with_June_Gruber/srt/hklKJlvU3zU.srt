1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,840
We'll be speaking with Dr and [inaudible]
professor of psychology at the

2
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:08,220
University of California Berkeley and a
member of the Institute for Personality

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,140
and Social Research on
schizophrenia and emotion.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,300
Dr. King received a BS in psychology from
Ball State University and her MBA and

5
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:19,470
phd in clinical psychology from the State
University of New York at Stony Brook.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,480
Dr [inaudible] research focuses on emotion
and psych pathology with a specific

7
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:26,850
interest in the emotional
features of schizophrenia,

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,930
assessing negative symptoms
of schizophrenia and the
linkage between cognition

9
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,420
and emotion and schizophrenia.
In addition,

10
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:37,410
she also studies emotion healthy
individuals with a focus on individual

11
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:39,360
differences and expressive behavior,

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,350
gender differences in emotion and
linkages between cognition, personality,

13
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:45,000
social context and emotion.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,860
Dr. Craig has received numerous awards
including a young investigator award from

15
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:52,860

the Distinguished Teaching Award from

17
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:57,720
UC Berkeley.

18
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,530
She's currently president elect for the
Society for research and psychopathology

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,880
and has served as an associate editor
for the Journal of abnormal psychology as

20
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:08,910
well as cognition and emotion and a
member of the editorial boards for

21
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:10,080
Schizophrenia Bulletin.

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,770
Psychological Science and the public
interest and applied and preventative

23
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:17,160
psychology, emotion and Journal
of research in personality.

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,690
She's also the author or editor of three
books and several scholarly papers in

25
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:22,830
top journals in the field.

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,640
So I now turn to our special experts in
emotion interview with doctor and crane

27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,570
on schizophrenia and emotion.
Com.

28
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:35,900
And thanks for speaking with us today.
Thanks for having me.

29
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,530
So I wanted to ask you as a place to
start sort of what your journey into the

30
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:46,820
world of emotion was. So what first got
you interested in the topic of emotion?

31
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:48,671
Well,

32
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:53,440
when I was a graduate student I was
looking around for some sort of research,

33
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,810
uh, to land on and uh, it
wasn't schizophrenia, but, uh,

34
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,870
I had an advisor that was interested in
schizophrenia and interested in some of

35
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:06,170
the symptoms of schizophrenia, which to
me sounded an awful lot like a problem,

36
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:08,140
that emotion. So that led me, um,

37
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,260
as a graduate student 20 years ago to
really start reading about basic emotion

38
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:14,081
research.

39
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:19,081
And that's when I first got the idea to
translate some of the research and basic

40
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:21,410
emotion to the study of schizophrenia.
Yeah.

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,240
So speaking of that,

42
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:26,150
I'd love to now ask you some questions
about your research on emotions,

43
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,350
schizophrenia. And so, I mean,

44
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,210
you've really pioneered this field and
really advanced almost everything we know

45
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:34,310
about the realm of
emotion and schizophrenia.

46
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,910
And one of the things that has been
most interesting and sort of most

47
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:40,320
illuminating was really,
um,

48
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,270
understanding the way in which
emotion experience on the one hand,

49
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,680
maybe intact and schizophrenia,
whereas other domains, you know,

50
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,780
like expressive behavior
may be less intact.

51
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:54,650
So you've described this
as the disjunction between
different components of

52
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:55,700
emotional responding.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,950
And I was wondering if you could say a
little bit more about how research has

54
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:04,420
illuminated this potential disconnect
between internal emotion experience on the

55
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:07,540
one hand and external emotion
behavior on the other,

56
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,950
among individuals with schizophrenia.
Well,

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,521
again,

58
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:15,730
it started as a graduate to really
where I was reading all this fascinating

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,260
research in basic emotion in healthy
people. And so I thought, well,

60
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:22,440
why not use those same methods,
uh,

61
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,350
to understand what's happening in
schizophrenia. Prior to doing that,

62
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:30,560
I think people in the field of
schizophrenia thought that, um,

63
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,880
people without people with schizophrenia
just had no emotion at all.

64
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,980
They were just completely without emotion.

65
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,430
And so what we did was we actually
imported some laboratory paradigms to the

66
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:46,480
study of schizophrenia and we took a
close look at their outward expression,

67
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:50,380
their experience, their physiology.
And what we found was quite surprising.

68
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:53,830
I think too many people who had
studied schizophrenia for years,

69
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:55,810
and that will cause that just as you said,

70
00:03:55,811 --> 00:04:00,040
that people with schizophrenia reported
feeling things very, very strongly,

71
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,670
just as strongly as healthy
people did. They, uh, they, uh,

72
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,760
felt very happy and amused.
Um,

73
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,710
they felt very disgusted
and scared and sad.

74
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,180
But what distinguished people with
schizophrenia from people without

75
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:16,420
schizophrenia was almost a complete
lack of outward expression.

76
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:20,000
So we would show people
I'm using film clips or uh,

77
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:25,110
put a plate of tasty food in front of
them or a show them some very disturbing

78
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:29,650
pictures or ask them to tell
sad stories about their lives.

79
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:31,090
And no matter what we would do,

80
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:34,540
people with schizophrenia would
say they felt things very strongly.

81
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:38,350
They felt very amused. They felt
very pleasant. They felt very sad,

82
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,500
but yet they would not show that
on their face. They didn't cry,

83
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,150
they didn't show a lot of smiles. Um,
so this is the disconnect it with that.

84
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:49,210
We observed that people with
schizophrenia field things strongly,

85
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:50,650
they just don't show it outwardly.

86
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:54,340
And so they kind of simple
a take home message from,

87
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,850
from this line of work is that you, you
don't want to judge a book by its cover.

88
00:04:57,851 --> 00:05:01,840
Just because someone would get to phrenia
it doesn't show an outward expression

89
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,501
of emotion.

90
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:06,400
Doesn't mean that they don't feel it
because chances are they feel things very

91
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:07,234
strong.

92
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,750
And so how did this work at the time fit
with previous conceptualizations of the

93
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:14,150
emotional lives of individuals
with schizophrenia?

94
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,100
Well as I said that, uh, before
that I think that the typical, uh,

95
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,180
view of people with schizophrenia was
that their lives were emotional vacuums.

96
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:25,430
They just had no feelings.
They,

97
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,320
they didn't show any feelings
that a what a bleak existence.

98
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:34,040
So I'm so I think people mistakenly
assumed that because people with

99
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,840
schizophrenia and weren't
expressing emotion,

100
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:37,380
they weren't laughing at funny joke.

101
00:05:37,381 --> 00:05:42,110
So they weren't looking scared or when a
car came barreling down the street that

102
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:46,860
they just had no emotion experience.
But that was absolutely not the case.

103
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,780
They just weren't showing it outwardly,
but they were feeling it very strongly.

104
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,510
Okay.

105
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,380
So you've also demonstrated another really
interesting feature of the emotional

106
00:05:55,381 --> 00:05:57,030
experience in lives of people with,

107
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,550
which is that they show these really
unique patterns of emotional related

108
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:06,320
difficulties that depend on sort of the
timing or temporal frame of the emotion

109
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,100
itself.

110
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,640
And I wondered if you could say a bit
more about your work that's really teased

111
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:15,020
apart this distinction
between the anticipation of
emotion versus the more kind

112
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:19,580
of online consumer Tory experience of
emotion among people with schizophrenia.

113
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,930
Well that that blind of researcher rose
from an interesting paradox we observed.

114
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:28,830
So I'm, one of the symptoms of
schizophrenia is called Anhedonia,

115
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,460
which means,
uh,

116
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,700
a lack of interest or pleasure
in things in life. Um,

117
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,710
it's not specific to schizophrenia.
People with depression also have this,

118
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:41,040
but it's a pretty common symptom.

119
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,840
As many as three quarters of people with
schizophrenia have this symptom, uh,

120
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,770
which would suggest that in the
presence of something pleasurable,

121
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:53,700
I'm a milkshake or a amusing
heartwarming film clip.

122
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,730
People with schizophrenia shouldn't
enjoy it, but in fact they do.

123
00:06:56,731 --> 00:07:00,090
And that's what we demonstrated in our
early studies that in the presence of

124
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:03,900
pleasant things, people with schizophrenia
enjoy it just the same as as you are.

125
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:08,010
I would. So how then could they
have the symptom of an Idonia?

126
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,680
So that led us to think about,
uh,

127
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:15,420
what is the time course of an
emotional response. And so certainly,

128
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,710
uh, when you present somebody with
something or you have a tasty meal,

129
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:23,520
you enjoy that, that we call that in
the moment or consumer Tory pleasure.

130
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,080
But there are other aspects of the
timing of an emotional response. So,

131
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:28,621
for example,

132
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:33,030
just even thinking about what am I
going to have for lunch today that might

133
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:37,680
conjure up a representation or an image
of what you might like to have for lunch

134
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:41,610
and then, um, that would then
make you anticipate that, boy,

135
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:44,180
I'm really looking forward to having a,
uh,

136
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,010
a tasty salad for lunch.

137
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:51,030
And so you might even have a kind of a
mental image of that salad and you might

138
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:54,300
really be looking forward to it and you
might feel good now knowing that you're

139
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:55,134
going to have a,

140
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:00,230
a tasty salad for lunch and
that anticipatory pleasure
we call that will then

141
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,710
motivate you to get up and leave and
go get a that the tasty salad for lunch

142
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:08,730
show up. Um, uh, and then
you have it and you enjoy it.

143
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:12,450
So what we then begin to think about
the problem that schizophrenia is not so

144
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,280
much enjoying,
they're tasty salad,

145
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:19,281
but it comes in the looking forward to
it or the anticipatory pleasure of that.

146
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,550
And so we did a number of laboratory
studies and we also did a study called an

147
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:27,650
experience sampling study
where we took a look at, uh,

148
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,590
the emotions that people
with schizophrenia experience
in their daily lives in

149
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:33,420
the context of the things that they do.

150
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,730
And what we found was in fact that people
with schizophrenia do have trouble in

151
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,100
anticipating that things in the future,

152
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:46,101
whether it's a tasty salad for lunch
or going out to a movie with friends or

153
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:47,490
visiting with family,

154
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,180
they have trouble anticipating or
predicting that that will be pleasurable.

155
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:55,290
And that in turn interferes
with their motivation,

156
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,290
their behavior to go seek
out those pleasurable things.

157
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,670
But once they have those pleasurable
things, whether they're having, um,

158
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,510
a tasty lunch or watching a movie
with friends, visiting with family,

159
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:07,344
they'll enjoy it.

160
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,310
But where they're going to have difficulty
is anticipating that they will enjoy

161
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:15,480
it and then seeking it out or going
after those kinds of activities in life.

162
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,380
I mean,
it's just so interesting.

163
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:21,190
It reveals how complex the nature
of emotion isn't schizophrenia.

164
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,780
And so based on these really interesting
and nuanced insights that we now have

165
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:29,890
in the schizophrenia, thanks to your
work, um, you know, it makes me wonder,

166
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,281
you know,

167
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:34,360
to what extent can we be translating these
to interventions for individuals with

168
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:35,021
schizophrenia,

169
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:38,020
which I know is something you're
actively doing in your own work now.

170
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,721
Well,
we,

171
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:44,260
we have to in these findings and tried
to translate them both into assessments

172
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,100
and into a interventions for
people with schizophrenia. So, um,

173
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,080
the most standard way of assessing,
um,

174
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,110
some of the problems that
people with schizophrenia,

175
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:57,670
my experience as a clinical interview.
And so, uh, along with my colleagues,

176
00:09:57,671 --> 00:10:00,370
we've developed a new, uh, interview, uh,

177
00:10:00,371 --> 00:10:04,720
for the symptoms of schizophrenia
that specifically targets anticipatory

178
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:08,920
pleasure. Um, so that we're
actually building that into
our assessments now. Um,

179
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:13,180
but we're also trying to work to
develop some psychosocial treatments for

180
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:15,170
schizophrenia because unfortunately,
uh,

181
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,520
the best we have to offer people with
schizophrenia right now anyway in terms of

182
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:23,110
treatment is medication and the
medications don't really do a good job of

183
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,510
helping with this anticipatory pleasure,

184
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:29,020
a deficit or this problem and
outward expression of emotion.

185
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:32,890
So we've developed a couple
of psychosocial treatments.

186
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:37,090
One involves a type of meditation
that focuses on emotion.

187
00:10:37,091 --> 00:10:41,860
Another is a skills based treatment that
really tries to build people's skills

188
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:42,641
and uh,

189
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:46,960
looking forward to things in the future
and savoring and hanging on to those

190
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,970
emotional experiences,
um,

191
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,960
as an effort to try to make a
dent in some of these problems.

192
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:54,190
And anticipatory pleasure.

193
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,430
I mean, when you've also, I mean,

194
00:10:56,431 --> 00:11:00,120
another line of work related to all
this is identifying important sources of

195
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:04,290
gender variation and emotion among
individuals with schizophrenia.

196
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,910
And I wondered if you could just tell
us a bit more about that too. Well,

197
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,360
in some of the early studies we did
where we identified that people with

198
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:15,240
schizophrenia work showing very
many outward expressions of emotion,

199
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:19,800
almost all those studies were done with
men. So it left this big gaping question.

200
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:23,100
Is that also the case for
women with schizophrenia?

201
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,010
Because we know in healthy
people that in general,

202
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:29,010
men tend to be less expressive than women.

203
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:32,280
Women are more readily show all
sorts of outward expressions.

204
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:36,250
And so we wondered if our
observations of this, um,

205
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,920
diminish outward expression and emotion
might be just a function of our having

206
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:44,460
studied only men. So we didn't
have worked to recruit, uh,

207
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:46,260
samples of women with schizophrenia.

208
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,240
And here what we find actually is the
same thing that women with schizophrenia

209
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:56,241
are also very much diminished in their
outward expression of emotion compared to

210
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:59,310
women without schizophrenia. So, uh,

211
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,380
even though women in general tend
to be more expressive than men,

212
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,210
women was schizophrenia also tend not
to show very many outward expressions of

213
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:09,850
emotion,
but also like Ben was schizophrenia,

214
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:13,780
women with schizophrenia feel things
very strongly, just the same as men.

215
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:18,070
Was schizophrenia just the same as
healthy men and women. Um, so, uh,

216
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,940
what we've been able to see that despite
the fact that women in general are more

217
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:22,960
expressive than men,

218
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,930
that doesn't seem to be the case
with people with schizophrenia.

219
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:30,070
Women who have schizophrenia are
also not very outwardly expressive.

220
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:30,620
Hmm.

221
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,400
So it seems that some of the common
gender differences among men and women and

222
00:12:34,401 --> 00:12:38,960
turns of expressivity are slightly
altered an impacted when a diagnosis of

223
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:42,260
schizophrenia is at play.
[inaudible] right. Great.

224
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,160
So this is really interesting to hear
about kind of what got you into emotion in

225
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:49,250
the first place in all the discoveries
you've done illuminating the nature of

226
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:52,340
emotion and schizophrenia,
how it's relevant for you know,

227
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:56,090
intervention and treatment and what are
some important sources of sort of gender

228
00:12:56,091 --> 00:12:59,390
variation, you know, in,
in this emotional profile.

229
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,080
And so I wonder as you think about
sort of where you've come from and what

230
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,950
you've done, sort of where
things are going, um,

231
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,560
in terms of where do you see the future
of emotion research headed from here?

232
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,410
The big question, sorry.
I think, uh, you know,

233
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,410
it's a good question though.

234
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:21,150
I think this is a super exciting
time for emotion research because,

235
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,300
um, I think, you know, for the
first time in probably 30 years,

236
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:29,301
there's some really exciting
new theoretical models of
emotion that are turning

237
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:32,224
our,
uh,

238
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,390
kind of longstanding conceptualizations
about what emotion is on his head.

239
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:38,040
And those are exciting.

240
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:42,870
I think paradigm shifting moments
in the field of emotion. So, um,

241
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,170
if the past 20 years of,
um,

242
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,780
newer imaging research
has taught us anything,

243
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:53,781
I think it's taught us that the brain
doesn't really recognize our discrete

244
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,360
categories of emotion that
we use and lay life. Uh,

245
00:13:57,361 --> 00:14:01,050
but also that's really been at the
forefront of emotion of research. Um,

246
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,060
the idea that emotion,

247
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:07,800
the emotion pie can be carved up into
things like happiness and anger and fear.

248
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,030
You know, the brain just doesn't
respond that way really, um,

249
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,490
to these different discrete categories
and make common sense to us and that have

250
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,450
guided our research. What we
know now is really that, uh,

251
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:21,130
emotion,
and this is a,

252
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:24,660
I think one of the most exciting
theories is that some of the work of Lisa

253
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,660
Feldman Barrett showing us that emotion
is a very similar to other sorts of

254
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:34,140
psychological processes that we
experienced in daily life. But yet, uh,

255
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:37,560
what we've learned about emotion to
our language and just the simple act of

256
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:40,440
labeling can really influence how we feel.

257
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,400
The label a term like
happiness can really constrain,

258
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,530
um, the way we perceive emotion in other
people, the way that we ourselves feel.

259
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,220
Um,

260
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,130
and that is something that we've
learned and constructed an imposed upon,

261
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,560
uh, the feelings that we have in
our bodies and make sense of a,

262
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,080
as we navigate through the world.

263
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:04,390
So I think probably in the
next 10 years or more, um,

264
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,510
uh,

265
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,960
people are gonna look back on our kind
of antiquated views of emotion and we'll

266
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:12,110
have a whole new paradigm I
think for thinking about emotion,

267
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,390
which is exciting I think for the field.

268
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,790
And I think one of the things
that's exciting for the
field to is thinking about

269
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,450
what the next generation of scholars
and students are going to look like.

270
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:26,260
And you know, as someone who
learned emotion from you, um,

271
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,860
you're my very first mentor, you know,
into this field. That was emotion.

272
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,660
My favorite question to ask you is sort
of what advice do you have for students

273
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:35,680
embarking on emotion?

274
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:39,910
I know you've given me a lot of great
advice that I now give to my own students.

275
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,690
Um, and so I'd love to hear just the
advice that you could share with a broader

276
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:45,000
audience of what,

277
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,700
what should students be focusing on or
what are the most interesting puzzles

278
00:15:48,701 --> 00:15:50,260
they should try to approach?

279
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,640
Well,
if people are interested in emotion,

280
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:58,210
I don't know if this is the advice
that I gave you, but it would be,

281
00:15:58,211 --> 00:16:02,980
I would say to study broadly and not just
stay within the fields of emotion but

282
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,280
read in philosophy and in a
neuroscience and in economics of cause.

283
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,240
We emotion is something that impacts
a daily life across all fields and,

284
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:15,880
and walks of life.
Um,

285
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:19,660
so to get kind of a broad
conceptualization of emotion,

286
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:24,080
get outside of a psychology
and read broadly and study, uh,

287
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,510
just to emotion as it unfolds in
a daily life. I think that, um,

288
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,430
we'll give people,
um,

289
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,490
who are interested in becoming scholars
of emotion and a really nice perspective

290
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,090
rather than a very,

291
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:41,620
a narrow one that we all can sometimes
get when we just stay within our,

292
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,660
uh,
individual fields boundaries.

293
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,010
Well, thank you so much and
for speaking with us today.

294
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,520
You're welcome.
Thanks for having me.

295
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,600
