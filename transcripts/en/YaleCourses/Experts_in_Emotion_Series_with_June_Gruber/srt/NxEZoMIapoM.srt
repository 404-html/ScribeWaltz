1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,590
And I'm pleased today to be
speaking with Doctor Laurie Santos,

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,940
who's going to share with us her thoughts
on the question of do animals feel and

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:08,780
think like us.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,610
Laurie Santos is an associate professor
of psychology at Yale University and

5
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:16,880
director of yelling universities,
comparative Cognition Laboratory.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,350
She received both her ba and phd from
Harvard University and her research

7
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:25,850
explores the evolutionary origins of
human cognition by studying the cognitive

8
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:28,250
capacities present and nonhuman primates.

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,300
Laurie has won numerous awards for her
scientific achievements and for her

10
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:35,540
teaching and mentorship,
including the Yale University.

11
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:39,650
Arthur grew memorial prize for Outstanding
Junior Faculty and the Stanton Prize

12
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:42,320
from the Society for,
for philosophy and psychology.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,860
She was recently voted one
of popular science magazines,

14
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:47,540
brilliant 10 young minds.

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,130
So I now turn to a very special experts
and emotion interview with the treasure

16
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:54,950
local colleague of mine,
Dr Laurie Santos.

17
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,710
So welcome Lorrie. Thanks for
speaking today. Thanks for having me.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,730
So I thought what I might do is just
start off a little bit by asking you what

19
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:08,200
first got you interested in this topic
of emotion and how it can apply to non

20
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,470
humans.
Yeah.

21
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:14,340
So I actually got interested in nonhuman
animals by actually hanging out with

22
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,930
them, um, as a,

23
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:19,350
as a college student and had
the opportunity to actually
do some research with

24
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,184
monkeys.

25
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,000
And that actually brought me down to a
very nice warm Caribbean island where I

26
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,190
get to hang out with a bunch
of monkeys for the first time.

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,730
And I think I can remember the
moment when I first got interested,

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,780
not just in their cognition,

29
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:34,410
but particularly in their emotion when
I was hanging out on a beach that I was

30
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:36,930
finding really beautiful and it
was warm and there was a breeze.

31
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,770
And I noticed there was a monkey sitting
right beside me who was like looking

32
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:45,300
out into the water and seem
to be experiencing exactly
the same things I was.

33
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,380
And it just caused me to think like,
what, what does he know about the world?

34
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:52,920
What does he know about the scene? Is he
enjoying it? Does he find this beautiful?

35
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,840
Um, and it was kind of a fascinating
moment because I realized that, you know,

36
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,210
we now have these cool tools and cognitive
science where we can answer some of

37
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:04,830
these, these big questions. And so
that was kind of what got me into it.

38
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,470
That's a nice,

39
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,780
I bet anybody who's had an animal or there
I was going to say whether you have a

40
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:12,300
pet dog or a cat or even a gold fish,
right?

41
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:15,570
You can't help but wonder what they're
experiencing and if they experienced some

42
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:18,040
of the same things that
you do. Excellent. So one,

43
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,830
ask you just a little more about some
of the work you've done in this area.

44
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:24,080
So I mean, you've really
conducted the, you know, someone,

45
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:27,910
I'll work here looking at the evolutionary
origins of the human mind through the

46
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:31,960
study of nonhuman primates such as, you
know, monkeys. And here you found that,

47
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,650
you know, monkey seem to be able to
understand what other people are thinking.

48
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,510
And I wonder what implications do you
think this might have for how monkeys

49
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:45,220
might understand the emotions of other
people as one type of cognitive process?

50
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,920
Yeah. Well, it's still a
bit of a puzzle. I mean,

51
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,130
if you think about how we
process each other's emotions,

52
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:54,490
sort of how we empathize with others
seem to have different components, right?

53
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:59,491
So I can empathize with somebody when
they say stub their toe and that just

54
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:00,550
involves me,
you know,

55
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:04,410
thinking about what it would feel like
to experience something like that. Um,

56
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,080
if I think about what it would feel like
for somebody to win the lottery or to

57
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:11,020
find out, you know, that their
parent had died or something sad.

58
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,110
Those things require much
richer cognitive components.

59
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,740
They really require me to understand
something about the other person's belief,

60
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,270
their intentions,
what they know.

61
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,960
And that's what researchers in primate
cognition have really been focused on.

62
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:26,320
This question of whether or not other
animals can actually think about what

63
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,950
other individuals see and know the answer.
So far,

64
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,550
at least in the monkey species
we work with seems to be, yes,

65
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,460
nonhuman animals can think
about what others see, a know,

66
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,700
however they fall short if
thinking about what others believe.

67
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,870
And this means there's,

68
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,130
there's sort of a big disconnect between
how we think about the minds of others

69
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,960
and how other primates do that.

70
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,580
We don't yet know whether this translates
into how others think about how

71
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:51,971
primary is,

72
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:55,120
think about the emotions of others and
how it translates into empathizing.

73
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,640
But I think these are some big
questions in the field right now.

74
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,310
So it sounds like,
although it's an open question,

75
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:02,050
they may be able to be empathic,

76
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:06,340
but it may be a different kind of empathy
than human species experience perhaps.

77
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,420
Yeah. Or it might be, it might be that
they have some aspects of empathy but,

78
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,120
but not others. And I think some
of the work we're doing now,

79
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:18,490
it seems to be suggesting that they might
have a lot of emotional empathy, um,

80
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,750
but maybe not as much cognitive empathy.
So,

81
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,620
so one example of this is a set of work,

82
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:27,850
trying to look at whether or not other
primates actually contagiously Jaan. Um,

83
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,920
so as you probably heard
about in this series,

84
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:33,130
the fact that we yawn when other
individuals young is really just another

85
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:36,970
mechanism showing that we're kind of
engaging with what others are feeling and

86
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:39,690
it's just kind of an automatic
response to that. Um,

87
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,750
turns out chimpanzees and other primates
also will contagiously beyond if they

88
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,310
see other individuals yawning.

89
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,050
I'm suggesting that they
have some emotional ability
to experience what others

90
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:51,070
are experiencing.

91
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,760
The question is just kind of how far does
that go and can we come up with great

92
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,120
ways to test it? Well, it sounds like a
lot of the work you're doing right now,

93
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:01,270
it's going to be answering some of these
important questions in the upcoming

94
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:02,830
years or we're trying,

95
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,570
another question I wanted to ask you a
bit about is, I mean you've also taken,

96
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,050
you know,

97
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,590
comparative approach to investigating
the origins of prosocial behavior in

98
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:13,300
monkeys, which is really, really cool.

99
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,100
And your work here suggest that monkeys
are sometimes but not always willing to

100
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:20,620
donate even their own food to others.
Right.

101
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,240
So could you say just a bit more
about these findings? Yeah. So this,

102
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:29,530
this set of work is really trying to
tap into whether other species have this

103
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:33,820
motivation that we do to
kind of help others. Um, you
just, all things being equal,

104
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:37,480
you want to see others, you
know, feel good or get more
food or have more welfare.

105
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,230
Um,

106
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,680
and so there's a big set of work now in
the field of primate cognition trying to

107
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:44,050
see whether other primates do this too.

108
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,290
And the simple tasks that we tend to use
is one that works. Something like this.

109
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:51,460
You bring a primate subject in a lab and
he can pull one of two different tools

110
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:55,210
to get access to food. The first tool
can actually give food to another guy,

111
00:05:55,211 --> 00:05:56,950
his friend who's in an another enclosure.

112
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,070
Where's the second tool delivers the
second guy. Nothing. So the question is,

113
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,260
what are primates do? Did they want
to be nice to have than the guy?

114
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:06,920
Do they pull the first well or are they
kind of mean to the guy pulling a second

115
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:07,870
12?
Um,

116
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,990
what we find in our own species that we
passed here at Yale completion monkeys

117
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,970
is that these capuchin
monkeys are actually nice.

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,310
So if you give them this choice,
more often than not,

119
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:18,500
they'll pull the tool that
gives the other guys' food.

120
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,130
The problem comes when you start messing
around with the setup a little bit.

121
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,970
So now imagine the same sort of
situation except the second one.

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,430
You can't actually see the first
monkey you delivering the food.

123
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,690
So in some sense the first monkey
is behaving anonymously for people.

124
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:33,830
Probably even if you're anonymous,

125
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:35,840
you'd want the other guy
to get something nice.

126
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,870
What you see in capuchins is
actually just the opposite. In fact,

127
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:40,310
when the conclusions are anonymous,

128
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:43,250
they actually are more likely to pull
the mean for all the tool that gives the

129
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:45,980
other guy nothing.
And so this is just one result,

130
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:49,400
but it suggests that the way that
other species actually process,

131
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,520
whether they're willing to give food
to others are willing to be altruistic,

132
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,100
might be quite different than
what we do in our own species.

133
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,110
And it's still really early in this work.

134
00:06:57,111 --> 00:07:00,620
But it suggests that there might be
some big differences in our ability to

135
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:04,900
empathize with other individuals rewards.
So interesting. It makes me wonder,

136
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:05,141
you know,

137
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:08,440
what does the say potentially about the
nature of emotions that monkeys might

138
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:10,000
actually feel towards others?

139
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,520
And I think we know very
little about it in one of the,

140
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,510
the challenges of work with other animals
is that we can measure their behavior,

141
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:19,570
right? We can measure which
tool they pull say yes.

142
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,820
But it's actually really tricky for us
to measure what they're experiencing.

143
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:26,480
You know, do they feel bad when they kind
of don't give the other guys some food,

144
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:28,520
you know,
do they get happy when he gets the food?

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,660
These are measures that are really
tricky for us to actually objectify and

146
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,430
actually study in meaningful ways.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,300
So it sounds like these are some of
the additional challenges and exciting

148
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:40,930
questions, right? That lie
ahead in this field. Yeah,

149
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,660
and I think this is where there's a
nice marriage between work in effect and

150
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:46,910
processing in humans and in animals.
You know,

151
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:49,460
the hope is that we can bring
some of those methods, you know,

152
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:53,210
the same methods that you use in your own
lab to work with the animals to try to

153
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:55,850
answer some of these big
issues. Right? I mean,

154
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,610
and that's just leveraging
insights from one field to another.

155
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,910
We can learn so much in this field
of an aspect of science that is so

156
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:04,930
interdisciplinary as you were alluding to.
Yeah.

157
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,840
So I wanted to ask you a little bit
about your recent work, which, you know,

158
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,390
transcends to a different
domain of the animal kingdom,

159
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,580
where you've looked at some
of our closest companions,

160
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:15,770
dogs and how they might think and feel.

161
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,670
And I know a lot of people have their own
label beliefs about what their dog can

162
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:23,030
and can't feel and the extent to which
their dog truly empathizes with how

163
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:27,380
they're feeling. And I wonder what you
think in this domain, um, and your work,

164
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,170
sort of what have been the core
discoveries here, you know,

165
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:34,220
about the emotional and sort of cognitive
inner lives of dogs. Some of our most,

166
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:38,950
you know, intimate, you know, animal
friends, we'd say yes. Yeah, I mean, yeah,

167
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,680
I think if I had to pick the,
the three lists,

168
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:45,880
things we've figured out recently
in dog cognition work, um,

169
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,950
I guess the first would be just how good
dogs are at reading our own behavioral

170
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:52,150
cues.
Um,

171
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,950
one of the puzzles in primary cognition
for a long time is it even really

172
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:57,180
closely related primates,

173
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:00,420
like chimpanzees were just
really bad at reading human cues.

174
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,430
So you set up a simple task where a human
would point to a cup that had food and

175
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:08,160
you'd expect a chimpanzee subject
to actually pick up on this.

176
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,100
But chimpanzees would just ignore the
pointing and they just didn't seem to

177
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:12,490
understand what these cues meant.

178
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,850
And what we're learning is that dog seem
naturally adapted to use the cues that

179
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:21,150
humans provide.
So unlike to Menzies in the first trial,

180
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,090
dogs will pick up on pointing,
they use human gaze.

181
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,110
They seem to be really well attuned to
our cues and they seem to use them and

182
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,470
socially meaningful ways.
So that was sort of surprised.

183
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:34,010
Number one is that dogs are even better
than primates when it comes to using

184
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,890
these cues. Um, if I had
to pick kind of number two,

185
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:40,010
the surprising result cognition world,
um,

186
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,550
I think that would be how good dogs are
at understanding human language. Um,

187
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:47,400
I mean anybody who has a dog knows
that you can teach dogs, so, you know,

188
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,540
sit and fetched and so on.

189
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,140
But it turns out that dogs are actually
better at understanding some of our

190
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:53,220
words than we even thought.

191
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,280
And this is the lovely work of
Julianne Kaminsky and her colleagues,

192
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,640
particularly looking at some border
collies species where there are certain

193
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,460
individual to seem to
understand lots of human words.

194
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:06,900
So if you give them information about
pick this specific toy or pick a toy with

195
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:08,630
a new name, like a blink get, um,

196
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,990
they can understand these
cues specifically as referring
to particular objects.

197
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:13,560
Um,

198
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,800
and one of the dogs that community and
colleagues study actually is thought to

199
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:18,510
understand over a
thousand different words.

200
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:23,100
So it seems like hugs are much better at
understanding not just our social cues,

201
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:26,970
but also some of our vocal cues
than we thought. Um, I think the,

202
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,200
the third spot,

203
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:31,290
what we're learning more about dogs
is actually in the emotional domain,

204
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:35,290
which might be the one
that's most relevant to the
series that you're doing. Um,

205
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,410
and that's that we're learning
that just like primates,

206
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,760
at least when it comes to reading
physical emotions and emotional contagion,

207
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,460
dogs seem to be even more empathic.
And we originally thought, um,

208
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,740
so a recent study suggests that dogs
are actually also good at contagious

209
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:52,700
yawning. Um, some 70% of dogs tested, uh,

210
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,160
well contagiously yard if
they see another yon. And um,

211
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,250
and so and so that suggests
that just like primates,

212
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:01,140
even though their physical features are,
we are,

213
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,140
they might be kind of a weirder than
ours are just different than ours.

214
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,621
They might,

215
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:08,850
dogs might actually be really in tuned
to their owners emotions and their owners

216
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,330
processing. It's still sort
of early stages in at work,

217
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:13,830
but it's exciting because it,
again,

218
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:16,950
we're sort of developing some new methods
to get at some of this stuff. I mean,

219
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,220
so those are three really,
really cool insights that you provided.

220
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,970
And it makes me wonder sort of what do
we think at this point or some of the

221
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:28,850
biggest puzzles still out there? Yeah,
well there's lots of puzzles. I feel like,

222
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:29,911
I mean,

223
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:33,570
I think the one that my students in I
are most interested in is this puzzle

224
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:36,210
about how dogs are using our social cues,

225
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,350
do they learn and some of the same
social ways that humans do. Um,

226
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:44,280
one of the cool things we're finding in
developmental psychology right now is

227
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,970
all the ways that children's learning
can actually be constrained by what other

228
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:49,320
teacher is actually tell them.

229
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,620
And we know very little about
teaching and other animals,

230
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:56,110
but in some ways dogs provide a perfect
window and did this because they're good

231
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:59,830
at using our queues. There's just this
big question about how did they use them?

232
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:00,011
You know,

233
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:03,550
can they use them to learn about artifacts
or to learn how to categorize? Um,

234
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,670
or is it just they're,

235
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,080
they attended these cues but don't learn
in some of the same ways as humans.

236
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,560
And so the biggest puzzle and the kind
of most exciting thing we're doing at our

237
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:14,710
dog cognition lab now is to
actually look at dog pedagogy,

238
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:19,030
to see the dogs pick up on the
same pedagogical cues as humans do.

239
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,850
Very cool stuff you have going
on in your lab. Dr. Santos.

240
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,680
So I wanted to ask you then, as you
think about the future of this field,

241
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:28,850
where do you see it headed?

242
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:33,780
Kind of what are the next most important
areas that you see moving forward? Yeah,

243
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:37,530
well particularly thinking about
the study of animal emotions.

244
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:42,531
I mean my guess is that the most exciting
next step is going to be to find new

245
00:12:42,571 --> 00:12:47,030
techniques for specifically
measuring animals, emotions,
and I, as I said before,

246
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,930
we're very good at
measuring their behavior,

247
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,920
but I figure it doesn't
necessarily correlate with
how individuals are feeling.

248
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,400
And I think that there's some new
psychophysical techniques. Again,

249
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,910
someone like some of the ones you used
in your own lab might be useful in

250
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,220
studying these kinds of questions.

251
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:05,760
They might give us a unique window into
actually what's going on inside the

252
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:07,710
animal's head in terms
of their own emotions.

253
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,400
And so I think at the most exciting
thing in the next step or this field,

254
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:12,960
particularly with studying emotions,

255
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,710
is actually applying some
of these new techniques, um,

256
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,100
and seeing what they can tell us
about the animal mind. Excellent.

257
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:21,680
So then when you have students, you
know, when we think about the future,

258
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:24,980
it's often the students that are at the
forefront when they come to you with an

259
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:28,760
interest in these kinds of questions or
they're thinking about embarking in this

260
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:30,830
field, um, and they
come to you for advice.

261
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,080
What do you tell them or what
would you tell them? Well,

262
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,120
the first thing would be to get started,
right?

263
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,870
To actually dive in and do
some research yourself. Um,

264
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,760
one of the nice things about working
animal cognition is that, you know,

265
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,340
even a little kids come up with
the same questions. You know,

266
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,100
little kids want to know, what's
my thinking? What does he know?

267
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:48,810
Does he know what that word?
And so on.

268
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,310
And so my advice would be to jump
in and start doing it. Um, you know,

269
00:13:53,311 --> 00:13:56,940
if you have access to doing work with
primates, that's fantastic. But many,

270
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:58,800
many research universities
around the country,

271
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,660
we actually have ways that you involved
in work with dog cognition. Um,

272
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:06,510
and even if you're listening to this
series and you're not near there,

273
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,480
there are cool new tools on the internet
that can allow you to do some of this

274
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,620
stuff. Um, so my colleagues, uh,

275
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,970
Brian Hare at Duke University has
just started his own website called

276
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,060
[inaudible] dot com and
as part of that mission,

277
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:22,160
you can get involved in citizen science
and help test your own dog or test other

278
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,090
people's dogs, um, to look
at kind of cool questions.

279
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,840
So even if you're far away from
labs that are doing this stuff,

280
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,790
there are ways for you to get involved.
Um,

281
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,750
but that would be my main
advice is like jump in,

282
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,240
try to see what doing empirical science
with the animals is really like and you

283
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:37,780
know, see if it's for you. Great.

284
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,900
Well thank you so much for speaking with
us today, Lori. I will. Thanks so much.

285
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:43,820
Thanks for having me as part
of the series. Yeah, thank you.

286
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,400
So this concludes our experts in emotion
interview with Doctor Laurie Santos

287
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:49,260
from Yale University.
Thanks again.
