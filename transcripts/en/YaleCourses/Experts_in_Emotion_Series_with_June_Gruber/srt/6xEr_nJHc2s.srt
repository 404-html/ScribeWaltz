1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,910
Welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,010
So these three familiar faces that you've
seen at the beginning of every lecture,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,460
perhaps they're from different
backgrounds and if so,

4
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:15,960
would we expect them to actually show
or experience differences in emotion as

5
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:17,670
well?
So in this lecture,

6
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:22,671
what we're going to discuss today is to
what extent emotions are indeed shaped

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,130
and tune by culture and
different backgrounds.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,350
So how is it possible that we could
show differences in emotion based on our

9
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:36,450
cultural background?
In other words,

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,960
our emotions actually culturally shaped.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,190
This is the question we want to grapple
with today. Is it that, you know,

12
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:48,480
in some ways we may have overestimated
how hardwired or sort of how

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,490
biologically, you know, uh,
strengthen these emotions are,

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,870
have we underestimated the role that
our actual life experience and cultural

15
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:02,280
contexts can play in shaping who
we are as an emotional being?

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,810
So today what I want to do is sort of
delve inside with you to get a sense of

17
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:09,870
what is culture and in what ways to date.

18
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:14,871
We know that culture does indeed plays a
role in influencing our emotional life.

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,780
So we're going to do this by going
through the following roadmap.

20
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,070
First introduced to some terminology
relevant to the field of culture and

21
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:27,820
emotion. Next we'll go through some
key examples that demonstrate, uh,

22
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,040
the ways in which culture indeed
does influence our emotional lives.

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,520
We'll conclude with this
question of nature or nurture.

24
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,390
We had started with talking about sort
of evolutionary and more biological

25
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,620
origins of emotion.

26
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,110
And today we're going to be talking about
evidence suggesting that maybe context,

27
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,830
cultural context,

28
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:51,820
social influences may also influence the
way we experience and express emotions.

29
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:55,230
So our emotions,
more a product of our nature,

30
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,040
inherent nature or more a product
of nurture or environment.

31
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,870
And we'll conclude with takeaway questions
and an expert interview today with Dr

32
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:07,740
Jeannie Psi. So let's start
with some basic terminology.

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,200
I think what we really need to start
with first is the question of exactly,

34
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:16,350
well what is culture here?

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,630
When we think about what is culture,

36
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,650
there's a definition that is
common across different fields,

37
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,840
defining culture as human phenomena
that cannot be easily explained by or

38
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:31,890
attributable to genetics or biology.

39
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,810
So some examples of what culture is or
sort of what is the scope of over which

40
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:40,290
culture, uh, presides
include some examples here.

41
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,270
So culture includes systems of meaning
to interpret the world as well as

42
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:48,330
concepts that are transmitted
through social participation.

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,430
So examples include language,
um, sort of social customs.

44
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,420
These are sort of the, you know,
fabric of what makes up culture.

45
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,920
So when we think about exactly
how culture shapes emotion,

46
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,080
there are two different perspectives that
scientists have when they think about

47
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:08,920
this question.

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,150
One of them on the left is what
we talked about previously.

49
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:17,440
You might remember this evolutionary
perspective to emotion that suggested that

50
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:21,610
emotions are biologically rooted
part of our evolutionary history.

51
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,710
They serve specific functions and their
universal across cultures and other

52
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:26,981
words,

53
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:31,750
meaning there should be no cross cultural
variation that emotions are really

54
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:35,050
part of our biological
and evolutionary history.

55
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,210
So that's a first perspective we covered.

56
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,660
The second we're going to talk more in
detail about today that we touched on

57
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:45,460
previously is this idea of social
constructivism also called cultural

58
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:49,030
relativism. Here, it takes
a much stronger stance,

59
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:54,031
really suggesting that culture plays a
tremendous role in shaping and creating

60
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,050
our emotions.
So again,

61
00:03:56,051 --> 00:04:01,051
emotions here as you can see on the right
and purple are constructed by cultural

62
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:04,960
values,
institution and language biology,

63
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:09,010
both the brain and are sort of autonomic
nervous system. Our thoughts to play,

64
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:12,190
little to no role in emotions whatsoever.

65
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,650
And in fact emotions are
these open systems and they
can be constructed in many

66
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:22,180
different ways. So this takes
a really strong stance. In
fact saying that culture,

67
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:22,811
you know,

68
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:27,811
not only influences our emotions but
can even create certain emotions for us.

69
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:34,230
So what do we know then about the
role of culture in shaping emotion?

70
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,050
Sort of what is the evidence to date?

71
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,750
So this is going to take us to our second
stop here on the roadmap where we're

72
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:48,751
going to talk about what do we know
about cultural influences on emotion?

73
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,920
Exactly how can it shape our emotion?
How can it create emotions?

74
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,600
How does it modify the kinds of
triggers that would elicit emotions and

75
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:03,220
different people? So let's turn
here now to the evidence to date.

76
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,680
Looking at cultural influences on emotion.

77
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,040
So I'll start with the first example to
answer this question of how exactly does

78
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,810
culture shape emotions.

79
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,110
So one example here is that
culture suggest what are
the appropriate solicitors

80
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,760
also refer to the antecedent
conditions for an emotion.

81
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,830
So what I mean by this is the following.
So although most of us,

82
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,840
for example, can think of snakes that
elicit fear and everyone across cultures,

83
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,670
we also see specific types of illicit hers
that are unique to different cultures.

84
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,990
So for example,

85
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:46,140
you can see here that work that's
looked at frequent antecedents of uh,

86
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,070
emotion across different
cultures. Find thing, finds
things like in us culture. Um,

87
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:54,250
we see that relationships
are highly valued.

88
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,150
And so things that elicit joy
within the US include relationships,

89
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,440
bonds with our partners, bonds
with families, with children.

90
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,460
So that seems to be a really common
elicit or for what would elicit joy or

91
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:11,930
happiness. Now, what if we look at
different cultural context? Do they have,

92
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,000
you know, the same types of antecedents,
oral listeners of joy and happiness?

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,080
Like what most frequently elicit these
kinds of emotions in different cultural

94
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:24,980
contexts? Interestingly, we know
that Israel values achievement.

95
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,150
So if you ask people the commonly report
what makes them feel happiness or joy,

96
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,590
they're more likely to give you examples
of times in which they accomplished

97
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:38,591
something of value or achieved or one
something that signaled their own sense of

98
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:42,080
accomplishment.
By contrast,

99
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:47,060
if we look at the up to Eskimos,
they report something quite different.

100
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,290
Um, they report, um, frequent
antecedents are elixirs of joy,

101
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,330
which include chasing lemmings as
you can see here on the bottom.

102
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:01,390
So what we're seeing here is that the
frequency of the kinds of antecedents or

103
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:06,170
elixirs of joy can have a lot of
cultural influence varying widely from,

104
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,550
you know, the u s to Israeli
cultures to these, um,

105
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,180
[inaudible] Indian or sorry,
at Ku, Eskimo cultures as well.

106
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,240
A second example here of how culture,
shapes and motion.

107
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,860
So we also know that culture is
shaped the appraisals of emotion.

108
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,010
So here you can ask a couple
of really important questions.

109
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,030
So do the same appraisals lead to
the same emotions across cultures?

110
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:34,880
In other words,
does threat always lead to fear?

111
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,280
And do people appraise
situations similarly, uh,

112
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,870
across cultures? So, in other words,

113
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:46,790
does threat mean the same thing to all
people even if they come from different

114
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,770
cultural backgrounds? So, um,

115
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,660
I'm just briefly refreshing
our memory here of a,

116
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:57,290
in our theories of emotion timeline from
the very beginning of the course where

117
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,080
we talked about these
cognitive theories of emotion.

118
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,800
And the reason that I'm bringing this
up again is this is really this sort of

119
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:07,730
foundation upon which we
know that appraisals, uh,

120
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,940
play a really important role
in giving rise to emotions.

121
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:16,180
So it's the appraisals of a situation
that give them meaning in the first place

122
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:19,280
that then would lead to the sort of,
you know,

123
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,270
heart rate acceleration and
experience of emotion fear.

124
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:24,830
Here's you can see in this example.

125
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,820
So this is just to underscore that
the idea of appraisals giving rise to

126
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:33,821
emotions has been ingrained in our
conceptions of emotion since Lazarus first

127
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:36,020
brought up his cognitive
theory of emotion.

128
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:40,070
But now it's until recently that we're
starting to look at whether or not these

129
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:42,980
appraisals can actually
differ across culturally.

130
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,140
So one example,

131
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,790
as you can see here is an
example using a group of fish.

132
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,590
Okay. So you see this group of fish.
And if you were asked the question,

133
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,100
what do you think the fish right here
on the front, what is he feeling?

134
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,960
So Americans who were asked this question
of what does the fish in the front

135
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:08,961
feel are more likely to say that the
fish is angry and that he's leaving the

136
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:12,570
rest of the fish because he
wants to get away from the group.

137
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,410
And people think that this
might be because in the u
s we really focus on these

138
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:22,020
individualistic values, ways in which
we are different from the group.

139
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,410
And so in this way, what you're
seeing is this fish in the front,

140
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:27,990
he must be different in
the group in some way.

141
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,940
And the emotion often attributed to
explain that more individualistic focuses.

142
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,790
Well the fish just feeling angry.
Okay.

143
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,860
If you were to ask people however from
a more Chinese backgrounds and ask them,

144
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,990
okay, well what do you think the
fish in the front is feeling?

145
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,520
They're more likely to say that the
fish and the front is feeling sad. Um,

146
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,630
and in fact, he may feel lonely and
rejected from the rest of the group.

147
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,470
And this is thought to be explained by
a different set of cultural values that

148
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,470
instead of focusing on more
individualistic values like
Americans, um, there's,

149
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:00,750
uh,

150
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,750
increasing emphasis instead
on collectivistic values
of wanting to be part of a

151
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:10,410
group, um, having your identity as
part of a bigger collective whole.

152
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,600
And so when you're
separated from the group,

153
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:16,230
that's actually something that feels
quite negative or aversive and you're

154
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:20,520
feeling sad as opposed to feeling angry
because you really want to get away and

155
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:21,810
you want to be different.

156
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:26,070
You want to lead the group and not be
sort of stuck and being part of that pack.

157
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,410
So this is some interesting
work suggesting that the
way that cultures appraise

158
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,820
different situations,
um,

159
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,690
is really quite different depending
on their own set of cultural values.

160
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,740
Here's an example of individualistic
versus collectivistic culture or values

161
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:45,090
that influence the motions that we
attribute to different scenarios.

162
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:51,290
So another way in which we can illustrate
this principle is through an example

163
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:54,430
that I, that I've really enjoyed here. Um,

164
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,320
that was given to me by a colleague
of Mine, David Pizarro at Cornell.

165
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,380
So imagine that you go to a friend's
house and you're told to help yourself to

166
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:07,530
the refrigerator.
How might you view this?

167
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,830
So research has found that Americans
view this situation in the following way.

168
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:18,420
So they view this situation as something
where they would feel pleasant.

169
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,040
Wow, I feel at home. You know, I can just
help myself to whatever's in the fridge.

170
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,240
They also report feelings of fairness,
um,

171
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,570
that they really feel that this act
is an act of courtesy and generosity

172
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,220
and also feeling, um, report, uh,

173
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,230
feelings of happiness because wow,

174
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:41,100
now they have the opportunity to really
just eat whatever they want in that

175
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:45,930
fridge. However, you see a
really different set of emotions,

176
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,610
uh, in response to the situation when
you look at a different cultural context.

177
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,780
So here, um, we know that Americans are,

178
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,870
would report feeling
happy in this context,

179
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,840
but in another culture such as Japan,

180
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,080
this situation is actually
appraised very differently.

181
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,530
So instead of seeing
feelings of pleasantness,

182
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,240
fairness and happiness arrives from the
situation, you see more frequent reports.

183
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,490
A feeling unpleasant,
um,

184
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,060
which is thought to be because the
host is refusing to take care of you.

185
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:21,040
They're sort of leaving you on your
own to figure out what to do with the

186
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:25,000
contents of food in their refrigerator.
You may feel that this is unfair.

187
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:29,170
So do you deserve this kind of rudeness
where someone just leaves you to help

188
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:31,600
yourself to find what you
need in the refrigerator?

189
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,890
And this may actually lead instead of
feelings to happiness, feelings of anger,

190
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,600
you just can't believe that they would
just sort of not say anything or guide

191
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:44,830
you or be a good house and just leave
you to sort of sort out for yourself what

192
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:45,940
is that you're supposed to eat.

193
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,990
So what's interesting about this example
is simply from looking at a fridge and

194
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:51,610
someone telling you to help yourself,

195
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,170
is that it can give rise to a completely
different cascade of emotions here in

196
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:56,780
this example,

197
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,940
depending on if you're from an American
background or Japanese background.

198
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:05,810
So what I think is really interesting
here is that we see appraisals, um,

199
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,310
not only differences in the kinds
of appraisals people may have,

200
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,330
but in the emotions that can follow
from these different appraisals.

201
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:18,070
So in how the situations themselves are
appraised differently and how this leads

202
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:22,180
on the one hand to feelings of
happiness in one cultural context.

203
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,260
And in another cultural context like we
talked about to feelings of anger, um,

204
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,050
and appraising the person was very rude.

205
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,620
And this is just from a
simple fridge example.

206
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,290
So what's a third way that we know
that culture can shape emotion?

207
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,281
Well,
here,

208
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:43,030
and I find some of this to be the most
interesting research is that culture

209
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:47,560
actually shapes the way that we express
our emotions through what's called

210
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:48,640
display rules.

211
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,820
So cultural display rules are defined
as when and how one is appropriately

212
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:58,180
allowed to express certain emotions.

213
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:03,250
They're sort of the rules that govern
how we sort of transmit emotions in our

214
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:07,840
face or in our nonverbal behavior.
So

215
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,490
a display rule to define it in more
detail are the cultural rules that dictate

216
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:19,801
how emotions should be expressed and
when and where their expression is

217
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:20,884
appropriate.

218
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,290
And there was one study that was done
here by freezing that really tried to

219
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:31,291
tease apart different display
rules according to different
cultural and societal

220
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:32,241
context.

221
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:36,820
So often a society's display rules
require people to give evidence of certain

222
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:41,821
emotions that they may not actually feel
or to disguise their true feelings in

223
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:44,800
context where they should
or ought not to show them.

224
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,750
So this is an example that was done
in a study by freezing in 1972.

225
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,670
Um, we had two of people, again,

226
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:56,500
they were American participants
or Japanese participants. Um,

227
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,980
in this study they were asked to view
a movie depicting a surgical procedure.

228
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,300
And as you can see here,

229
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:06,410
they viewed it either with an
experimenter in the room or alone.

230
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,060
And what we see here is that
the Japanese participants,

231
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:14,210
when they were with the experiment
or watching this really gruesome,

232
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,000
really awful surgical movie,
showed little emotional expressively.

233
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,920
They were in fact what was
thought of as stone faced.

234
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:26,570
So they suppressed a lot of their emotions
when they were around. Another person.

235
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:31,680
By contrast, when they were alone,
they actually showed, you know, the,

236
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:35,150
the typical kind of expressive
displays of emotion, right?

237
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,420
So they showed disgust and things of that.

238
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:42,860
Like by contrast, when we looked
at the American participants,

239
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,100
they displayed an emotional reaction when,
when,

240
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:49,610
when they're with the experimenter
and they displayed a similar emotional

241
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:53,240
reaction when they were alone watching
the surgical video. And in fact,

242
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:55,970
if you look just at the column
to the right here alone,

243
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,660
the Japanese and American participants
did not differ in their emotional

244
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:01,340
expressive, the, when they were alone,

245
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,410
they only differed when they were in the
context of the experiment or suggesting

246
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:11,090
that some of the display rules in Japanese
cultures may be to sort of suppress

247
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:14,900
or inhibit certain kinds of negative
emotional expressions when you're in the

248
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:16,460
context of another person.

249
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,630
Whereas the American participants did
not have those same types of cultural

250
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:23,720
display rules that they
were feeling, uh, you know,

251
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:27,590
appropriate to display whatever
emotional reactions they were feeling in

252
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:29,150
response to watching this video.

253
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,930
So it's interesting here is that you
see that certain display rules really

254
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:36,290
suggest that in certain social contexts
that may not be appropriate to express

255
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,930
emotions.
And another context it is.

256
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,810
So this graph is interesting too.
Um,

257
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:49,490
and that it's giving other types of
examples that display rules as to how

258
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:54,200
frequently one should be expressing
emotions dramatically differs across the

259
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:58,470
world. So what you see here is a
lot of different countries here, um,

260
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,010
depicted by these
different purple circles.

261
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:06,310
And on the left side you hear how much
they endorse expressing emotions overall.

262
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:12,410
And the point I want you to take away
from this graph is that there's a lot of

263
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:17,090
variability and the types of expressivity
that people endorse and importantly

264
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,230
that we just talked about consistent with
the studies we've found is on the top

265
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:24,590
right, you see the u s
very, very high, right?

266
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,800
So some of the display rules in the u
s are that it's very appropriate and

267
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:34,430
highly common to express emotions
frequently and intensely. In fact,

268
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:38,600
we're way here up at the top. And you
can contrast this with other countries.

269
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:39,620
Some of them that we've talked about,

270
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:44,390
Japanese cultures are much less lower on
their overall expressively endorsement.

271
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,490
I'm down here,
you have Hong Kong.

272
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,090
And so you really see an interesting
spread in terms of the overall degree to

273
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:56,091
which different cultures display emotions
at different intensities and different

274
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:57,090
frequencies.

275
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,390
So example for how else can
culture shape emotion? Well,

276
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:08,391
we see here that culture can also give
shape to the value that we place on

277
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:12,450
experiencing emotions or the way in
which we give it special premium or

278
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:13,830
importance in our life.

279
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,180
So this is an example that I always find
really interesting and it is based on

280
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:23,181
the work of Jeannie side at Stanford
University who will speak with and our

281
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,280
expert in emotion interview
series. Uh, later today.

282
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,970
She really put forth this concept of
an effect of valuation or how much,

283
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,400
um,

284
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,350
personal value we place on experiencing
different kinds of emotions,

285
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,880
sort of what our, our, our emotional
ideals or emotional standards.

286
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,900
So we'll talk a bit more about her
work just now an aspect of valuation.

287
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,150
So some of you may have seen the movie
or read the book where the wild things

288
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:52,920
are. And if, so,

289
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:57,810
you may remember a character who was
named Carol and he was full of these mini

290
00:18:57,811 --> 00:19:00,390
kind of wild and unleashed emotions.

291
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,230
So on the left you can see
this picture of Carol. Um,

292
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:09,030
and what is a representation of what
Jeannie Syrah refers to as actual aspect.

293
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:13,080
So this is how Carol actually feels.
Um,

294
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:18,081
and so these are just the moment emotions
in the moment that he feels a on a day

295
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:19,530
to day basis.

296
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:24,330
Now what's really important is to contrast
this on the right with what's thought

297
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,430
of as his ideal aspect.

298
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,640
So this is the idea of how
he would actually like to
feel if he had his choice,

299
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,270
what would be his ideal emotional self.
And what's really interesting as well,

300
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,300
actual effect on the left is thought to
be shaped more by biological forces like

301
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:44,100
temperament or genetics ideal.

302
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:48,720
An effect on the right is instead
thought to be shaped more by culture.

303
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,440
So it includes like meaning thoughts,
beliefs,

304
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:57,650
values and practices that are promoted
within a particular cultural context that

305
00:19:57,841 --> 00:20:02,841
shape the kinds of emotions one ought
to feel or one should try to strive to

306
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:05,340
feel.
And this,

307
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:10,610
if you think about just how exactly
culture exerts an influence on the sort of

308
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:13,860
ideal aspect or an effect valuation,

309
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:17,610
the emotions you value and want to feel,
you can think of it this way.

310
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,020
So there's a grid here which has been
referred to as the effect of circumplex.

311
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,580
And what you can see here is um,

312
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,500
on one dimension we have negative
to positive sort of left to right.

313
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:30,330
So this is a valence dimension.

314
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,490
And by contrast you can see on the top
to bottom as a more sort of arousal or

315
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:37,500
activation dimension.
Okay.

316
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,100
So this depicts a landscape of emotions
that we talked about earlier in the

317
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:45,300
course when we were thinking about two
different perspectives to conceptualizing

318
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:48,370
emotion and looking at sort of approaches.

319
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,410
So it's something we've talked about here.

320
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,890
How might we suspect culture would
place a premium or on different kinds of

321
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:01,430
emotions? So when we think of
more Western cultures like the US,

322
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,710
what kind of emotions do we think
that people ideally want to feel?

323
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,260
What is their ideal aspect?

324
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,640
So this is work done by Jeannie side
that's found that western culture is

325
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:13,780
commonly report.

326
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,470
When you ask them what is the kind of
emotion or affect you want to feel,

327
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,280
they say they want to feel these
high arousal, positive emotions,

328
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,740
what she calls hap emotions.

329
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,630
So these include things like feeling
enthusiastic, elated and excited.

330
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,150
This is where most of
us want to go towards.

331
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,250
Now this is in stark contrast with
more eastern cultures by contrast,

332
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,170
who report wanting to strive towards
what's called these low arousal positive

333
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:44,050
emotions or lap emotions so to speak.

334
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,160
So they're gravitating more
towards an ideal aspect of state,

335
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:53,170
of feeling relaxed,
calm and peaceful.

336
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,700
So what's really interesting here is that
we have different cultural values that

337
00:21:57,701 --> 00:22:00,130
are sort of pushing us
in different directions,

338
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,150
both towards feeling more positive
emotion. But on the one hand,

339
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:06,490
one is very high and active and excited.

340
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,870
Kind of this go getter attitude in a
western culture and the other and eastern

341
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,110
cultures is really more
focused on obtaining serenity,

342
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,330
equanimity and calmness.

343
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,900
And so this is some of the work
that Jeannie size really pioneered.

344
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,560
And we'll speak with her more later
today and the expert in motion, uh,

345
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,720
interview series.
So here,

346
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,700
here's a fifth example of just how many
ways we can see that culture is shaping

347
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:31,534
emotion.

348
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,690
So we see that culture also influences
which emotions are emphasized or talked

349
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:40,600
about within a given, uh, cultural
groups. So in other words,

350
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,690
which emotions are highly regarded,

351
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:47,830
sort of what are the kinds of emotions
that seem to capture our attention and

352
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:52,831
that are represented in our
everyday language here the
distinction is often made

353
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:54,190
between two things,

354
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,750
hyper cognizant emotions
and Hypo Cognizin emotions.

355
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,280
So as you can see here,

356
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,460
hyper cognizant emotions are those that
are highly emphasized in a culture.

357
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,900
They become objects of discussion and
they have this kind of elaborate cognitive

358
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:14,800
structure usually seen within
these rich vocabularies.

359
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:19,801
We have a lot of words that sort of orbit
around these emotions that we really

360
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,750
highly emphasize in.

361
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:25,900
And really seem to be almost sort of
obsessed with in a way as a culture.

362
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,310
By contrast,

363
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:32,110
these hypo cognized emotions are
relatively underemphasized within a given

364
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:35,620
society and they have a really
limited cognitive structure.

365
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,100
So we see very few words that
represent these emotions.

366
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,150
So let me walk you through some examples
of what are culturally distinct,

367
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:47,370
hyper and Hypo cognitivist. So, um,

368
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,680
hyper cognates, an emotion
within Western cultures is love.

369
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,890
We talk a lot about love,
um,

370
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,410
not only our own everyday love, but we
have these romanticized kind of, you know,

371
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:04,420
novels with these picture best images
that are sort of burned in our minds and a

372
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:09,470
lot of really trashy celebrity pop culture
is also about love. Who's together,

373
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:12,680
who's breaking up, who cheated on who. Um,

374
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,480
so we just talk a lot about this and we
also have these notions of love at first

375
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:22,340
sight. You know, this kind of love
that turns your world upside down. Um,

376
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:24,470
and we also talk a lot
about other kinds of love.

377
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:28,370
This kind of slow growing
love that takes time, uh,

378
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,580
is deep and strong and can
happen with many people.

379
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,820
We really seem to be obsessed
with love in western cultures.

380
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,700
Um, by contrast, um,

381
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:43,680
when we think of what our
hypo cognized emotions are,

382
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,130
the to Haitians here, interestingly,
the hypo and emotion for them,

383
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,380
uh, is sadness. They have no
linguistic concept of sadness.

384
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,370
They tend to think of sadness
more as a physical condition,

385
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,570
then an emotional state. So you don't
see it represented in a lot of, you know,

386
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,570
images in their culture.
You don't see it highly talked about,

387
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:10,571
you don't see these kind of elaborate
or ritualistic stories about sadness the

388
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:12,530
way that Westerners do about love.

389
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,220
So we've talked about hyper and Hypo
cognized emotions and who I want to

390
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:23,990
conclude with the sixth example or way
in which culture may shape emotion.

391
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,920
So we talked a little bit about the kinds
of emotions that are frequently spoken

392
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:30,460
about love and sadness.
Um,

393
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,850
but culture not only influences which
kinds of emotions get attention,

394
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,470
but it also shapes our
very language of emotion.

395
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:43,310
So let me explain what I mean
here. So we know, for example,

396
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:47,540
that there's culture specific
emotion words. So, for example,

397
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:50,390
in Japan they have this particular word,
a my,

398
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:55,690
that refers to this indulgent feeling of
dependency sort of akin to what a child

399
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,110
might feel for its mother.

400
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,610
And these are feelings of dependency that
are highly valued within this cultural

401
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:05,840
contexts. Um, that's a very sort of
interdependent and collectivistic.

402
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,430
So this is a word that you see in Japanese
cultures that we just don't have in

403
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:15,290
westernized cultures that are not as
interested in or sort of whose values

404
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:19,850
aren't sort of orbiting around depending
on and being intertwined with others.

405
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,600
Instead, we have this more autonomous
or individualistic culture.

406
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:28,870
So these are specific emotion words that
are highly emphasizing and created by

407
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:33,950
the cultural contexts. Um, another
example is shot in Freud, uh,

408
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:34,821
from Germany.

409
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:38,930
Some of you may be familiar with this
and at the idea of sort of experiencing

410
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,750
pleasure at another person's expense.

411
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,880
We don't have a word for this
exactly in our own culture. Um,

412
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,090
this is something that's really
generated by, uh, you know,

413
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,460
German culture specifically. Though we
may be familiar with it and understand it,

414
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,280
we don't have a specific
word for it per se.

415
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,820
And then there's this other interesting
emotion and the Czech Republic, um,

416
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,420
which is emotion,
the tossed.

417
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:08,421
And this is an emotion that is defined
as torment caused by the sudden insight

418
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:12,000
into one's own miserable self.

419
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:16,400
So I don't know if you can
think of a word like this, uh,

420
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,170
in your own sort of English vocabulary.

421
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,980
But this is thought to be a unique
type of emotional experience, again,

422
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,620
influenced by one particular culture.

423
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,210
So the overarching point here is that
culture not only shapes the kinds of

424
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:34,950
emotions we value the kinds of emotions
we place a high premium on the kinds of

425
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:38,130
appraisals or meanings we
give emotional situations.

426
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:42,930
But it can even influence the very
nature of the language and the words that

427
00:27:42,931 --> 00:27:47,931
we're using to express emotions such
that different cultures in fact have

428
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:49,740
different emotional words.

429
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,070
And you may argue though
it's controversial for some,

430
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,760
but they may actually have very different
emotional lives altogether given that

431
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:59,850
they think about emotions,
they talk about emotions differently,

432
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:04,650
and they even have distinct types of
emotional words that some cultures don't

433
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:05,484
have.

434
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,940
So I want to talk a little now about
this idea of culture specific absences.

435
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:17,181
So James Russell did this very interesting
study where he reviewed ethnography

436
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:20,580
is describing everyday
lives and other cultures.

437
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:26,060
And here he found that some cultures
simply have no words for certain emotions.

438
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,501
Um,

439
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:31,500
so he talked about this in
terms of culture specific
absences of certain emotion

440
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:36,270
words. So you can see a few examples
here that I've highlighted. For example,

441
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:41,690
it seems that there may be no sort of
words for disgust in Polish cultures.

442
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,140
We talked a little bit about the Hypo
Cognos emotions of sadness into Haitian

443
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:50,520
cultures, but they also
don't have specific words for
feelings of guilt as well.

444
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,080
What's interesting that
I find here is that, uh,

445
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:00,140
in Tibetan culture is there's actually
no particular word that designates or

446
00:29:00,511 --> 00:29:04,030
kind of picks out this
concept of even emotion.

447
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,080
So what this course that you're taking
is about that focuses on human emotion.

448
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,820
They don't even have a word to describe
that specifically or pick that out.

449
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,140
Um,

450
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,640
and finally you can see that a Indonesian
cultures don't really have words for

451
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:23,850
embarrassment. Something we'll
talk about later on in the course.

452
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,730
So not only are there certain specific
unique emotion words that, uh,

453
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:33,540
occur in certain cultures,
but there's also an absence
of other emotion words, um,

454
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,531
and different cultures.

455
00:29:34,531 --> 00:29:39,531
So we really see a lot of variation in
the language of emotion and our ideas of

456
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:44,811
which emotions exist and occur and
that we talk about in our everyday

457
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:50,200
experiences.
So what's really important here though,

458
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:54,750
we've talked a lot about language
and how language can shape, um,

459
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,240
the kinds of emotions we talk
about on a frequent basis.

460
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,230
How language can shape which emotion
words we have in the first place,

461
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,310
and how language can also shape the
absence of certain emotion words in our

462
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:07,390
everyday dialect.

463
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,780
But what's really important here is
to make sure that you understand that

464
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:18,751
language is separate from the actual
subjective experience of emotion.

465
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,960
So we don't want to make the inference
that language is the same thing as

466
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:24,970
emotion experience.
Um,

467
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,960
so just to keep in mind here that
language is not equal to experience,

468
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,130
but what language does provide us some
insight and is the way that people

469
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:38,131
cognitively represent or sort of
transmit their understanding or ideas of

470
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:39,910
emotion experience.

471
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:43,780
But we need to be careful not to
assume then that certain cultures don't

472
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:47,080
experience, you know, embarrassment
for example, or sadness.

473
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,580
It's just simply something that's not
represented in their sort of current,

474
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,640
uh, you know, dialect or way
that they speak about emotion.

475
00:30:55,641 --> 00:31:00,010
So that's just an important caveat that
you want to make sure to sort of keep in

476
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:03,040
the background as you think about some
of these findings that relate to the way

477
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,620
that culture shapes emotional language.

478
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,320
So now in our roadmap,

479
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:12,730
I want to just conclude with this
broad question of nature or nurture.

480
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:17,830
So we spend a lot of time in our earlier
lectures talking at length about just

481
00:31:17,831 --> 00:31:22,831
how we are these evolutionary kind of or
originated species that were built with

482
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:28,330
hardwired emotions like fear,
disgust, anger, sadness.

483
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:28,511
You know,

484
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:32,860
that these are really built to sort of
deal with these recurrent evolutionary

485
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:34,030
situations.
You know,

486
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:38,470
seeing a snake or seeing a disgusting
substance that we need to have these

487
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:43,060
emotions built in us to help us survive
and help us reach our evolutionary goals.

488
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,710
At the same time,

489
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:49,180
we spent some time today to talking
about how it's not quite that simple that

490
00:31:49,181 --> 00:31:53,800
we're not simply the product of our
more biological or evolutionary past,

491
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:59,050
that the particular culture we grow
up in shapes the way we interpret

492
00:31:59,141 --> 00:32:02,200
situations.
It could just be a body of fish swimming,

493
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:04,000
do does the fish look angry or sad?

494
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,240
It could be the words we
use to represent emotion.

495
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,830
It also influences the kinds of emotions
we want to feel or those that we place

496
00:32:11,831 --> 00:32:14,740
a high degree of value or premium on.

497
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,820
So then how do we answer
this question of emotion?

498
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:23,380
Is it something that's more a product
of nature or more product of nurture?

499
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,750
And here what I wanted to picture with
these circles is that bottom line,

500
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:34,090
no surprise to most of you. I don't think
we can pick either nature or nurture,

501
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:38,380
right? Emotions are multifaceted
and they have multiple causes.

502
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:43,670
These causes can include evolution,
biology, individual development,

503
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,470
situational factors,

504
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:48,920
one's own temperament or
personality as well as culture,

505
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:50,390
which we talked a bit about today.

506
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,240
And what we need to think about carefully
is how these different sort of, uh,

507
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,460
causes of emotion overlap and intersect
to sort of give rise to the unique

508
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:05,710
emotions that we all feel, that
sort of makeup who we are. Um,

509
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,640
and sort of tease apart the different
contributions that each of these puzzle

510
00:33:10,641 --> 00:33:12,980
pieces I think of, uh, you know,

511
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:18,350
sort of fit and how they put together
to make up each individual person.

512
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,530
So it's neither a nature or nurture.

513
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:27,110
And now I want to conclude
with our takeaway questions.

514
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,250
So for this brief module
today on culture and emotion,

515
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,180
okay,

516
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,500
the first question that you should be
able to answer and to kind of take home

517
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:41,501
from what we've spoken about today
is what is culture and what are,

518
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:46,070
or were the two main
competing perspectives of the
role of culture on emotion

519
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,420
that we discussed today?

520
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,540
Yeah.

521
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,373
Second,

522
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:54,210
I'd like you to name and describe at
least five though we talked about actually

523
00:33:54,211 --> 00:33:58,030
six different sources of
cultural variation on emotion.

524
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:03,050
So what are some of the examples and
empirical data that suggest that there is

525
00:34:03,211 --> 00:34:07,680
an important role that culture plays
in shaping our emotional experience,

526
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,950
expression and language for emotion.

527
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,370
Okay.

528
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,330
And finally,

529
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,240
yeah,

530
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,470
what are hyper cognizant
and Hypo cognized emotions.

531
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,440
So you should be able to define what
each of these two are and you should be

532
00:34:22,441 --> 00:34:25,540
able to give an illustrative examples,
uh,

533
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:30,330
to sort of tease apart what these two
different categories of emotions are.

534
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,310
And now I want to conclude with
our expert interview. And again,

535
00:34:36,311 --> 00:34:39,640
this is part of our broader experts
and emotion interview series.

536
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,240
Okay.

537
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,580
For today we have the honor of
speaking with Dr Jeannie Psi, um,

538
00:34:45,581 --> 00:34:50,581
about the question regarding to what
extent our emotions culturally shaped Dr

539
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:55,490
Sigh received her phd in
clinical psychology from
the University of California

540
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:59,840
Berkeley and did her clinical internship
and post doctoral fellowship in

541
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:03,800
minority mental health at the
University of California San Francisco.

542
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,720
She's currently an associate professor
of psychology at Stanford University and

543
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:10,910
director of the culture and emotion lab.

544
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:16,220
Dr [inaudible] research focuses on how
cultural ideas and practices shape our

545
00:35:16,221 --> 00:35:20,900
feelings, identities, and even
mental health. She's highly regarded,

546
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:25,310
especially for her work that we
discussed today on asset valuation across

547
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:28,520
cultures.
She's received numerous awards,

548
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,810
including a young investor investigator
award from the National Alliance for

549
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:34,820
research on schizophrenia and depression,

550
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:40,420
an early career award for contributions
from the Asian American Psychological

551
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:45,300
Association and the Dean's Award for
distinguished teaching from Stanford

552
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:45,810
University.

553
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:50,700
So I now turn to a very special experts
and emotion interview with Doctor

554
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:51,480
Jeannie Sy.
