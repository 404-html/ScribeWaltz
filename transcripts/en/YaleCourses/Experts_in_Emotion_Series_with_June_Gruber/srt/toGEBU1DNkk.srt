00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,390
Hello, welcome back to human emotion. Um,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,810
today we'll be returning to a
discussion of morality and emotions.

3
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:11,811
So what role can emotion actually
play in making us moral creatures?

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,130
So how can it influence whether we
behave good or whether we behave bad?

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,560
And how much do emotions
actually influence our
decisions of what might be right

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,910
from what might be wrong?

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,260
And then how much in turn can
influence our own moral behavior?

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,420
Can it shape whether we act virtuous
and good or act wrong or bad?

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,130
So this is where we're going
to turn to questions such as,

10
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:41,970
can emotions actually underlie
morally good behavior?

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,680
Can emotions actually make us good
people or good citizens of the planet?

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,810
By contrast, can emotions also make
us bad as well? So today though,

13
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:55,320
we're going to focus on the ways in
which emotions may actually make us good.

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,130
So this is our second part in
understanding emotion and morality.

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,500
So here we're going to
talk about the good side.

16
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:05,220
So we're going to talk about
feelings of compassion, of elevation,

17
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:06,210
and of gratitude,

18
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,450
and what way they may actually shape
morally virtuous or good behavior.

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,510
So in other words,

20
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:17,460
this is the lighter side of
emotion and morality particular,

21
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:19,710
we're going to cover our
roadmap today as follows.

22
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:21,150
We're going to start with compassion,

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,560
turn to gratitude and elevation and
conclude with our takeaway questions and

24
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:26,580
expert interview.

25
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,270
So let's first start with this emotion
that we've probably all felt but maybe

26
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:37,140
never thought about. How it might actually
shape our own moral, the good behavior,

27
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,450
which is this emotion of compassion.

28
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,130
And if we were turned to our broader
moral emotion families we saw in our last

29
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:44,910
lecture,

30
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,570
we'll see that compassion falls in
what's called the two smaller families of

31
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:50,850
moral emotions outlined by Jonathan Heit.

32
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,890
Now he said that compassion is what's
called an other suffering emotion.

33
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,130
So remember that the core feature of
moral emotions included prosocial or

34
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:04,500
benevolent action tendencies.
And it was,

35
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:07,380
we know from discussing earlier in class,
um,

36
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:11,040
emotions motivate certain kinds
of behavioral action tendencies.

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,020
Originally we talked about them in terms
of flying or fighting or fleeing or

38
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:19,290
fighting. But when we get
to the moral emotions here,

39
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:23,370
we're going to see action tendencies
that are more intended towards benefiting

40
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:27,360
other people. And upholding
the social order. So here,

41
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:32,340
let's start with this other suffering
class of emotions called compassion.

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,390
So this is the oldest
class of moral emotions,

43
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:39,660
originally referred to as sympathy.
And also compassion.

44
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,490
And early scholars wrote about compassion
as the foundation or backbone of human

45
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:47,850
reality, including Adam Smith. He said,

46
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:52,851
when we see a stroke aimed and just ready
to fall upon the leg or arm of another

47
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:54,084
person,

48
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,380
we naturally shrink back and draw
back our own leg or our own arm.

49
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,910
And when it does fall,

50
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,860
we feel it in some measure and are
hurt by it as well as the sufferer.

51
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,010
So as you can see,
an Adam Smith's early observations,

52
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,220
compassion is really defined as being
moved by another suffering or a deep

53
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:20,041
feeling and understanding of the misery
or suffering and and of another person.

54
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:25,240
And having this sort of concomitant
desire to try to alleviate suffering in

55
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:27,550
someone,
to try to help them feel better.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,320
So compassion is really interesting
too because it was also talked about,

57
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,850
um, in early evolutionary theories,
as you can see here by Darwin.

58
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,540
So he thought that compassion,
which he called sympathy,

59
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,920
was associated with natural selection,
survival of the fittest,

60
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:48,370
and thought that compassion was
actually one of our strongest instincts.

61
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,360
So he argued that it has been increased
through natural selection over time,

62
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,690
and that those communities which
had the greatest number of the most

63
00:03:55,691 --> 00:04:00,070
compassionate or sympathetic people
would flourish best and rear the greatest

64
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:01,180
number of offspring.

65
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,320
So he said that just hear that sympathy
will have increased through natural

66
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:07,480
selection for those communities,

67
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:11,320
which included the greatest member
of the most sympathetic members would

68
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:14,920
flourish best and rear the
greatest number of offspring.

69
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,780
So not only is compassion seem to be some
of the most central moral backbone of

70
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:20,614
who we are,

71
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,180
Darwin here even argued that it's what
promoted our longterm survival and was

72
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,690
naturally selected for over
the course of evolution.

73
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:33,010
So we've been selected to be
compassionate species. He would argue.

74
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,030
So compassion's
interesting because indeed,

75
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,430
as you can see here in all these pictures,

76
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,530
we've seen a variety of humanitarian
crises in recent years such as Hurricane

77
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,110
Katrina or the major earthquake in Haiti.

78
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,310
And compassion doesn't just drive us
to help people who are related to us,

79
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,240
but often drives us to
help complete strangers.

80
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:59,440
And people we may have never even met.
So for this reason,

81
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:03,970
when we think of kind of evolutionary
analyses of compassion and pro social

82
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:08,110
behavior, it can be sort of difficult
or tricky to explain, right?

83
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:10,360
Because when we act for
the benefit of others,

84
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,620
it's often that a great cost or maybe
even risks to our own selfish wellbeing.

85
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,920
So why will we be born as
these compassionate beings
moved to try to help people

86
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,540
that we don't even know
that live thousands of miles
away to help them at our

87
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,270
own selfish cost of time,
of resources,

88
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:33,271
of energy as it because we are truly an
innately compassionate human beings that

89
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:37,660
care about the broader, greater,
greater social order of humanity.

90
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,610
So I think we want to first start
then when we think about how powerful

91
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:46,690
compassion is and how much it's been
discussed as the central feature of what

92
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:51,430
makes us human by first taking a
step back and asking ourselves, well,

93
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:53,920
what is compassion in the first place?

94
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,080
So compassion is defined as follows,

95
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,850
the experience of feelings,

96
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,880
chiefly emotions similar in kind to
those expressed by or known to exist in

97
00:06:05,881 --> 00:06:06,870
another person.

98
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,590
It sets aside our own personality and
moves us to partake of the pleasure or

99
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:17,640
pain,
the happiness or misery of other people.

100
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,263
Okay.

101
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,470
So when we think about our analysis we've
done with many emotions in this course

102
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,010
and break it up in terms of
an illicit or action tendency,

103
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,930
compassion has really evolved out
of this mammalian attachment system.

104
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:32,951
And as such,

105
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:37,951
it is elicited by perceiving distress
or suffering in another individual.

106
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,130
This need not be just our own kin.
It need not even be just humans.

107
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,010
As you can see here. We also may feel
it for other animals such as dogs, um,

108
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,150
and other pets in our lives.

109
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,900
And the action tendency that's really
important is when we proceed this distress

110
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:54,460
or suffering and other people,

111
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:59,670
we are motivated to act pro socially to
help them to comfort them or alleviate

112
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:00,754
their suffering.

113
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,200
So compassion has this really prosocial
orientation to try to remedy the

114
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:07,510
suffering of others at first sight of it.

115
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,350
Okay?

116
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,080
So we know 'em and work by Daniel Batson.

117
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:16,340
As you can see here that compassion and
related feelings of empathy really take

118
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:20,060
us outside of ourselves and
orient us towards other people.

119
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,130
So in Daniel Batson's work,

120
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:27,131
he asked participants to feel empathy
and or he asked them to just be objective

121
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,130
and found that when people
are asked to feel empathy,

122
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,840
which is related to compassion,

123
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,040
that it actually led to greater concern
for other people and importantly

124
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:41,000
motivated more helping or pro
social behavioral tendencies.

125
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,710
So it not only turns our
attention outwards but then
motivates us to act in ways

126
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,080
that assist or aid other people.

127
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:49,860
Okay.

128
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,700
Importantly, compassion is something
that we seem to almost be born with,

129
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:58,440
right Darwin and say we were naturally
selected or to have the system in us from

130
00:07:58,441 --> 00:07:59,274
very young.

131
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,020
So you see research showing that from
birth to 14 months in infants that they

132
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:07,650
will react with distress
to cries of other infants,

133
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:12,150
perhaps showing compassion for distress
of other individuals around their same

134
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:14,760
age.
And then after the first year of life,

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
this distress of others can actually
then lead them to engage in helping

136
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:23,490
behaviors. So they first pick
up on distress and mimic it.

137
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,910
And then later on in life,
even just after one year of age,

138
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,990
this distress that they see admitted and
others actually motivates them to try

139
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:34,560
to go alleviate suffering and
to help others. So indeed,

140
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:38,580
it does seem to be that were profoundly
compassionate beings and that this is

141
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:42,120
something that emerges very,
very early on in life for us.

142
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,180
We also see, uh, compassion
across species. So for example,

143
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,540
one study looked at on a distressed
albino rat who was suspended in mid air as

144
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:55,410
you can see here on right.

145
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,570
And what they found is that another fellow
rat would actually make the effort to

146
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:03,570
press the lever to lower
this rat to the ground.

147
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,710
So there's a sense in which they saw
even albino rats who see another distress

148
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:12,520
rat will be motivated to
engage in behavior to help
that individual and relieve

149
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,570
or alleviate their suffering.
Similarly,

150
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:17,640
we also see this in nonhuman primates.

151
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:22,080
So rhesus monkeys will also press
a bar to receive a food reward,

152
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,380
large or small. The large
food reward, however,

153
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:29,400
causes electric shocks for another monkey.
So upon realizing this,

154
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:34,401
most monkeys will forego a larger food
reward and stop pressing the bar in order

155
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:38,600
to alleviate the distress of the,
uh,

156
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,050
electrically shocked McGee.

157
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,110
So they're not only trying to
alleviate the distress of a muggy,

158
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,970
but they'll forgo their own
personal concerns for food. Right?

159
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,330
So it seems that humans and other
species are really built to try to Ha,

160
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,130
you know, be a compassionate and
alleviate the suffering of others.

161
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,690
So we've talked about compassion and
now I want to turn to gratitude and

162
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:01,530
elevation.

163
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,160
So this is our final four cell box here
where we're going to conclude with this

164
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,500
final,
smaller family of moral emotions,

165
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,850
which are called the other praising moral
emotions like gratitude and elevation,

166
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,920
again,
as outlined by Jonathan Height.

167
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,520
So when we think of
gratitude and elevation,

168
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,200
it seems that they may represent this
sort of brighter side of moral emotions.

169
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:29,910
So we know that people are sensitive
to good deeds and moral exemplars,

170
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,890
and these immoral emotions,

171
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:36,891
gratitude and elevation are thought to
be products of good or virtuous acts by

172
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:41,250
other people. You can see here helping
people, you know, in a soup kitchen,

173
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:45,150
helping suffering animals and helping
small children in need of aid.

174
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,570
So first that we think about gratitude,
again,

175
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:50,490
using this kind of functional analysis,

176
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:54,930
we see that gratitude is elicited by a
perception that another person has done a

177
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:59,250
good deed for yourself, whether it's
intentional or voluntary, right?

178
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:00,870
Someone's done something good for you.

179
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,900
This leads you to feel
grateful or gratitude for them.

180
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,230
So it's defined as a state
of being grateful, warm,

181
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:09,780
and friendly towards some benefactor.

182
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,980
And gratitude is thought to be this
important human strength as well, right?

183
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,460
It contributes to personal wellbeing,
civic engagement,

184
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:20,130
and even spiritual satisfaction.
Um,

185
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,000
and the action tendency then associated
with gratitude has this what they call

186
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:25,290
moral motive.

187
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,040
So it makes people act more
pro socially and help others.

188
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,250
So when you feel grateful for
something someone has done to you,

189
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,080
you're more likely than to go and sort
of pay it forward by doing something good

190
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:39,550
to someone else. So, not surprisingly,

191
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,230
a whole host of psychological
interventions under this broad umbrella of

192
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,460
positive psychology have actually
created and cultivated what they call

193
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:52,461
gratitude interventions to try to elicit
feelings of daily gratitude and people

194
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,100
in to not only have them appreciate the
benefactors are people that have done

195
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:57,934
good for them,

196
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,240
but in turn to motivate people to pay it
back and do good deeds towards others.

197
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,180
Okay.

198
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,990
And interestingly,
um,

199
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,030
there's been research showing
that gratitude not only
as good for other people

200
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,220
in terms of promoting pro social behavior,

201
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,940
but gratitude in and of itself
may actually be healthy for us.

202
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:22,270
So Michael McCullough did a study where
he showed that increased gratitude not

203
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:25,730
only benefits those
who are the recipients,

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,220
but that the more you feel gratitude,

205
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:30,620
so the more you're feeling
grateful on a daily basis,

206
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,800
it actually enhances your
resilience to stressors.

207
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,510
Your physical health improves as
well as your overall quality of life.

208
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,460
So feeling grateful is it really good for
you? And so, as we touched on earlier,

209
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:48,461
this has led to a really
prominent and powerful focus.

210
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,573
Um,

211
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,380
some people even call it an explosion of
these gratitude interventions that are

212
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:58,370
aimed to promote psychological
wellbeing alongside more traditional

213
00:12:58,371 --> 00:13:02,270
psychotherapies such as
cognitive behavioral therapy
or psychodynamic therapy.

214
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,010
These gratitude interventions really seem
to be playing a big role that has yet

215
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,460
been until recently been understudied.

216
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:15,380
Just the fact that gratitude can
actually promote all kinds of fantastic

217
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:18,080
physical and emotional
and social benefits.

218
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,220
Yeah.

219
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,100
So when we think about gratitude
and elevation, so again,

220
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:26,800
this is in this what's called other
praising family. Um, what we saw here,

221
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,330
we just talked about gratitude.
So you know,

222
00:13:29,331 --> 00:13:32,840
the perception that another person has
done a good deed and motivates this kind

223
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:36,560
of moral motive or more
prosocial action tendency. Um,

224
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,580
but there's also this emotion of
elevation. So this is a really mysterious,

225
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:45,350
really exciting, um, and really
kind of all inspiring state.

226
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,370
So elevation has also been
called awe, the awe, awe,

227
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,680
and it's experienced,
um,

228
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,980
in response to being around things
that seem larger than the self,

229
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,440
almost this larger than life phenomena.

230
00:13:57,441 --> 00:14:01,490
So you might remember a time
you felt really elevated or awe,

231
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,700
all inspired when you saw
something. Absolutely beautiful. Um,

232
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,340
maybe it was a work of art in a museum.

233
00:14:07,341 --> 00:14:10,400
Maybe you went on a hike in nature and
you are at the top of the mountains

234
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:12,200
looking out over the world.
Um,

235
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,180
or maybe you saw someone who had just
exceptional actions or abilities.

236
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,750
Um, someone you really revered,
someone you really respected.

237
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,430
And by seeing people who saw or,

238
00:14:23,431 --> 00:14:26,420
or things in the environment
that are really larger than life,

239
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,920
what it motivates you to do is to
become a better person yourself.

240
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,750
To try to take a step up towards being
something that's larger than your current

241
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:36,584
self.

242
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,033
Okay?

243
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,000
And Jonathan Heit talked
about the state of elevation,

244
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,750
which he recalled as this
manifestation of humanity,

245
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,570
humanity's higher or better nature.

246
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,940
So when people experience elevation,

247
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:54,020
they report these pleasant
and even almost like tingling,

248
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,580
goosebumps, sensations. Um,

249
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,790
and what it does that's really interesting
is that it turns your attention away

250
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:06,791
from the self towards becoming a better
person and towards helping other people,

251
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,120
right?

252
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,950
So elevation is this positive emotion
that's elicited when you observe other

253
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:17,870
people or other parts of your external
world that are particularly virtuous,

254
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,190
commendable, or maybe even
spiritually magnificent in some way.

255
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,660
So it's almost experiencing something
just absolutely amazing and larger than

256
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:27,620
life itself.

257
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,010
Okay.

258
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,640
Some of these discussions we've had
today about moral emotions and including

259
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,400
discussions of law.
I'm very interested in reading further.

260
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:40,960
I highly recommend this book by Dacher
Keltner at UC Berkeley called born to be

261
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:41,321
good.

262
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:45,310
The science of a meaningful life in which
he talks about all these ways in which

263
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,630
not only are we innately born to be
good people to act compassionately,

264
00:15:49,631 --> 00:15:51,880
to experience elevation and gratitude,

265
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:56,140
but what are the ways that we
may continue to try to, you know,

266
00:15:56,141 --> 00:16:00,280
leverage our own dispositions to
continue to cultivate a better and more

267
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:03,650
meaningful life as we continue forward.
Um,

268
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,700
if you're also interested in reading,
um,

269
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,730
Dacher Keltner is also the founder of
the greater good science center at UC

270
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,840
Berkeley.
You can see here,

271
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:15,841
greater good.berkeley.edu and hear what
you can see as uptodate discussions of

272
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:20,170
scientific events,
community events that are occurring,

273
00:16:20,171 --> 00:16:21,450
such as you can see here,

274
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,570
different conferences that try to talk
about mindfulness and compassion, um,

275
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,710
as well as a whole host of other
ways to really try to understand and

276
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:34,270
participate in what they
called the science of a
meaningful and morally virtuous

277
00:16:34,271 --> 00:16:37,690
life. Similarly, at Stanford University,

278
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:40,780
they've recently founded the
center for compassion and altruism,

279
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:42,070
research and education.

280
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,340
So it's CC care.stanford.edu if you're
interested in really trying to understand

281
00:16:47,771 --> 00:16:49,030
how can we,
uh,

282
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,530
conduct research to better understand
compassion and altruism and what are

283
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:57,980
different ways to educate the world, both
students and the general community, um,

284
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,400
to be a more compassionate society.

285
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,110
Okay.

286
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,210
And in closing,
as Jonathan Heit said,

287
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,470
morality is therefore like the temple
on the hill of our human nature.

288
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,380
It is our most sacred attribute,

289
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:16,590
a trait that is often said to separate
us from other animals and bring us closer

290
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:21,100
to God. So something's really
special about this lighter,

291
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:22,750
virtuous side of morality.

292
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:27,580
It's what makes us human and may actually
help bring us to a more elevated place

293
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,780
and our own existence
here on the planet earth.

294
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,493
Um,

295
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,320
and with that we will turn next week
to talk a little bit about in our third

296
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:40,240
module on emotion and morality.

297
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,980
What does it look like in
certain individuals who may
lack these fundamentally

298
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:49,030
virtuous emotions such as
compassion and empathy? Right?

299
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,940
So these emotions are just so critically
important because when we seem to have

300
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:55,050
an absence of them,

301
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,950
we can see some people performing what
my order considered some of the greatest

302
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:02,070
evils possible.
So here we can see Ted Bundy,

303
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:06,300
who many would argue really had
a profound lack of compassion,

304
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:10,890
empathy when describing some of his
heinous act say, you know, I mean,

305
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,480
there's just so many people.

306
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,000
So we'll have Dr Joshua Buckholtz from
Harvard University speak with us more as

307
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:20,730
we think about not only the
lighter side of morality,

308
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:24,840
but what happens when these
morally virtuous emotions
go awry and we delve into

309
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:29,640
the darker side of morality and emotion.
So with that,

310
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,910
I want to now conclude with our takeaway
questions from our second module on

311
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,970
emotion and morality.
Looking at the lighter or good side.

312
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,950
So the first question asks,
how was compassionate moral emotion?

313
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,880
What are its illicit,
hers and Associated Action Tendencies?

314
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,650
How is gratitude a moral emotion and what
are its illicit bitters and associated

315
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:53,610
action tendencies?
And similarly for elevation,

316
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,860
how is it in a moral emotion?
And again,

317
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,400
what I really want you to have here as
a sense of how are these emotions truly

318
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:03,690
moral and what trigger them and what
behavioral tendencies follow from them.

319
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,490
And with that we'll turn to our expert
interview as part of the experts and

320
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:10,110
emotion interview series.

321
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,950
Today we'll be speaking with doctor Jamil
Zaki on empathy and emotion doctors.

322
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:21,360
Aki is an assistant professor of
psychology at Stanford University.

323
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,680
His research examines the neural basis
of social cognition and behavior.

324
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,761
In other words,

325
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:31,140
how do people come to understand each
other and decide to behave towards each

326
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:35,880
other? So this work spans a
number of domains, including
empathy, theory of mind,

327
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,820
social influence, and pro
social behavior. Doctors, Zach,

328
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:44,520
he received his BA in
cognitive neuroscience from
Boston University and his phd

329
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:46,830
in psychology from Columbia University,

330
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,930
after which she conducted postdoctoral
research on altruism and prosocial

331
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,850
behavior at the Harvard
Center for Brain Science.

332
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,020
He's received research and teaching awards
from the Society for personality and

333
00:19:58,021 --> 00:20:01,170
Social Psychology,
the cognitive neuroscience society,

334
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,130
the Society for neuroscience,
the American psychological association,

335
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,650
the association for Psychological Science,

336
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,410
autism speaks as well
as Harvard University.

337
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,490
So I now turn to a very special experts
in emotion interview with one of the

338
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:17,400
most, uh, empathic people that I know,

339
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,930
which is doctor Jamil Zaki speaking
with us on empathy and emotion.
