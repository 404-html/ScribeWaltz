1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,200
So today we'll be speaking
with Dr Jennifer Learner,

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,400
a professor of public
policy and management at the
Harvard Kennedy School of

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,020
Government on emotion and judgment.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,440
Dr Lerner is a professor of public policy
and management at the Harvard Kennedy

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:14,810
School of Government,

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,350
as well as the founder and former
director of the Harvard Laboratory for

7
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,980
decision science.
This interdisciplinary laboratory,

8
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:26,780
which she cofounded with two economists,
draws primarily on psychology, economics,

9
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:30,380
and neuroscience to study human
judgment and decision making.

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,550
Dr Lerner publishes her research
widely and scientific journals,

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,150
summaries of which appear in popular
print, such as the New York Times,

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,210
as well as broadcast media
such as good morning America.

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,020
She also serves on the editorial boards
for the Journal of Personality and

14
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:46,190
social psychology,

15
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,490
organizational behavior and human
decision processes and the Journal of

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,370
Behavioral Decision Research. She's
received numerous awards for her research,

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,990
including the presidential early career
award for scientists and engineers and

18
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:01,100
in a White House ceremony,

19
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:04,970
the National Science Foundation and the
president of the United States annually

20
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:09,320
confer this award as the highest national
honor for investigators in the early

21
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:11,810
stages of promising research careers.

22
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,430
So I now turn to our experts and emotion
interview on emotion and judgment with

23
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:17,660
Dr Jennifer Learner.

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,030
So welcome Jen. Thank you for
speaking with us today. Thank you.

25
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,650
So what I wanted to start out asking you
was just a little bit about what first

26
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:32,300
got you interested in emotion. Um,
where did it all begin for you? Okay,

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,720
so I hadn't had actually
intended to study emotion.

28
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:40,721
I was in graduate school
and it was working with bill
Tetlock is my advisor and

29
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:45,050
I was trying to study
more outweighed really,

30
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:50,051
I was interested in attitudes
and judgment and decision making.

31
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:54,920
We were looking at legal cases
trying to understand, um,

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:55,940
you know,

33
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,940
the psychology behind people's judgments
and we kept trying to prime moral

34
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,060
outrage in the lab.
And um,

35
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,310
so we were writing all of
these scenarios very serious,

36
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,370
been yet giving them to
subjects in the pilot tests,

37
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:18,371
came back with meager results and nobody
was outraged based on the things that

38
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,820
they were reading.
And what I discovered is,

39
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:27,821
is that they were to cognitive and I
went to see Bob Levenson also on the

40
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:31,490
faculty at Berkeley.
And I say,

41
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,990
I can't get these people to be
morally outraged. And he said, well,

42
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:39,820
that's because you need to study emotion.
Um,

43
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,720
unless you invoke emotion systems,
they're not,

44
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,260
not going to get a strong
response, more or less age, uh,

45
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,450
is in many ways viscerally mediated and
you've got to trigger these systems.

46
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:58,130
So it was just huge awakening for me.
And,

47
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,263
um,

48
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,000
it turns out that while I was in
Grad school at Berkeley psychology,

49
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,220
it was, um, you know, just kind
of a mecca. Uh, it still is,

50
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:11,650
it's even more so for emotion research.

51
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,570
And so I had wonderful
intellectual resources,

52
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,500
um,

53
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,880
a lot of great advice and that was
how I started studying emotion.

54
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:26,460
And then I realized emotion
is what I wanted to study. Um,

55
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,880
I just didn't know it.

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,270
And there you were a serendipitously
in one of the most fantastic emotion

57
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:36,500
research centers in the
country. Yes. Fantastic.

58
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,210
Yes. Bob Always gives people some of
the best career advice possible. Um,

59
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:45,620
I've been there too and he helps shape
everyone towards emotion, which is great.

60
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,670
Yes. So I wanted to ask
you about your research,

61
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:54,350
which really has pioneered
important discoveries in
our understanding of emotion

62
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:55,790
and how it relates to judgements.

63
00:03:55,791 --> 00:04:00,620
So you are widely known for developing
this really exciting and novel framework

64
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:05,150
to understand how and why emotions
influenced judgment and decision making,

65
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:07,550
which you referred to as the
appraisal tendency framework.

66
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
And I wondered if you could share a
little bit about what you see as the core

67
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:13,130
principles of this framework.

68
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,260
Sure. Well, um,

69
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,510
the most important core principle is
that specific emotions can be related to

70
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:27,681
specific judgment and decision making
outcomes in predictable lawful ways.

71
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,680
And the key to making those correct
predictions is to understanding the

72
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:40,470
underlying structure of any given emotion.
So,

73
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,390
um,
most importantly,

74
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:45,540
we have looked at the cognitive
structure of different emotions.

75
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,990
And what we've predicted and found
is that the cognitive structure in

76
00:04:53,371 --> 00:04:55,020
particular,
the appraisal structure,

77
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:58,770
so some emotions are high and
appraisals of certainty. For example,

78
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,170
anger is a prime example of that.

79
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,980
That sense of certainty associated with
the active emotional state carries over

80
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,330
and influences how individuals
perceive new situations.

81
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,010
So if I'm feeling angry,

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm going to perceive more of a
sense of certainty in new situations.

83
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,590
And we call that process the
carryover of incidental emotion.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,760
I wondered if you could

85
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,640
say a little bit more about
this distinction between
integral versus Internet,

86
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,200
incidental influences
on emotion in judgments.

87
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,600
Sure. So, um,

88
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,670
we think of incidental emotion as
something like I just described.

89
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,500
You're driving into work,

90
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,090
somebody cuts you off to your car,
you're mad,

91
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,820
then you finally get into the office,

92
00:05:55,821 --> 00:06:00,821
he had the meeting that
involves a question of whether
you and your company are

93
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,920
going to take a particular risk.

94
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,550
So somebody hitting your car that morning
should have no bearing on the decision

95
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,130
for whether you're going to
take this risk. But in fact,

96
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,840
even though that emotion should be
incidental to the meeting decision,

97
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,370
it typically carries over and
influences it. And in the case of anger,

98
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,440
we know that when people are mad,

99
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,800
even if the source of the anger
should be normatively unrelated,

100
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,330
um,
it makes people more risk taking.

101
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,160
So you'd be more likely to take a risk
and your company than if you were in a

102
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:41,720
neutral state.

103
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,960
And certainly more likely than if you
were in a fearful state because fear is

104
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,850
associated with lack of certainty.

105
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:55,390
So what this framework does is it allows
us to link what's known about risk

106
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:58,340
perception and risk taking,

107
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,260
things like the role that certainty
and controllability play with different

108
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,520
emotional states.

109
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,870
And then we can make much
more accurate predictions.

110
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,050
Now you might predict the same thing
in the case of integral emotion and it

111
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:16,160
might be a stronger effect,

112
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,420
but let's say you were,
uh,

113
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,120
driving to work accident,
you're mad,

114
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,660
then you have to make a decision about
whether to change your insurance on your

115
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:33,440
car. That would be an
example of integral emotion.

116
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,910
So the anger that you're
feeling is normatively relevant.

117
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:42,800
It's defensible as an influence on your
decision regarding the car insurance. So,

118
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,760
so that's the difference.
So interesting. I mean,

119
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,900
it also makes me think of other work
that you've done. Again, more seminal,

120
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:54,650
important worth looking at the
relationship between emotion and economic

121
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:58,010
judgments as well. And I wonder, you
know, if you could say more here,

122
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:02,540
the ways in which emotions shape our sort
of everyday, you know, purse strings.

123
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,610
So to spare. Sure. Well,
one of the things I'm just,

124
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,650
that I'm interested in doing is bringing
a greater understanding of how emotion

125
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,510
works in the brain to um,
expand our knowledge,

126
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,400
but also,
uh,

127
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,200
more specifically just solve common
public policy program, um, problems.

128
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,100
So one problem that we have is that people

129
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,990
don't value the future enough so we
don't save enough in the present and we

130
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:40,400
spend too much in the
present. Um, and we also,

131
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,970
when we have opportunities to get more,
um,

132
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,760
later, then, um, we could get,

133
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:54,761
now we don't like to delay
that gratification and so
we just take less amount of

134
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,380
a lower dollar amount today then we could
take in the future if we were willing

135
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:03,360
to eat.
Um,

136
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,610
this relates to some of the classic
experiments done in psychology,

137
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,470
like Michelle's marshmallow study where
the kids are allowed to have more cookie.

138
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,420
He's, if they can wait to eat them. Well,

139
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,870
it turns out that adults do
the same thing all the time.

140
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:20,910
They don't wait to eat them.
Um,

141
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,940
and we do it with real money and this
is a problem in our national economy.

142
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,970
And so we have discovered
in our experiments that
sadness actually increases

143
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,250
this tendency.
And um,

144
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,120
sadness in general has very strong
effects on how people spend their money.

145
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,540
We always use real money and we use no
deception and we follow all of the very

146
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:52,701
well specified procedures in economics
because we like our work to be relevant

147
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,240
to economists as well as psychologists.

148
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,990
And what we've shown across many studies,

149
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,110
we now have three papers,
um,

150
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,720
dealing with sadness and economic
decision making published in psychological

151
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,070
science.
Um,

152
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,080
what we find is that sadness has what you
would call irrational effects and it's

153
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,110
incidental sadness and decision makers
do not recognize the impact they,

154
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,550
um,

155
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,810
if you ask them how is it
sadness influencing the
prices you said or that sort

156
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:35,210
of thing, they deny the
influence of sadness. Wow.

157
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,490
So we're very interested in this and
later this semester I'll be going to the

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,380
White House by invitation to meet with
folks from the Council of economic

159
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:47,730
advisors to the president.

160
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:52,731
And thinking about how basic understanding
of emotion and economic decision

161
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:58,971
making can help us to think about
crafting some public policy interventions.

162
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,550
That's fantastic.
I mean,

163
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:06,530
just hearing that this work can also
have real world kind of, you know,

164
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,050
policy level implications too. Yes. So my,

165
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,500
my major career goal is to learn
more about how the mind works,

166
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,470
especially in the area of emotion
and decision making and to make that

167
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:25,680
information useful for the common good.

168
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,780
And that's one of the reasons I work
at a policy school rather than, um,

169
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:35,370
another place that I might work is
because I like having the direct impact.

170
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:38,580
I teach military commanders,

171
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:43,110
government officials from all over the
world and get that information to them

172
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,150
before they have to week to read about
it three years later. Right? Yes.

173
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:51,180
The publishing scientific papers
can take a while as you know.

174
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,010
So the last

175
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,450
question I just wanted to ask, I mean,
you touched on this already, but I mean,

176
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:00,700
I wanted to touch a little bit more again
about your work that's looked at the

177
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,030
impact of emotions on judgment,
including risk perception.

178
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,570
And I wondered if you wanted to say
anything else about the role of these

179
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,830
distinct categories of emotions on,
you know,

180
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,610
the way in which it influences
our perception of risks?
Sure. Like so your anger.

181
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,473
Yeah,
sure.

182
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,440
So fear in anger are both negative
emotions. And when I came into the field,

183
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,920
those standard prediction would be
because their negative emotions,

184
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:28,780
they should trigger pessimism because
a negative feeling leads to a negative

185
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,730
global outlook.
Um,

186
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:35,731
but that did not seem right to me
because the of what I knew about the

187
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:40,300
underlying structures,
I mean angers and approach emotion.

188
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,280
Fear is they withdrawal emotion.
Um,

189
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,160
anger is associated with a sense of
certainty and individual control.

190
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:53,020
Appraisals. When people are mad, they
don't question themselves and you know,

191
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:57,240
they really think they know what's going
on. There's fears associated with them.

192
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,170
It's a defined by a sense of uncertainty
and lack of individual controlled.

193
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,800
And those cognitive metta
factors control and certainty.

194
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:10,540
We know no drive
perceptions of risk. So, um,

195
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,220
along with Dacher Keltner we predicted
and found that fear and anger actually

196
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:18,520
have opposite effects on risk perception.

197
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,070
Also on risk taking.

198
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,350
And so this, uh, uh,

199
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:30,330
is one of the most important
findings that we, uh,

200
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,550
we have in terms of supporting the
framework and the need to look in a

201
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:41,551
desegregated way within emotional
valence and separate out,

202
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,690
it's not all negative emotions have
the same effects and not all positive

203
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:48,370
emotions have the same effects.

204
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,730
So it's really important to tease these
apart if you want to make accurate

205
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:57,760
predictions for judgment and decision
making outcomes. For example,

206
00:13:57,761 --> 00:14:02,740
we've done another set of studies
that compares sadness with disgust.

207
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,330
They're both negative emotions,

208
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:09,090
but they have very different
effects on buying price discussed.

209
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,560
Her suppresses buying
price, again, real money,

210
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,440
and that is increases buying price.

211
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,280
So there's a number of studies like that
in terms of the fear and anger we have.

212
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,080
Um, that's another one where we've
worked on some policy implications.

213
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,160
We've done a nationwide field experiment
where we randomly assigned people to

214
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,490
different emotion conditions
and we've presented that work,

215
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,880
excuse me,
at NATO headquarters and um,

216
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,000
a variety of places around the world.
Um,

217
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,170
also for the United Nations
Training Institute, um,

218
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,730
for various government workers who are
trying to understand the psychological,

219
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,670
biological,

220
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:04,030
behavioral responses that people have
to terrorism and threats and risk,

221
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,223
that sort of thing.

222
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,081
Right.

223
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:11,010
So it sounds like this has
really important implications
for sort of the public

224
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,180
communication

225
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,210
and perception of risk.
Absolutely.

226
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,420
We found that we can essentially shape
people's policy preferences and their

227
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:26,211
perception of risk by randomly assigning
them to one emotional condition versus

228
00:15:26,431 --> 00:15:27,420
another.
Wow.

229
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,370
Which is quite a sort of awesome
and humbling thing to be able to do.

230
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:37,380
Really powerful too that you can
manipulate it, you know, that easily. Yes.

231
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,723
Wow.

232
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,590
So what I wanted to ask you a bit,

233
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:43,750
I mean it's been really interesting
hearing sort of what got you into emotion,

234
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,370
all the discoveries you've
made in this realm of emotion,

235
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:51,060
judgment and risk perception and
decision making. And I wonder, you know,

236
00:15:51,061 --> 00:15:52,710
as you've made these discoveries,

237
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,930
if you were to project sort of where
the future of emotions headed, what,

238
00:15:56,931 --> 00:15:58,830
what might you,
what might you say to that?

239
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,910
Well,
um,

240
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:07,830
we are a relatively new field and um,

241
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,570
you know, for most of the 20th
century it was pretty much dormant.

242
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,670
You couldn't even buy,
um,

243
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,540
Darwin's book and um,
uh,

244
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,600
emotion and people like skinnier sort
of squashed the study of emotion.

245
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:28,230
So one thing I would say is that we've
made enough progress now that it won't

246
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:31,530
disappear. Yeah. And um,

247
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,240
so I would say if anything we're going
to see more courses being offered at

248
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:39,990
universities. I think it's going
to be very interdisciplinary.

249
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,970
And um,

250
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,870
what I hope is that the wheat from the
chaff can be separated because so many

251
00:16:48,811 --> 00:16:50,580
people are now interested in emotion.

252
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:55,581
There's a lot of kind of pop stuff
going on and marketers making money on

253
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,430
emotion types of assessments that are
not necessarily scientifically valid.

254
00:17:02,431 --> 00:17:06,210
So I guess I'm being negative
here and telling you not so much,

255
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,470
but I think we'll see you.

256
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:11,640
But what I hope to not see
and saw also important.

257
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,590
Yeah. So, um, those are
some of my thoughts.

258
00:17:16,591 --> 00:17:21,591
I think it's telling though that a
place like the Harvard Kennedy School of

259
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,520
Government would hire
an emotion researcher.

260
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:28,580
You inhale because in the past that was
just considered to be sort of fluff and

261
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,720
now people are understanding
there's a real, um,

262
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,460
science and the science is useful.

263
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,040
So then the last question I want to
ask you is a little bit related to the

264
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:43,970
future and so far as I'm sure you have
students come to you all the time asking

265
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:46,340
you for advice.
They're interested in emotion,

266
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:49,980
considering whether or not they want
to embark in this field. What do

267
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,400
you tell them? Yeah, so, um,

268
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,070
I tell them great.
And um,

269
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,120
I often tell them go to Berkeley or go
to Carnegie Mellon or go to Ucla because

270
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:12,480
those are the places where I got my
training and I'm so fortunate to have

271
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,740
benefited from that training.
I just had amazing mentors.

272
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,420
And,
um,

273
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,020
another thing I tell them is don't rest
on assumptions of what is kind of taken

274
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:30,090
for granted in the field. You know?
So when I came into the field,

275
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:35,091
there were some very influential models
about how valence of emotion predicted

276
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:39,030
judgement or decision making outcomes.

277
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:44,540
And I didn't accept the assumptions of
those models because it really didn't

278
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:46,230
seem right to me.
The more I learned,

279
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,800
and I'm still,

280
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,690
I think our research has
a long way to go in, um,

281
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,260
testing the hypotheses that
flow from the framework.

282
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,780
But I think it's really important.

283
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,870
People have so many lay
intuitions about emotion, um,

284
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,470
to not rest on those lay intuitions
and to not rest on even some of the

285
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,810
assumptions in the academic
literature about emotion. It is,

286
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,840
it needs to be all of these things
tested just as rigorously as if you were

287
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:24,240
shutting synapses and,
um,

288
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,440
and don't be kind of, um, you know,

289
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,423
uh,

290
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,320
sort of seduced into accepting some of
the lay or even scientific intuitions.

291
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,160
Well, I just want to say thank you so
much for speaking with us today, Jen.

292
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:47,580
It's been a real pleasure. It's
been a pleasure for me. Thank you.

293
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,930
So this concludes our experts and emotion
interview with Doctor Jennifer Learner

294
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,970
from the Harvard Kennedy
School of Government.
