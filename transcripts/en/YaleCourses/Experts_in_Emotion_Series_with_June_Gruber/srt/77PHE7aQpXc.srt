1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,600
Welcome back to human emotion.
Um,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,950
in this course we've sort of
thought about what an emotion is,

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,810
sort of what are tools we can use to
trigger it and how we can measure it's

4
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:17,760
varying representations in our own face,
our laughter,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,060
our bodily signals and most
recently even our brain.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,510
Yet the most striking feature
about emotion is that it's
usually not experience

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,670
in isolation.
In fact,

8
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:34,671
we experienced it around other people
and it's what binds us to other people.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,280
And in fact emotions are actually
thought of as the social glue of society.

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,640
Um,

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,640
so given that emotions
are rarely experienced in
isolation and that we have them

12
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:48,960
to connect us and bind us together,

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,610
we need to better understand this
social world of emotions we live in.

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,950
This can include experiencing emotions
with intimate partners and sort of one on

15
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:03,951
one or dyadic exchanges as
well as experiencing them
as part of a larger group

16
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:09,030
of people such as when
we cooperate or compete.

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,830
And so as we think about emotions
and how important they are to our own

18
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:14,940
individual life,

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,320
we want to remember how critical
they are to our social life.

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,500
And how they're literally the glue that
keeps us together as social creatures.

21
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,950
And so with this thought that we
live in this inherently social world,

22
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,960
um, how much do we know about
emotions in our social world?

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,430
How do emotions look in these lives,
social exchanges,

24
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,700
how do they underlie our most important
relationships and interactions like

25
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:51,570
romantic relationships, cooperating
with other people, working in teams.

26
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,650
These are some of the questions that
we'll begin to examine today in our first

27
00:01:55,651 --> 00:02:00,640
part, um, of the emotions
and social world series. Um,

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,510
and in particular,
um,

29
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,890
what I'd like to start out as we think
about emotions in a social world is to

30
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:10,590
ask you to engage in a thought exercise.

31
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,540
So what I want you to do is after I
explained this to you, to pause the video,

32
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,140
take out a piece of paper and
write down this little exercise.

33
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:21,690
And when you're done, you can
click, play and resume the video.

34
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,530
So what I want you to do is think about
a recent time where you experienced a

35
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:31,830
very intense emotion. It could be
positive or it could be negative.

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,910
And what I want you to do is just to write
about first describing an emotion and

37
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:38,640
all the ways and tools that
we've talked about so far.

38
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,210
Sort of what did it look like, you
know, and your facial expressions.

39
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:44,880
What did you feel
physiologically in your body? Um,

40
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:48,420
what kind of subjective experience did
you have go through all the different

41
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:52,170
multiple channels of emotion responding
we've talked about and when you're done

42
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,760
with that,
think about for a second,

43
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,420
what was the social context
this emotion was embedded in?

44
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,250
Were there any other people?
The emotion was about,

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,050
were you around other people when the
emotion happened and was the emotion

46
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:09,460
something that really tied you to have
a relationship with another person?

47
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,330
And I'm curious to see if you find
that most of the intense emotions we

48
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:17,770
experience in everyday settings are
rarely about things that have only to do

49
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:20,080
with us.
And more often than not,

50
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:23,620
they are often truly about other people.

51
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,470
And they're the things
that really get us going.

52
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:30,520
The things that make us feel joyous
things is that make us feel angry and sad

53
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,910
are the emotions we have
around others or about others.

54
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,520
So take a moment to try to do this.
And when you're done,

55
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,320
we'll come back and talk a bit about
this introduction to emotions in a social

56
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,500
world.
So here we go.

57
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,460
We're going to start in our introduction
of emotions and a social world.

58
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,870
And I think of it as a question
of will I feel you feel we feel.

59
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,801
And in a sense,

60
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:57,460
what I want you to think about is the
fact that any one of us feels emotions,

61
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:01,210
but we're often thinking
about the emotions of other
people and the emotions of

62
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:04,900
all of us together as a collective group.
And so what we're going to do,

63
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:08,650
and sort of thinking about
this introduction to social
emotions is go through

64
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:09,760
the following roadmap.

65
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,510
We're going to start with an introduction
to what social emotions are in the

66
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:16,930
first place, followed by an
account that's been provided,

67
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:20,650
have a social function of emotion
across different levels of analysis.

68
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,980
Conclude a takeaway questions and
our expert interview for today.

69
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,840
So I'm going to start here with an
introduction to sort of what our social

70
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:32,860
emotions in the first place. What do we
mean when we think about this? So again,

71
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:33,970
this is our graph here,

72
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:38,230
thinking about this idea of emotions and
a social world and asking the question

73
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:41,290
of why are our emotions so social.

74
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,900
So you may remember earlier on in our
course we talked about the evolution of

75
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:51,901
emotion and here we discussed the early
ancestral origins of human man and how

76
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:56,020
he evolved into the current
form of human species.

77
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,980
We know today and in particular we talked
about the early environment that man

78
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:03,220
is thought to have evolved in called the,
you might remember the acronym,

79
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:07,870
the EEA or the uh,
environment of evolutionary adaptiveness.

80
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,530
And I would just want to do a quick
refresh because some of its central

81
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:15,430
properties I think are really critical
to answering this question of, well,

82
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:18,670
why are our emotions so
social in the first place?

83
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,590
So when we talked about,
for example, the EEA, right,

84
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,360
we went through the
different properties of it.

85
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,260
And let me just go through some of these
properties that appear to have given

86
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:34,240
rise to our current emotional state
and just how social it really is.

87
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,970
So we talked about early man arriving,

88
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,650
sort of originating in an environment
where it was really important to care for

89
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:44,170
offspring, right? And
that they be vulnerable,

90
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:49,120
that we build this important attachment
system of dependency between a caretaker

91
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:50,620
and their human offspring.

92
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,570
So that it's important
that we have emotions like
compassion and nurturant love.

93
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,590
We also talked about the importance
of relatively monogamous bonds, right?

94
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:05,450
That we have this strong underlying
tone of commitment to a single partner,

95
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,010
and that this is really important to
build emotions of love and commitment and

96
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:13,310
the importance of jealousy and keeping
us together with these partners.

97
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:14,860
Okay.

98
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,790
And then we talked about the
emergence of caring and compassion,

99
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,330
which is due to the fact that
hominids lived very long lives.

100
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:26,650
And so we're in a society where there's
many older individuals who require

101
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:30,520
caring, right? And so the existence
of both vulnerable offspring,

102
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,350
young babies as well as older people
really suggest that caring and compassion,

103
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:39,760
these socially rich emotions are a core
feature of what we've evolved to be.

104
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,560
There's also the flattening of a
social hierarchy in society, right? Um,

105
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:48,350
that suggests that in many
ways that early societies,

106
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,010
hunter gatherer societies
were relatively egalitarian.

107
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,500
And because we lived
in this egalitarianism,

108
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:59,360
it was really important to have emotions
that fostered cooperation and bonding

109
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:00,194
with others.

110
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,490
Yeah.

111
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,360
And then finally we talked about this
need for a collective action related to

112
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:07,370
the point beforehand where again,

113
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:12,371
a central part of the societies included
needs for working together towards a

114
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:15,980
common goal and being cooperative,
being prosocial,

115
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,660
putting aside one's individual needs and
feelings for the bigger, greater group.

116
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,990
So it seems in many ways that we evolved
to be social creatures and hence our

117
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:30,650
emotions are just so richly
social at all levels.

118
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,260
So when we think about sort
of this introduction to
how social we are and where

119
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:40,670
it came from, recent researchers have
tried to sort of better quantify this,

120
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:42,140
to think about,
well,

121
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,070
if emotions are so social and we
live in this inherently social world,

122
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,030
what exactly is the social
purpose or function of emotions,

123
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:54,650
sort of what do they do for us? Sort
of what, what can they, you know,

124
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:57,140
feature and unique ways,
you know,

125
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,570
that that makes us function
as social creatures.

126
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,650
So when we think about social
functions of emotion, um,

127
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:08,710
this has been broken into four main
levels of analysis proposed by Dacher

128
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,220
Keltner and Jonathan Height. And first
they talk about this individual level.

129
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,660
And again, this is a lot of what we
originally studied thus far in the course.

130
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:22,661
So we've studied emotions as this kind
of sensory response system where we have

131
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:26,590
really coordinated expressions
in our face, vocal intonations,

132
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,130
things like laughter. We have autonomic,
physiological, you know, signatures,

133
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:32,570
heart rate,
skin conductance,

134
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:35,210
breathing that are associated
with different emotions.

135
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,780
And then we also have specific
neurosignatures of emotions as well.

136
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,540
And that these help us sort of solve,
you know,

137
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,980
different types of relationship based
problems as well as survival and group

138
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:47,690
behavior.
So that's the first level,

139
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,420
okay.

140
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,050
But yet there's more than just the
individual. There's the dyadic level.

141
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,910
So here when we talk about dyadic,

142
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,210
we're talking about a specific exchange
between two individuals or a Dyad,

143
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,870
right?

144
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,260
And so here it's really important to have
an emotional response system where you

145
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:05,071
can,
you know,

146
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:09,030
coordinate with another individual in
terms of having facial expressions that

147
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:12,840
you can pick up on one another using
the important intonation in the voice,

148
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,800
having,
um,

149
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,300
coordinated physiological responses that
mirror one another as you're engaging.

150
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:18,781
Um,

151
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:23,220
and even having brain systems that people
now like Jamil Zaki are studying that

152
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:25,980
help us actually empathize
with other people.

153
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,660
Empathy being the ability
to understand the,

154
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,990
what another person is feeling
or understand cognitively
what they're thinking.

155
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,510
Right? So this dyadic level
is critically important. Um,

156
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,630
the third level of analysis I'll hold on
just really quickly before we get there.

157
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,010
Um,

158
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:48,840
and turn to this quote by Paul Ekman
who really hearkened at the value and

159
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:53,250
critical importance of the
dyadic level of, um, you know,

160
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,750
social functions of emotion.

161
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:59,751
He said the primary function is to
mobilize the organism to deal quickly with

162
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:03,150
important interpersonal encounters.

163
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,480
So almost the father of human
emotion as we study it today,

164
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,720
really underscored the importance of
emotion as essentially helping us navigate

165
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,100
social or interpersonal endeavors
or encounters. So emotions, again,

166
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:18,360
are inherently social.

167
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,490
And here what I want to do as well
before we continue further is to make two

168
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,020
important distinctions here.

169
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,150
So the important terminology that we
need to make is between interpersonal and

170
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,320
intrapersonal.

171
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:38,120
So interpersonal that we see here on the
left with this has really for referring

172
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:41,720
to his emotions that occur
within an individual. So again,

173
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:45,500
this is mapping emotional processes
of one specific individual.

174
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,460
And this is contrast with
interpersonal emotions.

175
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,290
So these are emotions between two people
and hear when you study interpersonal

176
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,124
emotions,

177
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,570
you're looking at how emotions structure
relationships among individuals.

178
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,880
Okay.
So again,

179
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:05,600
what we're going to be talking about
today is we started with a dyadic level of

180
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:09,920
analysis and we move on to different
levels is are these interpersonal emotions

181
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,790
and if you're a member,

182
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,820
when we talked about dyadic
methods earlier in the course,

183
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:20,020
hopefully you remember our early lectures
on how to study emotions and different

184
00:11:20,021 --> 00:11:23,410
methods.
We talked about dyadic interactions

185
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,890
here.
When we talked about dyadic interactions,

186
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,450
we had specific examples of two people
coming into the lab and having people,

187
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:37,830
it could be between spouses, family
members, caregivers, friends,

188
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,300
and often when we study them,

189
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:43,080
we have them engage in conversations
and at the end of these emotionally

190
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:44,370
evocative conversations,

191
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,720
we have people write their
emotion experience sort of
how are you feeling right

192
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:51,840
now as well as their emotion
perception of their partner.

193
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,740
How is their partner feeling right now?

194
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,410
And we talked about some of the kind
of emotion processes you can get when

195
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:03,640
studying dyadic interactions are
looking at reactivity, regulation,

196
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,120
understanding of emotions
as well as some of the,

197
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:10,540
some of the advantages as
well as disadvantages of
studying dyadic interactions.

198
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,630
Some of the advantages is you
have good ecological validity.

199
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,330
You're looking at a
naturalistic social context.

200
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,680
And the disadvantages being that they're
somewhat idiographic and that emotional

201
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:25,390
responses are really complicated when
you study them in to people that they can

202
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:29,890
be mutually influenced by
both members of the dyad. So

203
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:36,510
what I want to turn to now is studies
that have looked at dyadic interactions in

204
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:42,150
married couples and really identified
core emotional ingredients that sort of

205
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:47,950
predict who are going to go on to have a
successful longterm dyadic relationship

206
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,690
or marriage as a really cardinal example
and which individuals are going to have

207
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:53,524
trouble.

208
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,860
So here we're thinking about research by
Levinson and Gottman who uncovered the

209
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:01,660
power of emotion and relationships.

210
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,430
So they found that or they reported that,
you know,

211
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,130
up to 40 to 60% of marriages
end in divorce, right?

212
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,590
And it's often hard to understand
exactly why, right? So, um,

213
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,770
what they tried to do is
they did longitudinal studies
to try to unlock what are

214
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:22,390
the emotional mechanisms that predict
who do and do not go on to get divorced.

215
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,600
And they identified,
you can see these four circles here,

216
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,600
but they called the four
horsemen of the apocalypse.

217
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:33,010
So what they did is they brought a
married couples into the lab spouses,

218
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:36,850
and they have them interact with each
other in these sort of brief 10 minutes

219
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:39,760
snippets of conflict arguments or topics.

220
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,570
And what they did is they coded
these conversations offline,

221
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,650
watching the videos very carefully, kind
of second by second and identified, well,

222
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:51,490
what are the ingredients
that predict divorce?

223
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,480
And here's what they found them to be.
So the first was criticism.

224
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,830
So if couples were very critical of
each other and not praising each other,

225
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,720
that was a bad sign. The second was
content. So we can all think of contempt.

226
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:08,560
It's this idea of people sort of feeling
that they're morally better than the

227
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:10,990
other sort of looking
down upon their partner.

228
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,500
So if you saw people sneering
during these conflict conversations,

229
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:18,790
or even like rolling their eyes, that
was a second horseman of the apocalypse.

230
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,430
The third was defensiveness.

231
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,630
So this is where someone sort of maybe
says something to you that sensitive or

232
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:30,520
critical and you just fire back, right?
You're very defensive, very sensitive,

233
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:33,370
instead of being able to kind
of engage in the conversation.

234
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,540
And the fourth and the one that I think
is often perhaps the most interesting is

235
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,500
stonewalling.

236
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:43,240
So this is literally like you become a
stone wall and you just sorta refuse to

237
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:46,330
talk about anything your
partner thinks is important.

238
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,770
So they found that individuals
in these very brief 10 minute,

239
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,080
if they show these four ingredients that
they were able to predict divorce 13 to

240
00:14:57,721 --> 00:15:02,250
15 years later at a rate of 92% accuracy.

241
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,530
So if you see these four things
in a conversation, in a couple of,

242
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,240
they would say signs are,
it may be bad news.

243
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,510
So what I like to think about taking away
from this is that there's these micro

244
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,470
behavioral,
um,

245
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,610
emotion laden behaviors and just brief
snippets of dyadic interactions between

246
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,270
the two most intimate kinds of
partners. You can think of, you know,

247
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:28,680
people in a marriage that can be signs
as to the quality of that relationship

248
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:32,040
even 10, 13, 15 years later.

249
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,070
Yeah.

250
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,730
So the third level then in
this is the group level.

251
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,660
So here we're thinking about big groups
of people and we're thinking about

252
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:42,890
social hierarchies.

253
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:47,810
How do people in high versus
low scs situations, you know,

254
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:49,250
how do they fare emotionally,

255
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,110
how does socioeconomic status plan to
emotional wellbeing as well as power.

256
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,010
So a lot of these studies have been
done by fascinating people like Dacher

257
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,590
Keltner and others at UC
Berkeley that find for example,

258
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:05,210
that people in low scs situations are
twice as likely to have depression, right?

259
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,210
That they have compromised
immune system functioning, right?

260
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,170
And they've also looked at power and
that individuals with higher power really

261
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:16,460
display a whole different repertoire of
emotional related behavior with people

262
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,050
of low power settings.

263
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,410
Okay.

264
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,770
And then finally in one
that's particularly important
when we think of kind of

265
00:16:23,771 --> 00:16:28,630
global level conflict and cooperation
is the between group level.

266
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:32,470
So here what we're talking about
is in group versus out group.

267
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,230
And this is a kind of collective level,
right?

268
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,920
And a very central and
controversial idea here, you know,

269
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:42,250
comes from sober and Wilson
related to evolutionary theory.

270
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,990
So they would say if we evolved in groups,
which is clearly true,

271
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,140
and if there were numerous
groups competing with each other,

272
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,820
which also happens that there's tens of
thousands of people in specific groups.

273
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,750
So there may be some emotional traits
that helped some groups do better in

274
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,460
competition against other groups.

275
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,180
So it's this idea of ingroup versus
outgroup and what sort of emotional

276
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:08,410
behaviors give rise to
competition versus collaboration.

277
00:17:08,411 --> 00:17:12,190
So this is a very controversial topic
and plays a really important role and we

278
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:17,191
think about global conflict and how can
we leverage insights from understanding

279
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:21,670
emotion and aspect of science to try to
think about emotion on a broader group

280
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:25,840
level scale
as well as cooperation.

281
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,040
So this has been an
introduction to social emotions.

282
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,550
And for the next second and
third modules in this series,

283
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,660
we're going to have a couple
of very exciting and very
esteemed guests lectures.

284
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,860
And I want to give you a quick sneak
peek as to who's going to be coming up in

285
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,710
the next two modules on social emotions.

286
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:45,970
Okay.

287
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,400
So one of our guests lectures is a beloved
colleague of here at Yale University.

288
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:55,050
Dr. Margaret Clark, who's a renowned
expert on emotions and relationships,

289
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,950
and so she's going to speak with us about
some of the most cutting edge findings

290
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,820
as to how we can think about our
emotions and the way they navigate our

291
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:05,910
relationships,
especially romantic relationships.

292
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,840
We'll also have day at Dr. David Desteno.

293
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:14,310
I'm from northeastern university who's
just one of the founders of this field of

294
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:15,420
social emotions,

295
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,040
who's going to be talking with us
about emotions and social interactions

296
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:24,420
touching across a broad range of
really central and important themes.

297
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,500
Yeah,

298
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,070
so we've talked about an introduction
to what our social emotions,

299
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,810
we've talked about the social function
of emotions across four different levels

300
00:18:34,811 --> 00:18:35,680
of analysis.

301
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,753
Yeah.

302
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,690
I've given you a little sneak peek into
the two upcoming guests lectures that

303
00:18:40,691 --> 00:18:44,380
are going to conclude our
module on social emotions.

304
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,230
And so now we'll conclude
with our takeaway questions.

305
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,500
Our first question asks,

306
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,780
what were the features of the early he
a that gave rise to social emotions and

307
00:18:57,781 --> 00:19:01,530
humans from an evolutionary perspective?
Second,

308
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,330
what were the four levels of analysis
inherent in a social functional approach

309
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:09,360
to emotion?
And finally,

310
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:14,130
can you describe what are called the four
horsemen of the apocalypse research by

311
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:18,090
Gottman and Levinson.
And what does this tell us about emotion,

312
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,500
romantic relationships,

313
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,340
sort of what are the most important
emotional ingredients that can predict who

314
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:28,341
will and will not go on to have a
healthy romantic a future together.

315
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,020
And we're going to conclude
with our expert interview today.

316
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:35,883
Yeah.

317
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,030
This is part of our experts
in emotion interview series.

318
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,970
Yeah.

319
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:45,770
So for this uh, lectures experts
and emotion interview series,

320
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:50,771
I'll be speaking with Dr. David Rand on
emotion and cooperation in the social

321
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:51,734
world.

322
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Doctor Rand earned his phd from Harvard
University and systems biology and his

323
00:19:56,811 --> 00:20:00,200
Ba from Cornell University
in computational biology.

324
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,800
His work focuses on human
cooperative behavior.

325
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,390
His approach combines
empirical observations from
behavioral experiments with

326
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:13,280
predictions generated by evolutionary
game theoretic math models and computer

327
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:16,280
simulations by doing this doctor ran ass.

328
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:21,310
What prosocial and antisocial decisions
people make in particular situations and

329
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:22,700
social environments.

330
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,630
The cognitive mechanisms that determine
how these decisions are actually made

331
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:31,700
and the ultimate explanations for why our
decision making processes have come to

332
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:32,870
function as they do.

333
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:37,400
He draws on methodologies from psychology
as well as economics and evolutionary

334
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:41,960
biology and is interested in applications
including law management and public

335
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:45,200
policy. Doctor Ran, has published
in high impact journals,

336
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:50,050
including nature and science,
was named wired magazine Smart List,

337
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,920
uh, in 2012 as one of 50 young
people who will change the world.

338
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,520
And his work has widely appeared
in the media, including the BBC.

339
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,110
NPR is morning edition marketplace and
all things considered scientific American,

340
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:06,160
Huffington posts, a New York
Times, La Times, the Atlantic,

341
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:09,580
The Washington Post,
and Msnbc among many others.

342
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:13,750
So I now turn to our experts and
emotion interview with Dr. David Rand on

343
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:16,630
emotion and cooperation
and the social world.

344
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:20,100
Okay.
