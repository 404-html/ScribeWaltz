1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,930
For our experts and emotion interview.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:06,670
We'll be speaking with Dr Ronald Dahl
on emotion and sleep in adolescents.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,030
Dr Doll is a professor in the school of
Public Health and the director of the

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,990
Institute of Human Development at the
University of California Berkeley.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,070
He obtained his MD and fellowship training
in sleep and neuroendocrinology at

6
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:22,660
the University of Pittsburgh and
completed a pediatric residency at Duke

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,610
University at the
University of Pittsburgh.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,360
He led a program of clinical research
at the interface of child psychiatry,

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,520
pediatrics and psychology,

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,900
focusing on the development of sleep
and arousal as well as aspect regulation

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,260
and their relevance to behavioral
and emotional health in children and

12
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:40,480
adolescents at UC Berkeley.

13
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:44,650
His current work is now extending these
lines of investigation to bridge from

14
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:45,311
developmental,

15
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:49,390
social and aspect of neuroscience to
address a broader range of clinical,

16
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:53,980
educational and social policy issues
with a primary focus on adolescence.

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,980
So I now turn to a very
special experts in emotion,

18
00:00:56,981 --> 00:01:01,500
interviewed together with Dr
Ronald Dahl. So welcome, Ron.

19
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:02,940
Thanks for speaking with us today.

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,653
Thank you.

21
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,060
So I thought we could start with,
uh,

22
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,060
me asking you just a little bit about
what first got you interested in emotion.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,260
I've heard really longstanding
and deep interest in,

24
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:18,650
in emotion and affective
dimensions of experience broadly.

25
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:21,890
And I think even going back to
my early training in pediatrics,

26
00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:26,891
the relevance of how feelings influence
real behavior and decision making was

27
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,580
just central. So I think so much of my
experience and trying to target problems.

28
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,060
And then the second thing is that early
on in my research career I was focusing

29
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,800
on emotion disorders.
Uh,

30
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:40,790
I'm depression anxiety and that raised
a whole set of questions about emotions

31
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:44,270
and how to think about them and emotion
regulation and that interface nicely

32
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,240
with the sleep and arousal regulation
from a developmental perspective. So it's,

33
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:51,230
it's sort of a long standing interest
broadly and affective domains and the role

34
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:55,250
of feelings in the development of young
people and their social experiences.

35
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,091
Excellent.

36
00:01:56,091 --> 00:01:59,600
So I wanna now just ask you
a few questions about your
work in this domain. So,

37
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:03,860
I mean your work is so exciting and
you're widely known for this work you've

38
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:08,570
done on the relationship between sleep
and emotion, especially among adolescents.

39
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,050
And I wonder if you could
say just a little bit from
your perspective about what

40
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:14,570
do you think are the most
exciting discoveries here?

41
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,253
There's really,

42
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,960
there are a couple things I want to
focus initially on this idea of by

43
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:27,380
directional interactions and the
evidence has been growing. I think we,

44
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:31,010
there were a lot of hints for that early
on just just from basic observational

45
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:35,270
studies that emotional arousal can
interfere with sleep and a variety of ways

46
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:37,490
and emotional distress
can interfere with sleep.

47
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,980
And this idea that sleep
is turning off vigilance.

48
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:44,270
So anything that raises arousal vigilance
can interact negatively with sleep.

49
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:49,010
And then the fact that insufficient
sleep or disturbed sleep interferes with

50
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:52,850
aspects of emotion regulation sets
up this framework for spirals,

51
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,990
negative spirals of
bi-directional interactions
that fits, that spiraled down.

52
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,750
The flip side of that is if
could intervene strategically,

53
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:05,950
particularly in key windows
and development to scaffold
each of these processes

54
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:08,620
in positive ways.
It could really alter the trajectory.

55
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,920
And so to me those are the exciting
questions to understand more deeply how

56
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:18,480
these interactions occur.
The, the, the not just
mechanistically to understand but,

57
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:22,180
but practically how does this play out in,
in young people's lives,

58
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,420
vulnerabilities and then how insufficient
sleep or emotional disruptions can

59
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,810
start these,

60
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,840
these cycles of interaction in ways
that can be spiraling down or then with

61
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:37,630
intervention,
a scaffolded to caught up in healthy ways.

62
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,970
So do you think that the spider actual
relationship applies equivalently across

63
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:46,280
both positively and negatively
balanced emotion states? What's it?

64
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,910
So it's a good question and I think,
um, I have a few compliments about that.

65
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,020
I think first of all,
I think it's an empirical question at the,

66
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,390
at the current state of the science,

67
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,480
I think there's strong evidence for
negative spiraling components for both

68
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:07,810
aspects of negative emotion
and positive emotions that,

69
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,200
that there's an increased vulnerability
reward sensitivity. In fact,

70
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:14,350
some of the work I've been
doing with Matt Walker here,

71
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,930
we're trying to pull that
work down into adolescence.

72
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,640
And we beginning to look at that.

73
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,660
And I think that can set off the sort
of risk taking excitement seeking

74
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,450
dimension. And some of this is
relevant to bipolar disorder,

75
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,590
but I think that there's also very
strong evidence for the four aspects of

76
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:34,591
negative emotion and how insufficient
sleep makes it more difficult to deal

77
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,240
functionally with some
aspect of negative emotion.

78
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,600
But then I also have to say that my
personal bias is that I don't like lumping

79
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:46,840
emotions into these two categories
as if positive, negative, right.

80
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,020
And I know even the people that
do that understand the nuances,

81
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,260
but increasingly I've been interested
in the idea that the emotion specific

82
00:04:56,321 --> 00:05:01,321
differences in what emotions people
like to feel or don't want to feel or

83
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,790
behaviorally seem to amplify
or avoid can be so different.

84
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,890
And I think that even the,

85
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,260
using the language of what are positive
emotions and what our negative emotions

86
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,360
can obfuscate some really important
questions. And to come back to your,

87
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:16,870
your initial question,

88
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:21,871
I think we may be better off served
in understanding how sleep and emotion

89
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:27,010
specific regulatory processes interact.
And it may be,

90
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,030
there are similarities across any domain
of emotional activation or arousal.

91
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,370
There could be commonalities,

92
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:36,760
but there also could be specific
types of interactions, for example,

93
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:41,290
with fear and vigilance or certain kinds
of reward seeking that may not apply to

94
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,440
other emotions even if they're
broadly negative or positive.

95
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:48,160
So I think these are really important
questions empirically to, to get in and,

96
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:51,130
and disentangle, uh, in,
in, in more specific ways.

97
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,770
Right. And as you're saying,
it's, it's complex, right?

98
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,900
And there's so many open questions,

99
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:59,390
right as to how the directional
relationship works with different kinds of

100
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:00,890
emotional experiences.

101
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,300
And it's an important framework for my,

102
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,190
my approach to these questions is
the idea of looking for windows, uh,

103
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,550
windows, a brain development, windows
of social and emotional development,

104
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,310
where in these patterns of interactions
may set up particular vulnerabilities

105
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:22,100
for particular youth in
particular environments.

106
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:25,970
And I think that's another place where
emotions specific or even positive

107
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:27,020
emotion,
negative emotion,

108
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:29,540
specific interactions with
sleep could be really important.

109
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,720
You have patterns of learning and
we've been interested, for example,

110
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:36,680
in the onset of puberty as a time of
fundamental shifts in both sleep and

111
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:39,840
fundamental shifts, shifts in
some aspects of emotion. Um,

112
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,730
some of it positive emotion,
reward seeking and sensation seeking,

113
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:47,750
but also sensitivity to social threat
and negative emotions and vigilance.

114
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,490
And I think that that the
emotional learning and the
role of sleep in learning,

115
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,890
um, including emotional learning could
be just as important as whatever,

116
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,050
what the short term effects
are on these systems.

117
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,100
What do you think when you think about
these developmental trajectory is,

118
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:07,400
to what extent do you think is
relationships bear similarities during

119
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:10,820
adolescents as compared to
middle or older adulthood?

120
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,390
So I think there are two frameworks
within which I think about these things.

121
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:20,940
I think in, in many ways there are, uh,

122
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,210
continuity's and this sort of a deep
theme of development that there are

123
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,560
continuity and discontinuity is,

124
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:30,060
I think in some ways there
are similarities in how
these systems work and how

125
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,200
learning occurs and how regulatory
systems interact in young children,

126
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:38,630
school aged children, adolescents, adults.
And I think that there's a lot of, um,

127
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,260
value and understanding the commonalities.
I think that in addition to that,

128
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,480
just like any other measure
of growth or development,

129
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,850
there are what I call inflection points.

130
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:52,320
And I think the important issue about
inflection points in a trajectory is that

131
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:55,770
there's a relatively larger
impact of learning and experience.

132
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,980
And so one or two or three bad experiences
at a key window of time may have a

133
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,220
bigger impact on the geometry.
And that's the kind of model,

134
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:07,020
not that it's categorically different,

135
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,580
but there are unique opportunities for
positive early intervention and unique

136
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:15,960
vulnerabilities that the same
sort of hit or challenge or,

137
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,060
or stress to the system.

138
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,560
And especially if there are a few
of them in a script, you know,

139
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,130
relatively unstable or changing
transition can have a bigger impact.

140
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,060
And so rather than just talk about
a broad group like teenagers,

141
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,730
I think should understand
developmental processes and,

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,390
and some of the developmental
process, these are social. Uh,

143
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,090
when you graduated from high school
and Start College or trade school,

144
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:40,600
you get your first job.
Uh,

145
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,650
but some of them are biologic and puberty
happens to be a biologic transition

146
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,830
that is powerfully impacting a
subset of these neural systems.

147
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,210
And I think that sets up a potential
imbalance because there's new change in

148
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:57,660
sensitivity. Some of these
neural systems but not others.

149
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,110
And puberty has been happening
earlier and in contemporary society.

150
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,160
And the social challenges of, of young
children in middle school, um, is,

151
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,860
is increasingly complex.

152
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,240
So I think there are opportunities to
understand these inflection points even if

153
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:14,760
there are similarities to
what happens in older adults,

154
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,720
middle age adults transitioned to old age,
other inflection points.

155
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,620
I think there are reasons to zoom in on
the unique opportunities in these early

156
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:23,454
witness to develop,

157
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,600
I mean, speaking of this early window
of development and makes me think about,

158
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:26,841
you know,

159
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:30,920
this really novel neurodevelopmental
model that you've proposed to try to

160
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:33,200
understand emotion
regulation in adolescence,

161
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:37,250
this sort of peak time of discovery
from a scientific perspective.

162
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,360
And I've heard you speak about it as
this time of all gas and no brakes.

163
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,960
And I just wondered if you could say a
little bit about what this expression can

164
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:49,070
notes in terms of the unique role of
emotion processes during this critical

165
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:50,240
developmental phase.

166
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,480
So I'm actually glad you asked
that that way because I want to,

167
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,240
I think there's some nuances
to the metaphor and the
variations in the metaphor

168
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:00,230
that are really important.

169
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:03,930
And we actually just published a paper
in nature reviews neuroscience, um,

170
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,210
last year when we did a met analysis
and revisited some aspects of this.

171
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,950
So let me zoom in on this idea
of the accelerator and the brake.

172
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,680
I actually think that a better metaphor,

173
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,830
the initial metaphor was starting the
turbocharged engines without a skilled

174
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:23,570
driver. Um, and then people, and then
Larry Steinberg emphasize the, the, the,

175
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:28,100
the gas and the brakes. But I think the,
the, the metaphor has limitations. Yes,

176
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:31,310
there is this capacity for acceleration,

177
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,350
reward seeking sensation seeking that
seems to kick in individual differences.

178
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:38,960
Some kids still are shy and
cautious when they hit puberty.

179
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,400
But the tendency when
gage novel, exciting, uh,

180
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,360
ambiguous environment seems to increase
at puberty and that can clearly

181
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,410
overwhelmed the capacity to be driving
carefully or putting the brakes on

182
00:10:54,411 --> 00:10:55,280
appropriately.

183
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,550
But I think we shouldn't overstate that
metaphor because when adolescents are

184
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:03,890
highly motivated to do a complex task,

185
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,690
including a task that requires a lot of
inhibitory control, cognitive control,

186
00:11:08,691 --> 00:11:12,920
tedious tasks like text messaging,
they can, if they're motivated,

187
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,400
they can recruit frontal cortex
pretty effectively. And in fact,

188
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:18,710
in some situations they
may outperform adults.

189
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,040
And so I think the very ability in the
recruitment of these control systems and

190
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:30,161
the degree to which they learn this
quickly very so much on social context.

191
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,600
And I think the metaphor is still
relevant because the capacity for these

192
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:40,220
excitement seeking systems to tip the
balance and overwhelmed, you know,

193
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:41,360
inhibitory control,

194
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:45,140
the ability to put on the brakes or
to steer carefully is relevant to

195
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:48,350
understanding what can happen to really
smart adolescents who can make good

196
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,184
decisions.

197
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,160
But I don't think we should imply they're
incapable of the steering and brakes.

198
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,900
Part of the metaphor they can,

199
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,990
it's just they're vulnerable to zooming
in on the relevance of the social

200
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:04,210
rewards and that tipping the balance.

201
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:09,330
And I think that sleep deprivation or
insufficient sleep can amplify that

202
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:11,090
imbalance.
Uh,

203
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:16,110
the emotional or the effect of
signals relative to the pausing,

204
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:22,051
cautiously evaluating for a moment before
acting is probably tipped a bit more.

205
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:26,050
And I think that's part of the initial
thing we were discussing about the

206
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:28,480
synergy,
the negative synergy or negative spiral.

207
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,610
It's sleep deprivation on top of someone
who's already a sensation seeking type

208
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:37,990
of personality in an environment that's
very excitement seeking and has a lot of

209
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,510
risks and then add on to
that staying up really late,

210
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,700
getting up early preschool
and being sleep deprived.

211
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:48,060
Those can add up for risk factors that
contribute to some of these impulsive

212
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,610
sensation seeking dangerous activities.

213
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,750
So when, this is all really interesting
and I liked the CAG out, you put that,

214
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:57,240
it's not that they don't have
the capacity for the breaks,

215
00:12:57,241 --> 00:13:00,840
it's just there's contextual factors
and motivational factors that influence

216
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:03,270
when and how they put on
the brakes. Right? Yeah.

217
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,070
It makes me wonder sort of what unique
treatment implications might this have

218
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:10,830
for adolescents and managing
their emotions and you know,

219
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,280
thinking about the intervening
role asleep too in that process.

220
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,560
That's a great question.
I,

221
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,380
so I think I'm going to oversimplify
some complex things to sort of zoom in on

222
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,180
my intuitions in this area.

223
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:28,181
I think one of the principles that's
emerging is that having goals be socially

224
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,330
salient to that individual.
And again,

225
00:13:32,331 --> 00:13:37,080
it's the cart that the heart of and the
art of motivational interviewing, um,

226
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,910
as an approach a of where the techniques
that, that are used with adolescence, uh,

227
00:13:41,911 --> 00:13:44,600
to, to really ground the
motivation for change.

228
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,320
It's something that's relevant and
salient to that individual's own ambiguous

229
00:13:48,321 --> 00:13:50,750
feelings and, and, and,
and, and what's salient.

230
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,310
And having that be socially
salient to adolescents, um,

231
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,330
is a powerful way to activate
these more natural motivations.

232
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,860
Something that's abstract and cognitive
that something could happen to you.

233
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,030
You know,
abstractly,

234
00:14:05,031 --> 00:14:09,980
theoretically in some future time is not
as sanely and it doesn't get into the

235
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:14,090
aspect of emotional domain and compete
as effectively in the moment and the

236
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:17,570
charged moment. And so I think
there are two themes to that.

237
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:22,571
One is having young people do the thinking
and planning early in the process,

238
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:28,610
anticipating that they're going to get
into a situation with more emotional

239
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,050
charge and not easily be able
to pause and think and reflect.

240
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,390
Um, that's a, that's one part.

241
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,480
And the second thing is to
have the motivation to do that.

242
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:41,450
Be linked to these emotionally salient,

243
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:45,800
socially salient goals or,
or, or fears or worries.

244
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,240
I think those anchoring the change,

245
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,480
the reason to change.
So,

246
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:56,240
so just telling someone to go to bed
earlier so that they can get better grades

247
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:58,100
or study more or uh,

248
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,990
interact with less irritability within
their relationships could be done in a

249
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:06,650
way that taps salience for
an individual adolescent.

250
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,570
But it also can be done in
a way that's like, okay,

251
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:11,360
here's another adult giving me
advice about what I should do.

252
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,020
And when it's 11 o'clock at night and a
friend is texting them about something

253
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:17,270
exciting that's going on,
it's just not going to compete.

254
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,540
So I think grounding these in ways that
are socially and affectively salient

255
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,660
goals and then helping adolescents,
you know, align their motive,

256
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:30,410
their own individual motivations, uh, in
those ways are, are important parts of,

257
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,550
of intervention approaches.

258
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,400
Thank you so much.
I mean,

259
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,990
so the last question I wanted to ask you
soak in a little bit about this is just

260
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:42,070
trying to understand the role of these
different emotional related systems and

261
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:46,510
that sort of development or etiology
of psychopathology among adolescents in

262
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:49,090
particular.
And I wonder from your perspective,

263
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:53,020
what you might consider to be some
of the most important developmental

264
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:56,710
trajectories here whereby emotion might
play an influence and onset of mood

265
00:15:56,711 --> 00:16:00,070
disorders like depression, some of the
things you've studied in your own work.

266
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,020
So I'm going to,

267
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,700
I'm going to dive into the line of
question that I find most compelling right

268
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:07,534
now.
Sure.

269
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,580
As relevant to what you asked in terms
of the trajectory to affect disorders.

270
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:16,030
But I think it's actually relevant to a
broader set of health relevant issues in

271
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:16,451
adolescence.

272
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:21,220
And that is that I think affect of science
generally and affective neuroscience

273
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:22,054
generally,

274
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,800
particularly as it's focused
on adolescence and a and
on these disorders has

275
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:30,340
focused almost exclusively on
emotions and emotion regulation.

276
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,700
And I think the effect of
dimension of motivation,

277
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,280
it's relatively understudied.

278
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,070
And what I mean by that is there's
aspects of motivation that are,

279
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,190
that are linked to goals
and and cognitive processes.

280
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:46,750
But a key part of motivation
is the feeling of desire,

281
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:47,830
the feeling of value,

282
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:52,831
the fast automatic processing that
something has salients and motivational

283
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:58,150
learning in this aspect of domain is
I think part of the window of unique

284
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,350
opportunity in adolescence.

285
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,380
I think the brain expects new motivational
learning to occur about what really

286
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:08,080
is salient to your goals as an individual.

287
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:12,580
You becoming an individual and a complex
society and the feeling of what has

288
00:17:12,581 --> 00:17:17,170
meaning purpose, value, uh,
connects to your passions.

289
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,760
Um, these are key windows of
learning that create fast,

290
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:24,860
automatic prioritizations about motivate.

291
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,580
Not that you make yourself do
something you don't want to do,

292
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:31,090
but falling in love with literature
or dance or changing the world or,

293
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,190
or a particular activity that becomes so
strong, you don't make yourself do it.

294
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,300
Someone would have to prevent
you from doing it because you,

295
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:42,310
you've in essence fallen in love
with a particular kind of activity.

296
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,160
And that's sort of the
extreme end of this spectrum.

297
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:50,161
But I think there's a dimension
of motivational learning
that I think extremely

298
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:54,510
important. Depression is a
bit of a paradox in many ways.

299
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,790
What happens with depression is a
loss of certain kinds of motivation,

300
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,580
especially this aspect of dimension.
This,

301
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,480
this pull towards social
rewards and pointing engagement.

302
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,450
They can make themselves
do it, uh, to some degree,

303
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,490
but it's not as naturally motivated.

304
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:13,491
And I think this inflection points where
some motivations can fiercely attached

305
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:18,300
to very unhealthy things like
drugs and alcohol risk taking, uh,

306
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,420
sensation seeking,
um,

307
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:25,490
some can really disengage loose
motivation as another inflection point.

308
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,530
And then finally healthy
versions of these passions,

309
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:30,700
a mastery curve of channeling your,

310
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:35,190
your goals and these feelings
of motivation in ways
that are really leading to

311
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:39,510
productive engagement. And I'm over
simplifying some very complex issues,

312
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:43,800
but I think justice affect of neuroscience
has brought a new way of thinking

313
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:45,510
about emotions and emotion regulation.

314
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,560
I think there's exciting opportunities
to understand motivation and motivational

315
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:53,700
learning and the role of feelings and
motivations and particularly in this

316
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:54,750
interval of adolescence.

317
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,720
I mean that's just really wonderful and
really interesting and it makes me think,

318
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,810
you know, you've illuminated a lot
of complex issues in this field.

319
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,170
Where do you see the
future of this work headed?

320
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,350
What are some of the most
critical next steps? So

321
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,510
I'm going to,
I'm going to focus a bit in my,

322
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:16,540
in and these comments on process and
having worked in this area for more years

323
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:19,170
than I want to admit at this point.
Um,

324
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,440
I think the most important issue
is creating teams of people,

325
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,340
teams of researchers who
can tackle the complexity,

326
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,090
especially developmentally.
These are really complicated issues.

327
00:19:32,091 --> 00:19:37,091
If you try to reduce emotion or motivation
too narrowly to a laboratory task or

328
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:42,380
an imaging study or controlled experiment
or if you just sample in ways you can

329
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:46,610
look in natural environments and really
ecologically valid ways to do cross

330
00:19:46,611 --> 00:19:50,690
sectional studies versus Longitudinal
to really understand the nuances of the

331
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,800
social dimension, the
affect dimension, uh,

332
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,870
peer interactions and emotions really
requires teams of people who can slice

333
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:04,010
through the complexity with
well the science studies
sample appropriately in the

334
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:06,440
diversity of things that
can influence these issues.

335
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,530
Think about the context as you mentioned,

336
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,930
how important context is for activating
different kinds of emotions and

337
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:16,580
motivations and follow them longitudinally
to understand development trajectory.

338
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:22,030
No one or two labs can do those things
well and so I think one of the challenges

339
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:22,310
in,

340
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:26,300
especially for young people who are told
they've got a super specialized in one

341
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:29,990
area and become experts. Yeah,
it's how to do team science,

342
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,370
how to learn to be having pockets
of expertise but engage in these

343
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,540
interdisciplinary,

344
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,040
transdisciplinary teams that I think are
really going to tackle the next level

345
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,290
of integration and work
across these levels.

346
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,200
Especially for things as complicated
as emotion and motivation.

347
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,600
So related then,

348
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:49,870
what kind advice would you give students
who are just thinking about embarking

349
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:50,704
in this field?

350
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,510
So it's hard to get,
I mean I think it,

351
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,690
it can be quite different for
different kinds of students,

352
00:20:56,691 --> 00:21:00,000
but I think the idea of balancing that,

353
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:02,180
that the Yin Yang of on one hand,

354
00:21:02,181 --> 00:21:06,140
zooming in and getting expertise and
developing the specialization that's

355
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,730
required to do science well.

356
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,270
But I think other head balancing
that with breadth and, and,

357
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,100
and having co mentors or,

358
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,270
or we're spending some time with
interdisciplinary teams because I think

359
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:22,271
increasingly the high impact socially
and clinically relevant questions are

360
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,140
going to require these teams.

361
00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:27,650
And if people spend all of the
formative years and their development

362
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,690
professionally, um, you know,
doing individualized work,

363
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,010
they're not going to develop the skills
and ways of thinking to really integrate

364
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:37,461
and do these,

365
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:40,110
these collaborative that not everybody
could do collaborative work and,

366
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:42,040
and we still need the,
the industry,

367
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:46,610
the brilliant individual who really
pushes knowledge forward in their niche.

368
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,560
But I also think we need more young
scientists who are going to do these cross

369
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,410
disciplinary,
um,

370
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,620
approaches and integrate and really
creative ways across these stickers

371
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:00,510
levels. Well, thank you so
much for speaking today.

372
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,530
It was really wonderful to
hear your insights in this
field and realize just how

373
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:08,040
complex the issues are and how much do
we need these interdisciplinary teams to

374
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,650
move these important questions forward.

375
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,371
Well,
thank you.

376
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:17,170
I really enjoyed it and I look forward
to hearing other people in the series

377
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:21,220
comments, uh, on these really interesting
issues and, and um, and it's an exciting,

378
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:24,640
I think the other thing I wanna say,
it's such an exciting time in this field.

379
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:28,060
It's, there's so much new
knowledge and opportunity,

380
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,990
so the more young bright people we can
get into the field thinking about these

381
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:33,580
things and helping us
understand them the better.

382
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,260
Right. So, thank you so much.

383
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:39,640
So this concludes our experts in emotion
interview with Doctor Ron Dahl from the

384
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:42,100
University of California at Berkeley.
Thanks again.
