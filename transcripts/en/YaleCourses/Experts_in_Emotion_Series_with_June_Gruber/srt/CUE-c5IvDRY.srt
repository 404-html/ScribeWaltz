1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,650
Today, uh, for our experts
in emotion interview.

2
00:00:03,651 --> 00:00:05,600
We have the honor of
speaking with doctors,

3
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:10,070
Lita cosmetics and John to be together
who will help us answer the question of

4
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:15,071
whether and how emotions are products
of our evolutionary history or our

5
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:17,630
emotions evolutionarily evolved.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,790
So doctor cause and two B are well known
for their work in pioneering the field

7
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,410
of evolutionary psychology.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,540
They're both professors of psychology and
anthropology at UC Santa Barbara where

9
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:32,330
they co direct the center
for evolutionary psychology.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,360
They began their collaboration 29
years ago at Harvard University,

11
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:41,030
just undergraduates and have received
since then numerous awards including the

12
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:42,800
NIH director's pioneer award,

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,940
the American Association
for the Advancement of
Science Prize for Behavioral

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,110
Research, American psychological
associations, early career award, um,

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,940
the national science science foundations,

16
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:56,300
presidential young investigator
award and Guggenheim fellowships.

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,510
So I now turn to a very special one of
a kind duo experts and emotion interview

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,020
together with Dr Lita caused
NEIdeas and Dr John Tooby.

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,800
So welcome Lita and John, thank you
so much for speaking with us today.

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,720
Thanks so much. Thanks for, I guess
what I thought I would do, I'm with you,

21
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:20,100
is first ask you each a bit about what
first got you interested in studying

22
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:23,220
emotion, um, and a leader
if you want to go first.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,320
Well we, we started together.
I mean we were trying to,

24
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,980
we were trying to figure out what it
would be to have an evolutionary approach

25
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:32,300
to psychology more generally.

26
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:35,690
And you really can't have that
without some approach to emotion.

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,400
And we, we talked about it a
lot and we were thinking that,

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,500
um, there's a phenomenology of emotion,
which is so real to all of us, right?

29
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:49,460
But on the other hand, at some point
if you think of the brain is a system,

30
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:53,150
the processes of probation, there
needs to be some sort of computational,

31
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:56,250
some sort of information processing
level description of what,

32
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,380
what an emotion is.

33
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,940
What we were thinking is that
if you separate those questions,

34
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:03,960
just like in envision,
um,

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,580
at first people dealt with the
phenomenology of vision and what,

36
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,380
you know is my experience of yellow,

37
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:13,400
like your experience and be yellow
or and so forth. But when people,

38
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:16,490
and those are, those are
important questions, but two,

39
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,820
they start to really make progress when
they start to get computational about it.

40
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:21,620
And so we want it to think,
well,

41
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:25,670
what would it be to have a computational
approach to emotion with the notion

42
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:29,480
that at some point you'll understand the
phenomenology but maybe maybe doing the

43
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:31,400
computational part first would help.

44
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,780
So, uh, what I would say is that, yeah,

45
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,530
the thing about evolutionary psychology,
which is perhaps not widely appreciated,

46
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,650
is that it's very theoretically
principle that, uh,

47
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,250
is this, uh, the, the other westerners
psychological approach to a whole ocean.

48
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,733
Uh,

49
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,260
hello.
Straight forwardly yeah.

50
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,340
Out of, uh, you know,

51
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,170
out of an analysis of how a brain,
which is a,

52
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:03,130
consist of a lot of different
problems and solving mechanisms would,

53
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,920
or evolutionary time
confronted again and again, we,

54
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,120
with even situations like fighting or
having to form a meat shop or dealing with

55
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:14,170
sexual infidelity or all
these different situations,

56
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,270
if the mind is full of
different mechanisms,

57
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:21,200
like your smart phone is full of ass.
Okay. Each one of her function, uh,

58
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,350
they won't all be turned
on. Uh, always, uh,

59
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,400
in all situations, right? Some
situations where you are, uh, you know,

60
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:35,401
there's a perimeter around more you
have to turn off the vigilant system.

61
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,110
You have to increased heart rate because
you're going to have to flee if you

62
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:40,410
identify which direction
the present Cruz in it's on.

63
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,770
So it's a what emotions are,

64
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,210
are there modes of operation or a,

65
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,830
an orchestration of all the different
mechanisms turning some off,

66
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,130
turning assignments in particular
situations which are particularly well

67
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,590
designed to deal with the challenges
of keeping the situation. Um,

68
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:03,490
and so for example, if somebody is
taking your stuff with beating you up,

69
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,110
then uh,

70
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,740
anger Russian system turns on you need
to defend yourself. You need to, uh,

71
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,640
uh, perhaps the cap, the
other person. Um, and uh,

72
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,260
so that's going to be very different
than what you would do if you're dealing

73
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:20,640
with your newborn and trying to make
sure that it's going to be fat, right?

74
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,640
So not just the physiology changes,
that's just one set of mechanisms,

75
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,730
but all sorts of other things.
Uh,

76
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,300
in terms of memory is almost every
feature speecher of psychology.

77
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,550
Your name will be tweaked,
uh,

78
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,620
into a mode which is the
evolutionary longterm best. Yeah.

79
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,510
Dealing with that kind of situation.

80
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,081
Thank you.

81
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:45,470
So actually I wanted to ask you both a
bit more about your research here. I mean,

82
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,160
you're both well known for pioneering
this evolutionary approach to

83
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:50,420
understanding emotion.

84
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,930
And you've already alluded a bit to some
of the fundamental principles of this

85
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:54,740
approach,

86
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,580
but I wondered if you might just say a
bit more and as well as how do we define

87
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:02,090
what an emotion is according to an
evolutionary approach that makes it unique

88
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:03,110
from this perspective?

89
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,820
Well, we, we think of it as a,

90
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,250
as a super word program
that when it kicks in,

91
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,900
they're happening situation detectors,
parts of the system that say,

92
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,460
am I in this particular situation?
So for example,

93
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,880
is it a recurring thing,
something that's happened,

94
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:23,120
a lot of no particular local situation,

95
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,980
the threat by a Predator or somebody
treating me badly or somebody has treated

96
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:32,300
me much better than I
ever expected and I'm,

97
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,090
I'm grateful and how then do y?

98
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,110
How then should I deal with that
person? That's what when we buy, buy,

99
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:44,120
buy situation, it should be
trigger a whole set out a
signal. Maybe part of that,

100
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,810
maybe part of our conscious experience
of emotion is the experience with that

101
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:49,130
signal.
I don't know.

102
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,880
But that's one hypothesis.

103
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,730
But to a lot of different
mechanisms that are honing.

104
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:59,570
So let's say let's take the
simplest of um, it's dark,

105
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:02,450
you're alone and there are
creaking noises outside

106
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,780
whether somebody is coming
break into your house or not.

107
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,230
Lots of things change.
Your hearing becomes more acute.

108
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,430
You notice sounds that you
would never have noticed before.

109
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,500
Inferential processes get turned on.

110
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:22,040
So was that a random set
of noises or was that,

111
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,570
what steps do you remember?
Uh,

112
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,190
you retreat from memory is all kinds of
information that is relevant to figuring

113
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:35,420
out whether you're under threat or
not under threat and what to do. Um,

114
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,290
you might have, uh, you know, um,

115
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,260
it might change some of your learning
settings. I'm learning mechanisms,

116
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:45,650
lots of things that might be changed. So
if you can think of it as a coordinated,

117
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,160
a supportive program that coordinates
a lot of sub programs in a way that's

118
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:51,500
particularly efficient for
solving that adaptive problem.

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,540
But it doesn't have to be something as,

120
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,100
as simple as the Predator situation.
It can be,

121
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,660
there are a lot of interest in
social emotions, um, that can be,

122
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,460
that have to be there to regulate the
kind of complicated social interactions

123
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:09,290
that we have,
including cooperative ones,

124
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:14,300
lots of times people focus and an
evolutionary point of view on, on, um,

125
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,680
negative emotions. Um, and those are
certainly, those are very important.

126
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,710
But once I gratitude and, and, um,
you know, gratitude, compassion, uh,

127
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,160
and so forth are as important in
regulating cooperation, for example, as,

128
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,530
as we would argue. Angerness. Um,

129
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,170
all right. So I was going to ask,
you know, from your perspective,

130
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:37,490
do you feel like this framework applies
to particular class of emotions or you

131
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,110
know, all emotions broadly? I mean,

132
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:42,170
you're bringing up things as diverse
as gratitude, anger and fear.

133
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:48,080
Yeah. So, um, yes, we think
it applies to everything.

134
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,060
Is it realistic as possible?
Uh,

135
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,930
so if you start out as Darwin did,

136
00:07:56,931 --> 00:08:01,450
looking at emotion from the perspective
of facial expressions, okay. Uh,

137
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,330
that's, uh, that's a very good start.

138
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:08,900
But that really limits you because whether
or not an emotion will be paired with

139
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:12,770
a facial expression, a depends upon
over the evolutionary long term,

140
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,540
whether it was big of broadcast
your internal state or not. Okay.

141
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,523
So we have

142
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,180
a small number of facial
expressions of emotion and we,

143
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,430
I think there's a much larger number of
emotions which are not designed to be

144
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:32,990
broadcast and therefore didn't devolve
this signal that tells you to tell

145
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:35,720
everyone around you. I am in this
particular state of mind. Okay.

146
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,590
So some of them, if they're maybe
negative aspects to broadcasting them,

147
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,890
other emotions, it may be the juiciest no
utility to. So for example, wonder, um,

148
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,890
it may be that certain emotions are
there to help organize your adaptations,

149
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:54,120
to calibrate them and organize them in
certain ways. When you see something, um,

150
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,730
certain kinds of events,
uh,

151
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,330
like a sunset or the stars,
um,

152
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,980
those may be part of what those may
be is a system designed to calibrate

153
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,300
mechanisms in your brain. It's
a very unromantic but, uh,

154
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,090
to calibrate mechanisms of vision and,

155
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:15,450
and color perception and so forth
on evolutionarily recurrent events,

156
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,030
things that we're reliably
present in the ancestral path.

157
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:21,380
It could be used to sort
of tune mechanisms, um,

158
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,760
didn't get two of them in the face of a,

159
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,680
the noise of the world as a
simple idea about this is that,

160
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,630
uh, in broadcasting there are test
patterns in the function of it.

161
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:35,880
Test pattern is too, you already
know what the signal should be,

162
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,210
so then you can treat your equipment
until you see the signal, you know,

163
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:43,860
you should see, okay. And
revolutionary time always been stars.

164
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,580
Okay. And, uh, so, uh,

165
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,270
the mind knows what they should look
like and therefore if you don't have

166
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:54,030
anything better or more important to do
and you're a hunter gatherer or sort of

167
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:56,940
sitting around at night, okay. Uh,

168
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,070
it's kind of mildly rewarding to
look up at the stars. Okay. And, uh,

169
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,720
and then these things,

170
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:07,800
an infinite optical distance allow
the different revenue topic mass to be

171
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:10,830
aligned and so on. So it's, so in general,

172
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:15,120
the aesthetics should be things which
help the brain organizes itself and to pay

173
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:19,840
attention to, we'll hope to organize
it. And it should be a mildly,

174
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,233
mildly

175
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,600
pleasant because you want to do it,
but you don't, it shouldn't, you know,

176
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,730
uh,
you shouldn't ignore predators.

177
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:32,910
You shouldn't be more the hunger
crowds of your child for it. Okay.

178
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:36,850
It should be just the right level when
you have nothing better to do. Right.

179
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:43,090
So I mean, when you start thinking about
it from an ad, a patient's perspective,

180
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,430
not all emotions are going to be there
for the same kind of class of problem.

181
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:50,830
Some might be there for very,
very different reason.

182
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,590
And also some things that we don't
think of as emotions might be.

183
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,570
Well thought of as emotions.
Like when you have, when you, uh,

184
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,900
when you get a concussion in your,
um, what's the word I'm looking for?

185
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,840
Hold on when you're in a coma.
Thank you. Okay, so this is works

186
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,350
she fair. When there were
no or traumas. Right. Right.

187
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,730
Yeah. Licensing. Right.

188
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,150
So,
so you shouldn't,

189
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,170
because there might be internal injuries
and moving around with aggravate them.

190
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,310
You shouldn't be not moving at all. Okay.
And you shouldn't be exerting energy.

191
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:25,000
You're getting excited by other events
that are happening. So the shuts down,

192
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,460
it's a very organic homa
is very organized. Okay.

193
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,280
And we just think of it this
bad ramifications of the
remainder of people who,

194
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,960
uh, unfortunately never leave the state
because they're so damaged. Okay. Right.

195
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,070
Right. But for most people in situation,
so, so you're, you're, you know,

196
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,620
basketball hits you in the head
and you're knocked out. Okay.

197
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:50,740
That's this system. Uh, and that's
when I was talking earlier about, uh,

198
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,690
starting with facial expressions of
emotions, which is a great to start,

199
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,010
but there's these other things
which have nothing to do with, uh,

200
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,500
signaling to others. And, uh, so
there's a great class of emotions.

201
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:05,350
He was Accenture to talk about addiction
because you don't have a feeling, right.

202
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,860
But, uh, either, so you don't have the
expression to me, I have a feeling,

203
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,590
but it's an, it's a mode of
operation for the whole system.

204
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,950
It's, it's, you can think of
it as a super order program.

205
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,610
It's just down a lot of different
programs so that all the energy can be put

206
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,340
into your immune system
and into prepare processes.

207
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,540
So weirdly on this perspective of
subordinate programs that are coordinating

208
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,220
other ones, you could think
about Komatsu with emotion,

209
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,980
which is not nine Twitter, but uh, it's
fascinating to think of it that way.

210
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,263
Yeah.

211
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,020
So how would you classify then those
emotions that really do need some sort of

212
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:40,410
external display, you know, to
signal something to other people.

213
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,690
And what would be those emotions
that really don't require that? Are,

214
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:47,670
you talked about wonder or what people
call off this idea of a coma in it and it

215
00:12:47,671 --> 00:12:51,020
keeps them anchor. Um, we've
been working, uh, with,

216
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,800
with a lot of our collaborators like
Erin Cell and they know Caesar on, yeah,

217
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,690
Chin. That anger is, I'm triggered
by the perception of somebody.

218
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,260
Somebody is putting much too little
weight on your welfare more too.

219
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,470
They're not taking your welfare into
account to the extent that you think that

220
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:09,720
they should be given the
nature of your relationship.

221
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,700
And that that should exactly trigger
a whole bargaining and anger as a

222
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:17,280
bargaining system where you're,

223
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,290
that operates in both cooperative and,
and, and aggressive sort of situations.

224
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,180
But where you were,
if it's a cooperator,

225
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,140
you need to communicate to them
that you don't like what they did,

226
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,510
that it impose costs on you,

227
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:34,520
that they impose costs on you for a
very little benefit to themselves. No.

228
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,590
And that, that's not okay. And you,

229
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:42,360
your bargaining basically it activates
all kinds of desires to argue with and

230
00:13:42,361 --> 00:13:46,380
can talk to the person to
argue, to bargain for better
treatment in the future.

231
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,740
So you have basically two ways to bargain
and one way is to say along with the

232
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,710
costs on me, okay, and then you
pay attention to what I want.

233
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:00,270
Or the other way is in a cooperative
relationship. Uh, you know, it's,

234
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,250
it's conceivable we haven't
experienced ourselves,

235
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:04,890
but sometimes husbands and wives fight.
Okay.

236
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,280
Never,
never

237
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,860
doesn't mean you're going to
shoot each other ninth each other.

238
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:14,180
It's that you're in a relationship.
So what marketing power, uh,

239
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,390
so harmony power in a
nonprofit relationships is
this ability to harm the person

240
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:25,310
who can affect more harm, stronger and so
on. They have more liver leverage. Okay.

241
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,090
Uh,

242
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,140
but in Walker relationships where you
were coordinating your behavior to achieve

243
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,260
a great mutual outcomes, okay. One,

244
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,540
the bargaining power is the extent they
can confer with Walt benefits. Okay.

245
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,430
And so what the what and the anger,
again, cooperative relationships. It's,

246
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,360
it hasn't seen water as a thing except
what you're doing is, you know what,

247
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:52,410
when somebody's spouse also their base
Chile and it's one that's the external

248
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:56,800
signal, um, uh, or even beyond that, okay,

249
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,640
but that's the external signal that from
them broadcasting that they think you

250
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:04,880
haven't put enough weight on their welfare
and therefore they're going to down

251
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:07,160
regulate the amount of
weight they put on your role

252
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,550
or that there better be a good
reason why they didn't do it.

253
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,630
Hopefully it was for a very large benefit
to the other person. If they weren't,

254
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,450
if they were doing something
that was harming you or not,

255
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,850
taking your welfare can counsel
that needs to be communicated.

256
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:24,330
If it's not communicated, the whole
point of that adaptation patient can't,

257
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,300
the function cannot be fulfilled
unless there's some sort of a bribe.

258
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,480
And it may be also often
what does it paints?

259
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:35,280
Anger is information that we're,
that's conveyed where you realize, oh,

260
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:38,290
the person did not, it's not that they
put two little weight on my welfare,

261
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,930
it's that I misunderstood the situation.

262
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,990
They didn't know they were putting a
cost on me where they didn't do it on

263
00:15:42,991 --> 00:15:46,410
purpose or they did it for a
very large benefit to themselves,

264
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:49,940
not for something trivial. And then that,
that just, it just sort of the ANC grows,

265
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:51,650
it disappears

266
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,180
that one.

267
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,160
But that's sort of the system we're
putting weight on each other's welfare,

268
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,380
that those being tied together.
So,

269
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,070
hmm.
MMM.

270
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,490
The wind that, uh, it's a, it's
a delicate interplay and uh,

271
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,370
so each essential, so, so anger, which
seems like a hostel, bad thing. Uh,

272
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,360
and, uh, you know, team has
to be connected to violence,

273
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:19,060
which would be hard bargaining. Okay. Uh,

274
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,860
actually it's also essential to
cooperation because people make mistakes.

275
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,030
Information processing makes mistakes.
There's always errors. Okay. And so, uh,

276
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,560
it's,
uh,

277
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:34,890
necessary to communicate your volumes
where things are happening that are not

278
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,610
what you expected in
Muladhara. Okay. And so then,

279
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,220
then you then in fights, people
are, it turns out there are,

280
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,730
are all the gear and sell with this
theory has looked at arguments and the

281
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:50,500
arguments structure or things like,

282
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,110
uh,
you know,

283
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,640
you hurt me a great deal.
Uh,

284
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,640
I didn't intend to or you
don't have your stand, uh,

285
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:05,420
I didn't realize that was
important to you. Or alternatively,

286
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,350
you don't understand the full importance
to me of having to do this other thing.

287
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,460
So it's always about the relative costs
and benefits and knowledge states.

288
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,400
And these are acronyms are hurt.

289
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,333
All right?

290
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,450
You can think of it as there
being a grammar to anger
and had the grammar to it.

291
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,180
And that people,
when they're arguing and negotiating the,

292
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,900
they use that grammar both in arguing
with the person that they think harmed

293
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:29,800
them and with a person responding to them.

294
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,970
The nature of these evolved mechanisms
are their second name or their first

295
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,550
nature to us rate. Uh, and uh, uh,

296
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,580
so we're not necessarily aware
of they're watching. Okay.

297
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:45,581
So you can do this highly organized
thing in a fight with your spouse and not

298
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:51,030
know anything about the, your
company. Okay. You feel it.

299
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,940
It's guiding you in certain ways.
It brings up certain concepts.

300
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,730
You remember all the times they didn't
put, we don't and welfare in the past.

301
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,310
You see, it's part of the pattern for
the times. Like really, really helpful.

302
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:07,120
That's great. Right. So I had a
question for both of you to, which is,

303
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:10,600
what are the questions right now that
you're grappling with and most excited

304
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:12,100
about in this domain of,
you know,

305
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,610
emotion and taking an evolutionary
approach to studying it? Well,

306
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,930
many of the things you've been
talking about. Yes. But, uh, the more,

307
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,450
a more general perspective,

308
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,070
this whole idea of bringing the emotions
into the cognitive sciences and,

309
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,990
and trying to get serious about
the computational architecture of,

310
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,160
of emotions so that the top of emotions
is as normal a part of the cognitive

311
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:42,151
sciences as a study of memory or the study
of attention is because I wa from our

312
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:47,140
point of view, you can't pull these
things apart. They're all intertwined.

313
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,480
They're all that they're
not only intertwined,

314
00:18:49,481 --> 00:18:53,830
but there is a computational account of
emotion and you won't fully understand

315
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:57,780
emotion without understanding that in
the same way that you would not fully

316
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,260
understand vision if you were only dealing
with phenomenology and you were not

317
00:19:02,261 --> 00:19:05,680
dealing with the computations that allow
people to recognize objects and know

318
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:07,900
where they are.
If you didn't know those compensations,

319
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:10,810
you wouldn't really understand vision.
Totally.

320
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,300
So to make that concrete,
uh,

321
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,610
we think there are certain things we
follow internal regulatory variables like,

322
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,310
okay, uh, I, I'm the weight.

323
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:24,850
So implicitly my brain is calculating a,

324
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:27,730
what's the word of this other person
that they're putting on my welfare?

325
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,790
When it's too low, then the brain
triggers, which you going to the anger,

326
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,723
uh,

327
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,640
anger turns on it as a bargaining of
ocean is designed to raise the other

328
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:42,520
person's a walkup trade off towards you.

329
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,970
Or if that doesn't happen to
lower years towards standards,

330
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,930
but you're not wasting resources on
more energy on somebody who doesn't care

331
00:19:49,931 --> 00:19:51,940
about you. Okay. Uh, then there's,

332
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:56,820
but at the same underlying variable
welfare tradeoff ratio in yields,

333
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,670
for example, that would be
men, you didn't, you, uh,

334
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,610
something you conduct yourself in
a certain way towards somebody.

335
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,390
It turns out that was really much
worse for them than you expected.

336
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,890
And then you need to be calibrated,
uh,

337
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,780
how much weight you put on your welfare
because you opening to level two level,

338
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,330
uh, well grounded gratitude is where you
find somebody else's but is putting on

339
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,650
larger way done with your welfare
than you've expected and anticipated.

340
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,570
And therefore you need to reciprocate.

341
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:27,990
Turn up your thumb tr your
ballpark trade off print shows,

342
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,840
no to just submit this new
higher level of cooperation.

343
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:37,290
And so and so the idea is to map these
magnitudes and the mind in which we now

344
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:42,510
we can do now and relate them to the
logic of emotions that emotions often play

345
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:46,500
its role and recalibrating your,

346
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,760
what you're prepared to do or the other
person where your response together

347
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,330
person. And that's why, that's why
we think there's this small app.

348
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,360
Phenomenology is there's
a sort of rob casting,

349
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,820
which she dealt the mechanisms to say,
change your settings on,

350
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,480
on this network of variables because you
have new information about the way the

351
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:11,050
world is.
And it takes time to feel okay,

352
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:13,270
so when your mother dies
or something like that,

353
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,780
people want to go away and be alone.
And just,

354
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,750
and so any utilitarian unit,
Darwinian Utilitarian University,

355
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,190
why engage in such spectacular?
We done functional behavior.

356
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,720
Our idea about offices
and some calibration, uh,

357
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:32,680
requires a lot of process and it takes
time to all the ramifications of the fact

358
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:35,730
that it, this person was a separate part
of your life and now they're gone. Sure,

359
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,730
sure.

360
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,240
All the different ways in which that
was reflected in your decisions at all,

361
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:45,090
has to be rerated maybe down new
support would you didn't have before.

362
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:47,410
So you can feel lonely or anyway,

363
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,780
such, just the question then when you
think about the future of emotion, right?

364
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:54,120
And you have students coming
up to you and asking you,

365
00:21:54,121 --> 00:21:58,240
so what's in store for the future and
you know, what advice do you have for me?

366
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:00,270
You know, if I'm thinking
about embarking in this field,

367
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,130
what do you typically tell them?

368
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,640
Okay.

369
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,150
I suggest to them that while they,
they,

370
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:11,600
if they use your intuitions as, as, uh,

371
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,290
as some guide, but really try
to take very seriously, uh,

372
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,570
the kinds of thinking seriously about
the kinds of adaptive problems our

373
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:23,710
ancestors had to solve well
in ancestral environments.

374
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,170
Because if you really start
to take those seriously,

375
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,040
you realize that they're
much more complicated than
you would otherwise think.

376
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:34,210
And it can lead you in new directions
that nobody would think to look before.

377
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,330
So that and,

378
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,340
and also to actually try to get very
specific about what that the architecture

379
00:22:41,941 --> 00:22:43,180
of those programs is going to be.

380
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,710
That's great advice.
Same advice from your end.

381
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,720
Absolutely. I mean it's,
as I say, it's very,

382
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,790
you could make a surprising amount of
sense of the chaos of human behavior if

383
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,790
you take this engineering
first principles approach it.

384
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,253
Mm.

385
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,880
What are recurring out adaptive problems
and what would a assistant as well

386
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,820
designed to deal with those.

387
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,080
And then in the modern world we have
often completely different problems.

388
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:18,500
And so the behavior looks non functional
or strange or why, why have that?

389
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,670
And uh, but then you can,
when you look at the logic,

390
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:25,660
you could make sense that that organize
it again around this engineer can spill

391
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,830
it makes enormous sense. And then you
can then explore questions of like,

392
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,010
well then what?
Like what can we,

393
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,030
can we do a little bit of a better with
the world if we understand actually, uh,

394
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,020
principles of your driving

395
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,480
well and even questions like, are certain
things that are considered disorders,

396
00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:44,960
are they really disorders?
Are they the normal functioning of a,

397
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,740
that evolved to do, to
behave in certain ways, to,

398
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,940
to create certain kinds of mental states.

399
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,090
And there are questions like that
about grief and about certain kinds of

400
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:58,070
depression. There can be very destructive
forms of all of these things. Um,

401
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,220
but it's an,
it's an interesting question.

402
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,300
Are we seeing an extreme form of
something that's really an evolved that a

403
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:09,580
patient or are we seeing
a disorder, uh, true, um,

404
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,130
dysfunction of an adaptation. And that
can be very helpful in thinking about,

405
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,950
about whether and how to treat

406
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,920
with depression. For example. You
could just see it as a malfunction,

407
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:26,750
but it might be that it's
a major recalibration will
load so that you've lived

408
00:24:26,831 --> 00:24:30,010
your life in a certain way with certain
expectations would need somewhere and

409
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:33,350
then you get this big signal that's not
happening and invested in a marriage or

410
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:34,720
even best,
you know,

411
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,830
you've spent your life trying to get a
in the academia and then you can't get a

412
00:24:38,831 --> 00:24:40,210
job. Uh, okay.

413
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,650
So all the ways you organize your life
on a daily basis in the intermediate

414
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:47,110
values, your grain in
storage to do certain things.

415
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,130
You now have this powerful signal that
those were a major seventh mistakes. Okay.

416
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:55,690
And so maybe, uh, we have
no evidence about this,

417
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,360
but it's quite possible
that interfering with, uh,

418
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:04,620
the recalibration process by drugs or
something you might come out better if you

419
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:09,550
go through a, we used to have grief
stage of doing this processing. Um,

420
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:14,050
and uh, rather than to
simply think it's unpleasant,

421
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,300
we should arrest it.
Of course.

422
00:25:16,301 --> 00:25:21,260
What I think the major or
the major depression might
be something else entirely

423
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:25,540
aware of things that would have brought
you out of bed to ancestrally don't

424
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:27,760
happen. And I'm not saying
depression is a bit necessary.

425
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:31,510
I'm just saying you want to understand
the logic of been things are doing or

426
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,673
about functions.

427
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,050
Well,

428
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:37,350
I just want to say thanks to both of
you for making the time to speak today.

429
00:25:37,351 --> 00:25:41,370
It's been such a pleasure and honor to
hear you both speak about some of these

430
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:45,180
fundamental principles underlying
where our emotions come from and what

431
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:48,930
functions they serve for us. So I want
to thank you both for speaking today.

432
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,870
Our pleasure,
and thanks for having us.

433
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,460
So this concludes our experts in emotion
interview with doctor [inaudible] and

434
00:25:56,461 --> 00:25:59,520
doctor John tooby from the University
