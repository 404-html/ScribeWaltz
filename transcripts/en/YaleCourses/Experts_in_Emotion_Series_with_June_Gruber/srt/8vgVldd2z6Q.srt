1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,040
Welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,650
Today we're going to be talking about
emotions as they relate to ourselves.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,460
And we're going to be doing this by
first answering the question of what are

4
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:13,620
self conscious emotions.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,730
So how many of you
recognize this painting?

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,620
So for those of you who don't,
this is a painting called narcissist,

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,923
a narcissist.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,140
And the story of narcissists as depicted
in this painting tells us a young man

9
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:31,710
who falls in love with his own reflection,
gazing upon it.

10
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:36,510
As you can see in the water and modern
emotion theorists use this painting of

11
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:41,511
narcissists as a classic example of when
there's perhaps pathological levels of

12
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:46,380
self conscious emotions.
Too much of an emotion like pride.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,610
And this is an emotion we'll be
discussing in class today. Um,

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,540
sometimes when people are thinking of
what our sort of modern kind of pop

15
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:59,490
culture, you know, contemporaries
of narcissist, I don't
know if the sunglasses,

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,150
um,

17
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,920
make you think of anyone in particular
for me and for many others out there when

18
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:09,180
they see these sunglasses, they think
of one of the pop culture. Um, you know,

19
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:10,320
songwriters of our day,

20
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:15,321
Kanye west who said in one of his songs
there's a thousand of use and only one

21
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:17,064
of me.

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,140
So let's think about this theme of self
conscious awareness and what kinds of

23
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:27,141
emotions my we experience when we're
really thinking about ourselves and how we

24
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,250
relate to the social world around us.

25
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,140
This is the realm of self conscious
emotions that we'll talk about today. Um,

26
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,610
a lot of this work has really
been pioneered by some of
the people you see here,

27
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,310
Jessica Tracy,
Richard Robbins,

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,250
and it's funny to see someone else
named June but June price tangy.

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,440
So they edited this book called the Self
conscious emotions theory and research.

30
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,100
Um, and this really contains
a lot of readings that
you'll see within the course.

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,940
I'm really drawing on the wide
scope of work in this field,

32
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,100
linking the self to how we feel.
So here's our roadmap for today.

33
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,180
We'll start out by really reviewing
what are the central features of self

34
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:10,260
conscious emotions.

35
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:13,800
So how are they different from some of
the emotions we've discussed thus far?

36
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,770
Like anger, sadness, happiness,

37
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,380
what is really different
about these emotions?

38
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,490
Then we'll go through some examples
of self conscious emotions followed by

39
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:26,190
takeaway questions and our
expert interview for the day.

40
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,290
So let's first start by defining some
features of really what makes an emotion

41
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,360
self conscious in the first place.

42
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,770
So when we think about the features
of self conscious emotions, um,

43
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,590
one of the first kind of core features
is that they involve a sense of self

44
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,690
awareness or the ability to have a
mental representation of I or me.

45
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,890
And so if you have a sense of yourself,
of the eye of the me,

46
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,500
then you have this ability
to be aware of yourself,

47
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:57,330
to have a sense of self knowledge,

48
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,050
which is absolutely in order to
experience self conscious emotions.

49
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,760
So since the first sort of central
feature of what makes up a self conscious

50
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:10,120
emotion experience and
there's others as well.

51
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,500
So the second feature that's really
different and unique about self conscious

52
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,480
emotions is that they are not innate.

53
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,840
These are not emotions like those
we've seen before, like you know,

54
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:23,680
sadness and crying or happiness
that emerge really early in life.

55
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,490
These are things that actually take
time to develop mentally emerge.

56
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,120
And here you can say see that they
don't emerge early in life as infants,

57
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,950
but they actually seem to come on much
later. So they emerge later in childhood,

58
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:38,080
often by the age of three.

59
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,490
So we're not seeing a sense of self
or awareness as well until that age.

60
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:43,540
So it's no surprise,

61
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,290
no surprise that we would see these
emotions as well take flight as soon as

62
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:51,670
they're just a mental representation of
the sense of self, a sense of I or me.

63
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,980
The third feature that's really important
about self conscious emotions is that

64
00:03:56,981 --> 00:04:00,040
they also help facilitate social goals.

65
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,540
So they're really central not only to
sort of understanding one's sense of self,

66
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,220
but also to one understanding one sense
of self within a broader sort of social

67
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:11,140
group or social here.
Archi.

68
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:16,300
And so they play this really critical
role in helping us establish and maintain

69
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:21,301
these delicate social bonds and
relationships that we live as human beings

70
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,840
living in a social environment.
So in order to be social creatures,

71
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,430
one component that helps us
sort of navigate those, uh,

72
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,280
sort of waters is having the
experience of self conscious emotions.

73
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:37,550
And we'll go into that
more in just one bit. Um,

74
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,100
an interesting feature of
self conscious emotions,

75
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:43,790
which seems to really fly in the face
of everything we've talked about so far

76
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:47,390
with respect to emotions, which is
that they have a subjective experience.

77
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:52,070
They have an external, you
know, universally recognizable
behavioral display.

78
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,500
Um, you know, physiological parameters.

79
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,430
One of those three components we just
don't see when it comes to self conscious

80
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:03,320
emotions, at least not yet. We don't
know of any universal facial expressions.

81
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,610
Um, instead it seems that self
conscious emotions really, um,

82
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,450
the way that in which they're manifested
is really this combination of bodily

83
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:16,070
postures and head movements that
there's not just one universal facial

84
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:19,910
expression that can pick out these
emotions that involve a sense of self

85
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:23,810
awareness. And that really helped us
facilitate our social environment.

86
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,620
So you might wonder, well what do self
conscious emotions then look like?

87
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,350
And that will be something we'll talk
about today if we don't see them in the

88
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:32,360
face.
Where do we see them?

89
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,190
The fifth

90
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,590
feature about self conscious emotions is
that they're really cognitively complex,

91
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,890
much more so than the basic emotions
we talked about earlier. Again,

92
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:47,490
the ones that were evolutionary heart,
evolutionarily hardwired like anger,

93
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,970
disgust, sadness, fear and
happiness. So we're fear.

94
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,930
For example, a basic emotion really only
requires you appraising the environment,

95
00:05:56,931 --> 00:06:00,950
it's being threatening or scary self
conscious emotions that we'll talk about

96
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:01,251
later.

97
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:06,251
Like shame and guilt and pride really
require these mark cognitively complex

98
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:09,530
representations. You have
to have, for example,

99
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:12,200
a stable representation
of yourself across time.

100
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,910
You have to have the cognitive ability
to self reflect upon your actions and

101
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:19,570
assess them against your own internal,
you know,

102
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,390
norms and past experiences
as well as sort of, you know,

103
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,530
evaluating against the broader social
norms that are external to the self.

104
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,580
So they are much more cognitively complex
than some of these basic emotions.

105
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,520
Not surprisingly, as we said,
they don't emerge until, you know,

106
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:37,170
later on in life as well
around the age of three.

107
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,840
When you start seeing glimmers of them.

108
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,800
So these are some of the five features
we've talked about that sort of help us

109
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:46,010
begin to understand what
our self conscious emotions.

110
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,160
And here again more much
more cognitively complex.

111
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,380
So we've talked about five features of
self conscious emotions that are really

112
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:54,921
sailing it,

113
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:58,430
kind of pick them out and differentiate
them from some of the more basic

114
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:00,260
emotions we've talked about thus far.

115
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,090
You may be wondering as I've
told you all these teachers,

116
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,720
they'll self conscious emotions.
Well well what are that?

117
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:09,500
It's self conscious emotions and what
are these funny emotions that are more

118
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,980
cognitively complex that don't
emerge until much later in life.

119
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,730
And that really seemed to involve a
sense of self awareness in order to

120
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:17,750
experience them.

121
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,980
So what I want to do now then is walk you
through some examples of what are some

122
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:26,510
of the prime candidates or examples that
have been discussed so far as really

123
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:27,590
kind of you know,

124
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:32,591
your poster child kind of icons for
the family of self conscious emotions.

125
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,590
So here I'm going to walk you through
four commonly discussed self conscious

126
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:42,950
emotions. And there is
follows. This includes pride,

127
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,410
embarrassment, shame, and guilt.

128
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,450
And what I'll do today is just walk you
through brief definitions of each and

129
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:57,560
then what we'll do for the remainder of
our module on self conscious emotions is

130
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:01,310
go into greater depth and, uh,
and each of these four emotions.

131
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,350
So let me give you a brief overview
today of these four really interesting,

132
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:06,800
uh,

133
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,800
examples of emotions that centrally
involved the self and an awareness of

134
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:16,940
oneself within a social group. These are
the family of self conscious emotions.

135
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,460
So let's start here with pride.

136
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:25,130
So what is pride in the first place?
So you know,

137
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:29,780
we think about what does pride look like
and if you look at these photos here,

138
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,610
you know, do you see examples of pride,
um, that are not only evident, you know,

139
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:38,090
in humans that are of the
bodybuilding, you know, variety,

140
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,320
but do we also see them in some
nonhuman primates as well? Sort of.

141
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:46,220
Is there a sense of elevating your sense
of self and sort of displaying your

142
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:50,450
social status that makes up
what the nature of pride is?

143
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,530
Um, and here if we talk about what
are the characteristics of pride,

144
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,190
I break it up into three categories
here with respect to the solicitor.

145
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:00,570
So what triggers pride,

146
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,280
what is the associated behavior of pride
and what are some of the consequences

147
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,840
of experiencing pride?

148
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,230
So pride is typically elicited if we
start here at the far left by some sort of

149
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:14,850
personal achievement or success.

150
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:20,210
So the self has had some
sort of accomplishment that
is really directed towards

151
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,380
yourself. Something good has happened
to you, you've achieved some goal,

152
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,180
you've obtained some reward,

153
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,620
you've gotten some sort of self praise
or recognition and the behaviors we saw

154
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:36,621
earlier in the bodybuilder and even
the chimpanzee seems to signal a way in

155
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:41,360
which you're sort of puffing out
your, your posture, your advertising,

156
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,360
advertising to others that you have an
elevated sense of status. It's like,

157
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:47,580
look at me,
I'm important right now.

158
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,310
And so you're signaling
to others as it says here,

159
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,520
I'm a successful person who deserves some
sort of recognition and perhaps higher

160
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:59,550
status within my social group. So
again, it's this very like, you know,

161
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,730
expanding your posture and
saying, look at me, I'm important.

162
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,530
And the consequence of this sort of
experience and display of pride is thought

163
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:08,730
to be,
um,

164
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,170
sort of focus towards gaining
respect within your social hierarchy.

165
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,210
You achieve something,
you display it,

166
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,630
and that should boost you up within
the social ladder that you live in.

167
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,680
So these are some of the characteristics
of what pride is thought to sort of be

168
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:26,850
about and sort of the ultimate social
goals that it's supposed to fulfill.

169
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
So that's a little bit about pride.

170
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,540
Now let's briefly walk through the
nature of embarrassment here. Again,

171
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,260
we're just going to go through some
of the basic features of what makes up

172
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,370
embarrassment. And I remember in our
very first class we sort of opened up,

173
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,110
you know, the topic of emotion by
having you think about, you know,

174
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,530
an example of a time in your life in
which you made a major social phobia and

175
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:52,740
had this almost painful
experience of embarrassment.

176
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,320
Now what good would embarrassment serve?

177
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,080
Why would we want to be
experiencing it in the first place?

178
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:01,500
And why are we hardwired
or built to be embarrassed.

179
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,470
So here I'll walk you through the
characteristics of embarrassment,

180
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:08,090
just like I did with pride.
So when we think of the solicitor,

181
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:11,970
so what is it that gets pride or
sorry gets embarrassment going.

182
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,620
We see that embarrassing.

183
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:18,240
It gets triggered when an individual
violates some sort of social convention or

184
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:22,830
norm. Again, they transgress. Um,
what is known to be a social rule.

185
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,530
They make a social fo pos.

186
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:28,470
So this could be saying something that
feels really stupid in front of a new

187
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:32,760
colleague or boss. It could be, you know,
just tripping in front of other people.

188
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,230
I always joke that I spill things a lot
like this, you know, Star Trek Coffee Mug.

189
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,250
So you can, you know, spill
coffee on someone. You're
doing something that's not,

190
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,860
you know, within the normal
bounds of social behavior.

191
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,870
And so you feel embarrassed and the kind
of behavior that you display is really

192
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:52,410
intended to let others know that
you know that you made a mistake,

193
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,500
you know you the social pho par,

194
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,530
but that the behavior suggest that you
have the intention or desire to remedy

195
00:11:59,531 --> 00:12:04,270
that social transgression and ultimately
repair your social relationships with

196
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:06,220
others. So it's a way of saying, look,

197
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,490
I know what I did was
socially unacceptable.

198
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:13,360
I'm really sorry I want to repair
this with you. I want to remedy it.

199
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,860
And not surprisingly,

200
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:18,610
what happens when people show
embarrassment displays is that they elicit

201
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:22,150
forgiveness and others they become
more likable. As you can see here,

202
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,100
it elicits laughter and others and
actually makes people trust you more.

203
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,430
So there's been some studies that have
shown that people who are more prone to

204
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:34,570
experiencing and displaying embarrassment
or often rated as more likable and

205
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:38,080
trustworthy by others because in a
sense what you're doing is saying,

206
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,740
I know that I made a mistake and
I want to make things better.

207
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,190
And that makes people feel like they
can trust you and they like you,

208
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:47,020
that when you do violate social norms,

209
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,030
you're going to do something
about it to correct it.

210
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,630
So those are some of the kind of
key features or characteristics of

211
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:56,650
embarrassment.
Now we'll turn to shame.

212
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,400
So what is shame? It's a word that we
use a lot in our daily lives will stand.

213
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,860
I'm ashamed of what I did
or you're ashamed of someone
else. And it seems to be,

214
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:10,570
as you see this quote here that shames
and essential or core part of humankind's.

215
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,350
So it says here,
men cannot live without shame.

216
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,250
A sense of shame is the
beginning of integrity.

217
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,380
So is there something about shame that
pushes us towards more sort of morally

218
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:26,710
righteous or prosocial outcomes?
Well,

219
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:30,190
when we think about shame from a sort
of aspect of science perspective, again,

220
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:34,930
breaking it up by all this sitter behavior
and consequence, we see the following.

221
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:39,931
So things that tend to trigger shame
are committing acts or being in certain

222
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:45,370
situations that trigger you to sort
of negatively evaluate yourself.

223
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,810
Right? Sort of thinking that something
might be wrong with you as a whole,

224
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,700
as a person. So it's kind of
a global evaluation of the
self in a negative light.

225
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,550
Um, some of the behaviors that
are associated with shame, again,

226
00:13:57,551 --> 00:14:01,090
you don't see a characteristic
shame display in the face. Again,

227
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:05,050
what you see as a sense of a behavior
that is intended to sort of make the

228
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,420
person physically appear smaller.

229
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,700
So people hunched over in their posture
and they'll even sort of pull away from

230
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:14,710
the group and sort of go and retreat.

231
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,500
So you can imagine someone
sort of hunched up, you know,

232
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:19,150
in a little ball in the corner.

233
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,440
So it's a sense of making
yourself invisible in the
eyes of others and actually

234
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:26,500
trying to find ways to make
yourself look physically smaller.

235
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:31,180
So then in many ways it's the complete
opposite of pride where you're expanding

236
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:34,600
your sense of self and you're looking
to gain recognition from others.

237
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,650
Shame is you're diminishing your sense
of self physically trying to look smaller

238
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,670
and you're retreating from the group.
And the consequence here is interesting.

239
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:47,230
So it seems that you're less likely to
take any corrective action against what

240
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:49,720
you think is negative about yourself,

241
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,110
but instead you sort of
withdraw and retreat. Um,

242
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:59,000
so Shane doesn't really seem to have the
kinds of pro social consequences that

243
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:03,920
we sipped seen so far with both pride
and embarrassment. So with that,

244
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:07,700
let's turn to our fourth self
conscious emotion, which is guilt. Um,

245
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,030
and I'm sure we can all think of in our
daily lives times in which you've done

246
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:13,520
something that we felt guilty about.
Now,

247
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:16,850
how is this different from feeling
shame about something that we did?

248
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,650
So let's walk through this
really quickly. So guilt, um,

249
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,690
we've all experienced
this in our daily lives.

250
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:27,260
We cannot think of something that
made us feel guilty, but really what,

251
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:31,730
what were the kind of key ingredients
that made up that feeling of guilt?

252
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,040
So here again, breaking it up by a
solicitor behavior and consequence.

253
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,990
What we see is that the kind of core
characteristics of gilts are as follows.

254
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:45,260
So what kind of triggers guilt?
What kind of gets it going?

255
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,790
Is this a negative evaluation
of one's action? So again, here,

256
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,580
you're not negatively
evaluating the self as a whole.

257
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,660
What you're doing is evaluating
some specific action you did.

258
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,610
So for example, if you stole
something, you might have the thought,

259
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,200
I can't believe I store.
Um,

260
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,540
this then sets off a series of
behaviors where you actually become very

261
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,800
motivated to address
or remedy the problems.

262
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:16,430
So maybe looking for ways to return the
item that you store or to find ways to

263
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:21,240
apologize for having stolen
the item as a consequence. Um,

264
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,470
and you'll see this is really different
from what we just talked about in the

265
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:25,580
context of shame,

266
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,320
is that guilt actually does motivate
these kind of prosocial, uh,

267
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,560
you know, good outcomes.
So as you can see here,

268
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:37,940
it's described as motivating good
consequences such as trying to address the

269
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:38,774
problem.

270
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,340
So guilt is interesting because it's about
an action or behavior and really gets

271
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:46,910
the person mobilized to try to do
something about it, to try to correct it,

272
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:48,470
such as this woman who,
you know,

273
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:52,760
maybe he feels guilty because she ate
something from the fridge that she wasn't

274
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,680
supposed to do,
or maybe with someone else's food.

275
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,640
She's going to be more motivated to maybe
do something about that in the future.

276
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,710
And so again,

277
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,700
these are our four main self conscious
emotions that we'll be talking about in

278
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:07,910
the subsequent two modules
where we go more in depth,

279
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:12,620
kind of delve into more deeply the nature
of pride and embarrassment followed by

280
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,060
the really complex nature of shame and
guilt and what ways they're similar and

281
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:19,070
what ways they're actually quite distinct.

282
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,140
And so with that was our introduction
to the world of self conscious emotions.

283
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,870
I want to conclude with
our takeaway questions.

284
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,310
So the takeaway questions for
today, um, are as follows,

285
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:36,050
the first and what you should make sure
you understand here is what are the five

286
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:40,760
distinct features of self conscious
emotions that really make them unique and

287
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:43,910
differentiate them from some of the
more basic emotions that we discussed

288
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:45,830
earlier.
A second.

289
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,220
What are the examples we just talked about
a moment ago of the most for commonly

290
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:55,170
