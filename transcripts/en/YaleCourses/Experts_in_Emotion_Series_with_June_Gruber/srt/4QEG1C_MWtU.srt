1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,950
For our experts and emotion interview.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,000
We will be speaking with
Doctor Nancy Isenberg on
emotion regulation in children.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,980
Dr Eisenberg is a regents professor of
psychology at Arizona State University.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,620
Her research interests
pertained to social,

5
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:18,520
emotional and moral development and
her books include the caring child,

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,480
the roots of pro social behavior in
children and how children develop.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,680
Dr Eisenberg has been editor
of psychological bulletin
and child development

8
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:30,490
perspectives and has received career
contribution awards from the American

9
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:32,110
psychological association,

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,280
the association for Psychological
Science and the International Society for

11
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:37,900
research on behavioral development.

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,790
I now turn to our experts in emotion
interview with Doctor Nancy Isenberg on

13
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:46,630
emotion regulation in children.
So welcome Nancy.

14
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:49,450
Thank you for speaking with us today.
Thank you Jen.

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,320
What I thought might be a nice way to
start off our conversation is to ask you a

16
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:56,350
little bit about what first
got you interested in emotion.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,600
Um,
well,

18
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:02,590
I was still studying
mall development and um,

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,510
back when I started there wasn't
really a field of emotion. Um,

20
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,990
I was studying a moral
reasoning and empathy and um,

21
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,630
assessing empathy back then.
People did it with, uh, people's,

22
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:23,500
particularly children's
self reports to stories.

23
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,780
And make a long story short,

24
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:29,230
we found that wasn't working
very well with children.

25
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,180
And so we just started to,
um,

26
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,940
try to use a nonverbal measures
like physiological measures.

27
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,340
So I had to start reading
the physiological literature
because I was trying to

28
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:46,660
get it empathic arousal, um, and uh,

29
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:50,470
you skin conductance,
heart rate to get it arouse on children.

30
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,620
And that takes you into
the emotion literature.

31
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,650
Also to our work,

32
00:01:56,651 --> 00:02:00,820
we found that there were some kids who,

33
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,110
uh,

34
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:07,110
were more empathic and they were also
seem to be more socially competent in

35
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:11,860
general while the kids who wha,
um,

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,720
bless socially competent,

37
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:18,400
we're more prone to what
we call personal distress,

38
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:21,900
which is the tendency to experience,
um,

39
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,530
averse of emotions when fund it with
someone else's negative emotion.

40
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,010
And so I started thinking
about why this might be,

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,920
and it led me into thinking about the
ability to regulate emotion successful and

42
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:41,020
how that may play out and
children's social behavior.

43
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,530
And so I had to start thinking
about individual differences
and emotionality and

44
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:49,960
also the ability to
modulite that emotionality.

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,320
So it's really coming from the empathy
literature that led me at first a

46
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,870
unbenounced to myself really
into the emotion literature.

47
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,380
So I wanted to then ask you
a few questions about your
research that's been just

48
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:08,090
so influential in this domain. So
I mean, you're widely known for,

49
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:08,391
you know,

50
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:12,950
your pioneering work in
a study of developmental
processes that have been vital

51
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:16,040
for healthy social and emotional
responding and children.

52
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,050
And I wonder from your perspective,

53
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:22,160
what you see as some of the most critical
discoveries in your work on emotion

54
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,420
regulation and children.

55
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,390
Um,
uh,

56
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,210
so I'm not going to
have to do with empathy,

57
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:34,440
but I think we're going to talk about
that a little bit. Uh, so wait on that.

58
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,200
Um,
uh,

59
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:42,290
we tried to differentiate between emotion
related regulatory processes that were

60
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:49,560
more applicable. Um, coming out
of the temperament literature,

61
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,620
there's a discussion of these kinds of
FFO control processes and also processes

62
00:03:55,441 --> 00:04:00,420
that affect behavior.
But seeing the be a little less voluntary,

63
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,410
how do to regulate what
we call reactive control,

64
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,450
like the child who's impulsive
and always approaching,

65
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,050
but has trouble inhibiting that word
child who seems to be very regulated,

66
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:19,050
maybe because they don't,
the sitting still,

67
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,120
they're not getting into trouble,

68
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,480
but the actually overly inhibited
and having difficulty approaching new

69
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:29,550
situations,
dealing with new people.

70
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,940
So I'm what people call
behavioral inhibition.

71
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:36,550
So we've been interested
in these more processes.

72
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:41,370
The kid can easily manage,
like make themselves where you're like,

73
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,020
stop a behavior and make
themselves activated behavior
even when they don't want

74
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:51,021
to voluntarily shift and focus attention
when they have to versus these other

75
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:57,651
kinds of behaviors like impulsivity
and behavioral inhibition where they,

76
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,370
the child seems to have less control,

77
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:07,371
but it does effect in a sense regulate
their behavior and outcomes for them.

78
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,700
And we showed that actually more recently
about statistically we can really

79
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:18,750
differentiate these
two kinds of processes,

80
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,020
but also they provide unique prediction
of psychopathology and a symptoms,

81
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,170
uh, you know, externalizing problems,

82
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:33,171
particularly to some degree internalizing
problems like social withdrawal and

83
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:38,380
anxiety, uh, but also
social competence. Um,

84
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,810
uh, and uh, empathy
and prosocial behavior,

85
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:45,930
other kinds of aspects
of social competence.

86
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,710
So that's one important thing.
Um,

87
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,080
actually when we started doing
the work in the early nineties,

88
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,190
there wasn't really much good
research will be a little,

89
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,500
but there wasn't much good research.

90
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,520
They used measures that assessed something
really close to regulation rather

91
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:11,280
than a general kind of doing
good at everything. Um,

92
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,870
so the early measures off and threw
together emotionality and regulation or

93
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,700
regulation and social competence.

94
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,980
And so we tried to sort out and get
clean or measures and we had longitudinal

95
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:27,530
data and the nine days
and then thereafter.

96
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,980
So we were one of the early people
to document how important these early

97
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:37,490
individual differences in regulatory,

98
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:42,491
these voluntary voluntary regulatory
processes work for predicting outcomes for

99
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:47,150
kids later. Um, for instance,

100
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,480
in our first study we had teachers and
parents just reporting on kids' ability

101
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:55,700
to focus and shift attention.

102
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,890
And we found that it not only related
to kids ability to manage anger at that

103
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:05,510
age, their popularity, the
social competence more broadly,

104
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,280
but it predicted two,

105
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:12,281
four and six years later into the school
setting problem behaviors at home.

106
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,340
So we were surprised how powerful
predictor just these ratings were from

107
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:24,000
teachers and preschool and that really
got us interested in following, um,

108
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,410
the kids and longer and looking at
emotional regulation and more detail.

109
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:36,230
But, um, yeah, so mapping out
some of those pathways, uh,

110
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,510
which a lot of people are doing now,
but people weren't doing it as much then.

111
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,780
I was wondering if you could say a
little bit more about what you see as

112
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:48,380
particularly important about the role
of adaptive and flexible autonomic

113
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:53,381
responding when it comes to
healthy emotion regulation
processes and children as

114
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:57,050
well. Uh, by, I dunno, I'm like,

115
00:07:57,051 --> 00:08:01,010
are you talking physiological?
Yeah, exactly. Oh, um,

116
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,480
well I guess, uh, um,

117
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,620
I was thinking of more automatic, but, um,

118
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,780
well I think,
hmm.

119
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,590
So be more like vago town,
um,

120
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,200
kids who can manage a,
um,

121
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,610
the Bagel system,
which is seen,

122
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,850
it's to do with heart
rate and respiration.

123
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:32,940
And it's seen as a system
that affects kids. Um,

124
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,330
physiological emotion regulation and uh,

125
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,200
kids who have what we call high
day or tone seem to be able to,

126
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,980
um,
they were more flexible system.

127
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:50,240
They can suppress the system so that they,
uh,

128
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,740
arousal rises when need be in situations.

129
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,093
Um,

130
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,370
and it seems to affect the
maybe be related to their
ability to focus attention.

131
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,160
And so it's important that kids be able
to change the attention and the arousal

132
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:13,200
with the context. Um, for instance,

133
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:18,201
focus in on something
strong like shut out other,

134
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,880
uh, aspects of the environment
when they need to. Um,

135
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,453
I'm not,

136
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,560
I don't think we really know very well
how that relates to though Ffo camp.

137
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,330
It does correlate in some studies with
these effortful control processes I've

138
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:38,940
been talking about,
but not that well.

139
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,870
And so I don't think we know enough
about how like the voluntary attention

140
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:51,171
process processes and the ability to
activate and regulate behaviors needed,

141
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,890
we light to those autonomic systems
because the literature is not that

142
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,064
consistent.

143
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,190
It's an important direction for future
years to really parse apart those nuances.

144
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:09,390
Yes. And it, I think it depends
on context. I'm a student of mine,

145
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:12,510
just a did a master's
that's being published,

146
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,230
assume that he found,
for instance,

147
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:21,710
Vagal tone was correlated with measures
of FFO control behavioral measures of

148
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:26,550
self regulation in a laboratories,

149
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,850
a situation only for kids who were shy
because for those kids that seem to be,

150
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:37,950
they really had to bring me after four
control to bear and that situation,

151
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,710
um,
to do well.

152
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,980
And so for them the relationship was
stronger than for kids that weren't shy.

153
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,870
In this laboratory situation it might
be very different and a non laboratory.

154
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,140
Sure.
So

155
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,760
that's really interesting
work you're doing. Um,

156
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,120
it makes me want to ask you also about
another line of work that I think you

157
00:10:59,121 --> 00:11:00,020
alluded to earlier,

158
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:03,590
which is the critical work that you've
conducted on the study of children's

159
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:08,150
capacity for empathy or the ability to
try to really understand the emotions of

160
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:09,560
others in their environment.

161
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,850
And I wondered if you could describe what
you see as the critical role of these

162
00:11:13,851 --> 00:11:17,900
empathy related behaviors and adaptive
social behavior and adjustment.

163
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,203
Um,

164
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,720
well one thing we tried to do and building
on the work of Dan bats and he's a

165
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:31,301
social psychologist was differentiate
different empathy related responses.

166
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,583
Um,

167
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,620
people used to use the word empathy
to refer to just about any emotional

168
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:43,691
response to somebody else's emotion
that wasn't totally off the wall and

169
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:50,210
somewhat related to what the
other person's feeling. Um,

170
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,970
we differentiated empathy,
which we call,

171
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,290
we really make define that is feeling
a highly similar emotion as the other

172
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:03,490
person.
And we differentiated that from sympathy,

173
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:06,850
which is concern for the other person.

174
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,020
So I can feel sadness when you sad,
which would be empathy.

175
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,760
But then if I feel concerned for you,
that would be sympathy.

176
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,080
And then Dan Batson talked
about personal distress,

177
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,320
which is when the emotions
become so aversive that I'm folk,

178
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,640
I like say you're sad and it makes me
anxious and depressed or depressed or

179
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:36,310
stressed and those emotions of us of,

180
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,000
and I focus on myself.
So it's two arousing.

181
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,680
I mean we can all think of times where
somebody is telling us something that bad

182
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:49,150
that happened to them and we can hardly
bear listening because it's making us

183
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:52,150
anxious.
That would be personal distress.

184
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,860
And that differentiation is very
important because they relate to different

185
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,690
behaviors.
Um,

186
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,160
it's the sympathy particularly
and maybe sometimes empathy,

187
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:07,760
but we think empathy often
leads to sympathy. Um,

188
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,850
that relates to helping others
to being more socially competent,

189
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,720
being sensitive and personal distress
actually is associated with trying to

190
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:25,231
avoid the other person that is
evoking the emotion and us and also,

191
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,780
um, is not related to a
better social competence.

192
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,330
Um, uh, I'm getting a cup of coffee.

193
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,620
That's fine. I wonder if I
could ask you about, I mean,

194
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:45,730
this is just really fascinating and I
wanted to ask you about just a third area

195
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:49,360
of are with your work that looks
at the relationship between, uh,

196
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,650
parental emotional express 70 and the
development of children's regulatory

197
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:56,800
abilities and broader kind of
social emotional functioning.

198
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,720
And I wondered if you could speak to
what you see as the most central findings

199
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:06,010
on this inner relationship between a
parent and the emotional wellbeing and

200
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,990
regulatory capacity of the child.

201
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,530
Can I say one more thing about the last
one thing I didn't mention is the lack

202
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:19,000
of empathy and uh, you know, most
kids do experience some empathy,

203
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:24,001
but there's some kids that
don't experience much and
that's the really scary a

204
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,570
situation.
I think.

205
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,440
I'm not experiencing empathy for others.

206
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,500
It seems to be part of psychopathic kinds
of tendencies where kids can be cruel

207
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,080
and manipulative and so forth.

208
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,260
So empathy sensitizes us and maybe often
may inhibit aggression if we started

209
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:50,230
feeling the other's distress when we start
to do something bad to them, hit them,

210
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:53,840
whatever. We're less likely to
do those kinds of behaviors.

211
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,820
So I think empathy can be an
inhibitor of problematic behavior.

212
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,050
Interesting. Um, so on
the parenting issue,

213
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,431
Oh gosh,

214
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:09,050
there's so much one could
talk about depending on what
outcome you're interested

215
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:12,920
in. But if I had to pick, you know,

216
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:15,920
a few most important things,
uh,

217
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,600
and kind of focus more
in on the emotion side,

218
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,510
but other than say aggression
or other kinds of issues. Um,

219
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,230
suddenly parents being supportive,
uh,

220
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,390
being supportive of the child's emotions,
trying to talk about emotions,

221
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,340
at least in this culture,

222
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,590
I should say that some of these parenting
behaviors may not be at work the same

223
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,900
way in other cultures. Um, uh,

224
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:50,950
being sensitive to the child
wants and needs and feelings,

225
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,860
expressing, um, uh,

226
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,900
positive emotion with the child when
dealing with the child when appropriate.

227
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:02,600
Of course, uh, uh,

228
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:05,960
not overly expressing hostile,

229
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:10,730
negative emotions and the
home and interactions with
the child course said you

230
00:16:10,731 --> 00:16:14,690
have to at sometimes and
it's part of everyday life.

231
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,080
But if the home atmosphere is more these
hostile kinds of emotions and warm,

232
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:24,620
supportive emotions,

233
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,360
kids that's associated with a lot
of negative outcomes for children.

234
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,853
Um,

235
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,050
and we guide to kind of
learning to manage emotions and,

236
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,460
uh, being well-regulated
in regard to emotions.

237
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,820
Probably also the, the issue of, um,

238
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,170
discussing coaching children,
discussing emotions,

239
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:49,700
not avoiding,

240
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,920
talking about dealing with
emotions in a natural way,

241
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:57,920
in everyday situations. Uh, you know,

242
00:16:57,921 --> 00:17:02,450
parents can ask the child
why they feel a certain way.

243
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,890
Talk to them about how that's natural.
What can one do about it?

244
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,510
Uh, how can you feel? What can you
do to make yourself feel better?

245
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,840
These kinds of behaviors seem to be
very useful in helping kids learn to

246
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:22,140
regulate their emotions. And in
fact, in John Gottman's work, uh,

247
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:26,870
going back has also been
related to the Spago, uh,

248
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:31,760
tone ability. Um, people call
it our say, by the way, but,

249
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,130
um, it's, uh, the mother,

250
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:38,930
the parents who were high and met her
emotion, able to accept the emotion,

251
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:43,670
talk about emotion, deal with that,
had kids that had better vagal tone.

252
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,810
Um, so it's all interconnected there. Uh,

253
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,780
so would be important.
But you know, parenting,

254
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:58,490
there's lots of aspects that are
important and including reasonable wool

255
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:03,540
setting, high expectations,
not accessibly high,

256
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,070
that it's impossible, but
depending on the outcome, um,

257
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,150
the parent wants also modeling,
I mean modeling empathy,

258
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,510
I mean who knows what
genetics comes in here.

259
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:19,410
But parents that are more sympathetic
have kids that are more sympathetic,

260
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,161
you know,

261
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:24,600
parents that are more prosocial of kids
that are more prosocial part of there

262
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:28,740
may be genetically transmitted but
prob probably part of its modeling.

263
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:34,120
What implications do you think these
signings might have for trying to develop,

264
00:18:34,121 --> 00:18:38,740
you know, emotion focused
interventions for children? You know,

265
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,380
um, well people are already doing, um,

266
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,400
sometimes without calling that the paths
curriculum of Mike Greenberg friends

267
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:52,430
sense is designed to deal
with problem behaviors. Uh,

268
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,293
primarily.

269
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:58,510
But what they do is teach kids about their
own and other's emotions had identify

270
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:03,320
them, uh, what they are, how to, um,

271
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,900
differentiate emotions. What
do you do about emotions? Uh,

272
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,580
um, what are strategies one can use
when you're angry? For instance,

273
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:16,760
of another child?
Uh,

274
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,470
they teach themselves
regulatory techniques like, um,

275
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,610
they have a picture of a stoplight
on a wall and you know, talk about,

276
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:30,380
look at the light, stop, think before
you do something when you're upset.

277
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,640
So I actually,

278
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:36,641
a number of the interventions out
there involve teaching about emotion,

279
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,610
emotion regulation and
they do have some effects,

280
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:44,510
particularly for the kids that
have the most problems. Um,

281
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,320
there's not so many with parenting and
it seems to me that that's an area that

282
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,130
is really ripe for more
research helping there.

283
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,100
I Susan Landry,
he's done some work that teachers,

284
00:19:58,101 --> 00:20:02,210
parents kind of best
practices of socialization,

285
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:06,620
the kind of thing I was just talking
about, being supportive, uh, sensitive,

286
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:11,540
using appropriate discipline and kids
have a number of good outcomes that seem

287
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,370
to,

288
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,610
if you seem to reflect
a better regulation.

289
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,203
Um,

290
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:23,230
but there's very little work where
parents are taught how to coach children

291
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:25,700
about emotions,
teach them strategies,

292
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,550
how to talk effectively about emotions,
um,

293
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,490
these kinds of strategies.

294
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:35,210
So I think that's an area that
could be developed a lot more.

295
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,950
So as you think about where the future
of this field is headed and in what areas

296
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:43,800
could be developed more, what would
you say as you look forward, where,

297
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,770
where are the most important discovery
is going to be going to be and you're in

298
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:48,604
your eyes?

299
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,683
Well,

300
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,940
in the prevention areas we were just
talking about this a lot to be done. Um,

301
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:00,150
I think one could use a lot of this
information more than we currently are,

302
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,530
particularly outside.

303
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:06,160
We're doing a better job in the
schools then outside of the schools.

304
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:06,941
But you know,

305
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:11,941
if the schools are teaching children
about emotions and emotion regulation,

306
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,840
but they have a terrible environment
at home, it probably helps some,

307
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:18,790
but we could do a lot more,

308
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:23,740
probably we could get the
parents to compliment the
school intervention and some

309
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:27,950
people are trying to do that.
But to a very limited degree, um,

310
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,990
obviously the work in the
biological areas is important than,

311
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:34,960
uh,
uh,

312
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,960
no psych and so forth where they're
trying to map some of the circuits to do

313
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:45,220
with emotion, emotion regulation.
How do these all connect?

314
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,430
Um, how do we make decisions then, um,

315
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,500
this is going to be very important and,

316
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,550
and I think it's going to
dominate the field actually.

317
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm thinking it's extremely important,
but I also think it's really important.

318
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:04,441
We don't lose sight of
behavior and the environment,

319
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,050
um, those inputs, uh, genetics
is getting very important.

320
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:15,370
People looking at a genetic
differences related to emotion,

321
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:16,810
emotion regulation.

322
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,220
But we will need to look at how
these interact with the environment,

323
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,930
the home environment,
the school environment too,

324
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,610
because that seems to affect
how the genes play out,

325
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:34,780
the genetic tendencies. Um, and, uh,

326
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:37,780
I think this work is really
the wave of the future,

327
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:41,620
but I'm a little concerned
that the environment and,

328
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,323
um,

329
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:48,390
other aspects are going to get lost
in the rush to find totally mostly

330
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:55,570
biological solutions and,
uh, answers to the questions.

331
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,620
So then what advice do you have for
future students who are thinking about

332
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:03,340
embarking in this area? What
might you tell them? Um,

333
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,550
get his multi-method as you can.
Uh,

334
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:11,020
it's important to learn a whole of ray.
I mean,

335
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,410
I think learning some
about biological measures,

336
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:19,300
learning about behavioral measures.
Um, uh, learning, you know,

337
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:23,200
facial expressions.
There's all kinds of ways to get at these,

338
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,590
the phenomenon related to emotion,

339
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:30,640
emotion regulation and their outcomes.
Um,

340
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,120
so the bladder,

341
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,910
the toolbox you have in terms of methods,
the better,

342
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,630
um, also, uh,

343
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,080
to not just stick to one literature
if had developmentalist we the adult

344
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:49,370
literature of your social psychologist,

345
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,270
the developmental literature is
critical lead the clinic. You know,

346
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:57,680
clinicians are doing a lot of
work, obviously relevant, uh,

347
00:23:57,681 --> 00:23:59,840
the biological areas.
I mean,

348
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:04,040
now we have to be reading papers and
a lot of the biological journals.

349
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,380
Um, you really need to get
cross areas in psychology,

350
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:14,240
but also even in the other disciplines
much more than in the past.

351
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,780
Well, thank you so much for speaking
with us today. Nancy was my pleasure.

352
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,790
So this concludes our experts in emotion
interview with Doctor Nancy Isenberg

353
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:27,820
from Arizona State University.
Thank you so much again.
