1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,710
Welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,620
I want to start out with a quote that
William James said when he was discussing

3
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:11,880
how central the physical body
is to our experience of emotion.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,983
He said,

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,940
no shade of emotion should be without
a bodily reverberation and hear.

6
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:22,170
What he was really emphasizing is that
our physiological responses are heart

7
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:25,950
racing or our palm sweating,
our knees shaking.

8
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:30,330
All of these things are really part and
parcel of what make an emotion in the

9
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:31,230
first place.

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,310
And we talked about this actually very
early in the course and we were sort of

11
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:37,770
reviewing our theories
of emotion through time.

12
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,390
So we began the first part of the chorus
by discussing theory by William James,

13
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:44,760
which was referred to as
the physiological approach.

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,350
And here he argued that feelings and
emotions are actually secondary to

15
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:52,590
physiological phenomena.
In another words, um,

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,780
he took the position eat to even argue
that the essence of what an emotion is is

17
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:59,520
the physiological response.

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,920
And so this is what I want to turn to
today to really question what role does

19
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:07,470
physiology play an emotion?
Our emotions?

20
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:11,580
Nothing without our heart racing
and our palms sweating or are,

21
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:15,780
is part of what makes our emotions
physiology. And if so, in what way?

22
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,560
So today what I want to
turn to is our lecture,

23
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,650
which will really focus on how we can
learn about our emotions by studying our

24
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,751
bodily sensations using the rigorous
scientific tools of aspect of science.

25
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,360
So today let's look at our
heart and ask ourselves,

26
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:36,300
is our heart really a
window into our feelings?

27
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,460
So today we're going to start our first
part of a three series overview into

28
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:44,340
what's called psychophysiology. Um, here,

29
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:47,880
what we're going to be doing is looking
at emotions through the window of bodily

30
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:52,881
responses and ask ourselves whether our
blood and sweat are really a clue into

31
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:56,310
our feelings, our tears, and our fears.

32
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,430
So let's get started with an
introduction to psychophysiology.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,760
So today what we're going to do
is start with our roadmap here.

34
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,740
We'll start by first asking ourselves,
well,

35
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:08,160
what is psychophysiology
in the first place? Second,

36
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,540
we'll go over some basic principles of
how you measure physiological responses.

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,340
As a first kind of first step into
thinking about how we can study emotions.

38
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,330
We need to first understand how we measure
physiological sensations in the body.

39
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,500
Then we'll move on to our,
um,

40
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,120
take home questions followed by our
expert interview today with one of the

41
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:30,380
renowned figures in the field
of psychophysiology sled.

42
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:34,080
Start here by looking at this question
about what is psychophysiology.

43
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,740
So here you can see an article and this,
this is an old newspaper article,

44
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:44,890
but I really love it because what it says
at the top here is electric meter test,

45
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:46,650
skin to gauge emotion.

46
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,580
And what I think is important to take
away from this article is that even long

47
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:53,610
ago, many of us thought that, you know,

48
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,490
there was some way in which
we can measure, you know, uh,

49
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,620
electrical signals in the body,

50
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,070
sweating from the fingertips
as a way to study emotion. Now,

51
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:05,860
back then they were using something
called galvanic skin response,

52
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:10,840
which is also been used as part of the
lie detector. Uh, you know, uh, equipment.

53
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,530
But we know today that there's much
more to gauging emotion through

54
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:18,220
physiological sensations than just
the amount of sweat on our hands.

55
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,700
So where have we come since then?
Well,

56
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,170
here we've come along ways
and as part of this journey,

57
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:30,460
we've really founded a field
called psychophysiology.
And so you may wonder, well,

58
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:33,880
what is psychophysiology in the first
place? And when I want to do here,

59
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,900
share with you a few different
definitions of how various, you know,

60
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:41,680
authoritative figures in the field have
defined the field of psychophysiology.

61
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,570
So you'll see here, one definition
of psychophysiology is the science,

62
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:48,940
which concerns physiological activities,

63
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:52,240
which underlie or relate
to psychic events.

64
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:55,660
And by psychic they mean
psychological, um, you know,

65
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:59,710
not some sort of reading into
a crystal globe here. Um,

66
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,520
then we also see a definition here by
Casio and colleagues where they defined

67
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:07,090
psychophysiology as the
scientific study of social,

68
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:12,091
psychological and behavioral phenomena
as related to and revealed through

69
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,050
physiological principles,
any events in functional organisms.

70
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,150
And then finally we see Alan
and colleagues talk about
psychophysiology has the

71
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:26,590
use of a particular set of physiologically
based dependent or independent

72
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:31,570
variables to gain insights into
psychological questions. Now,

73
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,780
as important as it is to think
about what psychophysiology is,

74
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:38,980
which is a measurement of different
physiological sensations that may map onto

75
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:42,250
important psychologically
relevant processes like emotion.

76
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,060
We also want to be very clear
of what psychophysiology is not.

77
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,920
So psychophysiology is not the same as
what's called physiological psychology.

78
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:53,830
I know it sounds very similar,
but it's actually quite different.

79
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:58,831
So physiological psychology is actually
a subdivision of biological psychology

80
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,600
that studies neuromechanisms of behavior
through direct manipulation of the

81
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:08,620
actual neural tissue in the brain
in these controlled experiments.

82
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,210
Psychophysics psychophysiology is
also not behavioral neuroscience,

83
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,550
so behavioral neuroscience by contrast,

84
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:20,551
as you can see here is the scientific
study of the central neural basis of

85
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:23,020
behavior and mental states.

86
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,550
So one important way in which
it's differentiated from
physiological psychology

87
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:32,551
and behavioral neuroscience is it doesn't
have this exclusive focus on neural

88
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:34,870
tissue or neural basis of behavior.

89
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,650
It's much broader thinking about
the physiological system as a whole.

90
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,810
And in particular a lot
of psychophysiology we'll
focus on the peripheral

91
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,480
nervous system.
So things like your heart rate,

92
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:50,410
your blood pressure as opposed to more
specifically focusing on the central

93
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:53,740
nervous system, which includes
measures of neural activity.

94
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,530
So we're going to now delve
into psychophysiology, um,

95
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,990
by thinking about the pros and cons.

96
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:04,760
So what can we gain from psychophysiology
as budding emotion researchers and

97
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:06,350
what might be some of the limitations?

98
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,410
So if we think about the
pros of psychophysiology,

99
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,970
there's a few we can get around social
desirability, which is this pressure.

100
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:16,760
People have to respond in a certain
way when they're in a study,

101
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,700
especially during questionnaire studies.
Um,

102
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:23,270
they feel like there's a certain right
answer that they should endorse on a

103
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:24,104
given measure.

104
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,880
The other pros of psychophysiology is
that it helps provide information about,

105
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,470
um,
psychological processes.

106
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,340
So about emotion that's relatively
outside of conscious awareness,

107
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:38,660
meaning that it can be pretty difficult
to consciously manipulate your,

108
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,110
your blood pressure or the amount that
you're sweating from the palms of your

109
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,400
hands.
So in this way,

110
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:47,360
psychophysiology really lets you get
outside of conscious awareness and sort of

111
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:51,230
get some of the automatic processes
that are happening when we experience an

112
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:53,720
emotion. And then finally, um,

113
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,960
psychophysiology enables you to identify
how mental states such as feeling

114
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:04,190
fearful or feeling happy are
related to physical health.

115
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,370
So you can look at things like
we've been talking about, you know,

116
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:11,450
cardiovascular functioning, um, you
know, things like blood pressure,

117
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:14,750
we'll talk about things like
cardiac impedance, um, later on.

118
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:19,340
And we can this way also link emotion
as a psychological process to physical

119
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:22,790
health outcomes. So these are some of
the advantages of the psychophysiology,

120
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,380
but like every tool and every field,
there's also limitations.

121
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,640
So some of the limitations are what we
think of as cons of psychophysiology are

122
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:36,170
as follows. So the methods are
sometimes difficult and expensive.

123
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,520
So they're difficult insofar as you're
hooking people up with a lot of different

124
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:41,330
sensors.

125
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,290
Some of them can be uncomfortable for
people and many of them limit the kind of

126
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,650
mobility people have. They're sitting
in a chair, relatively static,

127
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,310
and they can't really move around.
And they're actually quite expensive.

128
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:54,620
So if you're buying some of this
equipment for your laboratory,

129
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,730
you can easily spend up in the tens of
thousands of dollars just getting the

130
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:01,400
equipment there in the first
place to run your study.

131
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:06,620
And there's some controversy on exactly
what we as emotion researchers can

132
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:10,880
actually infer from
the psychophysiological
measures. So for example,

133
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:14,870
as you see here, if you have a higher
heart rate, what does that mean?

134
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,400
Does that mean that you're angry?

135
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,880
Could it mean that you're sad or
is it just a sign of movement? Um,

136
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,170
or maybe someone you know recently
came into your lab after, you know,

137
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,200
taking a jog in their heart is
still pumping relatively quickly.

138
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,760
So it can be hard to know exactly what
you take away just from psychophysiology

139
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,960
alone. So let's think about what
psychophysiology is, what it's not,

140
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:40,840
and the pros and cons as
we now delve into this.

141
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,750
An overview of the autonomic
nervous system. So again,

142
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,810
we know we have the nervous system here.
Okay.

143
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,780
And the nervous system
has two central branches.

144
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,520
So you have the central nervous system,

145
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,160
which includes your brain and spinal
cord and the peripheral nervous system,

146
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,400
which includes all other nerves.
And as I have highlighted here,

147
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:02,760
this is the system that we're going to
be focusing on the peripheral nervous

148
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:06,750
system. This is where psychophysiology
really concentrate its efforts.

149
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,110
And in particular if we look into
the peripheral nervous system,

150
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:13,110
we see that it's also broken
up into two branches itself.

151
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,060
So you have the autonomic nervous system
or the ans which monitors sort of your

152
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:21,990
internal world that kind of carries
out these automatic processes.

153
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,810
And this is contracted with
the somatic nervous system,

154
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:27,060
which is more about
monitoring the external world,

155
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,430
carrying out more voluntary processes.

156
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,560
And here psychophysiology again really
focuses on these automatic processes that

157
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:38,100
are relatively outside of conscious
awareness through the autonomic nervous

158
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:42,000
system and importantly a psychophysiology.
That's what we're really measuring.

159
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:46,230
Then, um, his activity in these two
branches of the autonomic nervous system.

160
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,180
So you have your
sympathetic nervous system,

161
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:52,230
which is really this fight or flight
system that really is geared towards

162
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,760
facilitating energy expenditure as
compared with the parasympathetic nervous

163
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:57,540
system,

164
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,920
which is really this rest and digest or
people call it 10 number friend system.

165
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,250
That's really about facilitating
recovery in energy storage.

166
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,970
So today we're going to be talking about
different ways you can measure activity

167
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,180
in the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous system

168
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,030
as highlighted there.

169
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,730
Now when we get into these two branches
of the autonomic nervous system,

170
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:25,420
the sympathetic neurosystem and
parasympathetics or SNS and pns, um,

171
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,030
we can see a few things here. So
here, if we look into the SNS, again,

172
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:34,570
this is our fight or flight system. It's
very excitatory. What it's focused on, uh,

173
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:39,590
essentially is I'm looking at things
like the release of catecholamines.

174
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:43,440
So epinephrine or norepinephrine
from the adrenal Medulla.

175
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,240
So what it's a sort of
seen as overseeing or um,

176
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,980
you know, directly facilitating
is things like, uh,

177
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,310
increases in heart rate and blood
pressure, slowing your digestion,

178
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:59,100
dilating your pupils.
Essentially what we're seeing is,

179
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,450
as you can see here on the graph,

180
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,710
the sympathetic nervous system is really
about mobilizing your body to either

181
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:07,920
fight or flight. So when there's
a potential danger or threat,

182
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:13,000
it's getting your body ready to expend
energy and potentially run away or um,

183
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,110
you know, confront a particular rival. Um,

184
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:19,500
so really what's happening is it's
shutting down a lot of automatic processes

185
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:22,530
like digestion and really
getting your body mobilized.

186
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,170
Now this is in stark contrast with the
parasympathetic nervous system or pns,

187
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,120
which is focused on this
sort of rest and digest.

188
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,870
So here what we're seeing is the
facilitation of energy storage.

189
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,450
We see a decrease in heart
rate and blood pressure.

190
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,780
We see digestion becoming activated
cause you're sort of at ease.

191
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:43,230
You can now tend to,
I'm digesting food material.

192
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,410
You see contraction of the
pupils and really interestingly,

193
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:49,530
and what we'll talk about further
on his activity of the Vegas nerve,

194
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,000
that many people are now seeing as a
really important of emotion regulation as

195
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:59,800
well as positive emotionality. So
we'll return to that later. Um,

196
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,911
importantly,

197
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:04,990
what you want to know when it comes
to these two branches of the autonomic

198
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,020
nervous system is that they
have different profiles.

199
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:12,700
So there they can sort
of act independently or
orthogonally of one another.

200
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,080
Um, so I just want to put this here for
didactic purposes just so you know that

201
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:20,140
there's kind of four different profiles
you can have at any given time.

202
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,990
And you can be high in one
branch of the nervous system.

203
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:27,260
So high in sympathetic activation and
either high and parasympathetic are low in

204
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:29,080
parasympathetic.
Likewise,

205
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,370
you can be high in parasympathetic
activation in either high or low and

206
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:33,204
sympathetic.

207
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,810
So these are sort of operating in
parallel with somewhat competing goals.

208
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,400
And so they have this sort of,
you know,

209
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:42,010
push and pull relationship
with one another. Um,

210
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,140
that's constantly going on all the time.

211
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,520
So you can have profiles here that are
called reciprocal sympathetic activation.

212
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:51,820
So the stress response co activation,

213
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,560
which is engagement and stress,

214
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,510
which is engaging your regulatory
systems co inhibition or this reciprocal

215
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,190
parasympathetic activation.

216
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,090
So this is what we think of as these
ans interaction profiles. Again,

217
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:07,360
the ways these two different branches
of the audit anomic nervous system can

218
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,890
interact with one another.

219
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,010
And what's really important as we get
started sort of delving into the realm of

220
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:18,460
psychophysiology has to be really
clear on important terminology here.

221
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,890
So let's imagine you
have an experiment here.

222
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,400
So you have your control group and
white and some comparison group in blue.

223
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,140
You have there, um, you know,

224
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,990
physiological response of a
given measure at baseline.

225
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,590
And you also have it in response to an
emotional provocation watching a film

226
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:34,090
recalling an emotional memory.

227
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,120
And there's two terms I want
to be really clear about.

228
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,810
So the first is what's called
physiological reactivity.

229
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,890
So reactivity is really looking
at a change from baseline.

230
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,810
So how much does the control group in
white increase when they're going from

231
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:52,150
their baseline to the emotion provocation.

232
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,650
Likewise with the blue group here to here.
So to compute reactivity,

233
00:13:56,651 --> 00:14:00,190
what you really want to do is compute a
change or what's called different score

234
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,550
between this and this as
well as this and this.

235
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:07,180
So really you're looking at from your
own baseline. When you come into a task,

236
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,460
how much do you either move up or down?

237
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,970
Now this is quite different from
what's referred to as responding.

238
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,270
So responding says,
I don't care about the baseline,

239
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,560
I just want to understand during this
task what the raw responses were.

240
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,920
So put everyone's own
individual baseline aside,

241
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,270
tell me how much responding we saw as
a function of this part of the task.

242
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:32,860
So again, reactivity takes into
account baseline responding does not.

243
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,970
Okay.

244
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,360
Okay. And we'll move more into
this later on in our lecture.

245
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:42,080
But I want to remind ourselves, this is
something we saw earlier in class, um,

246
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,670
which is just that, um, you know,

247
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:48,080
psychophysiology is really important
because it can sort of begin to provide a

248
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:52,730
map or a profile of the landscape
of different ranging from anger,

249
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,570
fear, sadness to discuss and potentially
even happiness at the bottom.

250
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,430
We'll return to this later in the lecture.

251
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,780
But keep this chart in mind as we start
to go through different methods and

252
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:05,690
different measurements and think about
how they can actually inform the way in

253
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:09,710
which our body responds when we're having
different kinds of emotional states.

254
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,200
So with that being said,

255
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,730
I want to now move from
what is psychophysiology
sort of what is the field,

256
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,230
what are the core terms,

257
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,880
what can we learn from it
to sort of getting into how
we measure these responses

258
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:26,780
in the first place. If you're conducting
a laboratory study, where do you begin?

259
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:28,220
What tools do you use?

260
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,310
So now we're going to go on to
this component of measurement.

261
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,460
Yeah.

262
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,850
So I want to think about two different
ways when we talk about measurement.

263
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,340
So one kind of measurement is in the lab,

264
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,880
so you're bringing in participants to
your lab and measuring responses while

265
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:44,714
they're with you.

266
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,500
And we'll talk about this first and
then we'll go to outside of the lab,

267
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:52,760
sort of how you can measure physiological
responses and people's own daily lives.

268
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,830
So let's start here with inside the lab.

269
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,540
So what I want to walk
through or different equipment
and tools that have been

270
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,540
used to measure physiological
responses in the lab.

271
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,540
So I love this here for
historical purposes.

272
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:09,860
So this is one of the earliest models
that was used to measure physiological

273
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:12,200
responses in the lab called
the grasp model seven.

274
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,580
And as you can see at the bottom,

275
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:18,170
and even had the polygraph paper with a
little impendent sort of wrote out the

276
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:22,070
signals as the person was going through
the task. Um, we no longer use these.

277
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:23,420
They're big,
they're cumbersome.

278
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:26,630
You have to actually use
paper to record your data.

279
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,780
We've now moved to much more digitally
based systems and the two major companies

280
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:36,860
out there right now are biopack and mine
were and they're both fantastic systems

281
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:39,290
for measuring physiological
responses in the lab.

282
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:43,040
You can see they have different
amplifiers that read the signals from the

283
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,160
participant and then display them
digitally on a computer monitor.

284
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,750
Okay.

285
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,210
Um, this is a picture from my lab
using, um, as you can see here,

286
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,420
the mine were based equipment where we
have people come into the lab and you

287
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:57,420
have a whole row of different
physiological sensors,

288
00:16:57,421 --> 00:17:01,320
sort of like stickers that are adhesive
and they stick to the skin and we attach

289
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:05,040
them to participants in our
lab as you can see here, um,

290
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,360
to measure their ongoing
physiological responses.

291
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,650
So here's one of my research assistants
in the lab. As you can see on the, uh,

292
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,660
the right hand picture, there's a little
white box with Blue Line around that.

293
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:16,800
So that's an amplifier.

294
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,330
And the cables that are hooked up to her
feed into that amplifier there to then

295
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:26,300
produce a signal, um, while she's
doing the task. So playing long,

296
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,600
uh, with a very important task in our
lab, um, singing, twist and shout.

297
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,230
And then while she's doing that,
she's answering questions on the computer,

298
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:37,950
monitor recording how she's feeling.
And as you can see here,

299
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,310
we monitor her remotely from a control
room and you can see not only her

300
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:41,941
behavior,

301
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:46,200
but you can also see her
online physiological responses
there in the monitor and

302
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:50,640
the different colored channels and looks
something like this. So you're able,

303
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:53,850
using the system that you can get
people's a wide range of different

304
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:55,290
physiological responses to hear.

305
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,830
Some of the things you can see are
the electrocardiogram signal in red.

306
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:00,320
So this is your heart rate.
Um,

307
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,870
so we're able to see this on a second
by second moment while in the lab.

308
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,403
Okay.

309
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,820
Now let's contrast this with
measuring physiology outside the lab.

310
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,240
So what have you actually want to get
people's physiological responses in their

311
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:14,070
own or actual daily lives?

312
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:18,780
So one of the tools that we've used in
our lab is what's called the biopack bio

313
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:19,614
harness.

314
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,730
So this is a method of what is called
ambulatory physiology are really getting

315
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:27,760
mobile assessments of people's
physiological responses. So here, um,

316
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,680
you take people outside of the lab and
they were this velcro strap that's worn

317
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:32,850
lightly around the abdomen.

318
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,690
And in the front there's a little data
computer chip here that records things as

319
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:37,111
you can see,

320
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:41,340
ranging from heart rate
to skin temperature to
respiratory sinus Arrhythmia,

321
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:45,060
which we'll talk about later
as a potential correlative
emotion regulation and

322
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:49,140
positive emotion as well as general
movement in three dimensional space.

323
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:52,530
So just looking how much people
generally are moving around, um,

324
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:56,060
and to what extent that might also
relate to their physiological responses.

325
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,310
So not only can you measure
these responses in the lab,

326
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:03,840
we can also get really
beautiful assessments of them
in people's own daily lives,

327
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:08,030
which is thought to really increase
ecological validity of your study. Um,

328
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,520
let me just walk you
through a schematic of um,

329
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,490
one of the studies we've done in my lab
using ambulatory physiology monitoring

330
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:15,240
tools.

331
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,560
So in this study we had participants
who first visited the lab and when they

332
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:24,300
visited the lab we did a
baseline assessment of their
clinical profile using the

333
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:27,540
skid as well as getting different
measures of mood symptoms and basic

334
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,910
demographics.
After the lab,

335
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,920
they were oriented to what we called
inexperienced sampling study or ESM,

336
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:36,690
which we've talked about
earlier in our course.

337
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:39,510
And we looked at different
methods of measuring emotion.

338
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,360
So for approximately one
week in their own life,

339
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,980
they completed different assessments
at random intervals throughout the day

340
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,850
using a palm pilot, recording what
they were doing, who they were with,

341
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,140
what they were feeling,

342
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,890
and different kinds of
regulation strategies they
use to manage or control their

343
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:58,470
emotions.
Along with that,

344
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,190
so you can see here is the palm pilot
with the questions we talked about in

345
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:05,940
terms of an effect context
and regulation strategies.

346
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:10,260
You can also see our participant here
wearing that, um, ambulatory straps.

347
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:11,820
So the bio pack bio harness.

348
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,240
So not only are we getting in her daily
life how she's feeling and what she's

349
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:16,670
doing,
um,

350
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,520
but we're also getting simultaneously
her physiological responses that were

351
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:22,050
collected during this period.

352
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,500
And then finally you bring people
back into the lab and you collect the

353
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:25,921
equipment.

354
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:30,000
So now you have a really elegant
measurement of both how they report their

355
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:32,910
feeling and their physiological responses,
which again,

356
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:34,110
as we spoke about at the beginning,

357
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:36,720
are relatively outside
of conscious awareness.

358
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,500
So, um, go back there really quick.

359
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:47,010
So what we're going to go
over in the rest of the class,

360
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:52,110
our next module is going to detail more
precisely about when we look at methods

361
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:55,330
that are used both inside
the lab and outside the lab.

362
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,040
What precisely are we measuring?

363
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:00,280
So what separate physiological
channels are we tapping into?

364
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,360
So we're going to spend the next
module going into different measures of

365
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:08,080
physiological functioning, ranging
from, you know, heart rate to sweat,

366
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:11,770
to breathing, frequency, skin
temperature, and even blood flow, uh,

367
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,820
in greater detail.

368
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:16,840
But I just want to give you a roadmap
today of where we'll be going next as we

369
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:21,070
sort of delve into the world of
psychophysiology. So with that,

370
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,670
I want to conclude with takeaway questions
for our introductory segment today on

371
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:25,660
psychophysiology.

372
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:30,970
So the take home questions
today are as follows. So first,

373
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,080
what were the two main branches of the
autonomic nervous system that we talked

374
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:39,310
about today that are central in the study
of psychophysiology and what function

375
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:41,980
do each of them serve?
Second,

376
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:47,550
can you name and describe several basic
emotions and their associated autonomic

377
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:53,110
profiles? So there was a table we showed
earlier in the lecture today that had,

378
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:53,411
you know,

379
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:57,520
five or six distinct emotions and the
different autonomic profiles that would

380
00:21:57,521 --> 00:22:00,190
map onto those emotions.
So you might want to go back,

381
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,580
remind yourself of that particular part
of the lecture and see if you can answer

382
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:07,630
for yourself this question of can you
describe what the autonomic profiles are

383
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,200
of these basic emotions?
And then finally,

384
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:16,470
how are psychophysiological measures of
emotion assessed both inside the lab and

385
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:18,280
outside the laboratory.

386
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:22,060
So what are the ways that researchers
who want to study physiological responses

387
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,410
look at this in these two
different contexts? And finally,

388
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,900
we'll conclude with our
expert interview for today

389
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:34,510
and today as part of our experts
and emotion interview series,

390
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,190
we have the honor of speaking
with doctor John Kasey Yotpo. Um,

391
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,290
he's going to speaking to
us about psychophysiology,

392
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,960
both the scope of
psychophysiology and the promise.

393
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:45,520
It bears for emotion research.

394
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,590
So Dr Casio Opo uses a
variety of psychophysiological
methods in his research,

395
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,720
including Autonomic Neuroendocrin,
Fsri Eeg,

396
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,250

397
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,800
doctor Kesey Opo is the Tiffany and
Margaret Blake distinguished service

398
