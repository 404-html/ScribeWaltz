00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,520
Today for the experts
in emotion interview.

2
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:05,730
We'll be speaking with
Dr Naomi Eisenberger, um,

3
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:07,650
on the nature of social pain.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,480
So Dr Eisenberger received her phd
from Ucla and is currently an associate

5
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:17,010
professor of psychology still at Ucla
and the co director of the social

6
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:19,050
cognitive neuroscience laboratory.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,580
Her work focuses on understanding
social pain as well as social pleasure.

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,630
This includes the neural basis of
social rejection, social connection,

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,120
as well as social support and health.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,530
She's published widely in top tier
journals including science, social,

11
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:36,270
cognitive aspect of neuroscience,

12
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:40,580
and the proceedings for the National
Academy of Sciences. Dr Eisenberger,

13
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:44,910
his work has been recognized by numerous
awards, including a Narsad award.

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,990
Janet Taylor Spence award from the
association for Psychological Science,

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,940
the sage young scholars award,

16
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:54,840
and the Herbert Wiener early career
award from the American psychosomatic

17
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:55,674
society.

18
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,420
So I now turn with great pleasure to our
experts and emotion interview together

19
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:02,490
with Dr Naomi Eisenberger.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,680
So welcome Naomi. Thanks for speaking
today. Thank you for having me.

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,520
What I wanted to start out with is just
asking you a little bit about what first

22
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:14,880
got you interested in emotion.
Um,

23
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,430
I don't know that there
was any one incident.

24
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:22,431
I think I've always been really interested
in psychological experience and very

25
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:26,130
sort of attuned to what's going on in
my mind and what's going on in my body.

26
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,140
And emotion is one of those things that
sort of captures your attention in ways

27
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:35,130
that other experiences don't
necessarily capture it. So, you know,

28
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:38,790
you notice that all of a sudden your
body feels different in your foundations

29
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,580
are different and what you're
thinking about is different. Um,

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,450
and I think that's just sort of what,
what got me interested in emotion.

31
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,440
Excellent.

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,500
Well I wanted to ask you about some of
your work in this field because you've

33
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:51,870
really, you know, pioneer and you know,

34
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:55,230
work on the neural basis of
things really relevant to emotion,

35
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:59,760
like social rejection, showing
that social pain can actually hurt.

36
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,880
And so I wondered if you could say
a little bit about your work here,

37
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,320
talking about how social pain may
actually share similar brain mechanisms to

38
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:09,870
physical pain.
Yeah.

39
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:14,280
So I been interested in rejection for
awhile just because rejection is one of

40
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:19,050
those kinds of experiences that can, you
know, change your emotions in major ways.

41
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:20,010
You know,
people,

42
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,580
all of a sudden when they're giving a
speech and they know that they can be

43
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,321
evaluated,

44
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:27,620
that they could be rejected and all of a
sudden you've had your heart racing and

45
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,810
your mouth gets dry.
Um,

46
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,050
people go to great lengths to
avoid getting rejected. Um,

47
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,530
so we do all these things to try to
prevent rejection in our own lives.

48
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:42,280
And I was just sort of curious, how
does the brain process rejection? Um,

49
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:47,190
and so we brought people in to the FMRI
scanner and we set up this game that kip

50
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:49,020
Williams has used before called cyberball.

51
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,520
And essentially what happens here is
people play this online virtual ball

52
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:58,521
tossing game well with what they think
are two other individuals and happens is

53
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:02,800
they're playing the ball together and
that at a certain point in time, um,

54
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,810
the two players who are
actually controlled by a
computer stop throwing the ball

55
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:11,470
to the subject, the subject
essentially a socially excluded. Um,

56
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,800
and so here we could look at what's
going on in the brain during that moment

57
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:18,070
when individuals are
feeling socially excluded,

58
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:20,760
when they're experiencing
social exclusion. Um,

59
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,120
and when we were running this study,

60
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,030
got back the data and I
was actually analyzing it,

61
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,040
I was sitting next to a fellow graduate
student who was analyzing a study on

62
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:34,360
physical pain and this was a study like
in irritable bowel syndrome patients.

63
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:38,440
So these were serious chronic
pain patients. We were
sitting next to each other.

64
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,050
We each had our data up
on our computer screens.

65
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:45,010
And at some point we noticed
just how similar our data looked.

66
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:47,110
I was looking at a study
on social rejection.

67
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:50,380
She was looking at a
study on chronic pain,

68
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:53,680
manipulated pain experience.
And at some point you sort of,

69
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:56,200
it got hard to tell which
study you were looking at.

70
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,350
And so based off that we thought,
you know,

71
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,370
it sort of looks like social rejection
is activating some of these same neural

72
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:06,670
regions that are implicated
in physical pain processing.

73
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,560
And in some ways it makes sense when you
think about this from an evolutionary

74
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:12,394
perspective,

75
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,770
given how important social
connection is for human survival.

76
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:21,220
And for more broadly speaking,
Mammalian survival. Um,

77
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:26,221
it's possible that the system that makes
sure that we stay socially connected

78
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:30,080
me, I've actually piggyback right
on top of the physical pain system.

79
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:32,860
So kind of borrowing that pain signal,

80
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,910
not only to alert us when our bodies
are in danger of being harmed,

81
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:39,880
but when our social relationships or
in danger of being harmed as well.

82
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,810
Such fascinating work. And it makes me
wonder, I know you've done some work here,

83
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:46,070
you know, to what extent, you know,

84
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:50,150
can we think about using interventions
then that are focused on alleviating

85
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:53,720
physical pain to remedy sort
of everyday social pain?

86
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,010
Um, so we've looked at that a little
bit. So based on this physical, social,

87
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,390
social pain overlap,

88
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:04,980
we've been very interested in whether
altering one kind of experience can alter

89
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:09,650
the other in a similar way. Um, and
we've been able to show that, you know,

90
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,920
maybe some surprising things that things
like a regular over the counter pain

91
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:17,520
killers like Tylenol.
Not only can reduce physical pain,

92
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:20,700
but it seems to be capable of
reducing social pain as well.

93
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,490
And I'm not suggesting people go
ahead and take a bunch of time.

94
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,740
There are other ways,

95
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,460
if you think about similarities
between physical and social pain,

96
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:32,130
there are other things
that can ameliorate both.

97
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:36,840
So any kind of activity that
increases opioid processing.

98
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:40,740
So opioids are also potent
painkillers in there, you know,

99
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:45,180
we have them within our bodies. And so
any activity like for example, exercise,

100
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,060
which increases the release of opioids,
um,

101
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,530
may have not only physical pain,
reducing effects, social pain,

102
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:53,670
reducing effects as well.

103
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,410
So interesting. I mean, and
I'm also thinking, you know,

104
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:59,780
of this domain of work
that's just so fascinating,

105
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:03,080
changed the way of what we think of,
you know, what social pain really is.

106
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,250
You've also been conducting work looking
at I guess the lighter side of social

107
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:10,790
connection as well by exploring
social connection and social pleasure.

108
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,940
And I wondered if you could tell us a
little bit about what we know about the

109
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:17,360
neurocircuitry here that may underlie
these ceilings of social warmth.

110
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:18,811
Yeah.

111
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:23,811
So we've sort of more recently tried to
switch our focus a little to focus on

112
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:27,210
some of them are positive
aspects of social relationships.

113
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:31,520
And we've done this in a
number of different ways. Um,
you mentioned social warms.

114
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:36,521
So in the same way that we've been looking
at what are sort of the neural bases

115
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,640
of social pain,

116
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:42,810
what are the sort of more basic neural
systems that may have been co opted to

117
00:06:42,811 --> 00:06:45,150
support socially painful experiences.

118
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:48,090
We've also been trying to do the
same thing on the positive side.

119
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,200
So what are the more basic neural systems
that may have been co opted to support

120
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,280
those feelings of social connection?
Um,

121
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:59,730
and so one of the experiences that
we've looked at, his social warmth,

122
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:03,330
these are sort of the warm feelings
that we have when we feel bonded and

123
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:05,210
connected with others.
Um,

124
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,480
and we've been cheerious and interested
in whether these experiences rely on

125
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,950
temperature regulation mechanism.
So a lot of times we'll say things like,

126
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,200
um, uh, you know,

127
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:19,850
I have a warm feeling towards that
person or I've felt warm hearted.

128
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,840
So we use these,
um,

129
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,020
temperature related words to describe
feelings of social closeness.

130
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,270
Um, so in a recent study in,
this isn't published yet,

131
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:35,271
but in a recent study we
tried to manipulate and
experience of social warmth and

132
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:39,810
manipulate and experience of physical
warms and look to see if we're getting

133
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,610
overlapping or activity and regions
that typically process temperature and

134
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:47,730
physical warmth. Um, so
in the social warms task,

135
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:52,440
essentially we bring in subjects and
ahead of time we contact their friends and

136
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:55,750
family members and we have
them provide us with, um,

137
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,820
sort of loving email
messages. Um, so it's,

138
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,300
these are actually very touching.
They were things like, you know,

139
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,500
I couldn't live my life without you in it.

140
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,680
These were real messages from
their family and friends. Um,

141
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,970
so they did one task where
they were reviewing these
messages for the first time

142
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,780
and then they did another task where they
were just sort of holding on to a warm

143
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:17,910
pack, um, when they were in the scanner.

144
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:20,910
And this was compared to a control
condition when they were holding onto a

145
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:22,800
squeeze ball.
Um,

146
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,100
and so essentially what we
found was overlapping neural
activity in two regions.

147
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,430
Um,

148
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,020
the mid insula and the ventral striatum
regions that in prior studies have been

149
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:38,760
shown to be involved in
processing physical warmth. Um,

150
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:42,210
so we see that there may be some, and
you know, this is a beginning study,

151
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,890
but there may be some kind of overlap,
um,

152
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,530
between the neural mechanisms that are
involved in processing temperature and in

153
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:53,880
processing social warmth than some other
behavioral studies have shown this as

154
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,340
well.
So if you like work by John Barge,

155
00:08:56,341 --> 00:09:01,140
if you hold on to a warm cup of coffee,
perceive other people as warmer.

156
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,610
Um, and this is sort of a neural
investigation of some of those overlapping

157
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,450
mechanisms.

158
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,530
So, interesting. I mean,
what do you think, you know,

159
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:13,610
are going to be some of the most
important advances in this field of social

160
00:09:13,611 --> 00:09:15,920
warmth as it moves forward? I mean, your,

161
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:18,740
your findings that you're talking about
that you're currently working on right

162
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:19,610
now are some of them,

163
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:22,490
but do you think there's other important
directions that we want to move forward

164
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:26,900
and to really understand what social
warmth is? Especially at the neural level.

165
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,120
Um, yeah, I mean I don't know
exactly where this will go,

166
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,150
but there's so many different kinds of
experiences that can make people feel

167
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:40,910
socially connected. You know,
we've looked at social warmth,

168
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:46,130
we've also looked at experiences where
people are feeling understood by others,

169
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:50,120
which seems to tap into some of these
same reward related neural regions.

170
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,080
And so I think going forward what would
be nice and what I'm ultimately looking

171
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:59,081
for is some kind of larger theoretical
framework for understanding all of these

172
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:03,740
different types of experiences
of social connection.

173
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:06,050
How do we organize them?
Um,

174
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,460
are they sub divided in some kind of
meaningful way? So that's at this point,

175
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:15,461
what I wanted to some kind of
larger theoretical structure
for understanding all

176
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:19,700
of these smaller types of
positive social experiences.

177
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,480
And speaking of this domain work,

178
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:26,470
I mean finally you've also
done some really important
work looking at questions,

179
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:29,700
aim to understanding the role that
social support plays, you know,

180
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,850
in our physical health.

181
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:35,200
And I wonder what you think we know
right now about this link between social

182
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,310
support and health.

183
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,740
Yeah. So this is probably actually the
question that first got me interested in

184
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,020
psychology in the first place.
Um,

185
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,830
I think I was an Undergrad at the time
and learned about the strong link between

186
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:53,730
social support and health and really,
you know, for the past 30 or so years,

187
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:57,510
this has been one of the strongest
findings within the field of health

188
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:59,460
psychology and social epidemiology.

189
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:04,461
The people who have fewer social ties
are at a greater risk for morbidity and

190
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:11,250
mortality and the risk factor is
on par with things like smoking.

191
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:15,960
So smoking is a risk factor for health
on par with not having social ties.

192
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,190
And so I've always been curious on why,
why does that relationship exists?

193
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,730
What are the mechanisms that explain that
link between social support and health?

194
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,360
Um, and so we've been doing a
little bit of work on this domain,

195
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:29,400
sort of starting from the top,

196
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:34,140
starting to try to understand what are
the neural mechanisms that underlie

197
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,000
experiences of social support.

198
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:40,320
And we focus both on what's going on
when people are receiving social support

199
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:41,940
from others as well as what's going on,

200
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:46,020
when people are getting
social support to others. Um,

201
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,730
and I think probably, oh, sorry,
I'm skipping to your next question.

202
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,210
No, go ahead. What have you found

203
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:00,160
most interesting things because it seems
kind of counterintuitive comes from

204
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:03,750
some of the work that we've been
doing on support giving. Um,

205
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,800
so I think when people
think about social support,

206
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:09,400
they sort of assume that all of that
psychological benefits or all the health

207
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:12,580
benefits come from all the stuff
that we get from other people,

208
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:14,730
all the support that they give us.
Um,

209
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,730
and we've been exploring whether some of
the benefits also come from the support

210
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:20,800
that we give to others.
So we've looked,

211
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,830
we've been looking neurally at what's
going on when people are engaged in giving

212
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:30,280
support to a significant other.
So in this particular study,

213
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,840
we bring in couples,

214
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:36,841
we scan the females as they
provide support to their
partners or their partners

215
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:38,440
stand right outside the scanner.

216
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,490
And on some trials their
partner gets electric shock, um,

217
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,420
while the female holds his arm as
he goes through this experience.

218
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,350
And what we find in these studies is
greater activity in reward related regions

219
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,680
that seem to be implicated in maternal
care giving behavior in animals.

220
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,880
And what's interesting is there seems
to be this hint that when people are

221
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:05,320
engaged in support giving,

222
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:08,230
not only does it activate
these reward related regions,

223
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,370
but it seems to relate to less activity
in certain regions that are often

224
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:16,450
associated with processing threats
of regions like the Amygdala.

225
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,540
And so we think that,
you know,

226
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:24,541
one possibility is that the active support
giving is actually threat reducing in

227
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:28,570
some kind of way,
at least physiologically speaking.

228
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,310
And we're currently looking at more into
this or running a study where people

229
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:38,311
are randomly assigned to either provide
support or go through a controlled task

230
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,250
before they go through their
own stressful experience.

231
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:44,200
And this particular situation,

232
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,420
people who are just engaged in support
giving actually seem to be less

233
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,640
physiologically responsive.

234
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,990
They show less of an increase in heart
rate and blood pressure in response to

235
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:58,960
that later stress task. Um, so there,

236
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,250
there may be sort of more
benefits to support giving,

237
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,880
um, then just for the person
receiving the support.

238
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,740
So where do you see the future of this
field headed and from your perspective?

239
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,420
Um, I don't know. I will
be excited to find out.

240
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:21,450
I guess I feel like emotion research
is probably still in the early stages.

241
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,550
When I teach my course and emotion,

242
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:29,300
which is typically taught as a graduate
course, I probably spend, you know,

243
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,460
the first three classes,
um,

244
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,560
either talking about
just what is an emotion.

245
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:37,270
Just sort of going over the definition,

246
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:41,150
going over people's different
approaches to understanding it. Um,

247
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,370
so even the fact that we don't sort of
have an agreed upon definition yet to me

248
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:47,950
suggests that we're in
the very early stages.

249
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,290
So I don't know what the future holds,

250
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,690
but I will be excited to see as there's
more and more research coming in.

251
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,410
And what advice do you typically give
to students then who come to you asking

252
00:14:57,411 --> 00:15:00,380
about, should I embark in this
field of emotion? You know,

253
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:04,640
how should I be spending my time,
or what should I be doing? Well,

254
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:08,750
I of course think emotion is one of the
most interesting topics in the world.

255
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:10,730
So anyone who's coming to me interested,

256
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:12,770
I would suggest definitely
go down that line.

257
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,840
But I guess I would recommend
a reading as much as you can,

258
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:21,830
reading from lots of
different perspectives, um,

259
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,250
but also sort of keeping in mind your
own experience and like d and does your

260
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:32,801
own experience jive with these
different theoretical perspectives?

261
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:34,521
I love that.

262
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:38,150
So reading widely and really connecting
your own experience to the science that

263
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:41,870
you're reading in front of your
eyes. [inaudible] great. Yeah. Well,

264
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:44,090
thank you so much for speaking today,
Naomi.

265
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:48,590
It was wonderful to hear your thoughts
and have this opportunity to thank you so

266
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:49,400
much.

267
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,030
So this concludes our experts in emotion
interview with Doctor Naomi Eisenberger

268
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:56,630
from the University of California,
Los Angeles. Thank you so much.
