1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,860
Welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,130
So today we're going to discuss both love
as well as sex and ask ourselves just

3
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:15,020
how does a promotion play a role
here? Um, so for example, um,

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,350
we'll ask the question in some ways like
what is love and sex got to do with it?

5
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:24,351
So exactly to what extent does emotion
shape the love we feel towards others as

6
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:28,410
well as our patterns of
sexual desire and arousal.

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,830
So we're gonna follow this road map today.

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,400
We'll start by talking
about love moving to desire,

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,630
moving to some really controversial and
provocative research on sexual arousal

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,520
followed by takeaway questions and an
expert interview with Dr. Michael Bailey.

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,130
So let's start with love.
So romantic love.

12
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:51,810
What is it in the first place?

13
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:56,811
So we know romantic love is something
that we all have some sense of.

14
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,500
We've read about and many of
us one day hope to experience.

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,740
So let me share a few features about
what psychologists and people who study

16
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:10,200
him. Human emotion think
romantic love actually is.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,590
So we think of romantic love as something
that underlies pair bonding between

18
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:20,760
partners and that it's thought to
help foster long term commitment,

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,100
um, and also help people stay together
in terms of fostering mutual goals.

20
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,780
Um, ultimately romantic love really seems
to be about keeping people together so

21
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:35,280
that they can rear offspring
over the longterm course. Okay.

22
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,580
So that doesn't sound
very romantic at all. Um,

23
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,160
what else does romantic
love associated with? Well,

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,030
we also know that it's associated with
the release of a neuropeptide you may

25
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:48,480
have heard of called oxytocin.
So this has been colloquially,

26
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,280
colloquially referred to as the love
hormone and that it's this hormone that's

27
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:58,281
thought to make us feel romantic love
and feel sort of attached and bonded with

28
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,060
another romantic partner.

29
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,090
And what I think is really fun is to
look at what are the behavioral displays

30
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:09,540
that people show when they're
feeling in love and say,

31
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:14,541
you see this funny combination of a head
tilt smile and making this very subtle

32
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:19,650
kind of, uh, you know, coy eye contact.

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,680
So what does this look like?
So these are images,

34
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:26,430
courtesy of Dacher Keltner who's
been studying these displays of love.

35
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:31,050
And here you can see exactly that. So you
find that the head gets tilt slightly.

36
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,160
People think it's a way of sort of
displaying your vulnerability to another

37
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:35,910
partner.

38
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,260
You see this kind of subtle smile
and you also see eye contact.

39
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:44,490
So many of you might remember times in
which maybe you were in class when you

40
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:48,180
were young, high school, college or
someone gave you that special look.

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,290
And what that special look really was
is the head tilting, looking at you,

42
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:57,150
making eye contact and smiling. So
that's thought to be our sort of, um,

43
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,390
you know, expressions or
displays of lab 11, the face.

44
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,213
Okay.

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,080
And what do we think about
what romantic love is?

46
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,110
So Sternberg has a theory of love and
this theory of love had three components.

47
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,870
The first component was intimacy.

48
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,990
So he talked about this
as a feeling of closeness,

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,600
connecting and connectedness and bonding.

50
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,500
So this is related to sharing information
with this person that you wouldn't

51
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:31,030
normally share with other people.
That's the first component of love.

52
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,310
The second was passion.

53
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,520
So he talked about this
notion of having desire,

54
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,800
you need to have physical attraction,
desire,

55
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,760
and sort of the proclivity to want to
have sex with the other person. Right?

56
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,780
And the third is this idea
of longterm commitment.

57
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,340
So this is the decision that one
is in this loving relationship.

58
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,370
They're willing to label
it as a relationship, uh,

59
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,940
which I know can be an issue for
many kinds of relationships that,

60
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:59,350
that wanting to commit and say,

61
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:04,000
I am in this relationship with you and
to maintain this relationship over time.

62
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,280
So intimacy,
passion,

63
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:09,640
and commitment are the three components
of love according to Sternberg.

64
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,740
And he noted that you need to have all
three components in order to truly have

65
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:19,480
romantic love. So what happens then if
you are missing some of these components,

66
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:21,430
if you have some but not all.

67
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,020
So he walked through several different
categories of different kinds of love,

68
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:29,920
like feelings, um, when you're missing
one or more of these components.

69
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,940
But keep in mind, these are no longer
romantic love if you don't have all three.

70
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,090
So what does it look like if you
have different combinations of them?

71
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,380
So first he would say there's
something called non love.

72
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,070
So this is where you have none of the
three components. You don't have intimacy,

73
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:48,670
you don't have passion, you don't have
commitment, there's no love going on their

74
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,520
liking. So we've heard people
say, I really like you.

75
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,170
I just don't love you.

76
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,730
So what this is thought to be of
as having this sense of intimacy,

77
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:05,350
only feeling connected with the person
but not having the passion, the desire,

78
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,320
and not really wanting to maintain
that long term commitment.

79
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,390
So these are more what we think of as,
you know,

80
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:13,630
I just want to be your
friend or casual friendships.

81
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,880
Then there's infatuation.
So here you have the passion,

82
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:20,110
you have the desire,

83
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,770
but you just don't feel
that close connection and
you're not really interested

84
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,530
in staying with them, uh, in the long run.

85
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:29,580
So people talk about this
as love at first sight. Um,

86
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,000
that this is really more about sort of,
uh,

87
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,370
your sort of system of desire and
sexual arousal and nothing more.

88
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,430
And then there's empty love.
So this is this sense of commitment.

89
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:45,940
So you're in it for the long
run to stay with this person,

90
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,750
but you no longer are
feeling intimacy or passion.

91
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,260
This can often be a sad but final stage
of longterm relationships that seem to

92
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:00,620
have just kind of fizzled out or gone
bad. So for example, it's, you know,

93
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:04,550
better to just stay together for
the kids' sake or for sort of social

94
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:06,110
appearances.
Um,

95
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,910
this empty love is often the first
stage of a relationship and arranged

96
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,230
marriages.
Um,

97
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:15,830
which is interesting because later on
they don't have a higher rate of ending in

98
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:16,640
divorce,

99
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,960
but it's also seen as the final stage
often before couples will often divorce or

100
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:23,540
split up.
So here you're committed to the person,

101
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:27,110
but you're missing some of the two key
ingredients of intimacy and passion.

102
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,930
There's also this sense
of um, romantic love. So,

103
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,220
um, what's interesting here, this is sort
of what we see in story tales, right?

104
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:39,860
Think of like Romeo and Juliet,
right?

105
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,790
So here you have the intimacy,
you have the passion,

106
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,680
but for different reasons you're unable
to make that commitment to be with them

107
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:52,370
long term. Um, some people
also think of things like,

108
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:57,290
I'm like the titanic as well.
Then there's companionate love,

109
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:02,090
right? So this is what you feel for like
a really good, really close best friend.

110
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,320
So you have the sense of intimacy and
closeness. You have the commitment,

111
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:09,560
you want to stay being close
to them for a very long time,

112
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,400
but there's just no sexual desire arousal.
Um,

113
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,680
so that's companionate love,
right?

114
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,010
Then there's fatuous love.

115
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,950
So here you have passion and
commitment, right? You have the,

116
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,080
the desire sexually,
you want to stay with them,

117
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,950
but you don't have that sort of
deeper psychological connection.

118
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,890
So you're only really committed
to each other for sex.

119
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,100
So the examples that are often talked
about or these kind of whirlwind

120
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,660
courtships,
um,

121
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:42,500
some people think of like Tom
Cruise and Katie Holmes or you know,

122
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:45,530
Britney Spears in her
mini fatuous love affairs.

123
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,840
And then finally there's
this idea of consummate love.

124
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:54,200
So here you really have all
three components of love.

125
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:58,640
And Sternberg would say this is
truly the sort of full deal of love.

126
00:07:58,641 --> 00:08:02,600
This is the real thing when you have
all three together at the same time.

127
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,600
Um, and if you'd like to
see more about this, um,

128
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,660
Sternberg's theory of love was also
talked about in an open Yale course taught

129
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:13,730
by professor Paul Bloom,
um,

130
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:17,360
where there's a guest lecture by Peter
Saliday here at Yale University on

131
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,840
evolution, emotion and reason
where he talked about love.

132
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,430
So if you want to hear more about this,

133
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:26,840
you can also go to the website below and
watch a really provocative and engaging

134
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:31,220
lecture on this topic further.
So we've talked about love,

135
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,940
but what about desire? We've
hinted that it's part of, you know,

136
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:38,480
Sternberg's theory of love,
but what is desire really?

137
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,080
So here what I have side by side is
romantic love and the different components

138
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:47,960
we just talked about and pitting
this against sexual desire.

139
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,070
So romantic love is really thought to be
fostering this commitment role to stay

140
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:56,520
with someone in order to help
rear offspring and foster alarm,

141
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,430
longterm commitment.
By contrast,

142
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:04,260
sexual desire has which just called an
initiation role to kind of initiate this

143
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:08,140
kind of repetitive or approach behavior
to essentially go and meet with,

144
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,020
with a potential, you know, partner.

145
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,770
So really what it's focused on
is promoting sexual behavior,

146
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,300
getting close to the person.

147
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:19,210
So proximity seeking and just
making physical contact. Um,

148
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,160
it's associated with releasing different
gonadal kind of estrogen and androgen

149
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:26,040
hormones, which are thought
of as the sexual hormones.

150
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,700
And it has a very different kind
of diff behavioral display too,

151
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:32,940
which is pretty funny.
So when people are feeling sexual desire,

152
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:35,550
they do things like lip puckers,

153
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,610
they a lick their lips,

154
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,820
they kind of turn their head away and
they make this kind of subtle coy eye

155
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:45,210
contact.
So they'll,

156
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,720
they'll look at eye contact just
briefly for one or two seconds,

157
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:53,700
that kind of flirtatious quick glance.
And they'll do what's called a coy smile.

158
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,820
So, um, I'll show you
what this looks like.

159
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:59,160
This is also an image
courtesy of Dacher Keltner.

160
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,160
This is what is thought
to be a display of desire.

161
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,420
Now think about what we showed earlier,
which were the displays of love here.

162
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:09,300
What you see as this kind
of coy kind of head tilts,

163
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,480
the smile and the eye
contact is very brief.

164
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,190
It's just this kind of subtle looking
back and looking forward very quickly.

165
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,950
And this is thought to be a
signal that you should pick up at.

166
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:24,500
That person is really interested in you
and really wants to get close to use

167
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,630
actually. Um, so that's the
sort of display of desire.

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,781
What we see here,

169
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:35,100
it's really interesting is that some
research points to some potential gender

170
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:39,630
differences in the way they
signal or cue desire to a partner.

171
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,070
So this is a really fun study.
Researchers actually spent their time,

172
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,220
hundreds of hours in bars and single bars
and what they would do is study these

173
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:54,501
brief kind of four to five second bursts
of behaviors between a single women and

174
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:56,184
single men.

175
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,000
And actually found that the way that
they sort of transmit their feelings of

176
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:04,650
desire look quite different. Okay,
so you get an a single's bar,

177
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,620
you're a researcher, and you're just
watching what's happening around you.

178
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,480
And here's what they found. So what a
women do when they want to signal desire,

179
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,620
they do this funny sort
of, um, theatrical, uh,

180
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,060
kind of a display of, of different things
that include, they arch their back,

181
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:26,220
you know, they kind of sway their
hips, they, they flip their hair. Um,

182
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,001
it's on,
and this,

183
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:31,950
what this is thought to two is almost
exemplify this kind of hourglass figure of

184
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:36,951
the female body and sort of exaggerate
these feminine kind of physiological

185
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:40,560
characteristics. Um, by contrast,

186
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:45,390
men do something very different when
they're trying to signal a desire or

187
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:50,340
interest in a sexual partner. They do
things, for example, as you can see here,

188
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,880
like amplifying their size and their
sort of research resource holding

189
00:11:56,981 --> 00:12:00,660
potential. So they kind of rock
back and forth on their heels.

190
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,620
They roll their shoulders,

191
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,040
they raise their arms and make
these exaggerated gestures.

192
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,010
So kind of trying to
exemplify their physical size,

193
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,480
status and resources. Um,
so it's really fascinating.

194
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:17,290
Next time you go to a singles bar to
just watch the way that men and women

195
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:22,150
behave differently when they're trying
to sort of signal their sexual desire.

196
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:26,960
And try to gain sexual attention
from another partner. Um,

197
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,760
so when we think of
sexual attraction then,

198
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,460
what are the kind of core components?
So there's,

199
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,410
I think you can think of two different
groups or factors that are associated

200
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:42,070
with sexual attraction. The first one
is what's thought of as the big three.

201
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,440
So proximity,

202
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,190
similarity and familiarity.

203
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:50,800
So these are things that
breeds sexual attraction,

204
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,450
being close to someone having some
similarity, which is actually co,

205
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,180
it's sort of counter to this
idea that opposites attract.

206
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,960
They actually don't attract very much
at all. It's more this notion that,

207
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:05,560
you know, birds of a feather flock
together and also familiarity.

208
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:10,561
So sort of being around someone you know
over time increases sexual attraction.

209
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,760
So you often see, you know,
sexual relationships between
coworkers, office mates,

210
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,970
and this has a lot to do with the
familiarity. You're just surround them,

211
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,030
you know,
over frequent or prolonged period of time.

212
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,170
Other factors that are thought to
sort of promote sexual attraction.

213
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:30,100
And the second group or what I call
the remaining four are the following.

214
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,930
So the first one is competence.
So, not surprisingly,

215
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:39,520
we like people who seem to be
competent. Um, but really important.

216
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:44,230
We don't want them to be perfect and in
fact we are more sexually attracted to

217
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:48,700
people who are competent,
but those who occasionally blunder.

218
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,590
So maybe they sort of, you know,
trip and fall or make like a verbal,

219
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:53,981
you know,

220
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:58,210
[inaudible] we actually find that to be
something that makes us more attracted

221
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:03,130
to them. So if you want to sort of, when
someone's attention, um, definitely,

222
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:04,870
you know,
look competent to them,

223
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:10,140
but it's okay to make an occasional
stumble or fall that this actually,

224
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,680
um, makes you more desirable in
their eyes. Not surprisingly,

225
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:18,910
physical attractiveness has a great
impact on the extent to which we find

226
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:21,040
ourselves sexually drawn towards someone.

227
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,760
Then there's this idea of gain loss.

228
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,940
So we are attracted to those whose
regard for us increases or gains momentum

229
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,710
over time.

230
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,670
So it's in a sense you don't want to
start right at the beginning was someone

231
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,300
you know at their maximum
level of interest in you,

232
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,100
but you see more attracted to people
who sort of over time seems to,

233
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,540
uh, seem to be more and more interested
in interested in you and who's regard for

234
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,310
you kind of increases and over time.

235
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,280
So you don't want to sort of put
all your cards out right away,

236
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:59,180
but you want to sort of let it gradually
build up and escalate over time.

237
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,190
And this is a really interesting one.
Misattribution um, and this actually,

238
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,760
people often use this as advice for sort
of how to take someone on a first date.

239
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:12,290
So often, um, there's this theory
of misattribution of arousal.

240
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,250
So when you're around someone and let's
say you get physiologically aroused,

241
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:20,000
your heart starts racing. Um,
you know, you start sweating.

242
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,750
If you're around someone who
you might be sexually, uh,

243
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,850
as a sexual romantic partner,

244
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,290
you're likely to attribute that
physio physiological arousal to them.

245
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,690
So, for example, and the, as a result,

246
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:35,570
if you feel this physiological arousal
while you're around the person,

247
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,810
you read this as a cue of, Oh,
well I must be attracted to them.

248
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,860
So people will say that, you know, some
of the best first dates are taking your,

249
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,530
you know,
potential partner on a rollercoaster.

250
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,280
So some of that kind of
gets them physically charged
because they're more likely

251
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,600
to attribute that physiological arousal
not to the rollercoaster, but to you.

252
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,890
So you want to think about just how
you can get people to attribute their

253
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,870
arousal, uh, to you.

254
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,440
And so these are some of the seven
factors that are thought to promote sexual

255
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:05,420
attraction.
And again,

256
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:08,750
this is something that you can see
more of on this open Yale course at the

257
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:12,980
website below, uh, through a guest
lecture from Peter Saliday. Okay,

258
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,320
so let's now turn to sexual arousal
here.

259
00:16:18,321 --> 00:16:23,300
What we're going to look at his work
by Dr. Michael Bailey from Northwestern

260
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:23,810
university,
um,

261
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:27,200
who looked at two different ways to
measure sexual arousal and looked at

262
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:31,670
differences between men and women who
were either heterosexual or homosexual.

263
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,780
And really looked at this question of
do patterns in sexual arousal really

264
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:37,280
differ across these groups?

265
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:43,510
So the first way that he measured sexual
arousal was just by using subjective

266
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:47,270
ratings. So this is something that
we're all familiar with and he had,

267
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:50,480
this is actually an image that he
loaned to me from his own work,

268
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,890
which was a lever here.

269
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:56,060
So where they would have the lever from
not at all arouse to extremely aroused

270
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:56,894
at the very top.

271
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,710
And this is something that people would
be moving sort of manually throughout

272
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:05,630
the task. Okay. He also
measured physiological arousal,

273
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:09,440
right? So we know that emotional responses
have both subjective and physiological

274
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:12,890
components. So he did this,
you measuring genital arousal,

275
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:16,040
both in females using a
vaginal plethysmograph,

276
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,850
which measures the amplitude of blood
flow to the vagina and with men,

277
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:22,460
what he called [inaudible]
mograph measuring the d,

278
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,280
The circumference of the penis
as a function of blood flow.

279
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,970
So this is actually what he used
in his lab. So this is for women,

280
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,280
this is the plethysmograph and this is
the one used for men in this study. Okay?

281
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,520
So he has people hooked up to
these two computers with these,

282
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:41,270
put these monographs with these rating
dials, and what does he have them do?

283
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,890
So here's the study that if he did
that of sexual arousal and it's quite

284
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:50,430
interesting and uh, has gained a lot
of attention, even some controversy.

285
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,670
So he brought participants into the lab.
Okay.

286
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,580
And the participants
were in four categories.

287
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,810
There were men and women who are
either heterosexual or homosexual.

288
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:03,690
So there were male, heterosexual,
Male, homosexual, female,

289
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:05,880
heterosexual and female homosexual.

290
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,250
And then what he had them do is
watch a series of evocative, uh,

291
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,010
sexually arousing film clips with all
kinds of different combinations that you

292
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:18,130
could possibly imagine of men and women
together are women and women's together

293
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:23,130
are women and men and see other doing
a variety of different kinds of sexual

294
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:27,930
acts. So it included things you
can see here as following, right?

295
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:32,280
So you had just all kinds of things to
appeal to, all different kinds of tastes.

296
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,120
Right.

297
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,380
And so what he wanted to do is to see
whether or not men and women really differ

298
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:41,250
in their patterns of sexual arousal when
watching these different film clips.

299
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,150
And so let's start with
the results for men.

300
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,450
So what did we see when they saw these
different film clips and they were

301
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:51,840
measuring both their subjective ratings
and their physiological response of

302
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:55,530
sexual arousal. It's
interesting. So, okay,

303
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,070
so what you have here is the
picture of the self report dial.

304
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,600
And you have three colors here.

305
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,780
You have the responses to
watching a male male film,

306
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,710
a female female film or
a male and female film.

307
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,980
So what they found was subjective
responses here is that men who prefer men.

308
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:19,101
So homosexual men show the greatest self
reported arousal when viewing male male

309
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:22,980
films. Okay? And over here on the right,

310
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,270
men who prefer women, so who self
identify as being heterosexual,

311
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,170
show the greatest,
um,

312
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:34,380
self reported arousal to female
female films followed by mail, mail,

313
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:38,130
films. Okay, so that's what they
showed for their subjective response.

314
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,510
What about physiological response?
So here what you're seeing,

315
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:45,690
and this is using that plethysmograph
that you can see here on the bottom right,

316
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,120
is that men who prefer men.

317
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:53,150
So homosexual men show the
greatest physical arousal
to the male male films and

318
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:57,510
purple that's the left graft.
And that men who prefer women.

319
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:02,570
So heterosexual men show the greatest
arousal again to these female female films

320
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,840
followed by male with female films.

321
00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:10,380
So this is really consistent with
their self reported response. Okay.

322
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,850
So what uh,

323
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,900
this work has concluded is
that heterosexual men seem
to generally show greater

324
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:22,360
or more increased sexual
arousal to heterosexual stimuli,

325
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:26,280
which they define as both men
with women or women with women.

326
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,560
And that homosexual men show the greatest
kind of sexual response in terms of

327
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:35,070
their arousal to homosexual stimulators.
So men with men.

328
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,270
So he concludes that male sexual
arousal is really category specific.

329
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,230
So you're going to show more arousal to
the kind of stimuli that's specific to

330
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:47,530
your self identified sexual orientation.
Okay,

331
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,330
now we'll look at women.

332
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,110
It's an interesting and very
different pattern of results actually.

333
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,620
So here we're going to start with
self reported arousal. Again,

334
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:59,980
same layout that we had before.
So on the left,

335
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,310
what we see is that heterosexual women,

336
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,710
so women who have a
male preference report,

337
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:10,711
the greatest arousal for male female
films followed closely by female female

338
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:15,160
films. Um, on the right by contrast.

339
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:19,900
So these are homosexual women report
the greatest arousal by female female

340
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:24,520
films. Okay? When we get to
physiological or sort of genital arousal,

341
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:26,020
what we see something quite different.

342
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:31,021
So on the left we see that heterosexual
women exhibit equal sec sexual arousal

343
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:36,670
for any kind of film. It doesn't matter if
it's male, male, female, female, or male,

344
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:40,600
female. And when you look
at homosexual women, um,

345
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,890
what you see as the exhibit as somewhat
greater arousal to female female films,

346
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,840
but also seem to show similarly high
arousal across all other film types as

347
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:50,674
well.

348
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,750
So this is the interesting
kind of controversial part
of this research here is

349
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:59,530
that he concludes that female sexual
arousal is not category specific.

350
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,440
And he argues in this
paper by shivers that, ah,

351
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,560
that women's show more of what
he calls a bisexual pattern.

352
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,800
So women's sexual arousal is bisexual
regardless of their identified sexual

353
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:11,831
orientation,

354
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:16,210
that they show more physiological
arousal across a wide variety of stimuli.

355
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,840
And so he says this is particularly
true of the genital arousal or the

356
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:24,700
physiological responding. So,
um, what does this all mean?

357
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,570
Right? So what this is
suggested by this research by,

358
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:33,340
by the authors is that men and women's
sexuality May in fact be organized

359
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:35,770
differently.
And that Michael Bay,

360
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:40,771
these labs showed that
men's genital sexual arousal
patterns closely track their

361
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:45,490
set, identified sexual orientations,
whereas women's did not.

362
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,300
Um, so this is something that
will be really interesting
to speak with them about

363
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,340
when we have our experts
in emotion interview.

364
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,390
Cause it's something that's gained a lot
of attention and even some controversy

365
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:56,980
as to what it all means.

366
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:01,630
So what I want to move now to our
takeaway questions followed by the expert

367
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:05,590
interview Michael Bailey that I've been
referring to in his research thus far.

368
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,780
So our takeaway questions
today on this topic of love,

369
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:15,781
desire and sex RF follows first to how
is romantic love distinct from sexual

370
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:18,334
desire?

371
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:23,090
What are Sternberg's components
of romantic love? Um,

372
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,770
we talked about three of them and we also
talked about what it looked like when

373
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:29,230
some, but not all of those
components were precedent.

374
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:34,230
So you want to refresh yourself as to
what those different forms of love looked

375
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:38,200
like. And then finally what
we just talked about. Um,

376
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:43,220
and what I'd like you to do is try to
describe what these gender differentiated

377
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:47,930
patterns in sexual arousal were both for
subjective and physiological measures

378
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:52,340
of sexual arousal and to what extent
men and women seem to differ in their

379
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:56,600
patterns of sexual arousal.
And with that,

380
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,950
I will be turning now to our
highly anticipated expert
interview as part of the

381
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:05,930
experts in emotions series
with Dr. Michael Bailey. Um,

382
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:10,910
so Dr. Bailey is a professor of psychology
at Northwestern University and highly

383
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:14,780
regarded for his work on the
etiology of sexual orientation,

384
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,490
gender nonconformity,

385
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,990
the genetics of sexual orientation
and the sexual arousal response.

386
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,500
He's the author of the well known book,
the man who would be queen,

387
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:29,150
the science of gender bending
and transsexualism, which
was published in 2003.

388
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:32,660
And his work has received
widespread attention in the media,

389
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,770
including the Boston Globe,
Washington Post, CBS,

390
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,110
CBS News,
just to name a few.

391
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,060
So I now turn to our experts and emotion
interview with Dr. Michael Bailey.
