1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,231
Welcome.

2
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:05,370
I'm excited to be talking to you today
again about something very near and dear

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:08,490
to most of us happiness.
Um,

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,510
we know that happiness is something
that's been ingrained in our society as

5
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:15,000
humans for many, many, many years.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,230
If we look back at ancient philosophical
writings by Aristotle, he said,

7
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:21,600
happiness is the meaning
and the purpose of life,

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,350
the whole aim and end of human existence.
Likewise,

9
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:27,990
the Dalai Lama has
indicated that in many ways,

10
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:31,260
the very motion of our
life is towards happiness.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,000
So indeed as humans,

12
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:38,001
we seem to have this insatiable desire
or yearning to be happy and to understand

13
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:41,280
happiness better.
Today though,

14
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:45,960
I want to talk about perhaps unusual
and understudied aspect of happiness.

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,700
So this is our third segment and our
module on happiness and wellbeing.

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,820
And it's the day we'll be looking at
what I refer to as the dark side of

17
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:57,150
happiness. So in other
words, can feeling good,

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,280
sometimes be bad for us.

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,720
So we'll start with this unusual question
of the dark side of happiness followed

20
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:08,460
by our takeaway questions
and expert interview.

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,850
So when we think about happiness,

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,430
it seems to be something that
we all want to understand.

23
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,590
And indeed we see an increase scientific
focus on happiness with magazines

24
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:24,210
coming out about the science of happiness
as well as a flooding of pop culture.

25
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:27,870
Attention on happiness.
We see books like the happiness project,

26
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,230
stumbling on happiness,
authentic happiness,

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,640
the how of happiness, the
art of happiness. And a
recent favorite of mine. Um,

28
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,400
get happy today.

29
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,690
I'm with a dolphin soaring out of the
water suggesting that maybe our interest

30
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:47,400
in happiness is being taken to an all new,
potentially dangerous level.

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,090
Um,
we also see an obsession with,

32
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:55,140
perhaps you might argue happiness
in our pharmaceutical industry.

33
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,340
So we see sales for a
host of antidepressants
skyrocketing in recent years,

34
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:03,120
including prescriptions for Prozac,
Paxil and Cymbalta.

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,640
And there's no surprise in many ways
that we would want to be trying to attain

36
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:12,540
happiness. So we see a growing
work of psychologist, you know,

37
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:16,380
really pointing to many of the
key benefits of feeling happy.

38
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,010
This includes building, you
know, vital social bonds,

39
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,230
enhancing our creative thinking and even
building physical immunity. Distressors.

40
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,090
So, even though we know all these
robust benefits of feeling positive,

41
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,560
should this upward pointing trend
towards greater and greater degrees of

42
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:38,430
happiness always be our desired goal?
Or should we pause,

43
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,760
maybe take a step back and perhaps ask
ourselves just for a moment whether or

44
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,470
not happiness is always a good thing.

45
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,390
So I think we should, and that's what I'm
going to try to convince you of today.

46
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,040
Because in life we always know that
there's two sides to every story.

47
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,320
And why should happiness
be any exception to that?

48
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,140
So in many ways when we think about this,

49
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:06,430
people often refer to this as trying to
look at the other side of happiness or

50
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,150
you know, you might consider as
the dark side of happiness, right?

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,850
So I don't know how many of you
are star wars fans out there,

52
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:14,500
but for those of you who are,

53
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,220
perhaps what we're doing is really looking
at the Darth Vader side of happiness

54
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:21,640
here. So when we think about
the dark side of happiness,

55
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,670
one way to begin our journey and to really
grasping the central themes of it is

56
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,270
again going back to Aristotle,

57
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:32,710
who seemed to have the most amazing
pressing observations about emotions of

58
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:34,060
anyone.
So he said,

59
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,170
getting angry or sad is
easy and anyone can do it,

60
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,330
but doing it in the right amount at the
right time and in the right way is not

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,080
easy, nor can everyone
do it. So this quote,

62
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:48,880
although it talks about anger and sadness,

63
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,510
highlights three key themes I want
to walk through with you today,

64
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,740
apply to happiness. So some codes
looking at the amount of happiness,

65
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,170
the timing for happiness, and the way
in which we tried to become happy.

66
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,970
So this will constitute the three core
themes as we journey into the dark side

67
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:11,050
of happiness.
So this includes the amount of happiness,

68
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,220
the timing for when we're happy,
and the way in which we become happy.

69
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,620
So let's begin with our
first core team here.

70
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:22,570
Looking at the amount of happiness and
asking the question together of whether

71
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:26,590
there can ever be too much of
a good thing like happiness.

72
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,810
So recent work has suggested that the
relation ship between our happiness on the

73
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:35,980
bottom and our psychological health as
you can see here over on the left is not

74
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:40,981
straightforward or linear and instead
it actually seems to mimic more of what

75
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:44,080
you can think of as an upside
down or inverted u shape.

76
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,090
So I'll walk you through
what this looks like.

77
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,800
So you can see in many ways that as
happiness increases as we saw earlier in

78
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:54,940
that upward pointing Arrow to some
extent is our happiness increases.

79
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,410
We see at at, um, sort of advantages
for our psychological health socially,

80
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:02,500
cognitively, and even physically. However,

81
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,850
this truism about happiness seems to
only hold up to what I think of as a

82
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:07,930
certain tipping point.

83
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,580
And after that point it seems that the
benefits of happiness actually begin to

84
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:13,720
unravel.
Um,

85
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,310
and our psychological health actually
goes down and this continues downwards

86
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:22,480
until we reach what we think of as the
potential dark side of positive emotion

87
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,500
or where we begin to see happiness
associated with a variety of negative

88
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:31,360
outcomes when it's experienced that too
extreme of a degree or where perhaps

89
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:35,290
there's too much of a good thing.
So I'll give you some examples here.

90
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,030
So what we see is that as happiness
increases to greater and greater levels,

91
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,450
um, it actually shows
decreases and creativity.

92
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,280
So we no longer see positive
mood facilitating this sort
of creative exploratory

93
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,310
thought. When it's experienced
at a heightened level,

94
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,190
it actually impedes our
ability to think creatively.

95
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,640
It also is associated with increased
rates of a, of maladaptive behaviors.

96
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,780
We see heightened levels of positivity
associated with increased risk taking

97
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:05,270
behavior,
alcohol and drug use,

98
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,980
as well as increased
risk for mental illness.

99
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:12,080
And in particular we've studied in my
lab a particular form of psychopathology

100
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:15,860
referred to as a mania, which is a
core component of bipolar disorder.

101
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,120
I'll show you a quote now that illustrates
in what way too much positivity can

102
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:23,420
be associated with mental illness.
Such as bipolar disorder.

103
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,060
So I think this quote here illustrates
that theme really nicely. It says,

104
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:33,410
the case for the dangers of positive
emotions is made most straightforwardly by

105
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:36,890
individuals with mania.
There joy is infectious,

106
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,950
their optimism and self
confidence unbounded.

107
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,320
One manic may give away his life savings
on a whim while another joyfully drives

108
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,850
a hundred miles an hour to a sexual
liaison with the potentially dangerous

109
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:50,684
stranger.

110
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,560
So here we can see that a
heightened amount of positive
mood and mania contently

111
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:56,930
to risky and even dangerous outcomes.

112
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,620
So when we look at this graph here,
again,

113
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,560
what it suggests is that this upside down,

114
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:08,210
you suggest that happiness is by and
large good up until we hit a critical

115
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:10,130
tipping point.
And beyond that certain point,

116
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,950
it indeed maybe too much of a good thing.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,430
So now let's look at the timing here.

118
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:20,360
We're going to ask the question of can
there ever be a wrong time for happiness?

119
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,650
Are there certain contexts or places
where it may not be to our advantage to be

120
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:25,700
feeling happy?

121
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,650
So here what I'm going to suggest is
that happiness is not adaptive in every

122
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,484
context.

123
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,540
And instead it seems to be specifically
tuned for situations that involve

124
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:39,680
building resources, savoring,
achievements, and cementing social bonds.

125
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,680
But that's not every context
of our everyday life.

126
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,950
And so indeed there may be wrong
times for feeling happiness.

127
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,110
I'll provide you with
a couple of examples.

128
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,270
One example is situations
that are competitive. So here,

129
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:57,410
recent work by Maya Tamir has found that
people induced to experience a happy

130
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:02,240
mood, actually perform worse on tasks
that require competition or confrontation.

131
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,690
In her study, she looked at
a competitive video game, um,

132
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,500
that people perform worse
on this competitive video
game compared to individuals

133
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:12,110
who are actually induced
into an angry mood state.

134
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,930
So when we need to confront
someone or compete,

135
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,110
we actually seem to do worse
when we're in a happy mood,

136
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,600
especially when we compare
it with an angry mood state.

137
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,560
Another important context
is one involving loss.

138
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,950
So we can probably all
readily imagine how that,

139
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:31,880
how feeling happy during the situation
of loss would impede our ability to

140
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:36,500
appreciate the absent object or person
or if imagine a loved one came to a

141
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:40,730
screening and we respond to them with
like a smiling expression on our face,

142
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:43,580
how that would not only hinder
our connection with them,

143
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:47,030
but it would impede our
ability to actually empathize
with them and comfort them

144
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,290
in their time of mourning.

145
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,520
So work in my lab has really looked at
this particular context and found that

146
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,690
individuals who are experiencing
heightened positive mood
while they're watching

147
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,020
films of a young boy crying
over the deck of his father,

148
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,280
that is those individuals are at greater
risk for developing mood disorders

149
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,670
later on in their life.
We've also found that individuals,

150
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:13,020
when they're watching other people share
moments of personal suffering and loss,

151
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,100
either with a romantic partner in the
room or watching a video of a real live

152
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:20,490
human telling a story about the
time that their mother passed away,

153
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,210
that those individuals who are at a
greater risk for developing mood disorders

154
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:28,320
like mania indeed seem to show greater
positive emotion experience and even

155
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:32,070
perceived other people to be feeling
more positive in these contexts.

156
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,210
So it suggests that feeling positive
in competitive situations causes you to

157
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:40,350
perform worse in those situations.
Whereas feeling positive in situations of,

158
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:40,921
you know,

159
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:45,750
very clear loss or suffering or tragedy
put you at risk for developing mood

160
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,060
disorders later on in life such as mania.

161
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,820
So let's turn to our final team
here. Looking at the way, by the way,

162
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:55,350
what we're really talking about here,

163
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:58,620
it's concluding with the question of
whether or not there can never be wrong

164
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:03,210
ways to find or pursue
happiness. And here, um,

165
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,321
again,

166
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:08,010
we'll return to this idea we've talked
about in our earlier lectures of this

167
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:09,750
ingrained in all of us.
You know,

168
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,310
especially in the u s and then our own
declaration of independence even is this

169
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:17,460
notion of life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

170
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,750
And even though this is a core kind
of central cultural value of ours,

171
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,100
should we stop for a moment in question
whether or not we ought to always strive

172
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:30,720
to be happy?
And indeed research suggests that yes,

173
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,160
we really should consider that the way
we pursue happiness may actually set us

174
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:36,300
up to be less happy.

175
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,940
So original work here was done by iris
mouse at UC Berkeley where she found that

176
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:46,941
those individuals who endorsed
high degrees of valuing
the pursuit of happiness,

177
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,090
so saying that was very important for
them to be feeling happy and they put

178
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:54,840
great efforts and expended great
effort to try to attain happiness,

179
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,610
that it's these individuals who actually
set themselves up with higher standards

180
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:00,510
for being happy.

181
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,970
And as a result she argues are likely
to experience disappointment when such

182
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:07,290
standards are not met.

183
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,150
And this is most apparent in positive
situations such as watching a happy film

184
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,300
where you might desire or
expect to be feeling happy.

185
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,730
So this paradoxical pursuit of happiness,

186
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:22,680
she would say is that those people who
value happiness the most and expanding

187
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:27,030
the most effort to pursue and attain it
actually may set themselves up for less

188
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:30,210
happy lives.
And in work with Iris Nelson colleagues,

189
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:34,980
our lab has found that those individuals
who actually endorse valuing happiness

190
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:38,530
the most are also those
individuals who report greater, um,

191
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,660
reports of symptoms of depression. So
they're actually the most depressed. Um,

192
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,870
we also have looked at work in
individuals with bipolar disorder as well,

193
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,020
who also endorse heightened
levels of valuing happiness.

194
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,830
So both for the general population that
seems not to be an ideal strategy and

195
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:58,210
seems to also characterize individuals
diagnosed with or at risk for mood

196
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:03,010
disorders such as depression
and bipolar disorder. So again,

197
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:07,090
it seems that we always turn back
to ancient scholars, uh, when we,

198
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:09,000
when we find these conclusions,
um,

199
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,810
who has suggested early on John Stuart
mill that those only are happy who have

200
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:18,100
their minds fixed on some object
other than their own happiness.

201
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,240
So where should we go then in
our ultimate quest for happiness?

202
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:27,160
So we see this idea of accepting your
happiness as it is, wherever that is.

203
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,880
And I want to leave you with
three take home points. First,

204
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:35,110
I hope that you take home the idea that
happiness is a critical ingredient of

205
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:38,020
what makes us human and
gives meaning to our lives.

206
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,440
There's nothing inherently
bad and happiness per se,

207
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,510
but which is the second point.

208
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,740
We need to treat happiness with care
and be mindful to experience it in

209
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:51,100
moderation.
So not too much at the right time,

210
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,770
which is not all the time
and in the right way.

211
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:56,740
So letting it come naturally rather than,
you know,

212
00:12:56,741 --> 00:13:01,330
obsessing over finding happiness
and maximizing it. And finally,

213
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,320
the third point is that it's critical
to find the right tools for attaining

214
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:08,410
happiness. And this is what I
allude to in this quote here.

215
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:12,280
So one of them being sort of radical
acceptance of your current state.

216
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,370
So this sort of traces back to ancient
Buddhist traditions that really suggests

217
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:18,730
that rather than trying
to strive for happiness,

218
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:23,080
to simply accept your happiness as it is,
wherever that is.

219
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:27,820
And this perhaps is the true secret to
happiness. And a way to sort of, you know,

220
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,170
get away or bypass some of the dark sides
of happiness that we've talked about

221
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:36,430
in our lecture today. If you'd like to
see more of me talking on this topic,

222
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:37,270
you can go here.

223
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,750
This is something that myself and my
lab spend a lot of time thinking about.

224
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,370
So now I'll conclude with our takeaway
questions and expert interview.

225
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,960
So our takeaway questions
today go as follows. First,

226
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:53,530
can there ever be too much of a good
thing when it comes to happiness and

227
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:56,920
related feelings of positive emotion?
Second,

228
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,380
what is the wrong timing for happiness?

229
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,330
What contexts or times is it not in our
advantage to be feeling happy or good?

230
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:09,250
And finally, what is the paradoxical
pursuit of happiness discussed today?

231
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,330
And to what extent does this suggest
that we should be striving to be happy?

232
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,340
So now we'll turn to our expert interview
as part of our experts and emotion

233
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:22,180
interview series today for our
experts and emotion interview.

234
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:26,350
We have the pleasure of speaking with
Dr Maya to Mirror on the dark side of

235
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:27,460
positive emotion.

236
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,710
Dr Tamir is an assistant professor and
the director of the emotion and self

237
00:14:31,711 --> 00:14:34,810
regulation laboratory at the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

238
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,530
She completed her undergraduate
degree at Tel Aviv University,

239
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,430
received her phd from the University
of Illinois at Urbana Champagne,

240
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,790
and completed her post doctoral
training at Stanford University.

241
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,620
Dr Tamir is most interested
in understanding what
motivates people to regulate

242
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:52,700
their emotions and in her quest,

243
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:56,630
she studies the implications of both
pleasant and unpleasant emotional

244
00:14:56,631 --> 00:15:01,430
experiences and people's beliefs,
thoughts, and feelings about emotions.

245
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,960
So I'll now turn to a very special
emotion and expert interview with my

246
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:09,710
colleague, Dr Maya Tamir on the
dark side of positive emotion.
