1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,660
Each one of us, whether or not we like
to admit it is an emotional being.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,690
You're going to get the opportunity to
hear experts from around the world talk

3
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:13,030
about what they know best human emotion.

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,180
You'll not only get to
learn about what emotion is,

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,050
what are the mysteries behind it, you
know, where do our emotions come from?

6
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:26,860
Or how can we harness them to
lead healthier and happier lives?

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,960
But you'll actually get to see the people
behind the science and technology of

8
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:32,794
human emotion.

9
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,010
So you may be sitting there wondering,
why should I care about emotion? You know,

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,240
how does it connect to me?

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,710
This series is going to answer that very
question because you're going to see

12
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:56,030
people who come from these very different
backgrounds tell you why you act the

13
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:56,864
way you do.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,310
Why perhaps sometimes we can't control
our tiers or we have uncontrollable

15
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:05,360
laughter. Why are we built
this way in the first place?
