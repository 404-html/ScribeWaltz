1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,600
Dr. Bailey is a professor of psychology
at Northwestern University and highly

2
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:10,470
regarded for his work on the
etiology of sexual orientation,

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,180
gender nonconformity,

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,650
the genetics of sexual orientation
and the sexual arousal response.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,630
He's the author of the well known book,

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,010
the man who would be queen the science
of gender bending and transsexualism,

7
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:27,810
which was published in 2003 and his work
has received widespread attention in

8
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:32,460
the media, including the Boston
Globe and Washington Post, CBS,

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,800
CBS news just to name a few.

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,750
So I now turn to our experts and emotion
interview with Dr. Michael Bailey.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,990
So welcome Mike.
Thanks for speaking with us today.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,340
Thanks for having me.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,650
So one of the questions I
wanted to ask you about, um,

14
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:53,360
so you start off our conversation today
is what got you interested in studying

15
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:57,530
emotion and sex, sort of, where did
it all begin in the first place?

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,650
Well, uh, I was, uh,

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,850
clinical psychology graduate student at
the University of Texas and I was taking

18
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,050
a graduate,
uh,

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,080
sex course and it became clear to
me how much interesting questions,

20
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,820
how many, how much interesting
work there was to be done, uh,

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,730
in that domain. Uh, you
know, let's be honest,

22
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,040
everybody finds sex to be
a pretty interesting topic,
but for various reasons,

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,810
people tend to avoid it.

24
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,550
And it seemed like an each,
uh,

25
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,350
that and you know, I really glad
that I went there because I've, uh,

26
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,340
been able to do some interesting things.

27
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,541
Fantastic.

28
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,630
And so some of the interesting things
you've been doing or exactly where I'd

29
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:46,320
like to Kinda start off our
questions today about your work,

30
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:47,580
because it's something like you're saying,

31
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:51,390
that appeals to almost
everyone yet I'm really,

32
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:55,530
I think until use pioneer work in
this area, we knew almost nothing,

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,700
especially when we related it to things
like sexual arousal and emotion. Um,

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,210
so what I'd love to ask you a bit
about, so in this realm, I mean,

35
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:07,470
you're really widely known
for demonstrating distinct
patterns of sexual arousal

36
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:09,570
response between men and women.

37
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,680
And men and women of differing
kind of sexual orientations.

38
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,160
So I wonder if you might say a little bit
about what you saw as some of the most

39
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,760
exciting discoveries when you first
embarked in this line of research?

40
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,590
Sure. So, uh, we've known
for awhile that men,

41
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,510
uh,
there's a close at that start over.

42
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,270
Uh, we've known for
awhile that in men, uh,

43
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,980
there is a close correspondence between
their sexual orientation and their

44
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:43,060
pattern of sexual arousal
in the laboratory. That is,

45
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:47,650
for example, a homosexual
men. Uh, we'll get,

46
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,360
uh,
erections to stimulate depicting men,

47
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,470
uh, but not so much to
stimulate depicting women.

48
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,000
A heterosexual men show
the opposite. Uh, in fact,

49
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,420
I think that, uh, for men, uh,

50
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:08,020
sexual orientation is a
pattern of sexual arousal.

51
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:12,430
That's how we know what our
sexual orientation is. Um,

52
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,260
we really haven't known
much about women for Awhile,

53
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,760
uh, in part because how to
measure sexual arousal in women,

54
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,130
uh, was less clear. Um,
and men you can measure,

55
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,530
uh, the degree of erection. You know,

56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,820
that's a pretty obvious way to do
it. And women, what do you measure?

57
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,530
Well, Eh, uh,

58
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,200
people have constructed an instrument
that seems to work pretty well. Uh,

59
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,720
it measures,
uh,

60
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,330
blood flow and the vagina and
in both men and women. Uh,

61
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,890
genital arousal depends upon the
flow of blood and the genitals.

62
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,070
Um, so anyway, uh,

63
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:58,970
we were interested in
whether in women as well. Uh,

64
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,950
sexual orientation corresponds
with a pattern of sexual arousal.

65
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,970
Uh, and so we did the analogous
study. And by the way,

66
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:11,971
in our studies we showed videos of
couples having a pretty graphic sex.

67
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,480
Uh, and the, uh,

68
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,600
most interesting kinds of couples are
same sex couples that is either two men or

69
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:26,150
two women. Uh, people
who like men should, uh,

70
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,130
respond to the stimulate with two women,
people who like men,

71
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,940
should I respond to the
stimulate depicting men.

72
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,370
So we did this study with, uh, both
heterosexual and homosexual women,

73
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,550
and we found, uh, that
heterosexual women, uh,

74
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,760
really respond, uh, to both equally,

75
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,870
uh,

76
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,400
very different than either
heterosexual or homosexual women.

77
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,320
Men, uh, who show a strong bias. They,

78
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:00,580
their preferred sex.

79
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,350
It will a heterosexual women show a
bisexual arousal pattern in the lab.

80
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,280
That's not to say that they are bisexual,

81
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,030
it's just to say that their
sexual arousal pattern,

82
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,530
their genital sexual arousal patterns
provide no information regarding their

83
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:22,300
sexual preference or sex with men.
Sex with women,

84
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:29,440
lesbians, uh, showed a somewhat
biased arousal pattern.

85
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:33,940
They got slightly more
sexually aroused, uh, to,

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,590
uh, female stimulated than
to mail stimulate. Uh,

87
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,570
but it was not nearly as
strong a bias as men show. Hmm.

88
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,910
So what do you think this tells us about,
you know,

89
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,910
you've spoken a bit about this already,
but to the relative influence of,

90
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,900
you know, gender on the one hand and
sexual orientation on the other end,

91
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,170
really kind of predicting
our degree of sexual arousal?

92
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:57,530
Well,

93
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,450
I think that the clearest thing that
shows us is that men and women do sexual

94
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:06,680
orientation differently. Uh, and, uh, men,

95
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:11,630
I think we understand pretty well. Uh, and
I'll just repeat. I think that for men,

96
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,370
sexual orientation is precisely
a pattern of sexual arousal.

97
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,730
It's their emotional response to a
attractive men versus attractive women.

98
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,440
That's not what sexual orientation
has for women. In fact,

99
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,060
I think that we barely understand
sexual orientation and women,

100
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,410
there's a lot of work to do,

101
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,740
but it's not about sexual arousal
at least as far as we can tell.

102
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,410
So it's really interesting and
I mean, you've really, you know,

103
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,260
pioneered other research related to sexual
orientation that I want to ask you a

104
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:47,520
bit more about as well.
I mean,

105
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,760
one of the lines in particular is on
gender nonconformity and you know, what,

106
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:55,500
that your work seems to really
interestingly support some of the common

107
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:59,760
stereotypes that we may have
for gay men and lesbian women.

108
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:02,460
And I wonder if you could say a
bit more about these findings.

109
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,910
Well, okay. Um, first of all,

110
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:08,670
we've known for quite a long time that,
uh,

111
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,700
childhood gender nonconformity is
associated with adult homosexuality.

112
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,690
That is a boys who are,
uh, relatively feminine.

113
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,350
You have a better chance than
boys who are typical, uh,

114
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,140
in their gender role behavior,
uh, to become gay man. And a,

115
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,970
an analogous, uh, uh, relation holds for,

116
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,130
uh, women. Um,

117
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,620
we know this both on retrospective
studies and prospective studies,

118
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,870
uh, and there are clearly
stereotypes about the way that,

119
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,930
uh, for example, gay men, uh,

120
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,580
move and speak and what their
interests are and so on.

121
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:58,200
And there are also stereotypes
about lesbians. Uh,

122
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,720
are these stereotypes true?
Well,

123
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:05,520
it was a very fashionable in the
seventies and eighties and into the 90s,

124
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,830
uh, to say, well, of course not.

125
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:12,480
There are no differences
between heterosexual and
homosexual people except who

126
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:15,090
they want to have sex with.
Um,

127
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,190
but we have started to study
these phenomena in the lab.

128
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,660
Uh,

129
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,660
we've actually gotten pretty
far and there's no longer
any doubt that on average

130
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,150
the stereotypes are true. Uh, we,

131
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,620
if we videotape a homosexual and
heterosexual men, for example,

132
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,570
people are much better than
chance at, uh, telling who's who,

133
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,410
even though the men don't
mention their sexuality at all.

134
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,750
Uh, now I should emphasize that,
uh, people aren't perfect at it.

135
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,050
Uh,
these phenomena are true on average,

136
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,660
which is the only way that
stereotypes are ever true. Um,

137
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,680
and I'll also say that, um, there's
nothing wrong with these stereotypes,

138
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,790
in my opinion,
that a gay men are somewhat feminine,

139
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:11,220
does not mean to me that
they're inferior in any way.

140
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,460
Uh, I think many straight men could
stand to be a bit more feminine. Uh,

141
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,890
stereotypes in the gender realm tend to
be a true on average and this is one of

142
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:23,274
the [inaudible].

143
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,920
And so it's interesting to,
I mean,

144
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:29,400
you've also looked at how behavioral
genetics right can also inform our

145
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:32,400
understanding of sexual
orientation. And I wonder, you know,

146
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:36,840
to what extent your work and
work of others you've read
does suggest that sexual

147
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:40,800
orientation can be influenced to
some degree by genetic factors.

148
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:47,050
The genetics of sexual orientation is
something that I've been interested in

149
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,300
ever since I entered sex research.

150
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:55,160
It's one of the things I studied in my
dissertation and I had done several twin

151
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,700
studies of, uh, sexual orientation.

152
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,740
My views on what the data say
have evolved somewhat. Uh,

153
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,770
the early studies seem to
show a very strong, uh,

154
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,290
influence of genes on sexual orientation.
Uh,

155
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,240
those studies. However, um, we're
not the best studies in terms of,

156
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,710
um, the way that, uh,
participants were sampled.

157
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,630
Uh, since I did most of those
studies, I can criticize them as,

158
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,000
uh, and uh, as, uh,

159
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,790
sampling has gotten better with the
use of twin registries. And so on.

160
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,540
Uh, the, uh, concordance rates,

161
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:43,040
that is the degree of similarity
between twins have the same pair,

162
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,250
have shrunken, uh, and, uh,

163
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:51,110
estimates of genetic causation
have shrunk and somewhat to, uh,

164
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,480
I would say that it still looks
like genes play a role, but, uh,

165
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,350
less of a role then for, um, most
other traits that have been studied.

166
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,620
Uh, that makes sense to me. Uh,

167
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,680
given the evolutionary paradox
of how genes for homosexuality,

168
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,780
uh, might persist, you know,
a homosexual people, uh,

169
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,190
uh,

170
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,190
seem not to be as interested in mating
with the opposite sex and reproducing a

171
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,140
as heterosexual people.

172
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:28,760
And so we would expect genes
for homosexuality to, uh,

173
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,160
uh, be disadvantaged evolutionarily.
And, uh, I think that the,

174
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,600
uh, genetic data, the best genetic
data are consistent with that.

175
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,200
So,
I mean finally,

176
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,780
this has been really interesting talking
with you about your work on, you know,

177
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,940
sexual arousal, sexual orientation, and
even the role potentially have, you know,

178
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,970
behavioral genetics and
helping us understand to
what extent genes play a role

179
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:55,270
in these kinds of sexual, you
know, preferences and behaviors.

180
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,990
And so I think one thing that's really
important in all of this is that,

181
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,210
you know, your work has used these really
precise methodological tools to study.

182
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,500
You know,
as you said at the outset,

183
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:09,160
this is one of the most fundamental
domains of what makes us human.

184
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:13,420
And it's such a central part of, you know,
motivational systems at the same time,

185
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:16,450
it's been largely taboo for,
for various reasons.

186
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,830
And so I think part of what's great to
talk with you is also to hear about your

187
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:25,831
expertise and sort of what you see as
the most innovative tools or stimulating

188
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,200
or ways that researchers can try to study,
you know,

189
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:31,120
sex and sexual arousal better.

190
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,080
Given that it is a domain that seems not
to be as largely tapped into as others.

191
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:37,930
So I just wonder if you might
say a little bit more about this,

192
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:40,030
where people who are less
familiar with this kind of work?

193
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,540
Well,
I do think that

194
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,040
studying sexual arousal is very
important for people who want to study,

195
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,560
uh, sexual orientation, uh, in part, uh,

196
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,363
you know,

197
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,590
otherwise we're reliant on
people's self reports and,

198
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,520
uh, that can be misleading,
uh, particularly, uh,

199
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:11,630
when some sexual orientations or
stigmatized as homosexuality has been,

200
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,870
although it is decreasingly stigmatized,
obviously.

201
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,290
Uh, so, uh,

202
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,320
and also people don't always have
perfect insight into what their sexual

203
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:26,900
feelings are.
Uh,

204
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:32,040
so I do think it is important to
try to use objective measures and,

205
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,270
uh, genital sexual arousal
is an objective measure. Uh,

206
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,160
it does have some problems in that.
Um,

207
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,640
people don't always,

208
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:45,840
men especially don't always respond
enough to give a good signal.

209
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,070
A one innovation that we've
been trying is to, uh,

210
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,850
move the action upstairs
to studying the brain, uh,

211
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,940
using brain imaging. Uh, Fmr. I, uh,

212
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:04,941
we've done a fairly large study by FMRP
standards on men and we're completing

213
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:09,090
one on women. And, uh,

214
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,450
my preliminary results I
would say are that, uh,

215
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,190
well I'm a little disappointed.
Uh, I would have thought that Fmr,

216
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,140
I would have had an advantage,
uh,

217
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,690
over genital measures
because, um, you know,

218
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:28,650
sexual feelings start in
the brain and, uh, you know,

219
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:33,651
one can have the feeling of sexual arousal
without an obvious genital response.

220
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,430
Uh, nevertheless, I think that, um,

221
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:43,970
our results suggest that a brain imaging
as it stands today in 2012 is not as

222
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:48,660
sensitive and measured
as the genital measures.

223
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,970
So what do you see then as some of the
challenges in conducting this kind of

224
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:53,804
work?

225
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,170
Well, I think, uh, the
biggest challenge remains, uh,

226
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,140
people's squeamishness,
uh,

227
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,020
regarding matters of sex. And that, um,

228
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:13,610
starts with, for example,
a potential participants.

229
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,490
It also affects Irb,

230
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,590
institutional review boards and
their scrutiny that they give, uh,

231
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:26,180
research. And, uh,
perhaps most importantly,

232
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:29,180
funding agencies. Uh, and, uh,

233
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,390
people who hire for jobs at universities,
uh,

234
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:37,210
are all hesitant to,
uh,

235
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,800
favor of sex research or they,

236
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:42,470
they're all prejudiced
against sex research actually.

237
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,960
So I think that

238
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,520
we need to work on having people
accept that sexuality is an important,

239
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:52,940
uh,

240
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,940
part of human life and as deserving
of attention as any other emotion.

241
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,180
So then as you think about the future of,
you know,

242
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:08,181
research and emotion and how it can try
to include measures of sexual arousal

243
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,750
and sexuality more broadly,

244
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,610
where might you see the future of the
field headed in a way that can begin to

245
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,230
really, you know, except you know,
and expand this line of work on,

246
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,011
like you're saying,

247
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:23,700
an important part of what makes us
human important part of everyday life?

248
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,550
Well, I think that, um,

249
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,150
I think that one direction will depend
upon, uh, breakthroughs in the field,

250
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,940
which is simply, uh, you know,

251
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,370
the instruments to measure sexual arousal.

252
00:16:41,371 --> 00:16:45,940
We have to keep trying to develop better
instruments, things that are less, uh,

253
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,290
intrusive, uh, you know, for example,

254
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,670
a genital measures,
you know,

255
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,160
have to go on the genitals and
the lab and, and people are, uh,

256
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,100
uh,
hesitant to do that.

257
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:04,670
So we need to develop a better
instruments or at least less invasive

258
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,720
instruments.
Uh,

259
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:11,721
and we just need to keep educating
people about our findings.

260
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,480
Uh,

261
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,310
and hopefully there'll be
interested enough in the findings,

262
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,810
uh,
to want more.

263
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,890
So finally, I want to ask, you know,
related to the future of the field,

264
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,920
a big part of this are the next generation
of students that are going to be

265
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,900
pushing this kind of research forward.

266
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,450
So when students come to you and they're
interested in sort of embarking in a

267
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,620
study of sexual arousal
or sexual orientation,

268
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,160
what kind of advice do you usually
give them or would you give them?

269
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,140
Well, I, I, I would say it's a
fine thing to be interested in.

270
00:17:43,141 --> 00:17:48,141
It's important I'd be aware
of the barriers in this,

271
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,880
uh, field research, uh, the
attitudes that people have.

272
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,590
Uh, the, the fact that, uh,

273
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,640
finding this hard to get
that jobs are relatively few,

274
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,440
uh, and trying to change
that. If you can't. Hmm.

275
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,650
Well, thank you very much. Um, it was
a pleasure speaking with you today.

276
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,163
Thank you.

277
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,251
And with that,

278
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:16,330
this concludes our experts in emotion
interview with Dr. Michael Bailey from

279
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:17,740
Northwestern university.
