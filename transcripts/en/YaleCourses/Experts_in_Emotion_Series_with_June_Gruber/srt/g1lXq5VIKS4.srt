1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,460
So welcome back to human emotion.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,200
Today we're going to continue in our
third part of a three part series on

3
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:11,550
emotion elicitation and measurement.
Asking what makes us emotional.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,180
So our first two modules
covered emotional elicitation,

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,380
looking at a diverse array of strategies
to trigger emotion both in and outside

6
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:23,740
of the lab. However, such techniques
are of little use in less.

7
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:28,350
We're also capable of reliably measuring
the emotion responses that we generate

8
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:29,400
using these tools.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,410
So today what we're going to do is
focus on the ways in which we actually

10
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:37,710
measure the emotions once they're set off,
once they're triggered.

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,670
This is really using a multi componential
approach to motion that's going to

12
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:42,960
guide our roadmap today.

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,560
So first we'll try to look at ways in
which people measure the subjective

14
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:48,780
experience of emotion or how do I feel?

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,890
Then we'll look at the ways people
measure the outward expressive display of

16
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:57,270
emotional behavior. In other words,
how do I look when I feel emotional?

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,050
And finally we'll conclude by discussing
physiological ways of responding.

18
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:07,410
So physiological tools to measure emotion
in the autonomic and central nervous

19
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:11,740
system. Answering the question of what is
my body saying when I'm feeling I given

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,570
emotion? We'll conclude with our
takeaway questions and expert interview.

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,240
So let's start with the
question of how do I feel?

22
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,870
How do we measure the subjective
experience of emotion?

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,780
So as we discussed earlier,
emotions have these multiple components.

24
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,410
So emotion needs to separately assess
each of these three components.

25
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,930
Here we're beginning with
subjective emotion response,

26
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:37,920
which is contrasted with behavioral
and physiological response domains.

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,440
When we think about subjective measures,

28
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:43,200
we can roughly break them
into three broad categories.

29
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,170
Self report questionnaires,
continuous rating,

30
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:50,100
dials and experience sampling methods
to capture emotion in everyday life.

31
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,400
So let's begin first with
some common questionnaires.

32
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,510
So one of the most common questionnaires
to assess both positive and negative

33
00:01:57,511 --> 00:02:01,590
emotion experience is called the positive
and negative aspects schedule or the

34
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:05,490
Panis p a, n a. S. So it's
what you can see here.

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,460
There's a host of different
emotion related adjectives,

36
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,660
which participants are asked to
rate on a scale of very slightly,

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,450
a little moderately,
quite a bit or extremely.

38
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,570
And so they can answer this in terms
of what they're feeling. Right now,

39
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:22,110
what they felt in general in the
past week or at a trade level,

40
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:23,490
how they generally feel.

41
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,450
And this is probably the gold standard
for measuring subjective emotion

42
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:28,290
experience.

43
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,120
A new tool that's been developed that
we use often in my lab is called the

44
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:35,700
modified differential emotion scalar mds.

45
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,000
And what I particularly like about this
scale that you might be able to notice

46
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:42,450
as you're sort of scanning through the
different items here is that it has a

47
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:45,930
much more rich repertoire
of positive emotional terms.

48
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,120
So we see feelings of awe,
wonder, amazement, glad, happy,

49
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:53,700
joyful, interested, alert, curious.

50
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:57,330
So it comes in triplets and people are
asked to indicate to what extent they

51
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:59,770
feel from not at all to extremely hopeful,

52
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:04,390
optimistic slash encouraged as compared
to, for example, loves slash closeness.

53
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,260
Slash.
Trust.

54
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,370
And this is really nice if
you're particularly interested
in measuring discrete

55
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:13,180
or distinct types of positive emotional
experiences and using questionnaire

56
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:14,014
measures.

57
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,463
Okay.

58
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,260
Another commonly used questionnaire
measure is called the stress appraisal

59
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,820
measure or Sam. And what's nice
about this as it gets sort of, um,

60
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,500
over potential or across potential
language demands that may be inherent when

61
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:32,190
people are using either the Panis are
endless in terms of how they interpret

62
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:36,900
emotional words, um, and what their
emotional vocabulary is prior to the, uh,

63
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:37,441
you know,

64
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:40,890
experiment where they're filling out these
measures instead with the Sam uses as

65
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:45,210
a graphical icon of a human man,
good old Sam.

66
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,450
And what it's measuring really is
emotional activation or arousal.

67
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:49,890
So if you scan left to right,

68
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,160
you see someone at the left who's
not very emotionally activated,

69
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,420
very low arousal all the way up to the
right where it's extremely emotionally

70
00:03:57,421 --> 00:04:01,590
activated. He's about to explode right
here from so much emotional intensity.

71
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,250
So this is a nice alternative if you
want to see to what extent, you know,

72
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:09,300
if you take language away and just use
graphical depictions of emotion related

73
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:10,134
intensity,

74
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,160
if you're able to get the same kind of
response that you would get using emotion

75
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:19,050
related adjectives. So, um,

76
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,370
let's think about questionnaires.

77
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:24,790
So there's different ways that you
can collect questionnaire responses.

78
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,730
One way is to use traditional
paper and pencil methods.

79
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,480
So bringing the questionnaires printed
out into the laboratory and have the

80
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,600
participants fill it out.
Much like the picture you see here.

81
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,650
So this is considered the traditional
way that's actually now becoming more of

82
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:39,670
the old school way.

83
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,850
So it seems more and more that
people are now collecting self report

84
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:46,600
questionnaires using computerized
online survey methods.

85
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,260
So one common use survey method
that people use as Qualtrics.

86
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:54,340
So Qualtrics is an example of how you
can actually program these questionnaires

87
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,120
using this interface and have people
instead of writing out the response,

88
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,740
simply click or select a particular
response option on the computer and then

89
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:07,180
have this particular online survey program
output the data for you in either a

90
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:11,860
very easily accessible excel,
SPSS or other type of format.

91
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,320
In addition, we see another method
that's gaining increasing attention,

92
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,540
which is Amazon's mechanical Turk.

93
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,670
So this is a very widespread
and ever-growing way to
collect data outside of

94
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:28,300
simply college undergraduate samples
from people around the world.

95
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:32,290
So you can distribute surveys and even
within the course of 24 hours have a

96
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,170
large number of self report
questionnaire responses.

97
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,150
So if you're interested
in more about this,

98
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:41,140
you can definitely look at some readings
that have suggested the potential power

99
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,010
of a tool like this for collecting
self report questionnaire. Assessment,

100
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,440
some emotion in a relatively
short time period.

101
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,740
Another method is called
narrative methods.

102
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:55,480
So this goes beyond general categories
to capture more nuance themes of a

103
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:59,720
person's unique emotional life. So
I particularly like this quote. Um,

104
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,650
this was a quote from the book living
narrative, and it goes as follows.

105
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,820
Putting events in a temporal sequence
not only orders them with respect to each

106
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:11,000
other, it creates an
overarching interpretive frame.

107
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,070
Just as a succession of notes does not
necessarily constitute a melodic phrase.

108
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,690
So events that are randomly recounted
do not make a story like notes.

109
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:24,350
The narrated events need to be
cast as members of an ordered set,

110
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,930
like a melodic phrase,
such as set,

111
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:30,410
constitutes a coherent narrative
unit called an episode.

112
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,030
So here what you're doing is
you're collecting people's
either verbal or written

113
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:39,350
descriptions of their emotional
experiences and you can code it, you know,

114
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:42,440
along rich dimension of,
of different categories.

115
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:45,210
You can look at the temporal
sequencing of the event,

116
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:49,370
sort of what's the linear trajectory
or lack thereof in which they tell the

117
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:50,204
story.

118
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,710
You can look at a particular kinds of
emotion words or metaphors people use. Um,

119
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:58,490
you can also look at the rich context
that they embed their emotions in and

120
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:01,340
whether they described their emotions as
being something that they're an active

121
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:04,460
agent over or simply a
passive recipient of.

122
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,820
So these are things that you simply can't
get using questionnaires and that you

123
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:12,650
can get using a narrative methodology.
Related to this,

124
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Pennebaker has developed a computerized
system called the Luke l IWC linguistic

125
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:19,940
inquiry and word count.

126
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,560
And what he does using the system is
he's able to take text of people's either

127
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,670
verbal narratives of speeches that
have been transcribed or again,

128
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:30,320
people will do writing assignments.

129
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:34,070
And it's like the one in this slide where
there'll be asked to sort of keep an

130
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:38,480
emotional diary over a time period where
they record their deepest emotions and

131
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:41,810
thoughts about some
emotional upheaval. Um, in,

132
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,220
in his instructions he asks people to
really let go and explore the event and

133
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:49,820
how it has affected you. You might
tie this experience to your childhood,

134
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,440
your relationship with your parents,

135
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,850
people you have loved or love now or
even your career and to write every day

136
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,920
continuously for 20 minutes.

137
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,590
What he's done with this exercise is
taken people's written descriptions of the

138
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:06,650
emotional upheaval or difficulty
that they're currently confronting.

139
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,220
Put it through his computerized
text analysis system, the Luke,

140
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,810
and then looked at the prevalence of
things such as pronoun usage, using more,

141
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:15,471
for example,

142
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:19,670
I versus we words or looking at the
kinds of emotional words people use are

143
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:23,780
looking at the kind of insight that
develops in their sort of cognitive use of

144
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:28,550
language as they write about this event
every day for four consecutive days.

145
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,960
So he's able to actually see change
in people's emotional wellbeing as a

146
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:36,440
function of the language or ways in
which they described their emotional

147
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:39,890
experiences.
Now,

148
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,280
now we moved from questionnaires
and narrative methods,

149
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:46,400
Twitter called rating dials.
So you can see this here in the screen.

150
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,530
What rating dials do that's really
unique is they allow you to look at fine

151
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,920
grained, um, second by
second measurements of,

152
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,830
so here what you have people do
is while they're in a laboratory,

153
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,320
you have them place their hand on a dial.

154
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,220
So it may be one like the dial on the
left where they can move it from left to

155
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:09,100
right from very negative all the way
over to very positive or it can be more a

156
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,751
straight line.

157
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:13,800
Here we're very negative maybe at the
bottom and very positive at the top.

158
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,390
And this has been used in studies where
people are either watching dynamic films

159
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,620
over a several minute period or
interacting in discussions with partners.

160
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,870
And what people can do is literally
shift the dial second by second as their

161
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:29,700
emotion experience changes.

162
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,720
So all the methods we've talked about so
far are really looking at broader time

163
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:34,470
scopes,

164
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,090
asking people to write in that moment
how they felt on average or how they felt

165
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,350
during a,
you know,

166
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,100
emotional film after the film has ended
and what you miss out on are the fine

167
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:48,090
grain second by second changes or what
people call the aspect of chronometer.

168
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,470
Three of an emotion response.

169
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,980
Here you can look at not only how
intense someone felt in the motion,

170
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,230
but what were the patterns of variability.

171
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,380
How long did it take them to
reach their peak emotion state?

172
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,330
How long did it take them to recover?

173
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,050
You can answer a whole host of really
rich questions when you use continuous

174
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:05,040
styles like this.

175
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,090
The one disadvantage some people might
argue is that it may interfere with the

176
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:10,890
actual experience of the emotion.

177
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,370
So you can imagine being in a conversation
with someone while they're sharing a

178
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:17,910
distressing event and you may find
it cognitively difficult to both pay

179
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:21,990
attention to the individual speaking
and sort of keep your hand on this lever

180
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,990
constantly moving it around
is your emotion state shifts.

181
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,920
But these are some of the
rich possibilities that
you can really extract when

182
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:32,100
you use these, you know,
more continuous rating dials.

183
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,600
And then finally the third sort of common
measure of subjective spirits as you

184
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:39,930
can see here is what's called
experience sampling methods,

185
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,760
often referred to as ESM.

186
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,440
So ESM is a really fascinating way to
collect information about a person's

187
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:51,030
emotion state outside of the lab and
their own naturalistic daily life.

188
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,140
So here this is a type of data collection
in which participants respond to

189
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:59,850
repeated assessments at moments over
the course of time while functioning and

190
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:01,920
living within their natural life settings.

191
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,600
So people originally would do ESM
studies starting with the alarm clock,

192
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:09,480
stacks of paper, palm pilot, pagers.

193
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,760
And today with all the
advances of technology,

194
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:16,761
there is now iPhone apps that people can
use to report over multiple times in a

195
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,360
given day at random intervals. How are
they feeling? What contexts are they in?

196
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,890
What kinds of strategies are they using
to effectively manage their emotions?

197
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,670
So what's Nice is that people can
respond directly to these devices.

198
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,240
It's time saving. It's convenient
often for participants to do it.

199
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:35,100
At their own time and their own life.

200
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,390
And what you can then do is just transfer
the state data relatively easily to a

201
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,030
computer for subsequent data analysis.

202
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:46,440
So this is one of the ways to sort of
get outside of the lab and try to capture

203
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:51,310
people's emotions as it's actually
lived in their daily life force.

204
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,920
The subjective experience of,

205
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,680
so for example,
um,

206
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,150
some of the things that experience
sampling methods provide, um,

207
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,370
are the following in addition to some
of the advantages I just highlighted.

208
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,190
So experience sampling methods one,

209
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,280
allow you to understand
behavioral contingencies.

210
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:13,360
So you can look at the
relationship between the
subjective experience of emotion

211
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,230
and the actual events occurring in their
lives and try to find some important

212
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:22,090
causal link between what happens in your
life and how that causes you to feel or

213
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:26,410
at least understand the association
between the two. Second,

214
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,340
it has good ecological validity. So this
is a term we've heard a lot in this,

215
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,970
you know, three part module on
emotional elicitation and measurement,

216
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,380
which really means how again,

217
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:39,580
how much does it map onto the
person's own real world experience.

218
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:43,180
Because here you're getting people to
get outside of the lab in their own

219
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:47,440
naturalistic every day environment.
Third,

220
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,430
what you can do here,

221
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:51,790
since you're getting multiple measures
of emotion within a single participant

222
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,020
across, you know, a wide, uh, period
of time, maybe a couple of days,

223
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:59,710
all the way up to a week or a month as
you can investigate what's referred to as

224
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:01,840
intra individual processes.

225
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,640
So this is within person processes such
as differences within a person that can

226
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:09,100
change over time or across the situation.

227
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,820
So we can all think of ways in which our
own mood may fluctuate over the course

228
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:15,220
of a day or in response to
different kinds of events.

229
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,790
And Esm lets you actually
look at that scientifically.

230
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,780
So we've talked a little bit about
subjective measures of or how we feel.

231
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,540
Now let's move to behavioral
measures or how do we look,

232
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:30,460
how do we behave when we're feeling
emotional? So behavioral measures, um,

233
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:34,360
some of the two most common use tools
in this domain are the facial action

234
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:38,320
coding system and the staff system.
So we'll talk about each of these in turn.

235
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,660
So we'll begin with the fax system.

236
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:44,830
So this is one of the first systems
that was developed to systematically

237
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,470
quantify emotion expressions in the face.

238
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:52,710
So it was developed by Paul Ekman and
freezing in the 1970s and what it did is

239
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,600
tried to categorize facial behaviors,

240
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,800
not based on overall sort of subjective
impressions of how emotional the

241
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:00,880
person's face looked,

242
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,560
but instead based on a more sort of
micro level rigorous coding of the

243
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:10,330
underlying muscle configurations that
are used to give rise to an emotion

244
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:11,164
expression.

245
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:16,210
So every little sort of unit of muscle
action he would say is what he called an

246
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:21,211
action unit or Aau and specific action
units where specific a use he would argue

247
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,910
combined together to reflect emotions.

248
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,180
So we'll go through an example of
what kind of a use, for example,

249
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:30,880
give rise to the expression
of happiness when we smile.

250
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,410
Now facts is incredibly rigorous and often
considered a gold standard and coding

251
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:38,770
emotional behavior in the face,
but it comes at the cost.

252
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:43,240
So it takes 80 to a hundred
hours to train on the system.

253
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,120
And once you've gone
through the training manual,

254
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,840
you have to pass a nationwide standardized
certified test become what's called a

255
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,660
official facts coder.

256
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,870
So this is something that myself
and my students in my lab have done.

257
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,170
And it's a considerable time investment.
But once you do it,

258
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,900
it changes the way you
look at the face forever.

259
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,610
You notice subtle muscle shifts all around
in the face that we often, you know,

260
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,830
maybe barely detect or go unnoticed.

261
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,280
And this particular system allows
you to capture them, notice them,

262
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:17,060
and quantify them.
So let's look at an example here.

263
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,090
So hugely an expression of a
woman looking, for example,

264
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:21,890
you might say she looks scared.
Now,

265
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:25,130
what are the particular muscle units in
our face that make her look that way?

266
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:29,150
So here these codes here, one
c, two c, five d, et Cetera,

267
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:33,620
these are the action units. So the action
units or the particular numbers here,

268
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:34,700
one, two, five, four,

269
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:39,500
20 etc. And the letters next to them
refer to the intensity of the display.

270
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,240
So they go from a,
which is sort of at the lowest sense.

271
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:46,490
So it's a trace all the
way up to [inaudible],

272
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:50,660
which is the maximal intensity of how
much you could contract that muscle.

273
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,300
So you see a c here that's
somewhere in the middle.

274
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:57,440
So she's raising her inner eyebrow
at a moderate degree, right?

275
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,020
And it really tries to code
all of these separately,

276
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,200
not looking so much at overall,
how do we think she's feeling,

277
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,070
but what specific muscles are being
activated and contracted while that

278
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:09,920
particular expression is occurring.
Now here,

279
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:14,120
what's interesting is that you can use
facts to reliably identify what's called

280
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:16,970
a real smile or a Duchenne smile.

281
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,420
So what are the characteristics of someone
when they're smiling authentically?

282
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,580
Well,
there's two distinguishing features.

283
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,090
One of them is called the
Aau six or the cheek racer.

284
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,540
Now this in older adults,
older than this young girl here,

285
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,050
we also call it the crows feet.
So when we raise our cheeks up,

286
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:37,250
what often happens in us older adults
is you see fine lines develop on the

287
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:38,450
corner of the eyes.

288
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,530
And so that's one kind of telltale
sign that it's a genuine smile.

289
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,580
And you also see what's called an Aau
12 which is really taking the corners of

290
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:49,520
the lips and pulling them upwards.
What we often think of as a smile.

291
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,560
So this is a genuine smile.

292
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,160
How do we contrast this then with
a fake or non Duchenne smile?

293
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,390
So what do you notice here? What is
different from the picture you just saw?

294
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,210
So those of you who said,
hey,

295
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,630
the Aau six is missing are exactly right.

296
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:10,250
So these kind of fake smiles we do for
photos or an awkward social situations,

297
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,430
what we're doing is we're trying
to pull the lip corners up,

298
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,800
but we're not able to move our cheeks up.

299
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:19,190
We're not able to kind of get those
crow's feet, you know, in action.

300
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,230
And that's because Paul Ekman and others
would argue that a genuine smile is not

301
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:26,300
something that we can voluntarily produce.

302
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,770
It's actually something
that's quite involuntary and
usually only co occurs when

303
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:32,300
we're genuinely feeling happy.

304
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,570
So if you want to know how to detect
a real smile from a fake smile,

305
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,340
look for the [inaudible] that she
grazer that you see. Not In this man,

306
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,620
but you see in this young girl here, okay,
so now let's look at the staff system.

307
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,580
So the spouse systems really fantastic
and includes additional codes that aren't

308
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:53,370
inherent in the fact system.
And as you can see here,

309
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:56,970
some of the additional codes that are
included in this bath system and that were

310
00:17:56,971 --> 00:18:01,410
really developed to help measure emotional
behavior in the context of dyadic

311
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:02,244
interactions.

312
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,020
Frequently between romantic partners or
spouses are additional behavioral and

313
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:08,340
even auditory cues.

314
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,420
So it will have postural codes such as
when someone sits up or forward when

315
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:15,760
they're talking to their spouse,
it'll try to get at intonation.

316
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,350
So whether or not there are changes in
a person's vocal pitch or whether they

317
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:23,220
were speaking at a different volume and
also gets at what a really important

318
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:25,170
emotional behaviors such as laughter,

319
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,130
which the fax system
does not itself code as,

320
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:32,880
it's only coding the ways in which the
face is contracting in terms of the

321
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:37,680
underlying musculature. So spath is also
fantastic to use and as you can see,

322
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,790
it's based off the fact system.
You see the same Aau six and a 12,

323
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,480
but it has additional codes here.
So you can see the man on the right.

324
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:49,140
This is Jim Coan. Um, a wonderful
aspect of scientists in the field.

325
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,540
And you see here not
only the Aau six and 12,

326
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:55,080
but also additional descriptions of
things that are associated with interest,

327
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:57,390
affection, validation,
humor and enthusiasm.

328
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,390
And we might also look at whether or not
he's showing an increase in his vocal

329
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:04,260
pitch, looking at his posture as he's
sitting up and forward, et cetera.

330
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,480
So now we've talked about subjective
and behavioral. What about our body?

331
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,890
How does our body say anything about the
way we feel emotionally and how do we

332
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:17,820
measure that? So I'll start
here with our bodily sensations.

333
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,430
Looking at the question of,
you know,

334
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,490
can things like our heart rate or a
heartbeat actually really be a window into

335
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:25,500
our feelings?
So William James,

336
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:30,240
really the father of psychology first
echo this notion that indeed the body is a

337
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:33,180
window into the emotional soul.
He said,

338
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,240
no shade of emotion should be without
some sort of bodily reverberation or some

339
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:43,230
way in which our body shifts or sort
of undulates when we feel an emotion

340
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,064
response,

341
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,490
and we'll talk about this more in the
course will actually have a specific

342
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:48,750
lecture devoted to this.

343
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,710
Where we look at this question of is a
heart really a window into our feelings

344
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,060
and we'll also look at the specific kinds
of tools that people measure emotion

345
00:19:57,061 --> 00:20:00,660
in the lab. As you can see here, this is
actually one of my research assistants,

346
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:03,690
Christina reas and she has
a variety of electrodes,

347
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:05,070
are sensors that are attached.

348
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,000
And what these sensors do is they pick
up electrical activity of the heart every

349
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:12,720
time, the heartbeats as well as looking
at different respiration patterns.

350
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,810
So you can see here in this graph
are things like the heartbeat.

351
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:20,370
So the red signal here and every little
blue.at the top is it is a distinct

352
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:25,320
point at which her heartbeats
and what you can do,

353
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:27,420
and we'll talk again about this
in more depth when we get to the

354
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:29,040
psychophysiology of emotion.

355
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,340
As you can map specific types of
autonomic nervous system or ans changes to

356
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:36,030
emotion responses.

357
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:40,590
So we can try to map specific
physiological profiles of anger, fear,

358
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:41,670
sadness,
disgust,

359
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:45,930
and even happiness simply based on
changes in our bodily responses.

360
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,760
So that's the peripheral
autonomic nervous system.

361
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:53,060
What about the central nervous system
or the brain? So there's, you know,

362
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,500
three kind of major divisions of the
brain that are thought to be included in

363
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:59,530
emotion.
So this includes the limbic system.

364
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,370
So this includes the hypothalamus
and Mig, Dulla, nucleus accumbens,

365
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:08,050
and several other nearby areas and has
great importance in emotional life and

366
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:10,510
memories for emotional events.
As you can see here.

367
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,310
Second is the stride
system or the striatum.

368
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,510
So this includes the putamen
caught a nucleus nucleus accumbens,

369
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,540
and it's divided into both the
dorsal and ventral striatum.

370
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,430
As you can see roughly here,

371
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,730
and this is often thought of as
the reward center of the brain.

372
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:31,750
So it's often associated with the
experience of pleasure or reward.

373
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,720
And third is the NEOCORTEX.

374
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,060
So this is the outer layer of the
brain as you can roughly see here,

375
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,070
deeply folded and grooved.

376
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,180
And here are the prefrontal cortex is
in the front part of the brain and we

377
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:46,210
think of this as sort of the
prefrontal cognitive control region.

378
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:50,290
So this is thought to be involved in
the regulation or control of emotion.

379
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,190
Each of these three subdivisions of the
brain will also go much further into

380
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:56,410
depth when we get to the
brain basis of emotion.

381
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,060
But I want you to see today as there's
really rich complex tools to study bodily

382
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:01,541
changes,

383
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:05,650
both in our autonomic nervous system
and higher up in our brain that indeed

384
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:08,020
provide clues into our
emotional wellbeing.

385
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:09,730
Yeah,

386
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,840
the central nervous system,

387
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:14,200
we can look at responses using things
called functional magnetic resonance

388
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:15,460
imaging or Mri.

389
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,000
Here we can look at areas of the
brain that seem to be activated during

390
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:21,730
different kinds of emotional
challenges or stressors.

391
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,140
Okay.

392
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,760
And we can also use Brainly's lesion.

393
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,450
Patient patients such as old Phineas gage,

394
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,830
who had a naturally occurring legion in
his orbital frontal cortex while working

395
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:37,030
on a railroad and after this lesion was
found to have profound changes in his

396
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:39,850
behavior.
So he was an uninhibited,

397
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,870
more aggressive and seem to just be
less emotionally regulated than he was

398
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:47,710
before. And you can also look at
areas of damage as well as um,

399
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,290
areas of disease as well.
So we've briefly touched on subjective,

400
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:58,000
behavioral and physiological
ways to measure emotion as
an introduction into the

401
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:02,260
emotion response system.
So now turn to our takeaway questions.

402
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:04,840
Yeah.

403
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,470
So the first takeaway question really
just has you recap what were the three

404
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:13,090
types of subjective emotion measures
discussed today. The second asks,

405
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,300
what are the two major behavioral
coding systems of emotion,

406
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,750
really prominent tools in the field
that were discussed in this lecture.

407
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,770
And finally,
how can the physiological body,

408
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,490
both in the autonomic or peripheral
nervous system as well as the central

409
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:32,491
nervous system actually be a potential
way to reflect our inner emotional life.

410
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,390
And with that,
I will now segue to our expert interview.

411
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,990
This is part of our experts in emotion
interview series where we're going to be

412
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:44,290
exploring questions about emotion
through the eyes of some of the most

413
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,340
distinguished scholars in the field.

414
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,810
So today we'll be speaking with doctor
iris smells on emotion measurement.

415
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,550
So doctor mouse received her phd from
Stanford University and is currently an

416
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:59,750
assistant professor of psychology at UC
Berkeley where she directs the emotion

417
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:01,670
and emotion regulation laboratory.

418
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,080
Dr. Miles is an expert in the nature
of emotion and emotion regulation.

419
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,790
And her work has forged exciting new
paths and measuring emotion response,

420
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,150
examining coherence between
different components of emotion,

421
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,000
looking at the measurement
and elicitation of anger,

422
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,260
and more recently the pursuit of
happiness and how it relates to our mental

423
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:22,400
health and wellbeing.

424
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,500
So I now turn to an incredibly special
experts and emotion interview with Doctor

425
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:29,540
Iris Mouse on emotion measurement.
