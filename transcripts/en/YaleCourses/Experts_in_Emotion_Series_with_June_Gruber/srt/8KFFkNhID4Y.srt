1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,490
I think this class is
pretty special for one.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,050
It's one of the few courses in the world
that's actually about human emotions

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,360
that's actually getting into the
trenches to understand why we are these

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,930
emotional creatures that we are.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,520
So what we're trying to do is get students
exposed to a broad variety of issues

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,590
that cut across many disciplines.

7
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:27,591
So these are disciplines ranging from
psychology to neuroscience to linguistics,

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,340
even to things like computer
science and even to art and music.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,540
So we're going to be approaching emotion
from a whole variety of perspectives.

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,741
And by doing this,

11
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:42,210
we'll be able to really answer
some fundamental questions
about what we feel and

12
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:45,510
why we feel it.
So we'll look at what is an emotion?

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,180
Where do emotions come
from in the first place?

14
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,280
Are we born as emotional creatures,

15
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:52,710
or is this something we
learned through experience?

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,190
And can we learn how to actually control
our emotions and use them to build

17
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:03,090
healthier, happier, and I would
hope more meaningful lives too.
