1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,370
Welcome back to human emotion. Um,
today we're going to talk about crying.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,410
So crying is something that really
punctuates the human life course from our

3
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:13,500
start is helpless.
Infants through adulthood.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,150
Tears seem to mark our most
important life moments, weddings,

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,770
births,
deaths.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,980
This capacity to cry really appears
to be this fundamental part of being a

7
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:25,944
human.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,390
And it's really an important signal of
some of our most salient life events.

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,790
Yet,
why do we cry?

10
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:37,791
Why do we have these sort of glands
that excrete water coming down our face?

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,900
What function does it serve and what
happens in our bodies when we cry?

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,190
Um, so today we're going to try to grapple
with some of these questions about an

13
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:50,160
experience that's familiar
to almost all of us,

14
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:54,960
which is a time we remember crying.
And as we can see here,

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,900
crying not only occurs in infants,
but occurs throughout the lifespan.

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,800
So we,
like I said,

17
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:06,801
we cry from birth all the way to death
and it appears to be part and parcel of

18
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:08,580
being human.

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,810
And crying appears at least
to be important in some way,

20
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,560
although mysterious for
our emotional wellbeing.

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,230
So we see crying also
widely spread in the media.

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,750
So we can see examples here
of, oh, President Obama, um,

23
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,530
who cried. You know, it says here,

24
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:31,260
cried while thanking the
campaign workers in Chicago.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,430
We see crying also in the
media with Hillary Clinton. Um,

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,500
we see it pervasive everywhere in our
life, even in the political sphere.

27
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:46,370
We also see songs that have been devoted
exclusively to talk about crying.

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,610
So one of my favorite bands, the
cure has a song. Boys don't cry.

29
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,960
And this not only speaks about crying to
speaks about some of our beliefs about

30
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,930
who ought to cry and in what
context should they cry.

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,640
There's other popular songs such
as the crying game by Boy George.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,990
And this is all to highlight that
crime is part of what makes us human.

33
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,370
And in many ways,

34
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:13,371
we wouldn't be who we are if we didn't
cry throughout our lifespan in public and

35
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:16,680
private spheres and even devoting songs,

36
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,570
it's exclusively to crying.
So with all this emphasis on crying,

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,580
being such an integral part of
our most salient life experiences,

38
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,500
why do we cry?

39
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,740
And what can we learn about human crying
that's going to help us in our own

40
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:39,090
life? So today we're going to try
to talk about crying. And again,

41
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,650
what I want you to first think about,

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,580
and I think what all captures
our attention is to think
about a personal time in

43
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,100
your own life that you
can remember crying.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,400
So I want you to take a moment and
pause this video and go through this

45
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:57,180
exercise, your own personal crying
reflection exercise. So again,

46
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,800
when you're crying and
you've identified a moment,

47
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:04,090
I want you to write down what
elicited the crying sort of episode,

48
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,430
what was going on in
your body when you cried?

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,030
What were the features of the crags?
Sort of what did it sound like?

50
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:13,120
What did it look like?
How long did it last?

51
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,850
Did it have any possible social effects?

52
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,780
And how did you feel after
you had finished crying?

53
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,030
So pause the video, take a moment to
write this down. And once you're ready,

54
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:27,850
you can hit play again.
And we'll proceed with the lecture today.

55
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,610
So today we're going to be
talking about crying. You know,

56
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:37,510
do we have tiers to express our fears?
Are there tears of joy?

57
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,140
What do these tiers in our
life actually mean to us?

58
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,640
What do they symbolize and
what can we learn about crying?

59
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,360
So let's think about our roadmap here.

60
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,950
We'll start with underlying theories that
people believe to have been true about

61
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,770
crying.
Then we'll get to some really subtle,

62
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,120
a contextual factors that suggest that
what makes crying adaptive are good for

63
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:07,381
us is actually really dependent on the
context and an actually much more complex

64
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,870
rich mystery about crying then
we could have ever imagined.

65
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,920
We'll conclude them with our takeaway
questions and expert interview with a

66
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,650
renowned authority on human crying.

67
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,510
So let's first start with our own
lay theories about why do we cry?

68
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,410
What is the function and purpose
of crying in the first place?

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,470
I always like to start with some of
these quotes that suggests that crying is

70
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:35,080
good for us,
that it seems to be strongly beneficial.

71
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,270
So you can read here early writing
saying that it is a relief to weep.

72
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,350
Grief is satisfied and
carried off by tears.

73
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,530
So this kind of early lay opinion
suggests that crying must be strongly

74
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:54,970
beneficial in some way. It helps us
sort of wash away our grief and worries.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,200
And here is,
we'll see,

76
00:04:58,201 --> 00:05:02,280
we'll go through several common beliefs
about crying that have evolved since

77
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:06,960
then.
So in popular articles we see in the news,

78
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:10,860
in the media and books,
it all suggests to us that well,

79
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:12,300
crime must be healthy.

80
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,690
So there was an analysis done of 140
years of popular articles about crying.

81
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,280
And in these articles,

82
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,420
94% suggested that crying is beneficial,

83
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:25,830
but it must be good for us.

84
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,270
And in fact that when you try to
suppress or hold back your tears,

85
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,760
that that is actually
going to be deleterious,

86
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:35,430
that it's actually going to
hurt your body and your mind.

87
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,560
So this suggests that we should cry
as we feel it and that by crying we're

88
00:05:40,561 --> 00:05:42,570
actually doing something healthy for us,

89
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,260
that it almost has this
cathartic function for us.

90
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,950
There's also been cross cultural studies
as you can see her that also suggests

91
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:56,510
that crimes Cathartic. So a survey
was done spanning 30 countries.

92
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,350
And these surveys found that when
you just ask people to report,

93
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:05,351
well how did you feel after you finished
crying that people by and large report

94
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:09,230
feeling better after crying.
So again,

95
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:13,820
we seem to have this belief
and some research suggesting
that crying is good for

96
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:18,320
us. There was also these
more psychodynamic theories.

97
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:22,730
So these are sort of originated by
Sigmund Freud who suggested that blocking

98
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:27,731
tears or is holding them back
actually causes psychological damage.

99
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,810
So in psychotherapy you would actually
want to encourage your clients or

100
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:36,740
patients who are feeling distressed,
feeling depressed, feeling anxious,

101
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,320
just to kind of let the tears out,
right?

102
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,250
To sort of cry openly in therapy sessions
because this was in some way going to

103
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:45,590
cleanse them of their worries and fears.

104
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,810
And then finally there's these biochemical
theories of crying that suggests,

105
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:54,380
well, there's actually a sense
in which tiers rid our body,

106
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:58,460
kind of expel out these
harmful toxins in our bodies.

107
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:03,530
So all of these common theories about
crying suggests uniformly it will of

108
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:05,570
course crying must be good for us.

109
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,560
And all we need to know is
that when we feel like crying,

110
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,640
we should just let the
tears pour out, right? Or,

111
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,120
or is there more to this story
than crying is simply good for us.

112
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,730
Here I want to ask the question
then is crying really healthy?

113
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:28,040
And here I want to sort of think of us
as almost a Sherlock Holmes where we want

114
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,690
to go in as scientists,

115
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:34,691
as students in a course on human emotion
and ask ourselves where exactly is the

116
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:39,170
evidence? Where's the scientific
proof that crying is healthy?

117
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,190
We want to go beyond just people's
beliefs about crying, go beyond, you know,

118
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:48,191
anecdotal evidence and popular articles
and set up a scientific study using the

119
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:52,400
same research methods we talked about
earlier in the course to really see where

120
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:53,570
the data leads us.

121
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,280
So I'm going to lead you on a beginning
of this Sherlock Holmes investigation

122
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,730
and actually suggest that maybe crying
isn't always healthy and in fact maybe

123
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:07,100
there's a nuance story to win.

124
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,070
It is healthy and when it
might actually not be healthy.

125
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,970
So this is going to lead us into some
rich and subtle contextual factors that

126
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:18,680
are going to determine for us when,

127
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,460
where and for whom crying
is actually healthy.

128
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,720
So example one crying is healthy
but it depends on the context.

129
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,030
So it depends first on how
you actually measure crying.

130
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,830
And what do I mean by this?

131
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:39,710
So I'm going back to some of the methods
that we spoke about earlier in the

132
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:40,544
course.

133
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:45,670
So here we find that when you do self
report surveys and you measure the

134
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,630
benefits of crying retrospectively,

135
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:52,631
so you ask people to self report how
they felt after they cried that indeed 60

136
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:56,130
to 70% of people report
crime crimes Cathartic.

137
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,570
They report feeling less tension, they
report feeling more relief. However,

138
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:03,660
if you do laboratory studies,
so bring people into the lab,

139
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,030
have them watch a film
that makes them feel sad,

140
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:08,460
that elicits tears or recall a memory,

141
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,830
their own personal
autobiographical memory.

142
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,490
And you measure their response
immediately after crying.

143
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:18,930
So one to two minutes later that
people actually report feeling worse.

144
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,200
So they report feeling sad and the report
feeling more physiologically aroused

145
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,190
or they actually show it in there in the
physiological measurements when they're

146
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:30,300
watching sad films.

147
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,680
So it actually seems to show very
different evidence if you use surveys,

148
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:37,410
which suggests it's beneficial
as opposed to loud studies,

149
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:41,340
which suggest it may not always
feel so good to cry. Okay,

150
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,870
here's another example,

151
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,430
whether or not crying is good for us
also depends on these social context.

152
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,480
And by social context what we're talking
about is whether you are around other

153
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:53,910
people or you're alone by yourself crying.

154
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,600
We can probably both remember examples
of each and the example that you thought

155
00:09:57,601 --> 00:10:01,620
of at the beginning of the class. Was
it around others or was it by yourself?

156
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,030
So we find that when we're actually
around other people crying that crying.

157
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:10,080
What it does around other people is it's
signaling to others that you want to,

158
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,400
um,
you know,

159
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,450
seek some solace and you solicit
comfort from other people.

160
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,950
So when you're around people,

161
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:21,120
then the benefits of crying man actually
come from the social support of people

162
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,250
coming up to you,
embracing new,

163
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:27,750
trying to help you as opposed to maybe
the actual act of crying in and of

164
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:30,450
itself.
Because when we're alone and we cry,

165
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,980
there's no one there to provide comfort
for us. And so when we're crying alone,

166
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:39,060
we don't seem to reap these
positive health benefits. Okay.

167
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,990
Another example suggests that whether or
not crying is beneficial depends on the

168
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:46,284
person.

169
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,460
So it depends on their personality
as well as their gender.

170
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,790
So what do we find in
terms of these things?

171
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,950
So in terms of personality,

172
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,540
we find that people who score higher in
a personality trait called neuroticism.

173
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,290
So this is a trait that is often
thought to involve greater emotional

174
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,041
instability.

175
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:09,480
So sort of more volatile ups and downs
in their emotions that these people

176
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:14,370
actually report more frequent
crying episodes and that
of those crying episodes,

177
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:16,980
they don't seem to sort of
reap the benefits from them.

178
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:21,750
They actually report feeling
more distressed and more
aroused from crying. Um,

179
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,280
when we think of gender differences,

180
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:28,281
we find that adult women cry more
frequently and intensely than men.

181
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,300
So it seems that both personality and
gender characteristics have a profound

182
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:36,930
influence on the nature
and frequency of crying.

183
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,630
There's still a lot of
evidence that needs to however,

184
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:43,620
be discovered as to whether or not
crying is more or less beneficial.

185
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:47,490
For example, in men versus women.
We don't know that answer yet.

186
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:49,250
So there's a lot of, um, uh,

187
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,150
answered mysteries at this point
too about crying of a fourth

188
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:59,150
example is that crying really depends on
the emotional state of the person as to

189
00:11:59,371 --> 00:12:03,720
whether or not it's going to be good
for them or bad for them, so to speak.

190
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,150
So let me flush out what I mean by this.

191
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,740
So what we see here is that people,
for example,

192
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:13,980
who have a history of depression
or who are feeling depressed,

193
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,510
that when they cry,

194
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:19,920
they actually experience less
improvement in their mood after crying.

195
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,800
So they don't seem to sort of
reap the cathartic benefits.

196
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:27,450
They don't necessarily feel better after
crying as opposed to people who don't

197
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:30,900
have a history of depression who
may read more of these benefits.

198
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:32,830
Okay.

199
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,510
If you also look at anxiety,
um,

200
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,620
research has found that anxious people
as well are less likely to feel better

201
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,880
after crying.

202
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,770
So people who have a history of depression
or anxiety appear not to reap the

203
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:51,340
benefits that many of us
associate with crying. So again,

204
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:55,300
it really depends on the emotional
makeup of the person as to whether or not

205
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:59,020
crying is actually helping them
or may even be hurting them.

206
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,910
Okay.

207
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,541
However,

208
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:07,280
and what this point suggests here is
that clearly more studies are needed only

209
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:10,610
until very recently on a lot of
the work done by John Rottenberg,

210
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,940
who's part of the experts in
emotion interview for this series,

211
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,240
we had really seen just a complete
lack or dearth of scientific data.

212
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,080
And so we need to do many more rigorous
studies on the nature of crying to

213
00:13:24,081 --> 00:13:28,910
really unlock its mysteries and either
try to confirm more of this everyday

214
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:33,950
intuition that crying is good for us
or disconfirm it by saying it actually

215
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,780
isn't good for us.
You know,

216
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:39,470
always in every condition at
every time and for every person.

217
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,780
So for those of you interested in crying,

218
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,340
here's a call to you to become a scientist
and researcher of crying so we can

219
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:50,600
better understand this everyday
common experience that we've all had.

220
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,190
Yeah.

221
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,250
So now I'm going to move to our
takeaway questions for today.

222
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,660
The first question from today really just
asks you to remember what were some of

223
00:14:02,661 --> 00:14:05,510
these early theories or
beliefs about crying.

224
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,780
And a lot of them are focusing on the
ways in which crying is thought to be

225
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,820
beneficial.
Second,

226
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,910
how does the measurement of
crying influenced findings
concerning whether or not

227
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:21,740
crying is actually beneficial for us?
Whether we use subjective reports, uh,

228
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,350
that are more retrospective or versus
more laboratory based assessments.

229
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,480
And finally, how do factors
such as gender, personality,

230
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:35,481
social contexts as well as
sort of emotional disposition
or makeup influence the

231
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:37,650
potential benefits of crying.

232
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:39,960
Okay.

233
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,950
And I'd like you also to go back to the
exercise and we had at the beginning of

234
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:47,070
class and to think about
what you learned today,

235
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,950
how does it change the way you think
about your own individual or episode of

236
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:52,700
crying?

237
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,810
Does it change the way you think about
what the possible effects were or what

238
00:14:56,811 --> 00:15:00,490
was going on in your body
or what the context was? Um,

239
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,880
when you are crying that
may have determined whether
or not you found it healthy

240
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,200
or may be harmful.

241
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,203
Okay.

242
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,941
And with that,

243
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:13,080
we'll now turn to our expert interview
as part of our experts and emotion

244
00:15:13,081 --> 00:15:14,220
interview series.

245
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:15,760
Yeah.

246
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,830
For our experts and emotion interview,

247
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:21,550
we have the honor speaking with
Doctor Jonathan Rottenberg, um,

248
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,150
a leading researcher in the area
of emotion and psychopathology.

249
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,440
Jonathan Rottenberg has pioneered
efforts to integrate the basic science of

250
00:15:29,441 --> 00:15:32,140
emotion with the study of psychopathology.

251
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,640
He received his phd from Stanford
University and is currently an associate

252
00:15:36,641 --> 00:15:41,170
professor of psychology at the University
of South Florida where he directs the

253
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:43,090
mood and emotion laboratory.

254
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,140
He's the lead editor of an n
of emotion and psychopathology,

255
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:49,450
bridging effect of and clinical science.

256
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,350
And he's authored over 30
scientific publications. His work,

257
00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:56,440
not surprisingly focused on
depression as well as crying,

258
00:15:56,441 --> 00:16:00,490
has received international media coverage,
including science news,

259
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,240
Scientific American, the
New York Times, ABC News,

260
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,570
and the BBC.
He also writes a blog.

261
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,040
I'm about depression for psychology today.
Um,

262
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,820
one fun fact about Jonathan Rottenberg
is that he decided in his early forties,

263
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,570
he was going to train for a marathon,
and by the time we'll speak with him,

264
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:21,940
he'll have already run
three during that time.

265
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:26,950
So I now turn to our experts and
emotion interview with Doctor Jonathan

266
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,820
Rottenberg, answering the question
of, is crying actually good for us?

267
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:36,770
Yeah.
