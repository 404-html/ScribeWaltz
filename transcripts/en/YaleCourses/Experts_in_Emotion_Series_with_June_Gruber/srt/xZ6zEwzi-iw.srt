00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,160
Today we'll be speaking with Dr. James
Gross from Stanford University on emotion

2
00:00:05,561 --> 00:00:06,394
regulation.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,630
Dr. James Gross is a professor of
psychology at Stanford University.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,310
He received his BA in philosophy and
psychology from Yale University and phd in

5
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:20,311
clinical psychology from UC Berkeley with
subsequent postdoctoral training at Uc

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,360
San Francisco.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,160
Dr. Gross is widely regarded as the
pioneer in the field of emotion regulation

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:32,490
and his work has received numerous
awards including early career awards,

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,700
um,

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,700
from the society for psychophysiological
research in early career award from the

11
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,960
American Psychological
Association Outstanding Young
Researcher Award from the

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,020
Western Psychological Association and
countless teaching awards such as an award

13
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:49,390
for teaching excellence
at Stanford University,

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,480
such as the Walter j Gorgeous Award
for excellence in teaching the Bass

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,990
University fellow and undergraduate
education and a postdoctoral mentor new

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,830
award from Stanford University.

17
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,910
His work has been supported by
numerous grants from the NIH, NSF,

18
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,490
the Nid among others.

19
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:11,730
He's also published over 200 papers and
edited the authoritative handbook of

20
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:12,910
emotion regulation.

21
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:18,040
So I now turn to our experts in
emotion interview with Dr. James Gross.

22
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,490
So welcome James. Thank you for
speaking with us today. Pleasure.

23
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,770
I want it to begin with talking with
you about how you first got started in

24
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:28,710
studying emotion.

25
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:32,750
So could you tell us a bit about what
first sparked your interest in emotion

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,310
June?
That's a great question.

27
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:40,050
I've been interested in emotion for as
long as I can remember. Uh, academically,

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,540
the source of my interest comes from a
longstanding interest in philosophy where

29
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,160
at least in the western tradition,

30
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,190
there's this rich history of questions
around the role of reason versus passions

31
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:55,530
and guiding behavior.

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,660
And as I wrote philosophy paper
after philosophy paper at Yale as an

33
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:01,710
undergraduate,
I,

34
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,940
I found that the core of my interests
really revolved around problems,

35
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:09,750
about when reason should be
in control and when passions,

36
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,970
including emotions should be in control.

37
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,660
And that's what laid the foundation
for my work in psychology,

38
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:18,900
trying to understand empirically
how to balance the two.

39
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,711
Oh,
that's fascinating.

40
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:23,040
So you had this philosophical interest
in the nature of emotion that you're

41
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,940
later able to tackle with
empirical tools. Exactly. Right.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,890
So speaking of empirical
tools is actually,

43
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:32,730
I have a few questions I'd like to
ask you about your research. Um,

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,670
so we can all relate to
emotion in our everyday lives,

45
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:39,600
but it seems like defining things like
emotion and emotion regulation are really

46
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:43,080
a thorny and tricky issue.
So as an expert in this field,

47
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:47,190
I was curious to hear how you think about
defining what emotion is and how it's

48
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:48,780
different from emotion regulation.

49
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,110
That's a great question.
Uh,

50
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,090
in everyday life I think there's a
very strong sense in which we make a

51
00:02:56,091 --> 00:03:00,940
distinction between the emotions we have
and the things do to manage or change

52
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:01,990
those emotions.

53
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,850
And so in our work we find it useful
to map onto that intuitive or lay

54
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:07,690
distinction.

55
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,850
And what we have in mind is something
I think fairly straightforward in many

56
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:16,450
circumstances. Uh, an emotion might start,

57
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:21,451
we might start feeling angry with a
spouse or a child and as that anger and

58
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:25,120
folds coloring our thinking,
our facial behavior,

59
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,750
our physiologic responses,
as we become aware of that anger,

60
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:31,840
we may feel that that's
not the right response.

61
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,240
That's not a helpful response
in this circumstance.

62
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:39,241
And so try to modify or change
how that anger is playing out.

63
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,400
We may try not to show it or
may even try not to feel it.

64
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,620
And it's that late distinction between
the emotion on the one hand and efforts

65
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:51,700
to modify or change it that we're trying
to map onto when we make a distinction

66
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:56,701
between emotion reactions on the one
hand and emotion regulation on the other.

67
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,360
Another context for this distinction
that's important to us is uh,

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,370
how it plays out between people because
emotions aren't just things that happen

69
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:11,260
inside a person, but also
things that happen, uh, very
importantly between people.

70
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,490
So for example,

71
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:16,870
with a child or a spouse or a parent
that the other person may be in an

72
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:21,340
emotional state, let's say of sadness
where let's take the case of a child,

73
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:22,600
someone, uh, is very,

74
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:25,960
very disappointed and upset at
something that's happened at school.

75
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,320
And it's often the case,
particularly for young children,

76
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,150
they don't have the skills yet to
manage or modify their own emotions.

77
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,130
And so they may come to a parent or
older sibling for help and regulating

78
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:41,110
emotions.
And in that case too,

79
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:45,160
I think it makes sense to try to
distinguish between the emotions that are

80
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:50,161
playing out in the child
and the regulatory processes
that are invoked in the

81
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:53,140
key in this case with bio helping other.

82
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,970
And so I think what's important June
and thinking about this debate about

83
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:02,740
whether it makes sense to distinguish
between emotion reactions on the one hand

84
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:07,741
and emotion regulation on the other is
to ask for what purpose local purpose are

85
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:10,390
we making this distinction.

86
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,620
And I think part of the confusion in the
literature is that some people looking

87
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:16,150
at this distinction say,

88
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,420
well that's not a distinction
about real things in the world.

89
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,100
That is to say you can't guarantee with
necessary and sufficient conditions.

90
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:28,750
You can always distinguish between an
emotion generative process and an emotion

91
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:33,430
regulatory process. And my
response to that is that, uh,

92
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:37,550
I take more of a, um,
instrumental, uh, perspective and,

93
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,780
and think that this kind of distinction
isn't so much about defining natural

94
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:49,201
kinds in the world as it is about
creating contexts in which we can ask and

95
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:52,750
answer empirical questions
that matter to us.

96
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,990
And so this is a distinction
of convenience and I think
in some cases it's easy

97
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:02,780
to draw the line between
emotion generation and
regulation as in the cases I've

98
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:05,810
given.
But in other cases it becomes more blurry.

99
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,950
And that I feel from an instrumental
perspective it's not a problem because in

100
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:13,850
those cases we might not want to make
such a tight distinction between the two.

101
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,580
That that's great. And it relates to
what I was going to ask you more about,

102
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:22,110
which is you really laid out this roadmap
or process model of emotion regulation

103
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:24,860
that really has shaped the
way we all think about, um,

104
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,690
not only when emotion
regulation strategies occur,

105
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:31,740
but what specific kinds of strategies
or ways we use to manage our emotions.

106
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,060
And I was wondering,

107
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:36,330
when you think about sort of the future
of where emotion regulation is headed,

108
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,860
do you see this model changing or
growing over time? And in what ways?

109
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,110
June, uh, the process model of
emotion regulation is meant to be a,

110
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,340
a framework within which we all can think
about how emotions play out over time

111
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:55,820
and how they can then be modified
either by ourselves or by other people.

112
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,680
And I emphasize it's a framework
rather than a well developed model.

113
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,630
And the distinction for me rests on the
idea that this is just an initial sort

114
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:09,770
of draft of a workspace that will
absolutely evolve as we fill in with more

115
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:13,700
understanding and more knowledge.
And so for me,

116
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:18,410
the framework a really rests on a couple
of very basic assumptions that emotions

117
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:23,390
develop over time. They change over
time in a context sensitive fashion. Uh,

118
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,500
they may vary dramatically across
context and across people, but the,

119
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,740
as we see emotions play out
in ourselves and in others,

120
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,160
we can usefully draw attention to the
ways that we and others may try to change

121
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:39,050
that emotion trajectory.
And as you say,

122
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:43,700
I've tried to distinguish among five
families of regulatory processes ranging

123
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:46,970
from very early efforts to intervene,
to change the emotion.

124
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:51,590
It's playing out too much
later, uh, interventions.

125
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,400
And I think there's gonna be
lots of change in that space.

126
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,040
I think it's a very generous space.
Um,

127
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,030
they're really rests on these very basic
assumptions that I think there's every

128
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:04,800
reason to think well, have, um,

129
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,410
a utility as we move forward.
But there are loads of other questions.

130
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:13,700
I think that this kind of
model, um, requires that we ask,

131
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,140
for example,

132
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:20,120
we need to ask questions about how people
actually are trying to modify their

133
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:22,040
own emotions and others' emotions.

134
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,350
And we are only beginning to understand
how people go about regulating their

135
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:29,690
emotions, not just what they do, but,

136
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,440
but what their emotion
regulation goals are. And from a,

137
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,320
from a lay perspective,
you might think it's easy.

138
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,160
People try to turn down bad
emotions and turn up good emotions.

139
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,770
But what does that mean? It's
certainly not as simple as,
uh, always trying to, uh,

140
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,810
to do away with negative emotions once
it feel yucky or increase emotions that

141
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:53,690
feel good. There are many
instances, as you know,

142
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:57,780
very well from your work where we want
to turn down positive emotions and

143
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:59,790
perhaps turned up negative emotions.

144
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,950
So that's an example of the way that I
think this framework will need to grow as

145
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:09,510
people do more work on the processes
involved in emotion regulation.

146
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,441
Yeah.
Thank you.

147
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:14,850
And as you think of this sort of process
model or framework emerging and growing,

148
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,200
I do you see any certain
types of influential tools
or methodologies that are

149
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:21,360
going to be most critical
on these next steps?

150
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,600
No,
I think there's going to be a mix of um,

151
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,250
advances that are going to be
really important in this space. Um,

152
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,060
some of these are going to be theoretical
as we really try to better understand

153
00:09:34,061 --> 00:09:37,420
the larger context within which
people are regulating their emotions.

154
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:42,160
I've said that in my own work we focused
on trying to draw some distinctions

155
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:46,540
among processes that people use
to modify the emotion trajectory.

156
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,550
But I've said that we need to broaden
our view to understand not just what

157
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:54,220
people are trying to do but
why they're trying to do it.

158
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,230
And I think we can learn quite
a bit from other related, uh,

159
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,560
research efforts to understand motivated
behavior more generally and goal

160
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:07,150
directed behavior more generally
asking in this case as in other cases,

161
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,970
not just what people are doing
and why they're doing it,

162
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:14,050
but how this plays in with all of the
other many goals that we have as we move

163
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:18,550
through life. And so part of the, uh, I
think effort will need to be theoretical.

164
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,160
So conceptual advances in our thinking,
um,

165
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,690
borrowing as we can from other,
uh, theoretical traditions.

166
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,490
I think another important growth point
for us will be not just theoretical but

167
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:31,324
empirical.

168
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,890
And here we're at a working in a really
exciting time where there as you know,

169
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:39,190
very well or range of new tools,
uh,

170
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,490
more sophisticated approaches
to behavior analysis,

171
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,380
more sophisticated approaches to tracking
people's subjective experience as it

172
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:51,520
evolves over time, but also neuro
biological assessment tools,

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,190
functional imaging techniques as well as,
uh,

174
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,540
procedures for a better understanding,
uh,

175
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,340
people with various types of brain
damage and in healthy individuals,

176
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:03,610
uh,

177
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,610
better understanding the
role of particular brain
systems through inactivation

178
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:13,930
procedures. Uh, uh, such as tms,
transcranial magnetic stimulation.

179
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:15,670
So I think there's a range of tools,

180
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:20,410
both conceptual and empirical that will
be brought to bear to help us better

181
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:24,130
understand how people manage
their emotions as they unfold.

182
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,870
And I know in your more recent work,

183
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:29,270
you've driven it in a direction
that's really interesting,

184
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,690
sort of relating emotion regulation
to clinical health, health outcomes,

185
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,500
and in particular focusing on
social anxiety disorder. Um,

186
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,610
what have you found when you think about
and research social anxiety disorder?

187
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,060
How do you characterize the nature of
emotion regulation and the ways that may

188
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:45,080
be going awry?

189
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,180
June? Uh, you know,

190
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:52,181
one of the strategies that we and
others have used is to try to understand

191
00:11:52,701 --> 00:11:57,701
emotion processes by looking at
clinical contexts such as social anxiety

192
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:02,710
disorder. And, uh, one of the
surprises I think for us as,

193
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,603
um,

194
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,810
as been the case for other people who've
used effect of science approaches to

195
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:12,811
better understand clinical phenomena is
that everything isn't exactly as we had

196
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:15,470
expected it might be.
Um,

197
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,180
and I think that really is a testament
to the value of applying effect of

198
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:22,780
science measures. And, and
con, uh, conceptual, um, um,

199
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,550
sort of rubrics to these complex
clinical phenomena. For example,

200
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:32,410
just give you a quick example. Um,
in social anxiety disorder, uh,

201
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,710
people, uh, are often quite impaired,

202
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,830
unable to interact with others socially
unable to work as they'd like to,

203
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,990
uh, um, outside the home and, uh,

204
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:46,030
this can be really debilitating disorder.

205
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:51,030
And the core of the disorder in the
diagnostic and statistical manual is

206
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,200
heightened levels of anxiety.
And that led us to the, you know,

207
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:59,500
straightforward assumption that when
we carefully assessed people in the

208
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:01,450
laboratory using functional imaging,

209
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,900
that we'd be able to easily distinguish
between the emotional responses to have

210
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,010
people with social anxiety disorder on
the one hand and healthy matched controls

211
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:16,180
on the other in terms of the magnitude
of the emotional response in some of

212
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:20,320
these brain systems such as the Amygdala
insula that are thought to be important

213
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:25,000
to emotion generation. To our
surprise, what we're finding in these,

214
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:30,190
uh, laboratory contexts is that
when we build, uh, relevant,

215
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,160
um, socially rich, uh, stimuli,

216
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,910
and we show these to participants who
are either characterized as having social

217
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:43,630
anxiety or our match controls,
you don't have the disorder.

218
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,020
We see robust responses,

219
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:51,010
physiologic responses in both groups
that are often indistinguishable.

220
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,420
Now that's not to say that subjectively
people with social anxiety aren't

221
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:58,090
suffering and reporting
very high levels of anxiety.

222
00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:02,260
But when you look at some of the core
brain systems that are thought to subserve

223
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:06,960
emotional responding, we see
often no differences, uh,

224
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,720
in,
uh,

225
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,120
these brain systems
response in these contexts.

226
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,010
And this is in context after context.
Um,

227
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,340
and what that tells me is that our
conceptions of emotion reactivity as being

228
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:25,561
simply greater and social anxiety
across the board as compared to healthy

229
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:30,130
controls or too simple that there's
a response fractionation such that

230
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:31,180
subjectively,

231
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:35,350
in certainly there are parts of the
brain other than these core brain systems

232
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:39,970
that are thought to be important to
emotion generation that must reflect this

233
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:40,804
difference.

234
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,970
But the simple assumption that there's
obvious and gigantic reactivity

235
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:48,820
differences is too simple.
Misses the mark.

236
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,780
I think another surprise for us is related
to the notion that people with social

237
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:57,950
anxiety have much greater
reactivity is the idea that they uh,

238
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,950
cannot use appropriate
regulation strategies.

239
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,690
That the reason that they have greater
reactivity is that they simply can't use

240
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,120
a healthy strategies like reappraisal,

241
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,380
which involves thinking differently
about upsetting situations.

242
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,720
And what we found in our
laboratory studies is that
when appropriately cute and

243
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:22,721
instructed people with social anxiety
disorder are just about as good at using

244
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:27,821
reappraisal as healthy controls and that
now again as a bit of a surprise and

245
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:33,260
suggests that not that there's nothing
to learn here but that we've been focused

246
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:37,580
in the wrong place rather than assuming
greater reactivity rather than assuming

247
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,430
failures across the board.
In regulation,

248
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,380
what we think is happening is that
people are unable when not queued.

249
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,790
So in the real world they're unable to,
if they have social anxiety,

250
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,670
appropriately invoke skills
that they actually have.

251
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,190
And that then points I
think to a great mystery,

252
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:57,860
which is why aren't they
using the skills they have?

253
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,980
And that would be an example of the kind
of thing we're learning in this work.

254
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:05,390
Yeah. And when we think about this work,
you know, beyond social anxiety disorder,

255
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,080
it sounds like there's lessons we could
apply to a host of different disorders,

256
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,020
depression, bipolar disorder, et Cetera.

257
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,140
Do you feel like there's big picture
lessons to take away about emotion

258
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,730
regulation and psychopathology?

259
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,060
Absolutely. Chan. I think that um, the,

260
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:23,750
the work that we and others are doing
on specific disorders such as social

261
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:27,020
anxiety disorder, major depressive
disorder, bipolar disorder,

262
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:31,650
borderline personality disorder,
borderline personality disorder, um, uh,

263
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,270
all,

264
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,920
all of these research programs I think
are only partly about the specific

265
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:41,780
disorders. And I'm actually much more
interested in the general lessons,

266
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,200
which I think are,

267
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:48,201
are many that we really need to be careful
with our assumptions that a clinical

268
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:54,161
traditions and even diagnostic criteria
may not rich to be richly informative

269
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:59,351
about underlying mechanisms that when
we come to the table with an assumption

270
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,590
about greater reactivity, in one case,
diminish the reactivity. And another,

271
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:08,210
we need to be open to the possibility
that when we use multiple assessment

272
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:09,044
approaches,

273
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,560
we'll see fractionation so that
there'll be greater reactivity with some

274
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,640
measures and not with others.
Um,

275
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,820
I think on the regulation side we need
to be open to the possibility that the

276
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,520
simple starting point
of failed regulation,

277
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,010
they can't regulate needs to be unpacked.

278
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,220
And the reason that's so important
to draw these general lessons,

279
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:32,990
I think is that if we want
successful intervention strategies,

280
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,770
the more sophisticated we
can be about what's wrong,

281
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,040
the more likely we are to be able
to help people make it. Right.

282
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,240
Thank you. So it's been great
talking to you about, you know,

283
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:47,170
your thoughts on how we tease a part
emotion for emotion regulation. You know,

284
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:51,570
how we think about the future of emotion
and where it's headed and now linking

285
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,650
it to some clinical health outcomes.
And so all of that's been interesting.

286
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:59,220
And when you think now sort of more
broadly about the future of emotion,

287
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,740
where do you see the,
the sort of field headed?

288
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:08,220
I think that the larger fields we've
talked in this conversation about the many

289
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:13,080
exciting growth points as I see
them for emotion regulation.

290
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,380
Think as I've said,
there's room for theoretical advance here,

291
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,330
this room for empirical advances,

292
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,340
applications to clinical contexts
and uh, many other exciting, uh,

293
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:28,290
I think avenues for inquiry even in the
narrower domain of emotion regulation

294
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,350
and some of our work,
for example, we're, uh,

295
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,910
extending and this is where they run
help run in Israel looking at intractable

296
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:40,500
conflict and how emotion regulation
perspectives might actually make a

297
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:43,680
difference in these longstanding
intractable conflict.

298
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,620
So I think even moving beyond individual
level psychopathology and distressed

299
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:53,560
and much larger societal ills,
whether in intractable conflicts, uh,

300
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,860
or in the classroom,
uh,

301
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,060
I think there's lots of exciting work
to be done even in the narrower area of

302
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:01,530
emotion regulation.

303
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:05,820
I think if we broadened our view and
think very generally about the field of

304
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:08,730
emotion and even more
broadly to effect of science,

305
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,350
there's an incredible amount of exciting
opportunities for researchers and

306
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:15,180
students coming into the field today.

307
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:20,520
I think at play are basic questions
about how to conceptualize emotions,

308
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,840
whether they're things in the world that
were just describing or whether there

309
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:30,450
are things that are psychologically
constructed, um, uh, and therefore,

310
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,640
uh, you know, uh, amenable
to various interventions. Um,

311
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,970
I think we need to relate emotions however
there conceptualized to other effect

312
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:43,950
of processes like moods, all of this is
basic work that still needs to be done.

313
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,800
Um,
I think because we have new tools,

314
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,670
conceptual and empirical tools,
we're going to be,

315
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:55,080
I think a learning, an immense
amount about how emotions play out,

316
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,590
not just in the laboratory but in
the real world where they matter,

317
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,720
how they play out in social contexts,

318
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:04,050
how they play out over the course
of development. And I think there's,

319
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,860
in each of these subareas of psychology,
whatever one's starting point,

320
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,550
a very rich set of questions about the
nature of emotion and other affected

321
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,500
processes.

322
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,180
My particular focus of course is how they
can be modified and changed over time.

323
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:22,950
But I think that's just a tiny fraction
of the exciting sort of opportunities in

324
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:24,990
this larger space of effect of science.

325
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,730
So if you are talking to students,
you mentioned students, you know,

326
00:20:28,731 --> 00:20:31,130
and sort of the future they
are going to be building in,

327
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:33,470
in learning about emotion
and emotion regulation,

328
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,250
what kind of advice would you have to
these students or people in general who

329
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:40,100
want to learn more about emotion,
where, where should they go?

330
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,950
Yeah, so I'm a, as you can hear,

331
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:47,410
very bullish about the future of
effect of science. I think if I were,

332
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,090
I'm happy to be in the field and if I
were advising students, I would say, Hey,

333
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:54,340
this great opportunity here.
Um,

334
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,600
they're just a very large
number of problems, uh, to,

335
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,480
to tackle that matter.
Um,

336
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,770
and I would recommend that they take a
good look at the field and the ways that

337
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,610
whatever their starting point,
they can link affected processes to their,

338
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,140
to their own interests.
Again,

339
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:15,670
whether it's developmental or clinical
or from a health psychology perspective,

340
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:19,780
lifespan, developmental, uh,
biological, cognitive, any of the,

341
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,300
uh, areas, uh, of the field, however
you define them, I think, uh,

342
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,980
are richly connected to these effective
processes. So I would say this is,

343
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:33,160
this is where a lot of actions going to
be happening over the next decade or two

344
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:33,994
in longer.

345
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:39,070
I would say please take a good
look at the field in terms of, uh,

346
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,630
how to get started.

347
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:44,530
I think the series that you're
building is a really exciting tool.

348
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:48,790
I think they're increasing opportunities
for students at different universities

349
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:52,530
in different contexts. Um, as I
tell my students, I, you know,

350
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,160
when I teach psychology one,

351
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,400
if they want to jump in and really
see what psychological science in this

352
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:02,290
spaces,
like they should join a research lab,

353
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:06,490
whether it's for a summer or whether it's
for a longer period of time to really

354
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,310
get involved in the sciences being done.

355
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,340
I think that's the way to really get a
feel beyond reading papers and end up in

356
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,300
books,
which is an obvious starting point.

357
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,650
Well, it sounds like it's an exciting
time for the future of emotion.

358
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,300
So I just want to thank you,
James for speaking with us today.

359
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,960
It's been a real pleasure.
My pleasure, Jane.

360
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,650
Thank you so much for the opportunity.
Yeah.

361
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:33,540
So this concludes our expert in emotion
interview with Dr. James Gross from

362
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:34,680
Stanford University.
