1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,480
So today we'll discuss what meditation
is and how exactly it relates to

2
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:07,500
emotional wellbeing.
Indeed,

3
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:11,670
we've seen a surge of interest in this
concept of mindfulness and meditation in

4
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:12,600
recent years.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,250
We see articles here in the New York
Times talking about how meditation may

6
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,720
actually change the brain.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,940
We also see articles here is
suggesting and the Huffington Post,

8
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:28,941
that you can unlock the
power of meditation to feel
happier and more at ease or,

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,350
and the La Times. This is your mind
on meditation, that if you meditate,

10
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:38,430
you'll engage in less mind wandering and
do get engaged in more doing or living

11
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:39,264
your life.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,230
So it's not surprising that mindfulness
and meditation more generally has gained

13
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:48,060
this exploding momentum and be when
widely advertised in the media and popular

14
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:49,980
press even more so.

15
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:53,280
There's a sense in which people feel that
we ought to be teaching mindfulness in

16
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:54,330
this digital age,

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,070
that this is an antidote to help solve
our current conundrum of being. So my,

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,440
you know, so engaged, uh, in
mind wandering, so distracted,

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,050
not focused in the present moment
that we need to teach mindfulness,

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,650
that it's not only an option, but it's
actually something that's a dire need.

21
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,350
So with all this hype about mindfulness,

22
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,710
both in the scientific realm
and in the popular media rum,

23
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,950
we have to ask ourself what is mindfulness
and how exactly does it relate to our

24
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:23,100
emotional health?

25
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,970
So today what we're going to be thinking
about is what is mindfulness and what

26
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:31,020
does it mean to actually meditate?

27
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,730
And also how can we exactly be
mindful of our own emotions?

28
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,310
And if we're mindful of our own emotions,

29
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:41,550
in what way might this actually
change our emotional health?

30
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,980
So when we think about this,
the Buddha thought and deed that we,

31
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:51,930
mindfulness indeed does promote and, uh,
not only promote emotional understanding,

32
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:56,130
but promote increased health.
So he would say to enjoy good health,

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,770
to bring true happiness to one's family,

34
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,130
to bring peace to all one must first
discipline and control one's own mind

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,510
through these sort of contemplated
practices like meditation and mindfulness.

36
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,150
So today we're going to start our second
series on emotional health by delving

37
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:18,690
into the realm of mindfulness
and asking ourselves,

38
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:22,500
can we really accept our
emotions in the present moment?

39
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,040
We're going to do so by first,
um,

40
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,070
approaching the idea of mindfulness
and trying to understand, well,

41
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:31,170
what is mindfulness in the first place?

42
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,970
And once we get an operational definition
of mindfulness or review some key

43
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:39,930
empirical findings that have associated
mindfulness with emotional wellbeing,

44
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,380
then we'll conclude with our takeaway
questions and expert interview.

45
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,460
So first let's ask ourselves, you may
have heard of mindfulness in the news.

46
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:50,820
You may have heard friends or
colleagues talk about mindfulness,

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,170
but what exactly is it?
So when we think of mindfulness,

48
00:02:55,171 --> 00:03:00,130
it's a form of really cognitive training
aimed at learning how and where we

49
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:01,420
guide one's attention.

50
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,040
So this involves maintaining awareness
of attention from one moment to the next

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,930
and gently but firmly escorting it back
to the initial target object when the

52
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,490
mind becomes distracted.

53
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:17,260
So the point of mindfulness meditation
is really to train the mind in a way to

54
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:20,920
make it stronger, to get the
muscles you know, bigger and better.

55
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:25,660
And faster to be more stable and let
it disengage from our typical more

56
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,140
automatic thought processes.
As you can see here,

57
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:33,130
these are what I think of as four
core components in most discussions of

58
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:33,964
mindfulness.

59
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,300
So we can think of these as the four
critical ingredients of mindfulness.

60
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:42,010
So it includes awareness, sustained
attention, focus on the present moment,

61
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,780
and nonjudgmental acceptance.

62
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,440
So let me walk you through these four
elements of mindfulness right now,

63
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,110
just defining them briefly
and discussing them in turn.

64
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,080
So I'll start with the first
component of awareness.

65
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,150
So what is awareness and a
mindfulness oriented approach?

66
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,590
So awareness has really defined as the
conscious knowledge of one's experience.

67
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,630
It includes conscious knowledge of one's
body sensations such as breathing, once,

68
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:11,320
thoughts and emotions,
and external events and sounds.

69
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,910
What about sustained attention?
What does it mean?

70
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:20,110
As the Buddhist said to really discipline
one's mind to really gain sort of

71
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:23,830
control over your attention
and observe where it takes you,

72
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:28,000
sustaining it in the present moment.
So by sustained attention,

73
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,870
this is really focusing on
placing one's attention on,

74
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,680
on an ongoing stream of
internal and external stimuli.

75
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,700
So it involves bringing attention
to the target of observation.

76
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,470
And when we get distracted,

77
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,940
having your attention gently brought
back to the original targeted focus.

78
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,210
So often the attention will
be focused on one's breathing.

79
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,220
So bringing one's breath to your
attention. And when you get distracted,

80
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:57,840
your mind wanders to other thoughts
about what you want to have for lunch and

81
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:00,460
what you're worried about tomorrow
and what's coming up next week.

82
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,400
Gently bringing back your
attention to your breath.

83
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,080
The third component is this sort
of focus on the present moment.

84
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,210
And by that what we're talking about
is directing one's attention with or

85
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:18,211
without effort to internal and external
phenomena at each moment of awareness.

86
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,910
So this is a distinct concept
from being preoccupied,

87
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,690
from fantasizing,
and also from ruminating.

88
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,990
So here you're literally just focusing
your attention on whatever is occurring

89
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,790
in the present moment.
It may be internal,

90
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,420
your thoughts and maybe something external
and the environment and you're just

91
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,490
letting that happen in the present moment.

92
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:43,900
Just noticing and observing each moment
in the present and being fully aware of

93
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:44,734
it.

94
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,740
So the final and fourth component often
discuss in definitions of mindfulness is

95
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:54,490
nonjudgmental acceptance.
So by nonjudgmental acceptance,

96
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:59,240
what this is focusing on is really
experiencing the thoughts, sensations,

97
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:02,330
and events as they are at the moment.

98
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:06,530
They enter one's consciousness without
judging them as either good or bad,

99
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,050
or as desirable or undesirable.

100
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,310
And really what you're doing here
is you're allowing all experiences,

101
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:18,260
whether good or bad, to arise without
trying to change control or of white.

102
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,000
Then this applies both to concrete
experiences such as sensory pain,

103
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:28,190
as well as abstract things such as
having thoughts or feelings of rejection.

104
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,990
So acceptance really allows individuals
to appreciate the experience,

105
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,410
even if it includes things
like negative valuations.

106
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,060
Thoughts such as I'm a failure.

107
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,230
And what it suggests is that you can
simply embrace these thoughts without

108
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:44,840
trying to suppress them,
distort them,

109
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,660
or sort of escape from
them through fantasy.

110
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,320
So you're simply accepting whatever
thoughts and feelings arise with a

111
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:53,210
nonjudgmental stance towards them.

112
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,290
So what I'd like to do now is to think
about these four elements and to really

113
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:03,680
highlight the point that all of these
four elements are required and important

114
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:08,540
in order to achieve a full moment of
mindfulness. So I think of it this way,

115
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,390
um, if we have mindfulness in the center,
in order to have it, we need awareness,

116
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:17,120
sustained attention,
nonjudgmental acceptance,

117
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:20,750
and the focus on the present moment that
it's all these four elements that need

118
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:25,751
to come together to have this full circle
and embrace and sort of give rise to

119
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,680
an experience of mindfulness.
Now,

120
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,610
interestingly,

121
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,450
recent models that have been proposed
and work by myself and some of my

122
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:39,530
colleagues here at Yale have really tried
to think about what is the mechanism

123
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:44,030
or process that underlies mindfulness?
What is it doing for our emotional life?

124
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,300
Does it d automatize our emotional life?

125
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:52,340
So we know that much of our mental life
is largely automatic. It's Ha habitual,

126
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,710
right? It's literally spontaneous, quick,

127
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,220
and even happening before you would
realize it in your own conscious and

128
00:07:58,221 --> 00:07:59,180
awareness of times.

129
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,740
And the process that my colleagues
and I have argued here is that what

130
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:07,520
mindfulness does is it helps sort
of break us of our habitual modes of

131
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:11,330
responding and really focus on
d automatizing emotional life,

132
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:15,260
making one more aware of our attentional
processes and thoughts so that we can

133
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,380
notice and even change them to ultimately,
you know,

134
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:20,210
promote enhanced emotional wellbeing.

135
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,380
So what you see here in this figure is
that mindfulness promotes these four

136
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:27,890
components we talked about earlier.
Awareness, attention, present moment,

137
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:29,780
focus and nonjudgmental acceptance.

138
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,100
And that each of these four critical
components of mindfulness gives rise to

139
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:38,780
what we think of as d automatizing
processes. So wearness promotes, um,

140
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,740
you know, a discontinuation of
automatic inference processing.

141
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,710
This is from literature looking
at priming and stereotyping.

142
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,480
Increased and sustained attention enables
us to enhance our cognitive control

143
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:51,840
over our emotions,
both at,

144
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:54,950
at the attentional control level
and gives us cognitive flexibility.

145
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,390
Being focused on the present
moment helps facilitate metta.

146
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,270
Metacognitive insight helps us engage
in decentering and sort of less or non

147
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:05,430
elaborative processing.
And finally,

148
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:09,000
nonjudgmental acceptance prevents us from
engaging in things that would take us

149
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:13,470
away from the actual emotion we're
having, right? It, it actually makes us,

150
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17,220
enforces us to be exposed to
the emotions in their raw form,

151
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,600
preventing us from suppressing
the emotions, distorting them,

152
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,160
and even escaping from them.

153
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,860
All of these d automatizing
features ultimately produce,

154
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,590
promote adaptive self regulation leading
to desirable individual and societal

155
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:34,590
health outcomes.
Now we've talked a lot about mindfulness,

156
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:36,570
but really what does it actually like?

157
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,890
So let me briefly guide you
through a meditation exercise,

158
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:44,550
just walking through some of the common
steps that you would see often occurring

159
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:47,930
in these exercises with a
focus on the breath. So, uh,

160
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,800
I'll have you follow these instructions.

161
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,380
So first I'd like you to take a moment
to adjust your position in front of your

162
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,420
laptop computer student probably,

163
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,200
and gently close your eyes
and settle into your body.

164
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,450
Okay.

165
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,890
If you're sitting in sure that your
body is upright and comfortable for you,

166
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,220
okay.

167
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,960
Now in your own way,

168
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,670
take a few moments and try
to simply relax your body.

169
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,363
Okay.

170
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,050
Once you've done that, perhaps you'll
feel the muscles in your body softening,

171
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,890
maybe even loosening,
relaxing and releasing.

172
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,473
Okay?

173
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,780
Just simply letting go

174
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,630
and perhaps even taking a deeper breath.

175
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,660
Taking a couple deep breaths.

176
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,690
As you breathe out,

177
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,200
notice that natural feeling of relaxing
and releasing a little more with each

178
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,430
out breath.

179
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,790
Remember to just simply let,
go.

180
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,530
Try to pay attention
to any sounds you hear.

181
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,860
Just listening with a gentle curiosity,

182
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,930
letting the sounds come and go,
not needing to judge them,

183
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,933
okay?

184
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,030
As you bring awareness to your breath,

185
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,440
notice what sensations there are as
you breathe in and as you breathe out,

186
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,140
feel the air,
touch your nostrils.

187
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,590
Feel the slight movement
of your chest and stomach.

188
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,580
If you notice your attention wandering
or becoming distracted, you're not alone.

189
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,810
We all do this,

190
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,830
but you can simply bring your
attention back to your breath.

191
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:03,970
Okay?

192
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,830
Being aware of this breath, being
aware of what it is to be breathing in,

193
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,370
being aware of what it
is to be breathing out.

194
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,910
So that was a very brief introduction to
the kinds of exercises one would do in

195
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:25,870
a guided meditation exercise. Um, it
would be done for a much longer period.

196
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,810
But just to give you the sense
that you're picking a sensation,

197
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:32,110
often the breath and focusing
on it in the present moment,

198
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,710
in a nonjudgmental attitude,
simply focusing on it.

199
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,040
And if your mind wanders or gets
distracted, which it does for all of us,

200
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,880
simply noticing it, observing
it, and bringing your
attention back to the breath.

201
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,170
Now if you're interested in doing more
of these kinds of exercises, UCLA,

202
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:50,020
the mindfulness awareness
research center has some fat,

203
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,350
fantastic free meditation. PODCASTS
is one place to get started. Um,

204
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,730
you can see here they have
different exercises focused on, um,

205
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,390
but the breathing meditation
similar to what we did today, um,

206
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,240
as well as meditation,
focus on different kinds of,

207
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,650
of things such as working with
difficulties, loving kindness, um,

208
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:13,060
and breath sound and body. So we've talked
about the definition of mindfulness.

209
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,290
We've talked about potential mechanisms
underlying it such as d automatizing our

210
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,124
emotional life,

211
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:23,460
and briefly sort of got a glimpse into
what some of these exercises might look

212
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:24,334
like.

213
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,450
So now I want to turn to some of the
scientific and empirical evidence on how

214
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:32,590
mindfulness may be associated
with enhanced emotional wellbeing.

215
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,320
So first we've seen studies that have
shown that mindfulness meditation actually

216
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:43,040
is associated with decreased
emotional reactivity.

217
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,210
So this was a study done by Judson brewer
and colleagues comparing mindfulness

218
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:50,540
therapy to traditional
cognitive behavioral therapies.

219
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,990
And what they found here is we're
looking at self reported emotion.

220
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,600
Our mindfulness therapy group is in black.

221
00:13:56,601 --> 00:14:00,350
And what you're seeing is that as a
function of engaging in this type of

222
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,630
mindfulness spaced, um,
treatment, individuals are
reporting reductions in anxiety,

223
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,630
sadness, anger, and fear.

224
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,460
So we're showing that indeed mindful
meditation seems to decrease the motion

225
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,560
activity,
especially for negative emotions.

226
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,490
Okay.

227
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,540
There's also been really an explosion of
work that was originally spearheaded by

228
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:26,370
Richie Davidson at Wisconsin and now
other colleagues such as heady Cobar and

229
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:30,720
others, looking at how mindfulness
meditation may actually change your brain.

230
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:35,520
So one of the original studies done in
2003 included an eight week randomized

231
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:38,970
controlled study in mindfulness meditation
as compared to a weightless control

232
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:41,550
group. These are all healthy
adults. At the outset.

233
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,030
And what they found is that those who are
assigned to the mindfulness meditation

234
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:48,240
group showed actual changes
in their brain activity.

235
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,150
So we saw increases and left hemispheric.

236
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,340
And as you may remember from our earlier
lectures on the emotion and brain,

237
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,120
when we see sort of lateralization with
relatively great activity in the left

238
00:14:59,121 --> 00:14:59,954
hemisphere,

239
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,890
this has been associated with the
subjective experience of positive mood and

240
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:04,724
emotion.

241
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,930
There's been more recent studies also
looking at potential neuromechanisms

242
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,970
underlying mindfulness training,

243
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:17,810
showing that it alters the neural
expression of sadness. So here,

244
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:22,811
authors used in Fmri study to compare
neuro reactivity to a laboratory

245
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:27,080
provocations of sadness and those
who either underwent eight weeks of

246
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:29,750
mindfulness training or
waitlisted control group.

247
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,870
And what they found is that those who
are in the mindfulness training group

248
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,220
exhibited greater what they
called visceral and Somata
sensory activation in the

249
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:38,420
brain during sadness.

250
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,830
And that this pattern of neural
reactivity was associated with decreased

251
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:46,040
depression severity scores.
So what this suggests,

252
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:50,780
they argue is that mindfulness may
help sort of balance, um, this,

253
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:55,400
this intricate balance between emotions
and sensory networks and may actually

254
00:15:55,401 --> 00:16:00,401
support a fuller portrait of both the
conceptual and body-based representations

255
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:02,630
of emotion.
And by doing so,

256
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:06,110
this may help actually reduce
vulnerability to depression.

257
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,950
We also see if we think
of clinical applications,

258
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:13,370
there's been many now studies looking
at clinical applications of mindfulness

259
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:17,780
meditation across a host of Dsm disorders
ranging from anxiety disorders to

260
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:21,120
depression to even bipolar disorder.
But one of the studies that,

261
00:16:21,121 --> 00:16:24,500
that I'm highlighting today is
looking at substance use and abuse.

262
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,920
So here there's been studies looking
at mindfulness meditation as a way to

263
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,590
actually curb cigarette craving and use.

264
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,770
So what you see here is if you
compare mindfulness training, um,

265
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,530
what you find is that it actually is
associated with Gregor smoking abstinence.

266
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,400
Um, so it's really fascinating when you
look at this work again done by Judson

267
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:47,360
brewer here at Yale University. And
additional work has filed this up by Heti,

268
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:48,620
Cobra and colleagues as well.

269
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:53,270
Looking at how meditation actually is
associated reductions and craving for a

270
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:56,780
whole host of substances
outside of simply cigarette use.

271
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:59,390
So what we're seeing is that
it helps curb addictions,

272
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,080
helps us retain control over some of
these impulses we have towards using

273
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:05,810
substances that may
ultimately be harmful for us.

274
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,670
So here's an example of one study that
Heady Cobra was an author on showing that

275
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:15,230
mindful attention reduces neural and
self reported cue induced craving and

276
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:16,580
smokers.
So again,

277
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:19,670
this is further suggesting that we're
not only seeing reduction than self

278
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:24,050
reported craving to different types
of substances such as cigarettes,

279
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,770
but we're also seeing parallel and
robust patterns when we look at neural

280
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:31,910
patterns of activation and response to
cues that would normally elicit craving

281
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,100
in smokers such as cues of a cigarette.

282
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:40,250
Now if you look at this here, um, for
those of you that like to watch ted talks,

283
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,440
um, I highly recommend this Ted talk on
the habits of happiness. Um, this, this,

284
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,161
this man is,

285
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:50,160
is a Buddhist monk at author and
photographer and has often been called the

286
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:54,360
happiest man in the world. He has a
really interesting quote where he says,

287
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:59,140
mine training is based on the idea
that two opposite mental factors cannot

288
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,430
happen at the same time.
You could go from love to hate,

289
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,610
but you cannot at the same time towards
the same object or the same person want

290
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,360
to harm and wants to do good.

291
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,810
So this is one of the most popular talks
you can find on the Ted talks and I

292
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:16,020
highly recommend watching it if you're
interested in learning more about some of

293
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:18,300
these core principles
underlying mindfulness.

294
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,560
I'm from a very scholarly Buddhist monk,
author as well as photographer.

295
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,050
Yeah,

296
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,660
so we've talked a little bit
about mindfulness, what it is,

297
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:27,770
what are the mechanisms?

298
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,640
We've sort of scratched the surface of
some of the key empirical findings that

299
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:36,290
have associated mindfulness with reduced
emotional or activity changes in neural

300
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:41,270
reactivity and even changes in craving
for substances as well as knowing that

301
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:44,960
it's associated with reductions in
symptoms severity such as depression,

302
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:49,340
vulnerability. What I now want to do is
turn to our takeaway questions for today.

303
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,240
The first question asks,

304
00:18:54,241 --> 00:18:58,590
how would you define mindfulness and
what are the four critical ingredients?

305
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,910
Second,

306
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,750
what does the support of evidence that
suggests that mindfulness can actually

307
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:07,920
alter patterns of self
reported emotional reactivity.

308
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,211
And third,

309
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:12,660
what is the supportive evidence that
suggests mindfulness can also alter

310
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:17,490
patterns of neural activity that are
commonly associated with emotionality as

311
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:19,950
well as cognitive control
over our emotions.

312
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,510
So now we'll turn to our experts
in emotion interview series.

313
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,290
Okay,

314
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,940
today we'll be speaking with doctor
heady Cobar on craving and mindfulness,

315
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,300
Dr Cobras and assistant professor in
the Department of Psychiatry at the Yale

316
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:36,610
University School of Medicine,

317
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,240
as well as the director of the clinical
and affective neuroscience lab and

318
00:19:40,241 --> 00:19:43,420
director of research at the Yale
therapeutic neuroscience clinic.

319
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,900
Doctor Cobras interest are focused on
using a multilevel approach to understand

320
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:51,910
the use of cognitive
strategies to regulate emotion.

321
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,840
She's used both behavioral and neuro
imaging tools to better understand the

322
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:59,980
psychological and biological mechanisms
that underlie processes related to

323
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,540
emotion craving,

324
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,770
the cog cognitive regulation of emotion
and craving in both healthy adult as

325
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:10,000
well as psychiatric populations.
Dr Cobra has received several honors,

326
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:13,750
including the National Institute of Drug
Abuse, women and Gender Travel Award,

327
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,590
the National Institute of Drug Abuse,
early career investigator travel award,

328
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,670
and the Yale Center for Clinical
Investigation Scholar Award.

329
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,640
Her work has also been
mentioned in the popular media,

330
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:28,810
including outlets such as
CNN, ABC News, La Times,

331
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,670
and US news and world report.

332
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,690
So I now turn to our experts and emotion
interview with doctor heady. Cohbar.
