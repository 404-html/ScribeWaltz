1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,210
So welcome back to human emotion.
Um,

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,250
today we're gonna continue our
discussion about this, Nate,

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,250
the nature of these emotions that
are so intimately part of ourselves.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,160
So this is the family of
self conscious emotions.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,970
And we're going to wrap up our discussion
about this family of self conscious

6
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:21,420
emotions by focusing
today on guilt and shame.

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,900
So some of our most perhaps
socially painful emotions.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,740
We're going to explore why we have them
in the first place and what sort of

9
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:31,500
social good they actually serve for us.

10
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,900
So we've talked about four different
self conscious emotions so far,

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,260
pride, embarrassment, and we've
touched on shame and guilt.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,150
But today what we're going to do is really
delve deeper into the nature of shame

13
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:49,410
and guilt, which we know are in this
broad family of self conscious emotions.

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,140
People have also called
them moral emotions.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,620
And what seems to be unique about
shame and guilt is that they're also

16
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:58,020
associated with some sort of wrongdoing.

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,380
So what is it that makes shame and guilt
what they are that makes them unique

18
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,800
and that makes them part of this
family of self conscious emotions.

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,520
So one of the things about shame and guilt
is that they are largely and uniquely

20
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:16,290
human emotions,
right?

21
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,270
They are also something that are not,
that they don't emerge at birth.

22
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:25,380
We don't have them from a very young age,
but they seem to sort of take on,

23
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,300
you know, a very powerful role in our
life a bit later in our development.

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,780
Um, and importantly, um,

25
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:38,781
I've talked about them as being referred
all also as moral emotions in so far as

26
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:41,520
even though there are
associated with wrongdoing,

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,670
they also serve this function that's
really focused on helping us, you know,

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,700
to reign in or inhibit some
of our more aggressive,

29
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,660
harmful and perhaps socially
undesirable behaviors.

30
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,580
So they serve this function to help
us reign in some of our more uh,

31
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,550
undesirable behavioral tendencies.

32
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,660
Now what's interesting too,

33
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:10,470
I think about shame and guilt is
that you've heard these words before.

34
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:15,471
We've all heard them and in fact we use
them in lay conversation all the time.

35
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,960
However we use them interchangeably,
right?

36
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:23,760
We sort of refer to feeling ashamed
or guilty as one in the same thing.

37
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,490
And not only do sort of our everyday
friends, colleagues, you know,

38
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,390
partners use these words interchangeably,

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,800
but it seems that even psychologists who
work with their clients in a clinical

40
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:39,660
context seem to use some of these words
there as well. So we see, for example,

41
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:39,991
here,

42
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:44,370
this is the Dsm or the diagnostic and
statistical manual of mental disorders.

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,500
We also see here if you peek into the
Dsm here and this is the criteria for

44
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,000
major depressive disorder,

45
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,160
that what we see here is one of the core
associated symptoms or features that I

46
00:02:56,161 --> 00:03:00,310
highlighted in blue here.
Our feelings of worthlessness or guilt.

47
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,020
So not only is this something that we
all know intimately in our lives that we

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,150
use common,
the conversation,

49
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,920
but it's even part of the very criteria
that psychologists and psychiatrists use

50
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,430
to, um, sort of dispense
diagnoses, you know,

51
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:19,120
to sort of determine whether or not
someone meets criteria for something as

52
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:21,610
severe and chronic as depression.

53
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,870
So guilt and shame play a
pretty big role in our life.

54
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,080
And yet in some ways we have a hard
time distinguishing which is which.

55
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,500
So when is it shame and when
is someone feeling guilty?

56
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,770
So I want to show you an example from a
recent sort of pop culture reference and

57
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:42,400
have you decide.

58
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,170
So what I'm going to do is show you a
video of tiger woods where he sort of

59
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:51,280
broadcast his apology to the
world for all of his infidelities.

60
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:53,290
You know that he committed
against his wife.

61
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:58,270
And I want you to watch closely and decide
for yourself whether or not you think

62
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,330
what he's experiencing is shame,
guilt,

63
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,880
or perhaps both.

64
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,120
So take a moment to watch
this and see what you think

65
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,000
every one of you has good
reason to be critical of me.

66
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,490
I want to say to each of
you simply and directly,

67
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,550
I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible
and selfish behavior I engaged in.

68
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:37,510
I know people want to find out how I
could be so selfish and so foolish.

69
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,420
People want to know how I could have
done these things to my wife feeling

70
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,520
and to my children.

71
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,760
And while I have always
tried to be a private person,

72
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,940
there are some things I want to say.

73
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,770
Elan and I have started the process
of discussing the damage caused by my

74
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,590
behavior.
As Ellen pointed out to me,

75
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,930
my real apology to her will
not come in the form of words.

76
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,950
It will come from my behavior over time.

77
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,300
We have a lot to discuss and a,
however,

78
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,640
what we say to each other will
remain between the two of us.

79
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,790
I am also aware of the pain
my behavior has caused.

80
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:37,500
For those of you in this room,
I have let you down.

81
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,590
I let down my fans

82
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,940
socio watch this video. What do you
think? Is this shame or is the skills,

83
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,800
and I want you to keep this question in
your mind as we now go into the rest of

84
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,620
our lecture today and
define what is shame,

85
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,160
what is guilt and in what ways do they
overlap and show similarity and in what

86
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,730
ways are they fundamentally
different emotions all together.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,440
And then we'll return at the end
to our beloved. Um, you know,

88
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:14,300
celebrity tiger woods and ask whether
or not he felt shame or guilt.

89
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,290
So we're going to start today
by first talking about guilt.

90
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,370
This will be followed by shame and then
we'll compare and contrast guilt and

91
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:26,820
shame followed by our takeaway
questions and expert interview.

92
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,480
So let's start with guilt.
What is it really?

93
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,350
So I want you to now think about again,

94
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:36,630
your own experience or
a time in your life.

95
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,470
You remember feeling
really guilty to again,

96
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:44,370
take out a pen and piece of paper and
I want you to write down what was the

97
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,890
circumstance that led you to feel guilty.

98
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,780
I also want you to write down what
thoughts were going through your mind when

99
00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:56,520
you were feeling guilty. What were you
thinking about? Was it about yourself,

100
00:06:56,521 --> 00:07:00,360
about the behavior, about other people's
perceptions? What were you thinking?

101
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,620
And then finally,

102
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,420
what do you think the social outcome or
purpose of feeling guilty was in that

103
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:07,290
circumstance?

104
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Did it motivate you to do any particular
behavior or to engage with other people

105
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:17,550
in one way or another? So pause the
video, take a few moments to do this.

106
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,330
And then when you return, we'll go
through what researchers have described,

107
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:26,160
some of the core features of what makes
guilt feel so bad and what makes people

108
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:29,430
feel so guilty.
And really what good does it serve?

109
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,810
So we touched on the characteristics of
guilt in our last couple of lectures.

110
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,910
And just as a sort of recap,

111
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:44,270
guilt is really triggered by you having
this negative evaluation about yourself.

112
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,250
So you're thinking something
I'm really sort of, um,

113
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,520
powerful about, I'm sorry Nigga
value valuation of your action.

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,320
So this is about some behavior that you
performed and you feel bad about it.

115
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:00,990
So you might say like,
I can't believe I stole that thing.

116
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,400
So you reflect on a behavior you did
and you evaluate it in a negative light.

117
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,470
This leads you to have negative emotions
towards the target and to have some

118
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:13,380
sort of, um, mobilization or,

119
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,080
or readiness to address the problem,
right?

120
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:20,280
Caused by your behavior that you
negatively evaluate. So as a consequence,

121
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:24,600
you feel motivated to address the problem.
Maybe it's returning the stolen item,

122
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:25,434
for example.

123
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,913
Okay,

124
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,130
now let's talk again about shame then.
So again,

125
00:08:32,131 --> 00:08:34,890
what I want you to do, and I think
this is really important to do this,

126
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:38,880
to engage in these exercises because
what I'm going to have you do is once you

127
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:42,030
sort of compare,
write down your own guilt experience,

128
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:44,700
and now engage in your own
thought exercise about shame.

129
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,480
What I want you to do later is you're
going to put them side by side and compare

130
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:51,060
them.
So please pause for a moment.

131
00:08:51,061 --> 00:08:54,660
Take out a piece of paper and think
about a separate time in your life,

132
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,320
not the same as what you thought
about earlier with respect to guilt.

133
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,650
Think about a tiny felt very ashamed.
Now again,

134
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:05,100
I want you to think about describing the
circumstance that led you to feel this

135
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:05,880
way.

136
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,110
What were the thoughts going through your
mind and what were some of the social

137
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,500
purposes or outcomes as a
result of feeling this way?

138
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,950
What were you inclined to do?
How did you behave around others?

139
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,850
Did you engage with others or did you
sort of retreat into your own space?

140
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,420
So please take a moment to do this cause
I assure you that this will be really

141
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:28,440
important when you take your own
personal life experiences. Um,

142
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,210
as a way to really understand the
complex nature of these negative socially

143
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:37,110
painful self conscious emotions.
So once you've done that,

144
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,320
you can hit play and we'll go back
through some of the features of shame.

145
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,110
So again,
as a reminder,

146
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,430
some of the characteristics of shame
that we talked about earlier are that

147
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:50,940
involves a negative evaluation
of yourself as a whole.

148
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,280
So it's in contrast with guilt,

149
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:58,050
which was about a very local specific
behavior here with shame as a whole.

150
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:02,970
You're seeing yourself in this negative
light. So instead of I stole that object,

151
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,350
it's,
I'm a thief.

152
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,270
And the behavior that you typically show
here again is to sort of have a sense

153
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:12,690
of smallness and sort of
inconspicuousness around others.

154
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:16,830
So hunched over posture, try to
retreat or high premier social groups.

155
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:21,060
So really your behavior's really mobilized
towards hiding and being undetected

156
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:23,370
by others.
And as a consequence,

157
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:26,400
you're very unlikely to
take a corrective action.

158
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,380
You're just wanting to
retreat in the whole,

159
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,090
feel bad about yourself as a whole and
not necessarily do anything to remedy the

160
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:37,170
situation as you would in the
case of guilt, for example. Um,

161
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,370
something interesting about shame is
that we see some really fascinating cross

162
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:44,820
cultural differences. So here
what we're, if you're look here,

163
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:47,490
this is contrasting individualistic
cultures on the left.

164
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:50,970
So you can think of the United
States is a prime example with more

165
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:54,270
collectivistic cultures.
Um, uh, on the right here.

166
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:59,271
So individuals that cultures are really
sort of emphasizing the sense of me or I

167
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,120
and collectivistic cultures are
more about your inner dependence and

168
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,810
connectedness to others.
So it's more about this sense of us.

169
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,310
Now on the left, we know the
individuals to cultures. Um, you know,

170
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:15,570
one self identity is really separate
from other people and that you sort of

171
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:20,280
follow your own individualized
or personalized standards
of norms for what are

172
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:23,580
sort of socially acceptable
behaviors or behaviors that you,

173
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:25,020
yourself think are appropriate.

174
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,340
By contrast here on the right
in collectivistic cultures,

175
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,380
the sense of one sense of self identity
cannot be separated from other people.

176
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:39,450
Um, yourself and sense of connection to
others are sort of part and parcel of the

177
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:43,200
same phenomena or sort of how
you think about who you are.

178
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,990
Not surprisingly as a result,

179
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,190
your standard of norms for what are
acceptable or appropriate behaviors are

180
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:51,750
really interpersonal.

181
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:56,650
So they're really about linking you to
other people or between other people.

182
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,611
So again,

183
00:11:57,611 --> 00:12:01,540
what we're seeing is a sense of self and
individualistic cultures versus a sense

184
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,240
of otherness in collectivistic cultures.

185
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,820
So then when we think
about the role of shame,

186
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:12,180
what we see here is that we really see
it play out more in these collectivistic

187
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:16,540
cultures on the right and it plays less
of a pronounced role in individualistic

188
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,580
cultures. We'll strike
blacked out there on the left.

189
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,880
So shame and collectivistic cultures is
actually highly valued and esteemed as

190
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:27,310
an emotion.
It's also hypercard Nice.

191
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:30,520
So we talked about this earlier and
we talked about cultural variation and

192
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:32,910
emotion.
So by hyper cognizant,

193
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,820
this is an emotion that plays a central
feature in the daily lives of people who

194
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:39,730
are in collectivistic cultures.
It's talked about a lot.

195
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:43,990
It's the sort of subject of, you can
think of, of newspaper articles, you know,

196
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:47,170
literary critiques,
Books, um, what have you.

197
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,560
But it's something that's thought about
a lot and as part of everyday language

198
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,260
in a really powerful way.
And as a result,

199
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:57,820
the experience of shame actually does
lead people to behavioral changes.

200
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:02,350
They actually are motivated to sort of
try to remedy or fix these group norm

201
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:03,310
violations.

202
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,250
So a lot of the work that we've talked
about so far has really been in the

203
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:08,170
context of individualistic cultures.

204
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,590
So I think it's just important to keep
in mind that there's always cultural

205
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:15,880
variation and this is one way that
culture plays a really powerful role and

206
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:19,390
actually showing here that
shamed can lead to ultimate good.

207
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,450
Whereas in more individualistic cultures,
as we talked about earlier,

208
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:25,180
it seems not to sort of
mobilize people to do much,

209
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:29,460
but they actually sort of retreat and
withdraw and remained stagnant. Um,

210
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,220
so just keep that in mind with all
these emotions, the role of culture.

211
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,140
So what I'm going to do
now is show some data, um,

212
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,700
that's going to directly
compare guilt and shame.

213
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,840
And with the caveat that this is work
that has been done largely in Westernized

214
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:48,280
cultures where we've tried to understand
the experience primarily of, you know,

215
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:53,281
us residents in the ways in which guilt
and shame are actually similar and

216
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:58,390
distinct. So many of us use
these terms interchangeably.

217
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,910
In what ways are we justified doing that?

218
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:05,110
Are we really referring to the same
thing or are we misusing these words and

219
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:09,580
should really pull them apart and really
recognize their nuances and differences.

220
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,820
So let's turn now to how
guilt versus shame play out.

221
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,320
So I want to start first with some of
the similarities between guilt and shame.

222
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,420
So here's a list of similarities
between these two emotions.

223
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,070
So broadly speaking,

224
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,010
they're both in the family of self
conscious emotions as we've talked about

225
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:27,844
earlier.

226
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,830
They're also considered moral emotions
and so far as their response to what you

227
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,680
can see below some sort of wrongdoing,
right,

228
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:40,600
of judging and act as being
morally wrong or, or incorrect. Um,

229
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,660
and in many ways they have the capacity
to try to help promote prosocial or out

230
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:49,840
touristic behavior, even though
they're associated with wrongdoing.

231
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,790
We largely see them helping,
as we said earlier,

232
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,260
inhibit aggressive tendencies and
promote more prosocial or cooperative

233
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:58,190
tendencies.

234
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,830
They're all so similar in so far as they,
we experienced them socially.

235
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,510
So we experience these emotions in the
context of other people and we think a

236
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:13,170
lot about other people when
we feel guilt or shame. Um,

237
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:18,290
but as much as these are similarities
in terms of relating ourself to someone

238
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:21,510
else and these emotions
being socially inherent, um,

239
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,540
the nature of the interpersonal appraisals
or the way we think about our role in

240
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:31,680
a social sort of context is actually
quite different between guilt and shame.

241
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,530
So for example,
with guilt,

242
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,380
what this is really about
is thinking about, you know,

243
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:41,820
a specific behavior perceived
by others perhaps is wrong.

244
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,520
And so this is really about,
you know,

245
00:15:44,521 --> 00:15:48,780
guilt as a specific behavior that might
be perceived by others as wrong onto the

246
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,614
self.

247
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,620
Whereas shame by contrast again is part
of this kind of Golo noble sense of self

248
00:15:55,831 --> 00:16:00,460
evaluation that is negative, that
is inherently flawed, that has,

249
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:05,400
that is wrong or defective in some way
that is then transmitted to other people.

250
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,510
So you feel yourself that you've done
something fundamentally wrong and that

251
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,930
this is something that should, you
know, be seen easily by others.

252
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,000
So what I want to say here is as much as
these emotions are both very social in

253
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:22,920
nature and they're really about the way
we interact and think of our role in a

254
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:25,710
social context,
even within these similarities,

255
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:29,130
we start to see some important
differences emerge. And so with that,

256
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:33,930
I want to turn to some of the more salient
differences that seem to be apparent

257
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,440
when we really pit guilt
versus shame side by side.

258
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,830
So one of the interesting differences
between shame and guilt is the extent to

259
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:47,520
which they focus on what's called
local versus global factors.

260
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,620
So let's tell you what I mean here.

261
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:54,390
So we're looking at guilt and shame
and we see this local versus global

262
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:55,224
distinction.

263
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,910
So guilt is thought of as
a local focused emotion.

264
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,120
So it's focused on something specific
so you feel bad about some contained

265
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,380
specific behavior.
Um,

266
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,060
whereas shame is more
about global dispositions.

267
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,630
So you're not feeling bad
about one aspect of yourself.

268
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,400
You're feeling bad about yourself very
globally. And very generally, right?

269
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,760
So it's just sort of
diffuse and spreads all out.

270
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,700
Whereas skill is very local and
contained about a specific instance. Um,

271
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,620
so for example, guilt would be, uh,

272
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,040
associated with statements such
as how could I have done that?

273
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:40,490
Whereas Shane by contrast is
how could I have done that?

274
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,080
And so this plays out to,

275
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:47,990
whereas with guilt having
these local kind of focus,

276
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,620
the person might think there's something
wrong with what I did in that specific

277
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:56,280
instance where shame would be
more readily associated with,

278
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,250
there's something wrong with me overall.

279
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,600
So guilt is local shame
has a more global focus.

280
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,300
They also differ in the extent to which
they motivate people to amend or fix the

281
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,690
wrongdoing versus sort of
retreat and hide away from it.

282
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:19,040
So again, we're going to pit
guilt versus shame side by side.

283
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,960
So we see guilt is associated
with more amending behavior.

284
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,550
So you want to try to correct or
redress the wrongdoing where shame,

285
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:31,700
we talked about this, you're sort
of, you know, hunter posture over,

286
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:33,200
you withdraw into a corner,

287
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:38,060
you want to hide and sort of get out
of the social spotlight altogether as a

288
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:39,080
result.
Um,

289
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,860
guilt is often associated with this
amending behavior where you feel motivated

290
00:18:42,861 --> 00:18:44,090
to address the problem,

291
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,290
where a shame you really are motivated
to hide from the problem to sort of get

292
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,820
away from it all together.

293
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,710
Yeah.

294
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,330
And so, um, as a result, some people
have talked about guilt as sort of,

295
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,290
you know, facing the music,
right? You, you go and apologize,

296
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,320
you try to undo the wrong
and you try to repair it.

297
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,490
Where shame has also often been talked
about is trying to sort of duck the heat.

298
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,650
So disappear or hide or
escape from whatever situation
made you feel ashamed in

299
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,484
the first place.

300
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,540
So guilt motivates us to amend or
fix what happened that went wrong.

301
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,990
Shame motivates us to hide and
get away from it all together.

302
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:22,460
Yeah.

303
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,870
And this is a really interesting one
because both of these emotions also have

304
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:28,580
different relationships.
To empathy.

305
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,820
So empathy is this ability to sort of
get in the mind of others and understand

306
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:34,461
their emotions,

307
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:38,720
to kind of connect to the thoughts and
feelings of other people and shame and

308
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:42,470
guilt are quite different and how
they relate to feelings of empathy.

309
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,600
So if we put them side by side,

310
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,400
we see here that guilt is this
very other oriented emotion, right?

311
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,440
As much as it's self conscious,

312
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:55,310
it really motivates you to try to connect
to the thoughts and feelings of others.

313
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,880
And by contrast,
shame is very self oriented.

314
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:02,840
It's these global negative feelings about
oneself and your attention is really

315
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:06,920
sort of turned inwards in this way.
As a result,

316
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,670
guilt being other oriented helps you
take other people's perspective in a

317
00:20:10,671 --> 00:20:15,110
situation where you've done something
wrong. Whereas shame being self oriented,

318
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,990
you're really sort of
taking your own perspective.

319
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:21,890
You're sort of caught up in what,
what is your perception of what happened?

320
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,110
And as a result,

321
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,700
guilt is associated with an increased
stability to empathize with other people

322
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,530
and shame is associated with a decreased
ability to empathize with other people.

323
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,590
Also there's the sense in which there's
a defensive versus non defensive

324
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:44,210
attitude about the wrongdoing and guilt
and shame also differ quite strongly in

325
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:45,050
this respect.

326
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,350
So guilt has a general defensive response
associated with it where shame has

327
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:54,160
this more defensive response. And let
me give you an example of what I mean.

328
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:55,060
So guilt,

329
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:59,860
having a non defensive response motivates
people to try to rationally discuss

330
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:00,850
the situation,

331
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,290
to kind of take proactive behavior to
remedy the wrong doing or behavior they

332
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,124
committed.

333
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,880
Whereas shame because it's all about
the self and he's a negative overall

334
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:10,900
evaluations,

335
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,700
you're more prone to try to blame other
people as almost this of this way to

336
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:20,560
escape feeling shamed about
yourself. Um, and so for example,

337
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:23,620
as a result with guilt,
when we think about emotions of anger,

338
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,170
even though you may feel angry,
you know,

339
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,630
when you've done something
that makes you feel guilty,

340
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:30,400
you'll feel sort of agitated about it,

341
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,230
you're more motivated to try to manage
that anger constructively and proactively.

342
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,970
Whereas shame people are more prone
to experiencing greater anger overall,

343
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:41,230
then people prone to guilt,

344
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,460
but they also manage their feelings of
anger differently. So they're actually,

345
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,690
when you're prone to shame,

346
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:50,500
you're more prone to engaging in
aggressive behaviors. So again,

347
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:52,870
guilt is a more non
defensive way of responding.

348
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,540
Shame is a more defensive
way of responding.

349
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,320
So I want to return now to our example
with tiger woods and ask yourself now,

350
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,260
after you know, you've learned a
bit more about guilt and shame.

351
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Did he really experience guilt
or did he experience shame?

352
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,810
And I won't tell you
what the right answer is,

353
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,680
but I'd be interested to hear what you
think after learning a bit about the

354
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:21,130
nature of guilt and shame.
And so with that,

355
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,150
I want to conclude with our takeaway
questions and then our expert interview.

356
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,800
So our takeaway questions for today goes,
follows first,

357
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,460
what are the key features again,

358
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:34,510
and you elicit or the behavior
and the consequence of guilt.

359
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,330
What are the key features, again, elicit
her behavior and consequence of shame.

360
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,630
And as we just talked about at
the end of the lecture today,

361
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,120
what were the key areas of similarities?

362
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:50,020
The way in which these two motions
showed overlapping features and what were

363
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:54,310
some of the really profound differences
that really teased apart the ways in

364
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:58,300
which shame and guilt can actually
be quite a significantly different

365
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,400
subconscious emotions as well.

366
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,060
We'll now turn to our expert interview.

367
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,740
So our expert interview as part of the
broader experts in emotion interview

368
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:13,510
series today. Um, for our
experts and emotion interview.

369
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:17,790
We have the honor of speaking
with doctor June Tangney um,

370
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,490
on shame and guilt, the
good, the bad and the ugly.

371
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,170
So Dr Tangney received her phd in
clinical psychology from the University of

372
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:26,711
California,

373
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:31,030
Los Angeles and is currently a professor
of psychology at George Mason Mason

374
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:31,864
University.

375
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,200
She's a fellow of the APA division of
personality and social psychology and the

376
00:23:37,271 --> 00:23:42,070
American psychological society. She's
authored or edited several books on shame,

377
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,070
uh, including and, and as well as
guilt and self conscious emotions.

378
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,960
These books include shame and guilt,

379
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,320
social psychological foundations
of clinical psychology,

380
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,120
the self conscious emotions,

381
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:56,750
theory and research and the
handbook of self and identity.

382
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,920
Her research has been funded by the end.

383
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:03,620
Ida and I see HD and SF and
the John Templeton Foundation.

384
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,250
Um,

385
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:09,250
she's also a very much loved teacher
and recipient of the George Mason

386
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:12,080
University's teaching excellence award.

387
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:17,380
So I now turn to our experts and emotion
interview with doctor June Tangney.
