Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01          Welcome back to human emotion. Today we'll continue to focus our discussion on the elicitation of emotion by learning about all the exciting and really cool tools and methods that one can use to both understand and quantify emotion. So think of yourself as a laboratory scientist trying to probe the mysteries of emotion.

Speaker 2:          00:20          Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:21          this will be our second part in this exciting module focused on how do we trigger emotions and once we trigger them, how do we measure them in the first place? In other words, we're really trying to get at the question of what makes us emotional. So today we'll continue our discussion of the different tools and methods that researchers use to elicit emotion. And then we'll conclude with our takeaway questions and another fantastic expert interview in this field. So let's jump right in with the second part of the tools and methods that are the coolest things. As a scientist, when you get into how do you trigger an emotion, how do you get people to feel emotional? So you might remember these three core processes we talked about in our last lecture, including emotion, reactivity, emotion regulation, and emotion understanding. So again, these are the three big processes that we try to get at as researchers when we're developing tools to tap into emotion.

Speaker 1:          01:24          So these were the eight domains of emotional dissertation tools. We talked about the top four in our last lecture. And as you can see here, highlighted in the lovely color red. We're going to be talking about these four bad boys here at the bottom. So we'll start talking about music and singing, the acoustic startle reflex, startle, eyeblink modulation, and the directed facial action task. So let's begin. What might be perhaps the most intriguing to all of you now music and singing. So how do we use this to elicit emotion? So we all know that music elicits strong feelings, right? Some of us feel the most emotional when we listened to our favorite song or song that reminds us of a really important time in our life. So researchers have tried to leverage this everyday experience to use music as a way of getting people into a certain emotional state.

Speaker 1:          02:13          So one approach that's used by Eric Eich has been to bring people into the lab and have them listen to different kinds of classical music. And he's had them listen to classical music that's used to elicit both happy feelings and sad feelings. Okay? So by using these tools, he's found that people can actually get them into the emotional states. Now what about singing? This is intimately tied to music, right? And when we think about singing, how can they use singing to elicit emotions? So the way that my lab has approached this is by using singing to try to elicit self conscious emotions. So perhaps we've all had our fair share of, you know, embarrassing Karaoke moments. I won't ask you to describe them now and I won't share mine with you, but if we think about Karaoke, we know that it elicit something pretty strong in us.

Speaker 1:          03:02          And so researchers have taken hold of this idea and actually brought karaoke sets into the lab, right? These are some of the most, you know, Rad labs you can think of in the world where they try to use this tool to elicit and understand self conscious emotions like embarrassment. So what you have people do is you use a well validated tacit goes as follows. So people come into the lab and they're asked to remain seated quietly while you acquire a resting baseline. Sort of getting what their current emotional state is that day in the lab. Next you tell them, okay, well we're going to do is have you participate in this study where we look at your emotional responses to singing. And in my lab we've used this task using the song, which is a favorite of mine is the Beatles Song Twist and shout. And while participants are singing along with this song wearing headphones, um, they're being videotaped unbeknownst to them later on, after completing a series of unrelated lab tasks, Bam, up on the computer monitor, they get to watch this video of themselves.

Speaker 1:          04:06          The best part of it though is that there is no background music. So literally all they're hearing is their own voice. Sing along to the song. And as you can see here, this is the period of the study that we know reliably elicits the emotion of embarrassment. And at the end we have people self report their emotional experience, not only how embarrassed they feel, but how positive in general and how negative in general did they feel. So I'll show you an example of one of my colleagues here at Yale University, Laurie Santos, participating in this study. So again, she was asked to sing along to the Beatle Song, twist and shout.

Speaker 3:          04:51          Well,

Speaker 2:          04:54          okay,

Speaker 3:          04:58          come on mom. Mom. Mom Pay man. Come on. Well yeah, no, you look so good.

Speaker 2:          05:12          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          05:13          yeah. You've got make Darwin. Nah, just like I knew you would. Well I'll shake it up a statue. Come on baby God on and work it all out. Yeah, we had twisted a little girl. Yeah, no, yeah. Twice a fun. Yeah, no, not twist a little closer. Now I know that you're mad.

Speaker 4:          05:57          And another

Speaker 1:          05:58          video that I'm very excited to share with you of one of our most favorite laboratory participants completing this task is John Lutz, who's a television writer who's written for both Saturday night live and 30 rock. And you may know him as playing the character. Let's on 30 rock. So now I'm very excited to show you a video of John Lutz. Indeed, even as you know, a famous writer, an actor, he too experienced embarrassment when having to sing the song, twist and shout, and then have the video of himself presented back to him.

Speaker 1:          07:36          So in summary, when we think of music and singing as a tool for eliciting emotion, we see that it's very good at eliciting emotional processes like reactivity. And the advantages are that it's relatively simple, effective. And as you saw by some of the video demonstrations engaging. The disadvantages though can be that for one, when you use music to elicit emotions, it's really difficult to match the musical tastes to the participant. So I sewed you Eric, I x technique of using classical music, which doesn't fit everyone, right? So you want to try your best to standardize music, but also match it to the people who come into the lab. And as you saw in some of the videos, um, by both Laura Santos and John, let's from 30 rock and Saturday night live, there can be some part of Smith discomfort when you ask them to sing in front of the camera and then present it back to them.

Speaker 1:          08:25          So now we're gonna move on to the acoustic startle reflex. So that startle reflex has three parts. And this is something that we all are ingrained with and built with us human beings. So first, if we hear some stimulus, some loud, just Bam noise in front of us, we have an initial response and this occurs within 500 milliseconds. And it consists of a stereotype pattern of sematic and muscular actions associated with physiological responding. So we all just kind of shutter jolt, right? This is something we all do. Now, the part that's relevant for emotion researchers is what comes, comes after, which is a secondary emotional response. So essentially what you're getting is a person's emotional response to having been startled. And this varies widely across individuals. It can take place in the form of amusement, sort of laughing at yourself for having been startled, embarrassment, and even anger or fear.

Speaker 1:          09:20          So Acoustic startle reflex as a methodology is really good at eliciting reactivity as you saw across the wide variety of emotions. It has the advantage of being relatively simple, unobtrusive, and you can get these both automatic primary responses as well as more secondary emotion responses to having been startled. The disadvantages though, or is that it's often limited to measuring just the general defensive kind of reflects of response. So you can't really tap into more specific emotions very easily. So you can use it for some kinds of responses, but you can't use it to measure the whole wide variety of our emotional, you know, repertoire. So we'll move from acoustic startle reflex to what's called startle eyeblink modulation. And I'll explain what this means now. So startle eyeblink modulation is a really interesting phenomena. So essentially what you're measuring is how big of an eye blink did you make?

Speaker 1:          10:16          Right? It was at a very big, I blink or really tiny. I blink. And you may wonder how the heck is that relevant to emotion at all? I certainly remember thinking the same thing when I joined the lab as an Undergrad student and they were having me code the magnitude of how big a person's blink was. But what's really cool about startle eyeblink modulation is it actually can tell us a wide variety about emotion that's less susceptible to demand characteristics or people trying to guess what the experiment is about or rate what they think they ought to be feeling in that study. So what we do with startle eyeblink modulation is you attach a variety of electrodes to the person's face, and these electrodes can be used to measure the amplitude or how big the eye blink is. Now, this may seem pretty wild to you at first sight, but larger eye blinks are an indirect indicator of negative emotions, whereas smaller eye blinks are an indirect indicator of positive emotions.

Speaker 1:          11:13          So I was like this analogy that helps illustrate this. So imagine you're walking down a dark alley and something startles you, right? You're likely to have a very big reflexive response, including a very big eye blink. So that's because you were probably anxious or a little nervous. So in a way your eye blink actually provided a window into how you were feeling. Now contrast this with walking down a sunny beach, right? It's a sunny day. The skies are clear and again, out of nowhere someone comes out and startles you. Now you're going to still blink, but how big you blink is actually going to be attenuated or it's going to be a smaller eye blink. So what you're really getting at is how much people respond to startles. So while people are wearing these electrodes, you present a brief noise over there, headphones that causes them to blink and whether they blink of a large magnitude or small magnitude in response to watching a series of prompts. I apps photos that we talked about in our last lecture positively, negatively or neutrally balanced or watching emotional films actually highly correlates with people self reported emotion experience, but does it in a way that's more indirect in a way that some people might say is an actually more reliable indicator of their emotion state. So the eye and perhaps the eye blink can be a window into a person's emotional soul, surprisingly enough.

Speaker 1:          12:34          So when we think about Acoustic startle reflex, what we're getting at our processes and emotional reactivity, how much your eyes quote blink in response to feeling negative or positive when startled. The advantages are that it's simple, unobtrusive and less subject to demand characteristics as we just spoke about. But the disadvantages are you really only get broadly at positive and negative leave valence behaviors. You can't really get into complex emotions like pride or embarrassment or shame. So you have a less rich Rhett repertoire of emotional behavior. But if your question is really focused on how positive or how negative is that person feeling in the moment, it can be a useful tool for that specific purpose. So now I want to turn to our final tool in our emotional toolbox, which is the directed facial action task. So this is a really cool task and one of the first that was used in the field of emotional dissertation.

Speaker 1:          13:32          So for the directed facial action task, I'm going to ask you to engage in an exercise with me. What I'd like you to do is to first get out a sheet of paper and a pen. So now you're sitting at your laptop watching this video. So I'd like you to just for a second, kind of go old school and go get out an actual piece of paper and a pen. And then I'm going to ask you to follow some instructions along with me. Okay. So let's assume you now have a piece of paper and a pen and I want you to do the following. Okay? So take one I'd like you to do is pull the corners of your mouth downward. Now as the corners of your mouth stay downward, raise your eyebrows up and pull them together. Kind of bring them towards the center of your face. Now squint your eyes slightly as you're doing all these things.

Speaker 2:          14:26          Okay?

Speaker 1:          14:27          And hold this for 10 seconds. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and 10. Now I'd like you to write down how do you feel this was take one. So very negative over here at the left, negative four to zero, which is neutral to positive is four. So pick one of these numbers here right now to indicate how you feel.

Speaker 2:          14:58          Okay?

Speaker 1:          14:59          Now we're going to do take two. So follow my instructions again. This time I want you to pull your eyebrows together towards the center of your face,

Speaker 2:          15:11          okay?

Speaker 1:          15:11          Why didn't your eyes by pooling your upper eyelid ups? So kind of try to get your eyes big, pull up your eyelid, get those eyes nice and big. Press your lips together. Hold him really tight. And as you have your eyebrows together, your eyes are widened, your lips are pressed. Try to tighten your lips and raise them up. Now hold this for 10 seconds and we'll count together. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and 10. Okay. Now I'd like you to rate how you feel now. Negative four, negative, zero, neutral, all the way up to four positive. And now take three. And thanks for bearing with me. So let's try this together. Pull the corners of your mouth upward this time.

Speaker 2:          16:14          Okay,

Speaker 1:          16:15          now take the corners of your mouth as they're up and pull them outwards. So away from the center of your face as much as you possibly can. Squint your eyes slightly and hold this for 10 seconds. All right, so let's count one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and 10. Okay, so write down how you feel negative four all the way up to four. And let's try to guess. So for take one, this was the facial configuration that's associated with sadness. So most people report feeling more on the negative spectrum of that scale you saw on the negative number range. So these are the facial muscles, the muscles associated with sadness. And we find that when people sort of basically put their faces in the muscle configurations that are associated with the display of sadness, we actually report feeling more negative or more sad. What would you guess for take two? What kinds of emotions did you feel? Well you were correct for the day and can get extra credit if you guessed anger. So again, you probably should've seen that your emotions were being rated as more negative as well here. Now finally for take three, what would be your guests? What do you, what kind of emotions did you experience and rate?

Speaker 1:          17:39          Well, here you go. What we had you do is put your face in the configuration that's associated with feeling joy and happiness. And we find that when people do that, either through the instructions I gave you, or even simply by at being asked to put a pen and hold it here on their lip, that we find that people actually report feeling happy. So there's some sort of feedback loop between the muscles in your face signaling and emotion state to your brain that then in turn actually helps engender the emotion experience itself. So people will say this expression like turn that frown upside down. Well to some extent there's truth to that. If we actually try to make our faces, you know, show an expression of joy or happiness, we may actually in turn subjectively feel more positive and happy. So you can do this task both explicitly.

Speaker 1:          18:27          The way we did it today in class, instructing people to move facial muscles in the take one, two and three we just went through, or like I was indicating with the pen implicitly. So just ask people to move their facial muscles for what seems to be a seemingly unrelated or different tasks. So holding a pen on their lip or putting a pen in their mouth said sort of elicit the kinds of muscles involved in happiness display because you can see it causes the corners of her mouth to go up, for example. And for some people it might even cause this sort of a raising of the cheeks or crows eyes, the squinting that's also associated with a Duchenne smile, which is an indicator of happiness we'll talk about later in the course.

Speaker 2:          19:05          Okay,

Speaker 1:          19:05          so summary here. So the processes, you can list it with the directed facial action task or reactivity. You can get people to feel emotions. It's also as in terms of its advantages, simple, unobtrusive and less subject to demand characteristics. But the disadvantages are you can't really assess reactivity to external stimuli. What you are able to assess is how much people respond when their face has changed, the muscle configurations that are associated with prototypical emotion displays, but you can't get sort of how they're responding to events occurring in the world around them, either on the computer screen or when interacting with another person.

Speaker 2:          19:42          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:43          So we've gone through eight broad domains of tools and methods. Um, the latter for we touched on today. So now I'd like to move to our takeaway questions.

Speaker 2:          19:53          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:54          The first question asks, well, what were the four emotional dissertation tools covered today, Aka, or are you paying attention when we went through the lecture today? Second, which of the three key emotional processes, so reactivity, regulation, and understanding did each of the two four tools discussed today? Target. And finally, what were the strengths and limitations of each of the four tools discussed today? And with that, we'll turn to a wonderful expert interview in the domain of emotional elicitation and measurement. And again, this is part of our experts in emotion interview series. Today we'll be speaking with doctor Gregg Siegal on emotion elicitation. Dr Siegel received his PhD degrees from the San Diego State University and University of California San Diego joint doctoral program in clinical psychology. He also completed a clinical internship at the center for addiction and mental health in Toronto and an NIH postdoctoral fellowship in clinical cognitive neuroscience at the Western psychiatric institute and Clinic. He's currently an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, where he directs the program and cognitive aspect of neuroscience. Doctor Siegel's research program examines brain mechanisms of depression, anxiety, and recovery from these conditions, as well as using tools of neuroscience to predict responses to treatments and guide novel Treatment Development. Dr Siegel has authored over 90 publications and 13 book chapters and has received several honors, including the Western psychiatric institute and Clinic Young Investigator Award and the junior faculty scholar award. So I now turn to a special experts and emotion interview with Doctor Gregg Segal.
