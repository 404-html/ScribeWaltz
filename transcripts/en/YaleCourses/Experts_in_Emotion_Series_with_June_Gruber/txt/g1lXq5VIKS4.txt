Speaker 1:          00:00          So welcome back to human emotion. Today we're going to continue in our third part of a three part series on emotion elicitation and measurement. Asking what makes us emotional. So our first two modules covered emotional elicitation, looking at a diverse array of strategies to trigger emotion both in and outside of the lab. However, such techniques are of little use in less. We're also capable of reliably measuring the emotion responses that we generate using these tools. So today what we're going to do is focus on the ways in which we actually measure the emotions once they're set off, once they're triggered. This is really using a multi componential approach to motion that's going to guide our roadmap today. So first we'll try to look at ways in which people measure the subjective experience of emotion or how do I feel? Then we'll look at the ways people measure the outward expressive display of emotional behavior.

Speaker 1:          00:54          In other words, how do I look when I feel emotional? And finally we'll conclude by discussing physiological ways of responding. So physiological tools to measure emotion in the autonomic and central nervous system. Answering the question of what is my body saying when I'm feeling I given emotion? We'll conclude with our takeaway questions and expert interview. So let's start with the question of how do I feel? How do we measure the subjective experience of emotion? So as we discussed earlier, emotions have these multiple components. So emotion needs to separately assess each of these three components. Here we're beginning with subjective emotion response, which is contrasted with behavioral and physiological response domains. When we think about subjective measures, we can roughly break them into three broad categories. Self report questionnaires, continuous rating, dials and experience sampling methods to capture emotion in everyday life. So let's begin first with some common questionnaires.

Speaker 1:          01:53          So one of the most common questionnaires to assess both positive and negative emotion experience is called the positive and negative aspects schedule or the Panis p a, n a. S. So it's what you can see here. There's a host of different emotion related adjectives, which participants are asked to rate on a scale of very slightly, a little moderately, quite a bit or extremely. And so they can answer this in terms of what they're feeling. Right now, what they felt in general in the past week or at a trade level, how they generally feel. And this is probably the gold standard for measuring subjective emotion experience. A new tool that's been developed that we use often in my lab is called the modified differential emotion scalar mds. And what I particularly like about this scale that you might be able to notice as you're sort of scanning through the different items here is that it has a much more rich repertoire of positive emotional terms. So we see feelings of awe, wonder, amazement, glad, happy, joyful, interested, alert, curious. So it comes in triplets and people are asked to indicate to what extent they feel from not at all to extremely hopeful, optimistic slash encouraged as compared to, for example, loves slash closeness. Slash. Trust. And this is really nice if you're particularly interested in measuring discrete or distinct types of positive emotional experiences and using questionnaire measures.

Speaker 2:          03:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:15          Another commonly used questionnaire measure is called the stress appraisal measure or Sam. And what's nice about this as it gets sort of, um, over potential or across potential language demands that may be inherent when people are using either the Panis are endless in terms of how they interpret emotional words, um, and what their emotional vocabulary is prior to the, uh, you know, experiment where they're filling out these measures instead with the Sam uses as a graphical icon of a human man, good old Sam. And what it's measuring really is emotional activation or arousal. So if you scan left to right, you see someone at the left who's not very emotionally activated, very low arousal all the way up to the right where it's extremely emotionally activated. He's about to explode right here from so much emotional intensity. So this is a nice alternative if you want to see to what extent, you know, if you take language away and just use graphical depictions of emotion related intensity, if you're able to get the same kind of response that you would get using emotion related adjectives.

Speaker 1:          04:17          So, um, let's think about questionnaires. So there's different ways that you can collect questionnaire responses. One way is to use traditional paper and pencil methods. So bringing the questionnaires printed out into the laboratory and have the participants fill it out. Much like the picture you see here. So this is considered the traditional way that's actually now becoming more of the old school way. So it seems more and more that people are now collecting self report questionnaires using computerized online survey methods. So one common use survey method that people use as Qualtrics. So Qualtrics is an example of how you can actually program these questionnaires using this interface and have people instead of writing out the response, simply click or select a particular response option on the computer and then have this particular online survey program output the data for you in either a very easily accessible excel, SPSS or other type of format.

Speaker 1:          05:12          In addition, we see another method that's gaining increasing attention, which is Amazon's mechanical Turk. So this is a very widespread and ever-growing way to collect data outside of simply college undergraduate samples from people around the world. So you can distribute surveys and even within the course of 24 hours have a large number of self report questionnaire responses. So if you're interested in more about this, you can definitely look at some readings that have suggested the potential power of a tool like this for collecting self report questionnaire. Assessment, some emotion in a relatively short time period. Another method is called narrative methods. So this goes beyond general categories to capture more nuance themes of a person's unique emotional life. So I particularly like this quote. Um, this was a quote from the book living narrative, and it goes as follows. Putting events in a temporal sequence not only orders them with respect to each other, it creates an overarching interpretive frame.

Speaker 1:          06:11          Just as a succession of notes does not necessarily constitute a melodic phrase. So events that are randomly recounted do not make a story like notes. The narrated events need to be cast as members of an ordered set, like a melodic phrase, such as set, constitutes a coherent narrative unit called an episode. So here what you're doing is you're collecting people's either verbal or written descriptions of their emotional experiences and you can code it, you know, along rich dimension of, of different categories. You can look at the temporal sequencing of the event, sort of what's the linear trajectory or lack thereof in which they tell the story. You can look at a particular kinds of emotion words or metaphors people use. Um, you can also look at the rich context that they embed their emotions in and whether they described their emotions as being something that they're an active agent over or simply a passive recipient of.

Speaker 1:          07:04          So these are things that you simply can't get using questionnaires and that you can get using a narrative methodology. Related to this, Pennebaker has developed a computerized system called the Luke l IWC linguistic inquiry and word count. And what he does using the system is he's able to take text of people's either verbal narratives of speeches that have been transcribed or again, people will do writing assignments. And it's like the one in this slide where there'll be asked to sort of keep an emotional diary over a time period where they record their deepest emotions and thoughts about some emotional upheaval. Um, in, in his instructions he asks people to really let go and explore the event and how it has affected you. You might tie this experience to your childhood, your relationship with your parents, people you have loved or love now or even your career and to write every day continuously for 20 minutes.

Speaker 1:          07:59          What he's done with this exercise is taken people's written descriptions of the emotional upheaval or difficulty that they're currently confronting. Put it through his computerized text analysis system, the Luke, and then looked at the prevalence of things such as pronoun usage, using more, for example, I versus we words or looking at the kinds of emotional words people use are looking at the kind of insight that develops in their sort of cognitive use of language as they write about this event every day for four consecutive days. So he's able to actually see change in people's emotional wellbeing as a function of the language or ways in which they described their emotional experiences. Now, now we moved from questionnaires and narrative methods, Twitter called rating dials. So you can see this here in the screen. What rating dials do that's really unique is they allow you to look at fine grained, um, second by second measurements of, so here what you have people do is while they're in a laboratory, you have them place their hand on a dial.

Speaker 1:          09:01          So it may be one like the dial on the left where they can move it from left to right from very negative all the way over to very positive or it can be more a straight line. Here we're very negative maybe at the bottom and very positive at the top. And this has been used in studies where people are either watching dynamic films over a several minute period or interacting in discussions with partners. And what people can do is literally shift the dial second by second as their emotion experience changes. So all the methods we've talked about so far are really looking at broader time scopes, asking people to write in that moment how they felt on average or how they felt during a, you know, emotional film after the film has ended and what you miss out on are the fine grain second by second changes or what people call the aspect of chronometer.

Speaker 1:          09:48          Three of an emotion response. Here you can look at not only how intense someone felt in the motion, but what were the patterns of variability. How long did it take them to reach their peak emotion state? How long did it take them to recover? You can answer a whole host of really rich questions when you use continuous styles like this. The one disadvantage some people might argue is that it may interfere with the actual experience of the emotion. So you can imagine being in a conversation with someone while they're sharing a distressing event and you may find it cognitively difficult to both pay attention to the individual speaking and sort of keep your hand on this lever constantly moving it around is your emotion state shifts. But these are some of the rich possibilities that you can really extract when you use these, you know, more continuous rating dials.

Speaker 1:          10:32          And then finally the third sort of common measure of subjective spirits as you can see here is what's called experience sampling methods, often referred to as ESM. So ESM is a really fascinating way to collect information about a person's emotion state outside of the lab and their own naturalistic daily life. So here this is a type of data collection in which participants respond to repeated assessments at moments over the course of time while functioning and living within their natural life settings. So people originally would do ESM studies starting with the alarm clock, stacks of paper, palm pilot, pagers. And today with all the advances of technology, there is now iPhone apps that people can use to report over multiple times in a given day at random intervals. How are they feeling? What contexts are they in? What kinds of strategies are they using to effectively manage their emotions?

Speaker 1:          11:25          So what's Nice is that people can respond directly to these devices. It's time saving. It's convenient often for participants to do it. At their own time and their own life. And what you can then do is just transfer the state data relatively easily to a computer for subsequent data analysis. So this is one of the ways to sort of get outside of the lab and try to capture people's emotions as it's actually lived in their daily life force. The subjective experience of, so for example, um, some of the things that experience sampling methods provide, um, are the following in addition to some of the advantages I just highlighted. So experience sampling methods one, allow you to understand behavioral contingencies. So you can look at the relationship between the subjective experience of emotion and the actual events occurring in their lives and try to find some important causal link between what happens in your life and how that causes you to feel or at least understand the association between the two.

Speaker 1:          12:25          Second, it has good ecological validity. So this is a term we've heard a lot in this, you know, three part module on emotional elicitation and measurement, which really means how again, how much does it map onto the person's own real world experience. Because here you're getting people to get outside of the lab in their own naturalistic every day environment. Third, what you can do here, since you're getting multiple measures of emotion within a single participant across, you know, a wide, uh, period of time, maybe a couple of days, all the way up to a week or a month as you can investigate what's referred to as intra individual processes. So this is within person processes such as differences within a person that can change over time or across the situation. So we can all think of ways in which our own mood may fluctuate over the course of a day or in response to different kinds of events.

Speaker 1:          13:15          And Esm lets you actually look at that scientifically. So we've talked a little bit about subjective measures of or how we feel. Now let's move to behavioral measures or how do we look, how do we behave when we're feeling emotional? So behavioral measures, um, some of the two most common use tools in this domain are the facial action coding system and the staff system. So we'll talk about each of these in turn. So we'll begin with the fax system. So this is one of the first systems that was developed to systematically quantify emotion expressions in the face. So it was developed by Paul Ekman and freezing in the 1970s and what it did is tried to categorize facial behaviors, not based on overall sort of subjective impressions of how emotional the person's face looked, but instead based on a more sort of micro level rigorous coding of the underlying muscle configurations that are used to give rise to an emotion expression.

Speaker 1:          14:11          So every little sort of unit of muscle action he would say is what he called an action unit or Aau and specific action units where specific a use he would argue combined together to reflect emotions. So we'll go through an example of what kind of a use, for example, give rise to the expression of happiness when we smile. Now facts is incredibly rigorous and often considered a gold standard and coding emotional behavior in the face, but it comes at the cost. So it takes 80 to a hundred hours to train on the system. And once you've gone through the training manual, you have to pass a nationwide standardized certified test become what's called a official facts coder. So this is something that myself and my students in my lab have done. And it's a considerable time investment. But once you do it, it changes the way you look at the face forever.

Speaker 1:          15:03          You notice subtle muscle shifts all around in the face that we often, you know, maybe barely detect or go unnoticed. And this particular system allows you to capture them, notice them, and quantify them. So let's look at an example here. So hugely an expression of a woman looking, for example, you might say she looks scared. Now, what are the particular muscle units in our face that make her look that way? So here these codes here, one c, two c, five d, et Cetera, these are the action units. So the action units or the particular numbers here, one, two, five, four, 20 etc. And the letters next to them refer to the intensity of the display. So they go from a, which is sort of at the lowest sense. So it's a trace all the way up to [inaudible], which is the maximal intensity of how much you could contract that muscle.

Speaker 1:          15:50          So you see a c here that's somewhere in the middle. So she's raising her inner eyebrow at a moderate degree, right? And it really tries to code all of these separately, not looking so much at overall, how do we think she's feeling, but what specific muscles are being activated and contracted while that particular expression is occurring. Now here, what's interesting is that you can use facts to reliably identify what's called a real smile or a Duchenne smile. So what are the characteristics of someone when they're smiling authentically? Well, there's two distinguishing features. One of them is called the Aau six or the cheek racer. Now this in older adults, older than this young girl here, we also call it the crows feet. So when we raise our cheeks up, what often happens in us older adults is you see fine lines develop on the corner of the eyes.

Speaker 1:          16:38          And so that's one kind of telltale sign that it's a genuine smile. And you also see what's called an Aau 12 which is really taking the corners of the lips and pulling them upwards. What we often think of as a smile. So this is a genuine smile. How do we contrast this then with a fake or non Duchenne smile? So what do you notice here? What is different from the picture you just saw? So those of you who said, hey, the Aau six is missing are exactly right. So these kind of fake smiles we do for photos or an awkward social situations, what we're doing is we're trying to pull the lip corners up, but we're not able to move our cheeks up. We're not able to kind of get those crow's feet, you know, in action. And that's because Paul Ekman and others would argue that a genuine smile is not something that we can voluntarily produce.

Speaker 1:          17:26          It's actually something that's quite involuntary and usually only co occurs when we're genuinely feeling happy. So if you want to know how to detect a real smile from a fake smile, look for the [inaudible] that she grazer that you see. Not In this man, but you see in this young girl here, okay, so now let's look at the staff system. So the spouse systems really fantastic and includes additional codes that aren't inherent in the fact system. And as you can see here, some of the additional codes that are included in this bath system and that were really developed to help measure emotional behavior in the context of dyadic interactions. Frequently between romantic partners or spouses are additional behavioral and even auditory cues. So it will have postural codes such as when someone sits up or forward when they're talking to their spouse, it'll try to get at intonation.

Speaker 1:          18:15          So whether or not there are changes in a person's vocal pitch or whether they were speaking at a different volume and also gets at what a really important emotional behaviors such as laughter, which the fax system does not itself code as, it's only coding the ways in which the face is contracting in terms of the underlying musculature. So spath is also fantastic to use and as you can see, it's based off the fact system. You see the same Aau six and a 12, but it has additional codes here. So you can see the man on the right. This is Jim Coan. Um, a wonderful aspect of scientists in the field. And you see here not only the Aau six and 12, but also additional descriptions of things that are associated with interest, affection, validation, humor and enthusiasm. And we might also look at whether or not he's showing an increase in his vocal pitch, looking at his posture as he's sitting up and forward, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          19:05          So now we've talked about subjective and behavioral. What about our body? How does our body say anything about the way we feel emotionally and how do we measure that? So I'll start here with our bodily sensations. Looking at the question of, you know, can things like our heart rate or a heartbeat actually really be a window into our feelings? So William James, really the father of psychology first echo this notion that indeed the body is a window into the emotional soul. He said, no shade of emotion should be without some sort of bodily reverberation or some way in which our body shifts or sort of undulates when we feel an emotion response, and we'll talk about this more in the course will actually have a specific lecture devoted to this. Where we look at this question of is a heart really a window into our feelings and we'll also look at the specific kinds of tools that people measure emotion in the lab.

Speaker 1:          19:57          As you can see here, this is actually one of my research assistants, Christina reas and she has a variety of electrodes, are sensors that are attached. And what these sensors do is they pick up electrical activity of the heart every time, the heartbeats as well as looking at different respiration patterns. So you can see here in this graph are things like the heartbeat. So the red signal here and every little blue.at the top is it is a distinct point at which her heartbeats and what you can do, and we'll talk again about this in more depth when we get to the psychophysiology of emotion. As you can map specific types of autonomic nervous system or ans changes to emotion responses. So we can try to map specific physiological profiles of anger, fear, sadness, disgust, and even happiness simply based on changes in our bodily responses.

Speaker 1:          20:46          So that's the peripheral autonomic nervous system. What about the central nervous system or the brain? So there's, you know, three kind of major divisions of the brain that are thought to be included in emotion. So this includes the limbic system. So this includes the hypothalamus and Mig, Dulla, nucleus accumbens, and several other nearby areas and has great importance in emotional life and memories for emotional events. As you can see here. Second is the stride system or the striatum. So this includes the putamen caught a nucleus nucleus accumbens, and it's divided into both the dorsal and ventral striatum. As you can see roughly here, and this is often thought of as the reward center of the brain. So it's often associated with the experience of pleasure or reward. And third is the NEOCORTEX. So this is the outer layer of the brain as you can roughly see here, deeply folded and grooved.

Speaker 1:          21:39          And here are the prefrontal cortex is in the front part of the brain and we think of this as sort of the prefrontal cognitive control region. So this is thought to be involved in the regulation or control of emotion. Each of these three subdivisions of the brain will also go much further into depth when we get to the brain basis of emotion. But I want you to see today as there's really rich complex tools to study bodily changes, both in our autonomic nervous system and higher up in our brain that indeed provide clues into our emotional wellbeing.

Speaker 2:          22:09          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          22:09          the central nervous system, we can look at responses using things called functional magnetic resonance imaging or Mri. Here we can look at areas of the brain that seem to be activated during different kinds of emotional challenges or stressors.

Speaker 2:          22:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:23          And we can also use Brainly's lesion. Patient patients such as old Phineas gage, who had a naturally occurring legion in his orbital frontal cortex while working on a railroad and after this lesion was found to have profound changes in his behavior. So he was an uninhibited, more aggressive and seem to just be less emotionally regulated than he was before. And you can also look at areas of damage as well as um, areas of disease as well. So we've briefly touched on subjective, behavioral and physiological ways to measure emotion as an introduction into the emotion response system. So now turn to our takeaway questions.

Speaker 2:          23:04          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          23:04          So the first takeaway question really just has you recap what were the three types of subjective emotion measures discussed today. The second asks, what are the two major behavioral coding systems of emotion, really prominent tools in the field that were discussed in this lecture. And finally, how can the physiological body, both in the autonomic or peripheral nervous system as well as the central nervous system actually be a potential way to reflect our inner emotional life. And with that, I will now segue to our expert interview. This is part of our experts in emotion interview series where we're going to be exploring questions about emotion through the eyes of some of the most distinguished scholars in the field. So today we'll be speaking with doctor iris smells on emotion measurement. So doctor mouse received her phd from Stanford University and is currently an assistant professor of psychology at UC Berkeley where she directs the emotion and emotion regulation laboratory. Dr. Miles is an expert in the nature of emotion and emotion regulation. And her work has forged exciting new paths and measuring emotion response, examining coherence between different components of emotion, looking at the measurement and elicitation of anger, and more recently the pursuit of happiness and how it relates to our mental health and wellbeing. So I now turn to an incredibly special experts and emotion interview with Doctor Iris Mouse on emotion measurement.
