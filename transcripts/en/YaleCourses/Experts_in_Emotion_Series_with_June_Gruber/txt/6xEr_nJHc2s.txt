Speaker 1:          00:01          Welcome back to human emotion. So these three familiar faces that you've seen at the beginning of every lecture, perhaps they're from different backgrounds and if so, would we expect them to actually show or experience differences in emotion as well? So in this lecture, what we're going to discuss today is to what extent emotions are indeed shaped and tune by culture and different backgrounds. So how is it possible that we could show differences in emotion based on our cultural background? In other words, our emotions actually culturally shaped. This is the question we want to grapple with today. Is it that, you know, in some ways we may have overestimated how hardwired or sort of how biologically, you know, uh, strengthen these emotions are, have we underestimated the role that our actual life experience and cultural contexts can play in shaping who we are as an emotional being?

Speaker 1:          01:02          So today what I want to do is sort of delve inside with you to get a sense of what is culture and in what ways to date. We know that culture does indeed plays a role in influencing our emotional life. So we're going to do this by going through the following roadmap. First introduced to some terminology relevant to the field of culture and emotion. Next we'll go through some key examples that demonstrate, uh, the ways in which culture indeed does influence our emotional lives. We'll conclude with this question of nature or nurture. We had started with talking about sort of evolutionary and more biological origins of emotion. And today we're going to be talking about evidence suggesting that maybe context, cultural context, social influences may also influence the way we experience and express emotions. So our emotions, more a product of our nature, inherent nature or more a product of nurture or environment.

Speaker 1:          01:59          And we'll conclude with takeaway questions and an expert interview today with Dr Jeannie Psi. So let's start with some basic terminology. I think what we really need to start with first is the question of exactly, well what is culture here? When we think about what is culture, there's a definition that is common across different fields, defining culture as human phenomena that cannot be easily explained by or attributable to genetics or biology. So some examples of what culture is or sort of what is the scope of over which culture, uh, presides include some examples here. So culture includes systems of meaning to interpret the world as well as concepts that are transmitted through social participation. So examples include language, um, sort of social customs. These are sort of the, you know, fabric of what makes up culture. So when we think about exactly how culture shapes emotion, there are two different perspectives that scientists have when they think about this question.

Speaker 1:          03:10          One of them on the left is what we talked about previously. You might remember this evolutionary perspective to emotion that suggested that emotions are biologically rooted part of our evolutionary history. They serve specific functions and their universal across cultures and other words, meaning there should be no cross cultural variation that emotions are really part of our biological and evolutionary history. So that's a first perspective we covered. The second we're going to talk more in detail about today that we touched on previously is this idea of social constructivism also called cultural relativism. Here, it takes a much stronger stance, really suggesting that culture plays a tremendous role in shaping and creating our emotions. So again, emotions here as you can see on the right and purple are constructed by cultural values, institution and language biology, both the brain and are sort of autonomic nervous system. Our thoughts to play, little to no role in emotions whatsoever.

Speaker 1:          04:12          And in fact emotions are these open systems and they can be constructed in many different ways. So this takes a really strong stance. In fact saying that culture, you know, not only influences our emotions but can even create certain emotions for us. So what do we know then about the role of culture in shaping emotion? Sort of what is the evidence to date? So this is going to take us to our second stop here on the roadmap where we're going to talk about what do we know about cultural influences on emotion? Exactly how can it shape our emotion? How can it create emotions? How does it modify the kinds of triggers that would elicit emotions and different people? So let's turn here now to the evidence to date. Looking at cultural influences on emotion. So I'll start with the first example to answer this question of how exactly does culture shape emotions.

Speaker 1:          05:14          So one example here is that culture suggest what are the appropriate solicitors also refer to the antecedent conditions for an emotion. So what I mean by this is the following. So although most of us, for example, can think of snakes that elicit fear and everyone across cultures, we also see specific types of illicit hers that are unique to different cultures. So for example, you can see here that work that's looked at frequent antecedents of uh, emotion across different cultures. Find thing, finds things like in us culture. Um, we see that relationships are highly valued. And so things that elicit joy within the US include relationships, bonds with our partners, bonds with families, with children. So that seems to be a really common elicit or for what would elicit joy or happiness. Now, what if we look at different cultural context? Do they have, you know, the same types of antecedents, oral listeners of joy and happiness?

Speaker 1:          06:17          Like what most frequently elicit these kinds of emotions in different cultural contexts? Interestingly, we know that Israel values achievement. So if you ask people the commonly report what makes them feel happiness or joy, they're more likely to give you examples of times in which they accomplished something of value or achieved or one something that signaled their own sense of accomplishment. By contrast, if we look at the up to Eskimos, they report something quite different. Um, they report, um, frequent antecedents are elixirs of joy, which include chasing lemmings as you can see here on the bottom. So what we're seeing here is that the frequency of the kinds of antecedents or elixirs of joy can have a lot of cultural influence varying widely from, you know, the u s to Israeli cultures to these, um, [inaudible] Indian or sorry, at Ku, Eskimo cultures as well.

Speaker 1:          07:16          A second example here of how culture, shapes and motion. So we also know that culture is shaped the appraisals of emotion. So here you can ask a couple of really important questions. So do the same appraisals lead to the same emotions across cultures? In other words, does threat always lead to fear? And do people appraise situations similarly, uh, across cultures? So, in other words, does threat mean the same thing to all people even if they come from different cultural backgrounds? So, um, I'm just briefly refreshing our memory here of a, in our theories of emotion timeline from the very beginning of the course where we talked about these cognitive theories of emotion. And the reason that I'm bringing this up again is this is really this sort of foundation upon which we know that appraisals, uh, play a really important role in giving rise to emotions.

Speaker 1:          08:11          So it's the appraisals of a situation that give them meaning in the first place that then would lead to the sort of, you know, heart rate acceleration and experience of emotion fear. Here's you can see in this example. So this is just to underscore that the idea of appraisals giving rise to emotions has been ingrained in our conceptions of emotion since Lazarus first brought up his cognitive theory of emotion. But now it's until recently that we're starting to look at whether or not these appraisals can actually differ across culturally. So one example, as you can see here is an example using a group of fish. Okay. So you see this group of fish. And if you were asked the question, what do you think the fish right here on the front, what is he feeling? So Americans who were asked this question of what does the fish in the front feel are more likely to say that the fish is angry and that he's leaving the rest of the fish because he wants to get away from the group.

Speaker 1:          09:13          And people think that this might be because in the u s we really focus on these individualistic values, ways in which we are different from the group. And so in this way, what you're seeing is this fish in the front, he must be different in the group in some way. And the emotion often attributed to explain that more individualistic focuses. Well the fish just feeling angry. Okay. If you were to ask people however from a more Chinese backgrounds and ask them, okay, well what do you think the fish in the front is feeling? They're more likely to say that the fish and the front is feeling sad. Um, and in fact, he may feel lonely and rejected from the rest of the group. And this is thought to be explained by a different set of cultural values that instead of focusing on more individualistic values like Americans, um, there's, uh, increasing emphasis instead on collectivistic values of wanting to be part of a group, um, having your identity as part of a bigger collective whole.

Speaker 1:          10:10          And so when you're separated from the group, that's actually something that feels quite negative or aversive and you're feeling sad as opposed to feeling angry because you really want to get away and you want to be different. You want to lead the group and not be sort of stuck and being part of that pack. So this is some interesting work suggesting that the way that cultures appraise different situations, um, is really quite different depending on their own set of cultural values. Here's an example of individualistic versus collectivistic culture or values that influence the motions that we attribute to different scenarios. So another way in which we can illustrate this principle is through an example that I, that I've really enjoyed here. Um, that was given to me by a colleague of Mine, David Pizarro at Cornell. So imagine that you go to a friend's house and you're told to help yourself to the refrigerator.

Speaker 1:          11:06          How might you view this? So research has found that Americans view this situation in the following way. So they view this situation as something where they would feel pleasant. Wow, I feel at home. You know, I can just help myself to whatever's in the fridge. They also report feelings of fairness, um, that they really feel that this act is an act of courtesy and generosity and also feeling, um, report, uh, feelings of happiness because wow, now they have the opportunity to really just eat whatever they want in that fridge. However, you see a really different set of emotions, uh, in response to the situation when you look at a different cultural context. So here, um, we know that Americans are, would report feeling happy in this context, but in another culture such as Japan, this situation is actually appraised very differently. So instead of seeing feelings of pleasantness, fairness and happiness arrives from the situation, you see more frequent reports.

Speaker 1:          12:10          A feeling unpleasant, um, which is thought to be because the host is refusing to take care of you. They're sort of leaving you on your own to figure out what to do with the contents of food in their refrigerator. You may feel that this is unfair. So do you deserve this kind of rudeness where someone just leaves you to help yourself to find what you need in the refrigerator? And this may actually lead instead of feelings to happiness, feelings of anger, you just can't believe that they would just sort of not say anything or guide you or be a good house and just leave you to sort of sort out for yourself what is that you're supposed to eat. So what's interesting about this example is simply from looking at a fridge and someone telling you to help yourself, is that it can give rise to a completely different cascade of emotions here in this example, depending on if you're from an American background or Japanese background.

Speaker 1:          13:01          So what I think is really interesting here is that we see appraisals, um, not only differences in the kinds of appraisals people may have, but in the emotions that can follow from these different appraisals. So in how the situations themselves are appraised differently and how this leads on the one hand to feelings of happiness in one cultural context. And in another cultural context like we talked about to feelings of anger, um, and appraising the person was very rude. And this is just from a simple fridge example. So what's a third way that we know that culture can shape emotion? Well, here, and I find some of this to be the most interesting research is that culture actually shapes the way that we express our emotions through what's called display rules. So cultural display rules are defined as when and how one is appropriately allowed to express certain emotions.

Speaker 1:          13:58          They're sort of the rules that govern how we sort of transmit emotions in our face or in our nonverbal behavior. So a display rule to define it in more detail are the cultural rules that dictate how emotions should be expressed and when and where their expression is appropriate. And there was one study that was done here by freezing that really tried to tease apart different display rules according to different cultural and societal context. So often a society's display rules require people to give evidence of certain emotions that they may not actually feel or to disguise their true feelings in context where they should or ought not to show them. So this is an example that was done in a study by freezing in 1972. Um, we had two of people, again, they were American participants or Japanese participants. Um, in this study they were asked to view a movie depicting a surgical procedure.

Speaker 1:          15:01          And as you can see here, they viewed it either with an experimenter in the room or alone. And what we see here is that the Japanese participants, when they were with the experiment or watching this really gruesome, really awful surgical movie, showed little emotional expressively. They were in fact what was thought of as stone faced. So they suppressed a lot of their emotions when they were around. Another person. By contrast, when they were alone, they actually showed, you know, the, the typical kind of expressive displays of emotion, right? So they showed disgust and things of that. Like by contrast, when we looked at the American participants, they displayed an emotional reaction when, when, when they're with the experimenter and they displayed a similar emotional reaction when they were alone watching the surgical video. And in fact, if you look just at the column to the right here alone, the Japanese and American participants did not differ in their emotional expressive, the, when they were alone, they only differed when they were in the context of the experiment or suggesting that some of the display rules in Japanese cultures may be to sort of suppress or inhibit certain kinds of negative emotional expressions when you're in the context of another person.

Speaker 1:          16:16          Whereas the American participants did not have those same types of cultural display rules that they were feeling, uh, you know, appropriate to display whatever emotional reactions they were feeling in response to watching this video. So it's interesting here is that you see that certain display rules really suggest that in certain social contexts that may not be appropriate to express emotions. And another context it is.

Speaker 1:          16:42          So this graph is interesting too. Um, and that it's giving other types of examples that display rules as to how frequently one should be expressing emotions dramatically differs across the world. So what you see here is a lot of different countries here, um, depicted by these different purple circles. And on the left side you hear how much they endorse expressing emotions overall. And the point I want you to take away from this graph is that there's a lot of variability and the types of expressivity that people endorse and importantly that we just talked about consistent with the studies we've found is on the top right, you see the u s very, very high, right? So some of the display rules in the u s are that it's very appropriate and highly common to express emotions frequently and intensely. In fact, we're way here up at the top. And you can contrast this with other countries. Some of them that we've talked about, Japanese cultures are much less lower on their overall expressively endorsement. I'm down here, you have Hong Kong. And so you really see an interesting spread in terms of the overall degree to which different cultures display emotions at different intensities and different frequencies.

Speaker 1:          17:59          So example for how else can culture shape emotion? Well, we see here that culture can also give shape to the value that we place on experiencing emotions or the way in which we give it special premium or importance in our life. So this is an example that I always find really interesting and it is based on the work of Jeannie side at Stanford University who will speak with and our expert in emotion interview series. Uh, later today. She really put forth this concept of an effect of valuation or how much, um, personal value we place on experiencing different kinds of emotions, sort of what our, our, our emotional ideals or emotional standards. So we'll talk a bit more about her work just now an aspect of valuation. So some of you may have seen the movie or read the book where the wild things are. And if, so, you may remember a character who was named Carol and he was full of these mini kind of wild and unleashed emotions.

Speaker 1:          19:00          So on the left you can see this picture of Carol. Um, and what is a representation of what Jeannie Syrah refers to as actual aspect. So this is how Carol actually feels. Um, and so these are just the moment emotions in the moment that he feels a on a day to day basis. Now what's really important is to contrast this on the right with what's thought of as his ideal aspect. So this is the idea of how he would actually like to feel if he had his choice, what would be his ideal emotional self. And what's really interesting as well, actual effect on the left is thought to be shaped more by biological forces like temperament or genetics ideal. An effect on the right is instead thought to be shaped more by culture. So it includes like meaning thoughts, beliefs, values and practices that are promoted within a particular cultural context that shape the kinds of emotions one ought to feel or one should try to strive to feel.

Speaker 1:          20:04          And this, if you think about just how exactly culture exerts an influence on the sort of ideal aspect or an effect valuation, the emotions you value and want to feel, you can think of it this way. So there's a grid here which has been referred to as the effect of circumplex. And what you can see here is um, on one dimension we have negative to positive sort of left to right. So this is a valence dimension. And by contrast you can see on the top to bottom as a more sort of arousal or activation dimension. Okay. So this depicts a landscape of emotions that we talked about earlier in the course when we were thinking about two different perspectives to conceptualizing emotion and looking at sort of approaches. So it's something we've talked about here. How might we suspect culture would place a premium or on different kinds of emotions?

Speaker 1:          20:58          So when we think of more Western cultures like the US, what kind of emotions do we think that people ideally want to feel? What is their ideal aspect? So this is work done by Jeannie side that's found that western culture is commonly report. When you ask them what is the kind of emotion or affect you want to feel, they say they want to feel these high arousal, positive emotions, what she calls hap emotions. So these include things like feeling enthusiastic, elated and excited. This is where most of us want to go towards. Now this is in stark contrast with more eastern cultures by contrast, who report wanting to strive towards what's called these low arousal positive emotions or lap emotions so to speak. So they're gravitating more towards an ideal aspect of state, of feeling relaxed, calm and peaceful. So what's really interesting here is that we have different cultural values that are sort of pushing us in different directions, both towards feeling more positive emotion.

Speaker 1:          22:02          But on the one hand, one is very high and active and excited. Kind of this go getter attitude in a western culture and the other and eastern cultures is really more focused on obtaining serenity, equanimity and calmness. And so this is some of the work that Jeannie size really pioneered. And we'll speak with her more later today and the expert in motion, uh, interview series. So here, here's a fifth example of just how many ways we can see that culture is shaping emotion. So we see that culture also influences which emotions are emphasized or talked about within a given, uh, cultural groups. So in other words, which emotions are highly regarded, sort of what are the kinds of emotions that seem to capture our attention and that are represented in our everyday language here the distinction is often made between two things, hyper cognizant emotions and Hypo Cognizin emotions.

Speaker 1:          22:58          So as you can see here, hyper cognizant emotions are those that are highly emphasized in a culture. They become objects of discussion and they have this kind of elaborate cognitive structure usually seen within these rich vocabularies. We have a lot of words that sort of orbit around these emotions that we really highly emphasize in. And really seem to be almost sort of obsessed with in a way as a culture. By contrast, these hypo cognized emotions are relatively underemphasized within a given society and they have a really limited cognitive structure. So we see very few words that represent these emotions. So let me walk you through some examples of what are culturally distinct, hyper and Hypo cognitivist. So, um, hyper cognates, an emotion within Western cultures is love. We talk a lot about love, um, not only our own everyday love, but we have these romanticized kind of, you know, novels with these picture best images that are sort of burned in our minds and a lot of really trashy celebrity pop culture is also about love.

Speaker 1:          24:08          Who's together, who's breaking up, who cheated on who. Um, so we just talk a lot about this and we also have these notions of love at first sight. You know, this kind of love that turns your world upside down. Um, and we also talk a lot about other kinds of love. This kind of slow growing love that takes time, uh, is deep and strong and can happen with many people. We really seem to be obsessed with love in western cultures. Um, by contrast, um, when we think of what our hypo cognized emotions are, the to Haitians here, interestingly, the hypo and emotion for them, uh, is sadness. They have no linguistic concept of sadness. They tend to think of sadness more as a physical condition, then an emotional state. So you don't see it represented in a lot of, you know, images in their culture. You don't see it highly talked about, you don't see these kind of elaborate or ritualistic stories about sadness the way that Westerners do about love.

Speaker 1:          25:14          So we've talked about hyper and Hypo cognized emotions and who I want to conclude with the sixth example or way in which culture may shape emotion. So we talked a little bit about the kinds of emotions that are frequently spoken about love and sadness. Um, but culture not only influences which kinds of emotions get attention, but it also shapes our very language of emotion. So let me explain what I mean here. So we know, for example, that there's culture specific emotion words. So, for example, in Japan they have this particular word, a my, that refers to this indulgent feeling of dependency sort of akin to what a child might feel for its mother. And these are feelings of dependency that are highly valued within this cultural contexts. Um, that's a very sort of interdependent and collectivistic. So this is a word that you see in Japanese cultures that we just don't have in westernized cultures that are not as interested in or sort of whose values aren't sort of orbiting around depending on and being intertwined with others.

Speaker 1:          26:19          Instead, we have this more autonomous or individualistic culture. So these are specific emotion words that are highly emphasizing and created by the cultural contexts. Um, another example is shot in Freud, uh, from Germany. Some of you may be familiar with this and at the idea of sort of experiencing pleasure at another person's expense. We don't have a word for this exactly in our own culture. Um, this is something that's really generated by, uh, you know, German culture specifically. Though we may be familiar with it and understand it, we don't have a specific word for it per se. And then there's this other interesting emotion and the Czech Republic, um, which is emotion, the tossed. And this is an emotion that is defined as torment caused by the sudden insight into one's own miserable self. So I don't know if you can think of a word like this, uh, in your own sort of English vocabulary.

Speaker 1:          27:19          But this is thought to be a unique type of emotional experience, again, influenced by one particular culture. So the overarching point here is that culture not only shapes the kinds of emotions we value the kinds of emotions we place a high premium on the kinds of appraisals or meanings we give emotional situations. But it can even influence the very nature of the language and the words that we're using to express emotions such that different cultures in fact have different emotional words. And you may argue though it's controversial for some, but they may actually have very different emotional lives altogether given that they think about emotions, they talk about emotions differently, and they even have distinct types of emotional words that some cultures don't have. So I want to talk a little now about this idea of culture specific absences. So James Russell did this very interesting study where he reviewed ethnography is describing everyday lives and other cultures.

Speaker 1:          28:21          And here he found that some cultures simply have no words for certain emotions. Um, so he talked about this in terms of culture specific absences of certain emotion words. So you can see a few examples here that I've highlighted. For example, it seems that there may be no sort of words for disgust in Polish cultures. We talked a little bit about the Hypo Cognos emotions of sadness into Haitian cultures, but they also don't have specific words for feelings of guilt as well. What's interesting that I find here is that, uh, in Tibetan culture is there's actually no particular word that designates or kind of picks out this concept of even emotion. So what this course that you're taking is about that focuses on human emotion. They don't even have a word to describe that specifically or pick that out. Um, and finally you can see that a Indonesian cultures don't really have words for embarrassment.

Speaker 1:          29:21          Something we'll talk about later on in the course. So not only are there certain specific unique emotion words that, uh, occur in certain cultures, but there's also an absence of other emotion words, um, and different cultures. So we really see a lot of variation in the language of emotion and our ideas of which emotions exist and occur and that we talk about in our everyday experiences. So what's really important here though, we've talked a lot about language and how language can shape, um, the kinds of emotions we talk about on a frequent basis. How language can shape which emotion words we have in the first place, and how language can also shape the absence of certain emotion words in our everyday dialect. But what's really important here is to make sure that you understand that language is separate from the actual subjective experience of emotion.

Speaker 1:          30:19          So we don't want to make the inference that language is the same thing as emotion experience. Um, so just to keep in mind here that language is not equal to experience, but what language does provide us some insight and is the way that people cognitively represent or sort of transmit their understanding or ideas of emotion experience. But we need to be careful not to assume then that certain cultures don't experience, you know, embarrassment for example, or sadness. It's just simply something that's not represented in their sort of current, uh, you know, dialect or way that they speak about emotion. So that's just an important caveat that you want to make sure to sort of keep in the background as you think about some of these findings that relate to the way that culture shapes emotional language. So now in our roadmap, I want to just conclude with this broad question of nature or nurture.

Speaker 1:          31:12          So we spend a lot of time in our earlier lectures talking at length about just how we are these evolutionary kind of or originated species that were built with hardwired emotions like fear, disgust, anger, sadness. You know, that these are really built to sort of deal with these recurrent evolutionary situations. You know, seeing a snake or seeing a disgusting substance that we need to have these emotions built in us to help us survive and help us reach our evolutionary goals. At the same time, we spent some time today to talking about how it's not quite that simple that we're not simply the product of our more biological or evolutionary past, that the particular culture we grow up in shapes the way we interpret situations. It could just be a body of fish swimming, do does the fish look angry or sad? It could be the words we use to represent emotion.

Speaker 1:          32:07          It also influences the kinds of emotions we want to feel or those that we place a high degree of value or premium on. So then how do we answer this question of emotion? Is it something that's more a product of nature or more product of nurture? And here what I wanted to picture with these circles is that bottom line, no surprise to most of you. I don't think we can pick either nature or nurture, right? Emotions are multifaceted and they have multiple causes. These causes can include evolution, biology, individual development, situational factors, one's own temperament or personality as well as culture, which we talked a bit about today. And what we need to think about carefully is how these different sort of, uh, causes of emotion overlap and intersect to sort of give rise to the unique emotions that we all feel, that sort of makeup who we are. Um, and sort of tease apart the different contributions that each of these puzzle pieces I think of, uh, you know, sort of fit and how they put together to make up each individual person. So it's neither a nature or nurture. And now I want to conclude with our takeaway questions. So for this brief module today on culture and emotion,

Speaker 2:          33:31          okay,

Speaker 1:          33:32          the first question that you should be able to answer and to kind of take home from what we've spoken about today is what is culture and what are, or were the two main competing perspectives of the role of culture on emotion that we discussed today?

Speaker 2:          33:47          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          33:48          Second, I'd like you to name and describe at least five though we talked about actually six different sources of cultural variation on emotion. So what are some of the examples and empirical data that suggest that there is an important role that culture plays in shaping our emotional experience, expression and language for emotion.

Speaker 2:          34:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:12          And finally,

Speaker 2:          34:14          yeah,

Speaker 1:          34:15          what are hyper cognizant and Hypo cognized emotions. So you should be able to define what each of these two are and you should be able to give an illustrative examples, uh, to sort of tease apart what these two different categories of emotions are. And now I want to conclude with our expert interview. And again, this is part of our broader experts and emotion interview series.
