Speaker 1:          00:00          Today for our experts in emotion interview. We'll be speaking with doctor Steven pinker on violence and emotion. Dr Pinker's, an experimental psychologist. I'm one of the world's foremost writers on language mine and human nature. He's currently a Harvard College professor and Johnstone family professor of psychology as well at Harvard University. His research on visual cognition and the psychology of language has won prizes from the National Academy of Sciences, the world institution of Great Britain, the cognitive neuroscience society and the American Psychological Association. Dr Pinker has also received seven honorary doctorates, several teaching awards at Mit and Harvard and numerous prizes for his books. The language instinct, how the mind works, and the blank slate. He's chair of the usage panel of the American heritage dictionary and often writes for the New York Times time and the new republic. He's been named humanist of the year prospects magazines, the world's top 100 public intellectuals, foreign policies, 100 global thinkers and time magazines, the 100 most influential people in the world today. So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview together with Dr Steven Pinker. So thanks for speaking with us today, Steve. It's great to have you here. Okay, good. What I'd like to do is just start out by asking you a little bit about what got you interested in the topic of violence and emotions, sort of where did it begin for you?

Speaker 2:          01:20          Well, I'm as a psychologist, I'd be interested in human nature and what makes people tick. And it's a hard problem to avoid because one of the questions that people naturally ask about human nature is, are we naturally violent or are we naturally peaceful and cooperative? And I think the answer to the to that question is both in neither, but a, it's not a question you could avoid if you're interested in big questions about what makes us what we are.

Speaker 1:          01:45          And speaking of that, I'd love to ask you some questions about just what makes us, what we are by asking you a bit about your work on this topic, looking at violence. So you've recently published a book, the better angels of our nature. And in this you powerfully demonstrate a somewhat counterintuitive but remarkable decline in violence in human society over time. And I wonder if you could just provide us with a little bit more about this really fascinating, but again, somewhat surprising finding for many.

Speaker 2:          02:13          Yes. It's one of the reasons it's surprising is we get our sense of the world from the news. And the news is about stuff that happens. It's not about stuff that doesn't happen. And since rates of violence haven't gone down to zero, there are always enough violent incidents to fill the evening news. They're the three things that blow up people who get shot. And because of the availability heuristic, namely that we estimate risk according to how easily we can recall vivid examples, our sense of how dangerous the world is is out of whack with the actual statistics. So this is an argument that depends a lot on statistics. Uh, for example, rates of a death in tribal warfare among a hunter gatherer and hunter horticulturalist societies who live, uh, without the rule of law firm, the state control have rates of death and warfare that are far higher than those, even in our worst, worse.

Speaker 2:          03:07          So that's something about the transition from a kind of tribal living. The characterized a lot of our evolutionary history to modern society brought rates of violence down. Another decline occurred since the Middle Ages, uh, were, uh, homicide statistics suggest that a contemporary European has about one 35th. The chance of being murdered, Gerd as his medieval ancestors. A third change was in institutionalized a barbaric violent practices like a torture executions burning somewhat at the stake or disemboweling them, uh, alive. Uh, the use of capital punishment for our trivial crimes like poaching and counterfeiting and bad robbing a store I, the institution of slavery, the institution of debtor's prisons throwing someone in jail because they couldn't pay back a debt. Those were all abolished in a span of about 50 years to the second half of the 18th century. Then more recently since the end of World War Two, uh, big powerful countries have stopped waging war against each other.

Speaker 2:          04:12          Germany and France, uh, we know aren't going to go to war and Russia and Poland. Uh, and that's very unusual in human history in which states and empires were almost constantly at each other's throats. Uh, more subtly in the 20 years since the fall of the Soviet Empire. It hasn't just been big, powerful developed countries that have stopped waging war on each other, but more and more the rest of the world has stopped fighting civil wars and the, and, and rebel conflicts, rates of death across the world and all forms of war have seen a bumpy trajectory, but a downward trajectory. Then finally, the, the various rights revolution, civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, children's rights, animal rights have all whittled down various categories of violence that used to be with us for a, for Millennia. Uh, domestic violence, bullying, child abuse, a lynching, pogroms, um, uh, animals in blood sports, gay bashing, criminalization of homosexuality. All of these are gifts of the various rights revolutions of the last 50 or 60 years. So those are the, those are the empirical phenomena that I sat out in the book.

Speaker 1:          05:27          So these are really interesting empirical phenomena you're documenting and people may wonder, well, why is violence declining and what role could emotion play in this phenomena? You know, are we becoming a more prosocial, you know, type of society experiencing? And greater prevalence or you know, uh, uh, intensity of emotions like empathy and compassion. So does emotion play a role in this decline in human violence? You think?

Speaker 2:          05:53          It absolutely does. Um, for one thing, many categories of violence are, are, are emotional in the sense that they are not just, uh, a, a calculated predatory via Ellen. Swear. We want something, someone's in our way. We get rid of them. I mean that that is a big category of violence and that you could consider just purely cognitive or rational. But, um, are there many other forms of violence? Kind of what we think of a senseless violence, which is really driven by the passions to men fight over a parking space and one of them pulls out a knife and you've got a body and a pool of blood. A Nation feels that it is, suffered a historic injustice and conquers, uh, tries to conquer a few, uh, rocky islands or more patches of barren land, but you can't grow anything on, but it just a match matter of national pride.

Speaker 2:          06:43          Or you have a sadism where a serial killers or sometimes entire societies bring up the kids to wash a prisoner. Uh, Claude with iron hooks are broken on the wheel. None of these are particularly rational in the sense of getting what you want. So they were driven by emotions. Then on the other side, there are some kinds of violence reduction that are purely cognitive. We people figure out violence is a bad thing. Let's see if we could figure out some way of reducing it. But some of them are also emotional. We feel greater empathy toward a larger, uh, category of living things. So rather than just feeling bad about our kids and cute little baby animals and our best friends, uh, we care more about strangers. We find it less, um, fun to see them. Disemboweled. Uh, we find it painful in fact to see them in pain. A self control, I don't know whether you want to call that an emotion or a, a a, it certainly attracts with the emotions. It, it suppresses behavior that is often triggered by the emotions. And there a good argument that, uh, exercising our capacity for self control is one of the ways that we reduce violence. Somebody assaults you, you may be mad as hell. Well you may want to pull out a knife but you count to 10 think the better of it walk away and soft control triumphs over emotion.

Speaker 1:          08:10          So it's really interesting and I mean this begs the question of how we can continue to foster these better angels and sort of work towards promoting, you know, ultimately the a violence free society in many ways. What recommendations would you have to continue pushing this trend towards decreasing violence and perhaps greater empathy and compassion?

Speaker 2:          08:31          Uh, I think that a greater empathy and compassion are, are good things up. I don't think they are enough, uh, because I, I kind of doubt that you could really get a person to empathize with all 7 billion people on earth. I mean, no one has the emotional energy. You get compassion fatigue and it better not depend on, on that. Uh, also there cases where empathy is not such a good thing. Um, when, when we talk about corruption in the developing world, what we're kind of talking about is empathy in domains where it shouldn't apply. Like you give a job to your a knucklehead brother-in-law because you feel bad for him, uh, or your or your best friend. You pay your best friend out of a sense of gratitude. We call that cronyism and nepotism. It is driven by empathy as opposed to say, giving a job to a perfect stranger.

Speaker 2:          09:19          How cold hearted is that? But of course it is what you do if you follow the rule of law, which will ultimately make everyone less violent than if it's one, a clan of blood relatives fighting for the perquisites of power against another, each one empathizing plenty within their own own clan. So it's not to knock empathy, but it isn't enough. You also need rule of law. I think you need a, a, a government that will penalize aggression, that will not only make individuals, I think the better of committing aggression, but it calms them down because if they know that their enemies are penalized by the government, they don't have to develop a belligerent, macho, bad-ass stance to a credibly assert deterrence. So good institutions, rule of law, a democratic society with a civil liberties, but an effective police force and bad judicial system. Uh, certainly anything that expands empathy such as cosmopolitan experiences, you travel, you read the words of others, you're made aware of what life is like in, at different times and places and among people who are unlike yourself.

Speaker 2:          10:30          Also just the, the spread of, of reason, knowledge of history, knowledge of, uh, what kind of violence reduction measures have worked in the past, the setting aside of violence as a, a problem to be solved rather than as always a contest, uh, that, that you have to win. And finally taking advantage of our sense of trade exchange fairness. The idea that you can do business with people, uh, in an evolutionary psychologist would call it reciprocal altruism. When you trade favors with people, you're bound to them. Uh, they're more valuable to you alive than dead. You have ways of getting what you want other than through via woods need me by exchanging it for something that they want. So the cultivation of networks of reciprocity I think has been another historical development that has reduced rates of violence.

Speaker 1:          11:22          So I think those are really all important suggestions for thinking about how we can continue to foster a society where we see violence on the decline. And so I wonder, although empathy may not play, you know, the major role here, when we think about what role can, you know the study and understanding of emotion play as we look forward into the future, where do you see the most important next steps here?

Speaker 2:          11:46          Well, certainly expanding some of the things that have worked in our society to other that are, uh, have some catching up to do, particularly when it comes to the rights of women and gay people and, uh, children. Um, so the, the idea that you don't throw pink gay people in jail, let alone execute them. Uh, we kind of, we kind of won that battle that's not no longer alive issued here, but it is a live issue in a lot of it large part of the world. The idea that, uh, you don't try to settle scores of national humiliation that uh, our country, our, our race, our religion has been humbled in the past. We have to get our revenge. And again, getting people away from that tribal group against group mindset toward a more individual, a human rights mindset. I mean, we wouldn't really counts are men, women and children and their happiness groups are kind of abstraction to concentrate. And this relates back to your, your, your emphasis on empathy to think of the individual, the actual thing that feels pleasure and pain as opposed to the abstraction of the group is one of the big developments that we've enjoyed in the west and that the, um, uh, the rest of the world could profit from a longterm.

Speaker 1:          13:06          So when we think then looking ahead with some of the suggestions that you offered and especially the students who may be the next generation of conducting these kinds of studies or investigating these areas of inquiry, what advice would you give to future students who are thinking about embarking on a study of emotion as it relates to violence or just trying to understand violence more generally?

Speaker 2:          13:26          Certainly to uh, appreciate, uh, both the dark side and the bright side of human nature. I think a lot of psychology has tried to paint a, a, uh, kind of Sunday school, Pete Picture of human beings as naturally peaceable and cooperative. And while I, uh, I wrote a book about how we do have that side, we wouldn't need that side if we also didn't have a lot of really nasty, ugly motives. And I don't think psychologists should avert their gaze from the dark side of human nature. We can only, we can only hope to control it if we understand that the other is to take a, an evidence based approach to violence. It's often a topic of moralization. We all deplore violence, but how much do we understand about what in fact actually increases or decreases it? There I came across a lot of cockamamie ideas that are why we held, but for which there's no evidence and some things that are not so obvious that turned out to be big producers of violence. So we should have an open minded empirical evidence based mindset to understanding violence.

Speaker 1:          14:28          Well, thank you so much for joining us again today. Steve. It's a pleasure to speak with you.

Speaker 2:          14:33          My pleasure. Thanks for having me on June,

Speaker 1:          14:35          and this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Doctor Steven Pinker from Harvard University. Thank you again.
