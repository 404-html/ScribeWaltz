Speaker 1:          00:01          For our experts and emotion interview. We will be speaking with Doctor Nancy Isenberg on emotion regulation in children. Dr Eisenberg is a regents professor of psychology at Arizona State University. Her research interests pertained to social, emotional and moral development and her books include the caring child, the roots of pro social behavior in children and how children develop. Dr Eisenberg has been editor of psychological bulletin and child development perspectives and has received career contribution awards from the American psychological association, the association for Psychological Science and the International Society for research on behavioral development. I now turn to our experts in emotion interview with Doctor Nancy Isenberg on emotion regulation in children. So welcome Nancy. Thank you for speaking with us today. Thank you Jen. What I thought might be a nice way to start off our conversation is to ask you a little bit about what first got you interested in emotion.

Speaker 2:          00:57          Um, well, I was still studying mall development and um, back when I started there wasn't really a field of emotion. Um, I was studying a moral reasoning and empathy and um, assessing empathy back then. People did it with, uh, people's, particularly children's self reports to stories. And make a long story short, we found that wasn't working very well with children. And so we just started to, um, try to use a nonverbal measures like physiological measures. So I had to start reading the physiological literature because I was trying to get it empathic arousal, um, and uh, you skin conductance, heart rate to get it arouse on children. And that takes you into the emotion literature. Also to our work, we found that there were some kids who, uh, were more empathic and they were also seem to be more socially competent in general while the kids who wha, um, bless socially competent, we're more prone to what we call personal distress, which is the tendency to experience, um, averse of emotions when fund it with someone else's negative emotion. And so I started thinking about why this might be, and it led me into thinking about the ability to regulate emotion successful and how that may play out and children's social behavior. And so I had to start thinking about individual differences and emotionality and also the ability to modulite that emotionality. So it's really coming from the empathy literature that led me at first a unbenounced to myself really into the emotion literature.

Speaker 1:          02:59          So I wanted to then ask you a few questions about your research that's been just so influential in this domain. So I mean, you're widely known for, you know, your pioneering work in a study of developmental processes that have been vital for healthy social and emotional responding and children. And I wonder from your perspective, what you see as some of the most critical discoveries in your work on emotion regulation and children.

Speaker 2:          03:25          Um, uh, so I'm not going to have to do with empathy, but I think we're going to talk about that a little bit. Uh, so wait on that. Um, uh, we tried to differentiate between emotion related regulatory processes that were more applicable. Um, coming out of the temperament literature, there's a discussion of these kinds of FFO control processes and also processes that affect behavior. But seeing the be a little less voluntary, how do to regulate what we call reactive control, like the child who's impulsive and always approaching, but has trouble inhibiting that word child who seems to be very regulated, maybe because they don't, the sitting still, they're not getting into trouble, but the actually overly inhibited and having difficulty approaching new situations, dealing with new people. So I'm what people call behavioral inhibition. So we've been interested in these more processes. The kid can easily manage, like make themselves where you're like, stop a behavior and make themselves activated behavior even when they don't want to voluntarily shift and focus attention when they have to versus these other kinds of behaviors like impulsivity and behavioral inhibition where they, the child seems to have less control, but it does effect in a sense regulate their behavior and outcomes for them.

Speaker 2:          05:08          And we showed that actually more recently about statistically we can really differentiate these two kinds of processes, but also they provide unique prediction of psychopathology and a symptoms, uh, you know, externalizing problems, particularly to some degree internalizing problems like social withdrawal and anxiety, uh, but also social competence. Um, uh, and uh, empathy and prosocial behavior, other kinds of aspects of social competence. So that's one important thing. Um, actually when we started doing the work in the early nineties, there wasn't really much good research will be a little, but there wasn't much good research. They used measures that assessed something really close to regulation rather than a general kind of doing good at everything. Um, so the early measures off and threw together emotionality and regulation or regulation and social competence. And so we tried to sort out and get clean or measures and we had longitudinal data and the nine days and then thereafter.

Speaker 2:          06:27          So we were one of the early people to document how important these early individual differences in regulatory, these voluntary voluntary regulatory processes work for predicting outcomes for kids later. Um, for instance, in our first study we had teachers and parents just reporting on kids' ability to focus and shift attention. And we found that it not only related to kids ability to manage anger at that age, their popularity, the social competence more broadly, but it predicted two, four and six years later into the school setting problem behaviors at home. So we were surprised how powerful predictor just these ratings were from teachers and preschool and that really got us interested in following, um, the kids and longer and looking at emotional regulation and more detail. But, um, yeah, so mapping out some of those pathways, uh, which a lot of people are doing now, but people weren't doing it as much then.

Speaker 2:          07:42          I was wondering if you could say a little bit more about what you see as particularly important about the role of adaptive and flexible autonomic responding when it comes to healthy emotion regulation processes and children as well. Uh, by, I dunno, I'm like, are you talking physiological? Yeah, exactly. Oh, um, well I guess, uh, um, I was thinking of more automatic, but, um, well I think, hmm. So be more like vago town, um, kids who can manage a, um, the Bagel system, which is seen, it's to do with heart rate and respiration. And it's seen as a system that affects kids. Um, physiological emotion regulation and uh, kids who have what we call high day or tone seem to be able to, um, they were more flexible system. They can suppress the system so that they, uh, arousal rises when need be in situations. Um, and it seems to affect the maybe be related to their ability to focus attention.

Speaker 2:          09:02          And so it's important that kids be able to change the attention and the arousal with the context. Um, for instance, focus in on something strong like shut out other, uh, aspects of the environment when they need to. Um, I'm not, I don't think we really know very well how that relates to though Ffo camp. It does correlate in some studies with these effortful control processes I've been talking about, but not that well. And so I don't think we know enough about how like the voluntary attention process processes and the ability to activate and regulate behaviors needed, we light to those autonomic systems because the literature is not that consistent.

Speaker 1:          09:59          It's an important direction for future years to really parse apart those nuances.

Speaker 2:          10:04          Yes. And it, I think it depends on context. I'm a student of mine, just a did a master's that's being published, assume that he found, for instance, Vagal tone was correlated with measures of FFO control behavioral measures of self regulation in a laboratories, a situation only for kids who were shy because for those kids that seem to be, they really had to bring me after four control to bear and that situation, um, to do well. And so for them the relationship was stronger than for kids that weren't shy. In this laboratory situation it might be very different and a non laboratory. Sure. So

Speaker 1:          10:53          that's really interesting work you're doing. Um, it makes me want to ask you also about another line of work that I think you alluded to earlier, which is the critical work that you've conducted on the study of children's capacity for empathy or the ability to try to really understand the emotions of others in their environment. And I wondered if you could describe what you see as the critical role of these empathy related behaviors and adaptive social behavior and adjustment.

Speaker 2:          11:19          Um, well one thing we tried to do and building on the work of Dan bats and he's a social psychologist was differentiate different empathy related responses. Um, people used to use the word empathy to refer to just about any emotional response to somebody else's emotion that wasn't totally off the wall and somewhat related to what the other person's feeling. Um, we differentiated empathy, which we call, we really make define that is feeling a highly similar emotion as the other person. And we differentiated that from sympathy, which is concern for the other person. So I can feel sadness when you sad, which would be empathy. But then if I feel concerned for you, that would be sympathy. And then Dan Batson talked about personal distress, which is when the emotions become so aversive that I'm folk, I like say you're sad and it makes me anxious and depressed or depressed or stressed and those emotions of us of, and I focus on myself.

Speaker 2:          12:38          So it's two arousing. I mean we can all think of times where somebody is telling us something that bad that happened to them and we can hardly bear listening because it's making us anxious. That would be personal distress. And that differentiation is very important because they relate to different behaviors. Um, it's the sympathy particularly and maybe sometimes empathy, but we think empathy often leads to sympathy. Um, that relates to helping others to being more socially competent, being sensitive and personal distress actually is associated with trying to avoid the other person that is evoking the emotion and us and also, um, is not related to a better social competence. Um, uh, I'm getting a cup of coffee. That's fine. I wonder if I could ask you about, I mean, this is just really fascinating and I wanted to ask you about just a third area of are with your work that looks at the relationship between, uh, parental emotional express 70 and the development of children's regulatory abilities and broader kind of social emotional functioning.

Speaker 2:          13:57          And I wondered if you could speak to what you see as the most central findings on this inner relationship between a parent and the emotional wellbeing and regulatory capacity of the child. Can I say one more thing about the last one thing I didn't mention is the lack of empathy and uh, you know, most kids do experience some empathy, but there's some kids that don't experience much and that's the really scary a situation. I think. I'm not experiencing empathy for others. It seems to be part of psychopathic kinds of tendencies where kids can be cruel and manipulative and so forth. So empathy sensitizes us and maybe often may inhibit aggression if we started feeling the other's distress when we start to do something bad to them, hit them, whatever. We're less likely to do those kinds of behaviors. So I think empathy can be an inhibitor of problematic behavior.

Speaker 2:          14:59          Interesting. Um, so on the parenting issue, Oh gosh, there's so much one could talk about depending on what outcome you're interested in. But if I had to pick, you know, a few most important things, uh, and kind of focus more in on the emotion side, but other than say aggression or other kinds of issues. Um, suddenly parents being supportive, uh, being supportive of the child's emotions, trying to talk about emotions, at least in this culture, I should say that some of these parenting behaviors may not be at work the same way in other cultures. Um, uh, being sensitive to the child wants and needs and feelings, expressing, um, uh, positive emotion with the child when dealing with the child when appropriate. Of course, uh, uh, not overly expressing hostile, negative emotions and the home and interactions with the child course said you have to at sometimes and it's part of everyday life.

Speaker 2:          16:15          But if the home atmosphere is more these hostile kinds of emotions and warm, supportive emotions, kids that's associated with a lot of negative outcomes for children. Um, and we guide to kind of learning to manage emotions and, uh, being well-regulated in regard to emotions. Probably also the, the issue of, um, discussing coaching children, discussing emotions, not avoiding, talking about dealing with emotions in a natural way, in everyday situations. Uh, you know, parents can ask the child why they feel a certain way. Talk to them about how that's natural. What can one do about it? Uh, how can you feel? What can you do to make yourself feel better? These kinds of behaviors seem to be very useful in helping kids learn to regulate their emotions. And in fact, in John Gottman's work, uh, going back has also been related to the Spago, uh, tone ability. Um, people call it our say, by the way, but, um, it's, uh, the mother, the parents who were high and met her emotion, able to accept the emotion, talk about emotion, deal with that, had kids that had better vagal tone. Um, so it's all interconnected there. Uh, so would be important. But you know, parenting, there's lots of aspects that are important and including reasonable wool setting, high expectations, not accessibly high, that it's impossible, but depending on the outcome, um, the parent wants also modeling, I mean modeling empathy, I mean who knows what genetics comes in here. But parents that are more sympathetic have kids that are more sympathetic, you know, parents that are more prosocial of kids that are more prosocial part of there may be genetically transmitted but prob probably part of its modeling.

Speaker 1:          18:29          What implications do you think these signings might have for trying to develop, you know, emotion focused interventions for children? You know,

Speaker 2:          18:40          um, well people are already doing, um, sometimes without calling that the paths curriculum of Mike Greenberg friends sense is designed to deal with problem behaviors. Uh, primarily. But what they do is teach kids about their own and other's emotions had identify them, uh, what they are, how to, um, differentiate emotions. What do you do about emotions? Uh, um, what are strategies one can use when you're angry? For instance, of another child? Uh, they teach themselves regulatory techniques like, um, they have a picture of a stoplight on a wall and you know, talk about, look at the light, stop, think before you do something when you're upset. So I actually, a number of the interventions out there involve teaching about emotion, emotion regulation and they do have some effects, particularly for the kids that have the most problems. Um, there's not so many with parenting and it seems to me that that's an area that is really ripe for more research helping there. I Susan Landry, he's done some work that teachers, parents kind of best practices of socialization, the kind of thing I was just talking about, being supportive, uh, sensitive, using appropriate discipline and kids have a number of good outcomes that seem to, if you seem to reflect a better regulation. Um, but there's very little work where parents are taught how to coach children about emotions, teach them strategies, how to talk effectively about emotions, um, these kinds of strategies. So I think that's an area that could be developed a lot more.

Speaker 1:          20:36          So as you think about where the future of this field is headed and in what areas could be developed more, what would you say as you look forward, where, where are the most important discovery is going to be going to be and you're in your eyes?

Speaker 2:          20:48          Well, in the prevention areas we were just talking about this a lot to be done. Um, I think one could use a lot of this information more than we currently are, particularly outside. We're doing a better job in the schools then outside of the schools. But you know, if the schools are teaching children about emotions and emotion regulation, but they have a terrible environment at home, it probably helps some, but we could do a lot more, probably we could get the parents to compliment the school intervention and some people are trying to do that. But to a very limited degree, um, obviously the work in the biological areas is important than, uh, uh, no psych and so forth where they're trying to map some of the circuits to do with emotion, emotion regulation. How do these all connect? Um, how do we make decisions then, um, this is going to be very important and, and I think it's going to dominate the field actually.

Speaker 2:          21:54          I'm thinking it's extremely important, but I also think it's really important. We don't lose sight of behavior and the environment, um, those inputs, uh, genetics is getting very important. People looking at a genetic differences related to emotion, emotion regulation. But we will need to look at how these interact with the environment, the home environment, the school environment too, because that seems to affect how the genes play out, the genetic tendencies. Um, and, uh, I think this work is really the wave of the future, but I'm a little concerned that the environment and, um, other aspects are going to get lost in the rush to find totally mostly biological solutions and, uh, answers to the questions. So then what advice do you have for future students who are thinking about embarking in this area? What might you tell them? Um, get his multi-method as you can.

Speaker 2:          23:07          Uh, it's important to learn a whole of ray. I mean, I think learning some about biological measures, learning about behavioral measures. Um, uh, learning, you know, facial expressions. There's all kinds of ways to get at these, the phenomenon related to emotion, emotion regulation and their outcomes. Um, so the bladder, the toolbox you have in terms of methods, the better, um, also, uh, to not just stick to one literature if had developmentalist we the adult literature of your social psychologist, the developmental literature is critical lead the clinic. You know, clinicians are doing a lot of work, obviously relevant, uh, the biological areas. I mean, now we have to be reading papers and a lot of the biological journals. Um, you really need to get cross areas in psychology, but also even in the other disciplines much more than in the past.

Speaker 1:          24:15          Well, thank you so much for speaking with us today. Nancy was my pleasure. So this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Doctor Nancy Isenberg from Arizona State University. Thank you so much again.
