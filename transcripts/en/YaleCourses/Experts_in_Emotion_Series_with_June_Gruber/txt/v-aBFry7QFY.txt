Speaker 1:          00:00          Our experts in emotion interview will be with our Touro. They Har the director of engineering at Facebook and he'll be speaking with us on emotion and social media. Arturo as director of engineering at Facebook, has worked on social tools to help people be more mindful of each other. This includes such areas as identity and abuse prevention, ways to develop better online citizens and tools designed to help resolve conflicts between individuals such as bullying. Previously he worked at Yahoo where he worked with a global team dedicated to providing a secure online experience. So I now turn to our last experts and emotion interview together with our tour obey Har on emotion and social media. So welcome Arturo. Thank you for speaking with us today.

Speaker 2:          00:48          Thank you very much for hosting me.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Great. So I wanted to start just by asking you a little bit about what first got you interested in studying emotion in the context of Facebook, in the broader world of social media.

Speaker 2:          01:01          So we're looking at the reports that we're getting from people about photographs that they have upload on Facebook. And usually it's most sites too. You have these reports that are about the rules of the site. This has some violence, discuss some drug use. And somebody says, Hey, this photo has Greg Hughes, can you please make it go away? And we would look at the phone and there was nothing in the photo, even remotely looked like that. It was just somebody like smiling, waving at the camera and like, what's going on here? And we realized that the person that we're submitting the report, in many cases, most cases was in the photo and the person had uploaded the photo, was one of their friends. Um, and so we're like, how can we help with this? And we figured out, okay, so you want people to be talking to each other.

Speaker 2:          01:47          So we told them, hey, can you send a message to your friends, letting them know that you would like them to remove the picture? And we put on an empty message box and only 20% of people would send the message. And, um, and then in most cases, even the messages didn't convey really what, what it's like, hey, you know, this photo, there's something about it that makes me want to ask you to take it down. At that time, we began meeting people, um, that are doing research scientist from Stanford and Berkeley. And yeah, we're doing all of this research about how people communicate and relate to each other. And one of the things that we learned is if you pick up that somebody else is experiencing an emotion, you're more likely to have a compassionate response. You're more likely to want to help them. So we did this experiment where we provided some default messaging that people can edit and send saying, hey, you know, I don't like this photo. Could you please to gate down. It makes me sad, but experimented with emotion and we saw a really meaningful results from that. Over 50% of people would send a message and then most of the people who receive the message would remove the photo. Um, I mean, we knew we were onto something and this was where it began. A lawyers of collaborations we're doing right now. We're exploring what are ways that people can communicate emotion to each other online.

Speaker 1:          03:03          That's fascinating. And so I wanted to ask you then, you know, the work that you're doing right now at Facebook related to emotion. Um, what role have you found in this work so far? I'm suggesting that emotion does play a role in these online interactions and Facebook. Okay.

Speaker 2:          03:18          Oh, it is a central, um, uh, because it's, it's central to be how people relate with each other. Um, we're, we have this flow now that that'd be put into place where we say, Hey, I'm in the photo. I don't want others to see me in the story. If you're known as a framing on that is, it's very emotional. Um, and then we asked you what is it about this photo that you don't like and we'll give you options that our emotions, it's embarrassing. It's about photo of me, not as much emotion, but an important thing to convey. It makes me angry or upset. It makes me sad. Um, and we found that people would select an emotion and then, um, uh, take the message where we provided that incorporated what we have learned about politeness and how you communicate. So, um, Hey Alan, is there something about this photo that's a little embarrassing to me?

Speaker 2:          04:06          Um, could you please take it down? And we found that over 60, I think 67% of the people will actually send the message, which is huge. Wow. Um, and, uh, depending on the message between 80 and 90% of people will use the texts that we provided, um, which means that we've captured their experience. Um, and even, um, I think more exciting than that is we asked the people who had created, uploaded the photo, the content creators, how they felt about the person, what sent them the message. Um, and remember this is somebody who is just share something with all of their friends because they think it's really cool. And one of the friends told him, Hey, you know, that actually, you know, it's upsetting to me. Well, it turns out that the person who receives the message feels at 60% positive, like 6% of them feel positive about the person who sent them the message. Wow. Um, and another 20%, they feel neutral. So it's like 80% of people, they kind of want to know if they did something that was upsetting to you, which is very interesting to contrast against the only 20% of people willing to communicate that emotion to their friends to help resolve the situation.

Speaker 1:          05:16          It's so interesting. So in what way do you think is worth thinking about these emotional relationships between people? You know, I'm trying to do things that will foster, you know, more positive interactions online. Um, I want to ask a little bit about your work suggesting that Facebook may actually be one route to sort of cultivate, you know, compassion and encourage it.

Speaker 2:          05:37          Well, we think based on the research that we've seen about how if you detect that somebody else is experiencing emotion, you're more likely to want to ease their suffering. And so hence the engage in a kind of question and response. Um, so I think we all know that, uh, emails and messages might not be the best way to convey. As at certain emotions, happy emotions are actually fairly easy to convey like smiley faces, like buttons. These things are very easy to convey that our positive feelings but conveying more complicated emotional stake, something gets embarrassing or something sad. Uh, we have looked at all of these mechanisms that we have when we talk to each other where we can, we didn't, somebody faces, you can hear it and that's one of their boys. And there's an absence of that today in many online communications. And so when we look at the fabric of Facebook, which is all about connecting people to each other and having great relationships and cultivating that community over time, um, having a mechanism that takes something that could be a source of distancing.

Speaker 2:          06:40          Um, if, if you uploaded a photo and it made me upset and I didn't tell you anything about it, that that pushes people further apart. Yeah. It, instead of having that you could have something where you can communicate how you feel and you can feel hurt. The other person says, Oh, I'm sorry it made you feel this way too. It's not my intent at all. And you begin a dialogue, even if the father doesn't come down, which is a perfectly legitimate outcome, that relationship gets closer and that bonds Franklin's. And so we hope if we have interactions that have positive results for people, that people will go like, and then what happened there? What can I learn from, from that communication and take this into other aspects of their lives.

Speaker 1:          07:19          So when you think about trying to promote a community that brings people together as opposed to distancing them apart, is this part of the reason underlying, you know, why there might not be the dislike button that a lot of people are often asking about?

Speaker 2:          07:32          I think so. I mean, I think that, um, uh, this like, uh, could be very easily misinterpreted and the ideal form of a dislike is one that begins a conversation. Um, so you want to be able to say, hey, you know, that thing that you, ah, shit, I disagree with that. Um, or that thing that, um, that, that you posted and Maytag and make me sad. It was upsetting to me. Um, and you need really good ways of communicating emotion for that to be a successful conversation. Um, and so we're starting in this realm of like photos and feedback. Um, and, and uh, and also bullying is another area that we're exploring to build tools that can successfully communicate emotion to and between people, these more complicated emotions. Um, but we hope that if we do a good job on this, that what we can learn here can be applied in many other areas of online communication.

Speaker 1:          08:21          So in embarking in this really, you know, still mysterious but rapidly growing world, you know, of online interaction, has there been anything that's really surprised you during your time at Facebook?

Speaker 2:          08:34          Oh, man. Every step along the way, there's game. So crisis, um, [inaudible] talks about, which is only 20% of the people willing to send a message telling their friends, but most of their friends wanting to hear about and feeling good about the contact. That was a really big surprise. Um, another one is, uh, when people come into the report flow for most of them over 80%, it's extremely important, um, for the photo to go to come down. But we believe that the action of um, acknowledging this is what's happening, naming the emotion that you're experiencing and then communicating that to the other person in a way where you feel like you've successfully, um, eh, eh, are heard. Um, the combination of those things make it so that at the end of that experience we asked them how they feel about the person that uploaded the photo and the number said or 50% positive.

Speaker 2:          09:27          Um, which is again, it's surprising considering you're going into this going like, oh wait, did you share this at the same metric? Me, another one that I think has been a very important insight, which goes against anything that you've seen in terms of computer design. And experience is that you get taught in all computer design classes. That language has to be very clear and very universal. So we been there, this, this slide where we can ask for a motion photo makes you feel our first version of it had adjectives. I'm like embarrassing. Just the word embarrassing. I just the word saddening. And we just had that the simplest, cleanest Ui. And then we had an option to in other where people could type in and only at 50% of people would select an emotion and then, uh, the other people and other 30% would put something in other.

Speaker 2:          10:20          And what would they select in other, it would type in, it's embarrassing. Hmm. We're going like, wait, there was like an option for him. What's going on? Um, well it turns out that it's important when you design things online that you use language that matches the experience. Can they, that people use when they talk about things with each other. So we change the options to sentence fragments. It's embarrassing. It makes, uh, um, and, and when we changed the emotions to a sentence fragments, we went from a 50% selection to 78%, which is in the world of online systems that that 30 point swings are just like completely nuts and wonderful. Um, and we've applied that principle in other areas of the work where the language is much longer and much more descriptive than what you would expect from any normal product that you have. But all of the measures of the language say having language that matches people experience at captured, whether it is that they're feeling that they're trying to say steak really works and, and, and to the tune of 20%, 30% improvements in the areas where we've applied these principles.

Speaker 1:          11:28          Wow. So in what way have you felt that your collaborations with people at Berkeley like Dacher Keltner, Paul Piff, you know, people at Yale like Marc Brackett among many others, um, how has this work from people who study aspect of science, you know, in psychology. How has that informed the kind of work that you're doing now at Facebook?

Speaker 2:          11:47          Oh, it's been insanely wonderful. Good. Well because, uh, it, it, it, everything I'm talking about has been born out of conversations with them. So in the work we've been doing with, with mark, um, at bracket from Yale on bullying, um, we're asking these really big questions about like, what kind of bullying is happening for you? How does it make you feel? How intense is the emotion? I mean, it's, this is, it's pretty big to say, hey, are you feeling afraid halfway? Do you feel, um, and, but it's central for being able to get people kind of the tools that they need and the department, and these are very close partnerships where we meet up with them once a week and we talked through the different ideas. We share the numbers, um, and, and uh, and the same has been proved the relationship with Paul, I piss and attackers and the, I'm on Thomas from Berkeley where we sit down and we'll look at the experiences people are having and we're asking the big question of like, what's really going on here?

Speaker 2:          12:44          What punches? And when we first began getting exposed to the word, like that emotional intelligence work. And, and the, um, as a self regulation and emotional literacy for kids with mark, uh, and bracket and the work that, uh, they were good is doing with Paul's work and that work and Eliana sport, but in some ways that people communicate in motion with each other. Um, it was, it was very exciting for us because we're like, okay, this, this is a total application for everything we're doing. And, and it was the basis of, of the compassionate research stay that we have or which we have another one tomorrow. They were very excited about.

Speaker 1:          13:19          That's so exciting to hear that Facebook is taking the science of emotion and using it to change the way that we interact with this world of Facebook. That's so many people participate in.

Speaker 2:          13:31          Yes. And it's, it's our hope by talking about it like talking with you today, but having a confessional research to any sort of other outlets that we're pursuing to help other people understand just how much we've gotten out of our partnerships with, uh, our researcher friends. Um, and, uh, and because I think anybody who's building any kind of tools to enable to medication or to be learning from what we were learning out to be working with their local scientists to figure out how they can explore these ideas. Um, because by every measure of the work we've done, it's been a positive thing for the people who use Facebook. Um, and um, and we hope that by the data that we get, and then we sorta put sharings that illuminates some pathways in the fields because one of the things you talk about when I'm getting started is most studies in the field and what was 200 people and everything we've done here spends hundreds of thousands if not millions of people that have gone through this. And they're telling us that's making the feel and it's like the results. Cause we help open up pathways for other areas of research and inquiry.

Speaker 1:          14:34          I mean absolutely those, those kinds of sample sizes or things that, you know, psychologists like myself and the ones you collaborate with, we could never dream of. Right. You know, you be there. Yeah. Facebook, you know, not so bad when it comes to just being able to access so many people. Right. And really get truly rich emotions that are things that are meaningful to them, you know, pictures of themselves, relationships with their friends. I mean this is where emotion, the meat of it is.

Speaker 2:          15:04          Yes. And there was a real, um, I think responsibility on us to honor the trust that people have in sharing this information through us and providing them the best tools that we can. And we'll do the genesis of all of this work is going at the issues that people are having on the side and understanding them and understand what's going on, what happens when there's a breakup and, and somebody posts pictures of it after a couple of, when they were there together. And have you resolved that communication between people? Um, what happens when uh, uh, like a low too, so that a little bit bullying is not intentional. It's somebody coming in and say, Hey, you look really beautiful today. And then the person looking at that, the message feeling bad about their self image and then navigating that and up to the point where we began this partnership setting.

Speaker 2:          15:53          The standard for the industry is like you look at a report, the report, Newson criteria, a hand comes down from the stand, makes it the piece of content go away. But who learns from that? How do you grow? How do you help the community heal and improve from that? Instead, what we're trying to do with, um, with, uh, the work that we're doing for sample on bullying is can you talk to the person if you can feel comfortable doing so whole uploaded the content? If not, can you reach out to somebody whom you trust that can support you navigating this? Because the best thing you can do for somebody who is the recipient or feels bullied or targeted is to get somebody in their life can sit down with them and help them navigate the situation and hopefully give them tools to navigate it as well. And so this is all, this is the first year of the field, literally began working on this a year ago in truly Ernest partnership with our scientists. But, um, but I think there's a lot of good work that remains to be done in the field.

Speaker 1:          16:45          So what do you see in store for the future of emotion and social media in Facebook and, and more generally?

Speaker 2:          16:53          So think we need to be exploring different ways for people can communicate emotion to each other. Um, there's work around the voice that's really interesting in terms of sealing sales work about facial expressions and how could you actually communicate those more nuanced feeling sort of facial expressions. Is there a better smiley to be had then the ones that we have today. Um, and I think there's also a lot of work to be done in supporting different kinds of communities we're looking at, at, at what we can do, for example, with veterans. Uh, we're as a community that in order for them to get support, it has to come from somebody who they trust and, and have a sense of identification with them. And so being able to give people the tools that make them feel seen, heard, and met on language or spoke to each other, it seems like it's, it's, it's something that we're just beginning to understand that of the work from the last year and that we will be exploring for the foreseeable future. Sure.

Speaker 1:          17:47          So what kind of advice do you have for students or people who are interested in learning more about emotion, you know, and how it sort of, um, I don't know, sort of manifests in this world, this social media world and in Facebook. What would you tell them if they want to learn more about it?

Speaker 2:          18:06          Two things. One is we do have this compassion research videos, articles written, happy to see what people have to see for themselves there. And so we're going to be live streaming the day tomorrow. Um, and uh, and there should be, there's going to be lots of really wonderful stuff there. But the other one is I think the biggest lesson that I've gotten out of my work in this space, which is that, um, a lot of people seem to think that because it's online it is different and, and as you start from the thesis, it has to be different online. The mechanisms to resolve just these things. It has to be different online and they start carve out areas and it turns out the listen, like people are people and if you want to make a big difference on line, the best thing that you could possibly do is do a great job of understanding how people relate and communicate and resolve issues with each other in different kinds of communities across the world.

Speaker 2:          19:01          Turns into debt. You can't, you, you, you have to be in communal living and have to see the person that they have to. So you don't have the luxury of like being really mean to them and then or disrespectful to them because no matter whatever happened, I mean you're going to have to live with them the next thing for the cost per serving. But it had like people, it has more respectful, something's funny have to be, um, but you could go into a high school and study what are the emotions that, uh, like, uh, teens communicates to each other that helped them resolve and navigate conflicts and take those lessons and then go look at a chapter on one line and say, what can they, what happened from what I learned in the high school? What, how could I apply this to a chat room?

Speaker 2:          19:41          Um, what I have learned from the wisdom of a community that seems to be functioning really well. How can I apply that in this other context? And that's the way the information needs to flow. So I think the best thing that comes to a, or a student that's getting started on the field is to pick a problem that that gets addressed by successful communication of emotion in real life, like within their circle of friends from in a school or something like that. And study that and then see how those results and lessons map to an online environment because there's a lot of that that needs to be happening in the coming years. And again, as I said, we're just getting started.

Speaker 1:          20:15          Fantastic. Well, thank you so much for speaking with us today, Arturo. It was fantastic to hear your thoughts and thank you very much for having timing. Thank you. So this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Facebook engineering director, our Touro. They had, thank you so much again.
