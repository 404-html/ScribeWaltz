Speaker 1:          00:02          I think this class is pretty special for one. It's one of the few courses in the world that's actually about human emotions that's actually getting into the trenches to understand why we are these emotional creatures that we are. So what we're trying to do is get students exposed to a broad variety of issues that cut across many disciplines. So these are disciplines ranging from psychology to neuroscience to linguistics, even to things like computer science and even to art and music. So we're going to be approaching emotion from a whole variety of perspectives. And by doing this, we'll be able to really answer some fundamental questions about what we feel and why we feel it. So we'll look at what is an emotion? Where do emotions come from in the first place? Are we born as emotional creatures, or is this something we learned through experience? And can we learn how to actually control our emotions and use them to build healthier, happier, and I would hope more meaningful lives too.
