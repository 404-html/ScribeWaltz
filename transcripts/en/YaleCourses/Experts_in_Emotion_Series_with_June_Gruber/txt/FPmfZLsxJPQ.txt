Speaker 1:          00:01          Today, I'll be speaking with doctor Jo Anne Bakar Roski professor of psychology at Vanderbilt University where she directs the Vocal Acoustics Laboratory. Her work there focuses on laughter and other domains of vocal communication including the vocal expression of emotion, infant directed baby talk as well as speech acoustics more generally. Um, she's previously served as an associate editor for the journal, cognition and emotion and has received several awards for her work, including grants from the NSF as well as the an IMH. Her work, not surprisingly on laughter, has been widely discussed in the media, including the BBC La Times, Scientific American and discovery. Um, just as a mere example. So with this work on laughter, I'm excited to now turn to our experts in emotion interview with doctor Jo Anne Bakar Roski from Vanderbilt University on laughter.

Speaker 2:          00:57          So welcome Joanne. Thanks for speaking with us today and thanks for having me. I'm excited about this. I'm excited to. Um, so I wanted to start by asking you a little bit about what first got you interested in studying emotion. I actually stumbled on it by accident. I was studying in post with behavior and I was looking for some sort of physiological correlate that would go along with the state of being impulsive. And a colleague suggested that I record people's voices and that turned into vocal expression of emotion and I really got interested in voice. And what came along with that was understanding emotions as well. So it was a good accident. I mean gotta love serendipitous accidents, right?

Speaker 1:          01:38          Yes. So I wanted to then ask you about your work. So I mean it's really exciting and you're widely known, especially for your influential work on the acoustics of laughter and if we've even developed a comprehensive laughter dictionary. And I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit about some of the most exciting discoveries here. I know all of us are really curious about what is laughter and can there really be different kinds of laughter.

Speaker 2:          02:02          I think it's one of the most fascinating behaviors that we engage in. And I think one of the surprising things to learn is how readily people laugh. And so we can bring people into the lab and have them do pretty much anything. And as long as they are in pairs of people or groups of people, then they'll laugh a lot. So that was really surprising to me. Another surprise was just how rich laughter is as a behavioral repertoire. And so, well as listeners we can categorize these all is kind of falling in a laugh lump of sounds. There are surprising acoustic very variations in the sounds and the acoustics themselves or just markedly different than we see in typical speech. And so we have things like the pitch of laughter goes wildly all over the place. We also sometimes produce what are called acoustic nonlinear charities, which are very unusual in normal voice or normal speech. And we see them in laughter a good proportion of the time. So that's been really exciting. And then another thing that interests me is the occasions when we don't laugh. Like what is it about our social partner that would lead us to not laugh or even inhibit our laughter. Wow.

Speaker 1:          03:11          So can I ask you a question then about this? So in what ways would you say are, you know, sort of not all laughs alike?

Speaker 2:          03:18          I think that one of the most important distinctions is whether laughs or voiced or not. So we kind of lump laughs into these voiced and unvoiced categories. And what it means to be a voice, to have a voice blast is that the vocal folds are important in the production of that sound. And so when we produce a voice sound, it has a periodicity to it because the vocal folds are operating in synchrony with each other. When we produce an unvoiced sounds, either the vocal folds aren't involved with, they're involved more chaotically and unvoiced sounds are noisier, they're more turbulent. And so things like grunts and snorts are often very rich vocabulary. Reid Branson snorts are often unvoiced and we'll snorts or necessarily envoys cause they're coming through the nose. And um, and voice sounds of what we, I think of as prototypical laugh sound. So we think about these kind of song like qualities to laughter.

Speaker 2:          04:16          Those are voiced laughs. And what we've learned about those laughs is that they are much more likely to elicit positive emotion in the people who hear them. So listeners to hear voice laugh, say they're sexier than unvoiced laughs that they're more likely to want to meet the person who produced the laugh. They think it's better for a laugh track and they're saying it makes them feel a lot better than unvoiced sounds or unvoiced laughs and unvoiced lasts can actually elicit negative emotions in people. So kind of begs the question of why we produce so many of those, but we do their prior to hire our repertoire.

Speaker 1:          04:50          So speaking of that, I mean you've alluded to some important individual differences and laughter profiles and I wonder if you could say a little bit about some of the really fascinating gender differences that you've found here when examining these different acoustic laughter profiles.

Speaker 2:          05:03          I think the gender differences are just, they're fascinating. So yeah, one thing, we don't get the standard. I think people expect that women laugh more than men and we've never seen that. So we've now conducted boy at least a half dozen behavioral studies with a substantial number of people in each study. And we've never found that women laugh overall more than men do. But it really depends on who our social partners are that drive laughter. So for example, people laugh more, and this isn't surprising, but we find that people laugh more when they're with somebody than when they're alone. And then they also laughed more with friends and if they're paired with a stranger. But the most interesting finding with these, um, sex differences is that what male subjects do I think? And that is that when males or with a friend, especially with a male friend, they laughed more and they produce higher pitch laughs, they produce longer laughs and it's, they're these kind of over the top laughs that I think that we expected ahead of time that women would actually do with their women friends.

Speaker 2:          06:04          But it's actually the guys who were doing it with their guy friends and they'll do it with female friends as well. And they will rarely produce these laughs when there was a stranger. And that all gets it notions about what kinds of sounds do you want to produce with someone who you know versus who you don't know. So she think about males. Um, they can actually work to kind of reinforce an ongoing relationship. If they produce these voice lasts that make other people feel good, but that might be too much acoustic information if the mail hasn't met the, the stranger male with a stranger, females. So if you can imagine it as a female, if you were to be at a party and a male who you've never met before came up and just laughed really loud and long and I pitched, you'd be like, Whoa, that's too much information. It's kind of like, you know, too much overload. It is overload. It's too much. I'd like too much eye gaze of too much physical contact. So males don't produce those kinds of laughs with a stranger, but they produce them a lot when they're with a friend, especially with their guy friends.

Speaker 1:          07:07          Interesting. I mean, speaking of friendships, I know you've also looked at this really intricate kind of temporal dynamics of laughter and the ways that it can differentiate, you know, close friends from just acquaintances. I wonder if you could say something about that too.

Speaker 2:          07:21          Yeah. We looked at, um, what we call the intifada laughter, which essentially just means back and forth. Laughter and friends are much more likely to produce laughs within like a second or two of their other, the friend that they're being tested with. We're strangers or just discoordinate in their laughter. It's almost like a random event. Um, what's even more interesting is that the friends are more likely to have this antipasto or synchronous laughter for voice laughter. So the idea is that if voice laughter makes other people feel good, the idea with friends is that they can have a learned emotional response to the laugh acoustics of the friend who they know. So they've been with this person repeatedly, they've shared a lot of good times together. They say their friends. And so when one person produces this voice laugh sound, yeah, the person has this very quick, rapid kind of learned response that includes laughter and in response to the initial friend laughing.

Speaker 1:          08:17          So interesting. You know, social relationships. I mean you've also uncovered these really, really, I think just like groundbreaking insights into sort of the distinct social consequences of different laughter types that you've spoken about today. And I wondered if you could say a little bit more about, in what ways do these voice versus unvoiced laughter elicit different social responses from other people?

Speaker 2:          08:41          I think, um, I don't want to correct your question, but I want, go ahead. We actually haven't studied directly social consequences and I think that is a really key question and it's one that we're like directly underway starting to Estin lab. So it's really exciting and I think that's critically important. What we've done is studied laughter in an almost disembodied way. So people come to the lab, they're in a perception study essentially they come into a sterile environment and they hear these labs over headsets, but they're not interacting with the person when they're making judgments about the laughs. And if tested people in the social situations, we haven't yet analyzed data that we have. On what, how much did you like your partner if they were producing lots of voice laughter versus how much did you like your partner? They weren't producing those sounds that they weren't laughing a lot. And so we're just really at the beginning stages of being able to address that. But I think it's really the most important kind of question we can be asking about the sounds,

Speaker 1:          09:39          well I can't wait to hear what your findings, you know, on earth. I mean, do you think in any way some of these findings, I know some, it sounds like it's at the forefront of where you're working right now, but I wonder if you know, where at any point to have a sense of, you know, how we ought to laugh, you know, in society and social interactions.

Speaker 2:          09:57          I think the results have implications for that. But the, um, I don't think we have a lot of control over our laughter. So when we try to shape it, it's actually a challenge. And if we want to really shape it for our lifetime, we really have to kind of work at that. So we might have to work at making her laugh less loud or making sure to laugh. So whatever. I think we do though to the course of development, learn a whole lot about what kinds of sounds work in what circumstances. Um, I think that the same way we learn things like I mentioned earlier about eye gaze and, and physical proximity. We learn what works in, in with different kinds of people and different kinds of circumstances. And I think we do the same for our laughter. And then I think that we actually run into pretty, um, I don't want to say dramatic, but I think people really can have social difficulties when they use laughter in the wrong way or in the wrong sorts of circumstances. Um, and so people talk anecdotally about that and we haven't directly studied that either at this point. But I do think that in the absence of using laughter effectively, people really can have challenges in their social relationships.

Speaker 1:          11:09          So when you say that about sort of where your path is taking you, you know, into the world of emotion, kind of serendipitously and now becoming, you know, the laughter expert, you know, and all the discoveries you've made in the directions you're going. Where do you see, looking ahead, sort of the future of emotion headed? What are the important directions?

Speaker 2:          11:28          I think, um, well actually I was reminded of this all today when the New York Times announced that Obama was about to spend many, many millions of dollars to understand the brain. And I thought, well, surely there'll be an important role for emotions and psychology in this. And I think that, you know, on the one hand we are traveling and understanding the brain more, but I think it's also important to kind of hang on to behavior and that really what's most important down the road is to make links between brain behavior relations and a more naturalistic way then we've done with some of our lab paradigms to date. Um, and I think another thing that's really exciting coming down the road with emotions we search is being able to use behavioral genetics techniques to understand, especially disturbances and dysfunctions in laughter. And they really see the next 10 years is exploding in both of those frontiers.

Speaker 1:          12:18          Okay. So my last question for you then is what advice do you typically give students who come to you and ask, you know, your thoughts on should I embark in this field and what are important? You know, ways that I should be thinking about becoming an emotion researcher.

Speaker 2:          12:33          I think, um, what I see with a lot of students is, is a really get revved up about emotions, which is great. Um, and if they get caught up in technique a little bit too much and or tools. And so they want to learn imaging or they want to learn eye tracking and they want to learn psychophysiology. And so what I try to shape students to really understand is that those tools and techniques are always going to be there. So behavioral genetics, right? It's going to be the next of, of those tools that we can use. But the most important thing they can do is to identify some core questions that they're passionate about that really tell us something about the heart of what's going on with emotional processing. And if they can get, you know, just develop those important questions and follow through, then then yes, they can learn imaging and yes, they can learn all these things, but the questions themselves are the most important.

Speaker 1:          13:25          Well, thank you so much for speaking today. It's been such a pleasure. Thank you. So this concludes our experts and emotion interview with Dr Joann background ski from Vanderbilt University. Thanks again.
