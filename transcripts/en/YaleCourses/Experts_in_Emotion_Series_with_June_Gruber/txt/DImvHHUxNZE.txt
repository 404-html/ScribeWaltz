Speaker 1:          00:01          We'll be speaking with doctor Robert Levenson from the University of California Berkeley, who is going to be speaking with us about this question that's guided much of our discussion today. Blood tears, sweat and fears, the autonomic nervous system and emotion. So doctor Levinson received his phd from Vanderbilt University in clinical psychology and he's currently a professor in the Department of Psychology at the university, California Berkeley, where he's a member of both the behavioral neuroscience, clinical science, developmental and social personality programs. He currently serves as the director of the institute or personality and Social Research as well as the director of the clinical science program. So Dr Levinson's research program is in the area of human emotion studying the Organisation of physiological, behavioral, and subjective systems. The way that these systems are impacted by neuropathology normal aging and culture and the role that emotions play in the maintenance and disruption of committed relationships. Dr Levinson's research has been supported by grants from the NIH and Nia, and he is the past president of the Society for psychophysiological research and the past president of the association for Psychological Science. So I now turn to a very special experts in emotion interview with Doctor Robert Levenson from the University of California Berkeley. Welcome Bob. Thanks for speaking with us today.

Speaker 2:          01:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:22          Yeah. So what I wanted to start out asking you a bit about is really what got you first interested in the study of emotion, kind of where did it all begin for you?

Speaker 2:          01:34          Well, actually this is one of these questions. Where are you normally have an answer, but I remember the exact moment. Uh hmm. I just started my first faculty position at Indiana University and um, I had been in the field at that time was dominated by a Dick Lazarus, Richard Lazarus. His work on sort of stress and coping. It really wasn't a feel of emotion. It was, it was a really, it was going to be another six or seven years before it started to explode. And um, in this, in the models of stress and coping, um, you got the idea that there was a sort of a stress response and everybody did the same thing. If you, if you, uh, provoke them in your laboratory, everybody would pretty much have the same reaction. And people before Lazarus, like Han Celia had described the physiology of that response quite elegantly. Um, one of the things that we're starting to come into the field was greater reliance on video recording and um, we had just run a classic stress study where we had, uh, threaten people with electric shock and we had had them gifts, a self revealing speeches about their weaknesses and you securities

Speaker 1:          02:58          studies. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:00          When I looked at these video tapes to see the started fixed action patterns where everybody was doing the same thing and it was just the opposite though, it's just this incredible variety of response. It was complex. If I'm folding it over time, it changed over time for different people. And some of it was quite counterintuitive. This is gonna seem really dumb, but the fact that people were laughing when they were threatened with it, it was real electric shock. We actually shot them in those days. You were allowed to do that. Um, and, and you know, it wasn't this sort of like general negative stress response. It was, it was this a rainbow of different, different things that I realized that this was very important and I have no idea how to start again. I have no idea how to measure it or quantify it. And, um, and the behavior we only deaf tied anything that I could probably get at with a self report measure or the physiological measures that I was a news.

Speaker 1:          04:03          Right. So I, uh, I got interested in that and, um, as a result, I want to tell you the whole story, but about three or four years later, I was able to go, come out to San Francisco to spend a year working with these two crazy guys, Paul Ekman and Wallace reason started spent a decade focusing on how you measure this very thing, you know, and, and, uh, they were developing a coating system or characterizing the full variety of human emotional response. And so that's how I got interested in. It's just, it's just, it was compelling in, in the, in what I was seeing that um, something was going on here that was much more differentiated than I expected. Thank you for that. I mean it's, it's a really compelling story just by observing a phenomena you saw something that you didn't understand and that's really what propelled all the research that you're doing now. And I mean really as a forefront in this field of emotion as well as psychophysiology. I mean, you do work that inspires so many generations, um, like myself and others to try to continue to grapple with these, these questions and phenomena that we observe but we don't understand.

Speaker 2:          05:18          Well, I think that's the best way to do research. I mean, I know that's your last question and we'll come back to it. Right? You can over arching research that's grounded in fundamental curiosity about the things that amaze and baffle you is the research that, you know, he's going to keep your interest for a long period of time. And I figure if you're lucky, you get, if you, if you hit on good questions, it'll, it will attract other people through those issues. Um, but curiosity is sort of at the core of my sort of approach to research.

Speaker 1:          05:54          So I mean, when thinking about curiosity, the realm of psychophysiology, I mean you have really sort of taken a lead in specializing in these really complex, you know, psychophysiological tools to study emotion. And I mean, in your opinion, sort of what do you see as some of the most effective tools for trying to understand and measure this really complex? You know, rain boys, you call it, of emotional responding?

Speaker 2:          06:21          Well, I'm going to, I'm going to give you an answer that's probably a little strange change and that is that I think the best, the best psychophysiological tools are good, are good, inappropriate research questions. Uh, that is, um, what I was first getting involved in psychophysiology. Um, one of the, the dominant voices in the field was a fellow named Paul Brest who was working in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of North Carolina. Could have been Duke. No, that's an important distinction. That range. Yeah. But he was always you MC. That's where I was. And he was a curmudgeon, the guy and a fighter and he um, he also championed young people who are working in the field. And his mantra was we need to know more biology to understand the biology of these measures and had a huge influence on me. And, and to this day, um, I almost tried to think the art of psychophysiology is to ask a question that, that for which these measures are appropriate.

Speaker 2:          07:43          Um, I can't tell you how many people write notes when they're applying to graduate school and say, I run, I want to use these measures in athletics. It's like measure first and then if I get a chance to talk to him, I only saw the same unless the question and a lot of questions in psychology are not appropriate for these kinds of methods and measures. So that's the first thing. Good. Psychophysiology is based on good questions and a good understanding. These are not psychological measures. Dick biological measures, they aren't measuring personality and the aren't measuring emotion. You're measuring metabolic processes. And adjustment of the homeostasis in the body and, and how we mashed them into the psychological question. That's part of good psychophysiological research. And I think it's really, really difficult and it's, and it's easy to have a mismatch where the measure, no matter how sophisticated, you know, how down to the millisecond the accuracy and the no fault is, it's, it can be the wrong measure for, for psychological question and then you just get nothing.

Speaker 2:          08:58          So, so that's, you know, that's, that's the prelude. Um, I know that's not exactly what you were, you were getting at, but, but then I think the getting to the measures themselves, I think the challenge has always been, you know, how can we get from the behavior of, of these target organs, you know, the heart, lungs and whatnot to the underlying action of the nervous system because we really want to understand it in terms of sympathetic and parasympathetic. And within these, you know, Beta and Alpha adrenergic subsystems, we really want to get a sense of what part of the nervous system is active. And, and that has been an area where there's been enormous progress over the last 20, 30 years. It used to be that we could measure what Oregon's we're doing, but we couldn't really infer what the, what the activating mechanisms were.

Speaker 2:          09:53          And that's been a real powerful tool. And you only turns out that w that changes in heart rate, let's say that there that are instigated by parasympathetic action, um, now founded very different psychological constructs and ones that are instigated by a sympathetic action. And so it would be able to get that kind of underlying mechanism to be reveal, you know, in our psychophysiological measures. I think that's been a huge advance in terms of getting to the real core of phenomena like emotion, you know, or, or you know, attachment or these big psychological constructs where the physiology, you can actually tell us some very interesting thing.

Speaker 1:          10:39          So when you think about really trying to probe under my underlying mechanisms further, where do you see some of the next most critical steps in the field of psychophysiology moving towards to be able to do this, to get at some of these really profound processes you were hinting like emotion attachment and then like, well

Speaker 2:          10:59          I hope this isn't self serving. Uh, but it's really worth thinking about in the last couple of years. I mean I've been, I mean we're only interested in the sort of the numeric side of physiology. Um, you know, my own work going back for a long time, I constantly gotten attracted to the ways that sort of physiology is, um, is it provides a measure of contagion. Um, and it provides a way of characterizing. We have shortly connection between people who are interacting and an emotion. You know, it provides a way of looking at a coherence, coherence between different aspects of your emotional response. So to answer your question, I think the era of the mean is probably over Aaron. I see that we're going to have to go back to the, we are oh, your physiology, which either it is a time series, it's, it's, it's something that unfolds over time and has [inaudible] and uh, it does have changes in levels if that's just part of that pattern.

Speaker 2:          12:18          And I think the challenges is going to be finding ways to characterize physiology over time, how it relates to other unfolding phenomena in the individual, like their subjective experience and their emotional behavior and how it sort of operates when two people are in and the interaction. And so how you are physiology and my physiology and the, and the kind of temporal relationships between them. He was close to the kind of psychological connection that we're engaged in. So I think that's the next frontier and it's ending, you know, it's, it's really um, challenging. Um, I mean going back to the last few months and we reading all this stuff I read when I was in graduate school about things like time series analysis for analyses and water retention and whatnot. Him and try and sort of come up with that, a fresh approach for characterizing some of these temporal relationships. So it's what's on my mind these days.

Speaker 1:          13:18          Yeah, I mean, so I'm thinking about, you know, some of the original groundbreaking work you did here where you identified, you know, distinct patterns of autonomic nervous system activity with particular emotion states. And on the one hand I wanted to ask you sort of what do you see as the most interesting discoveries in that original work? But what you're saying now makes me think too sort of how can we move that field forward of emotion specificity if we're looking at these more dynamic fluctuations and physiology over time.

Speaker 2:          13:45          That's what I'm thinking about. I mean I I remember very clearly are used to have a slide one slide and why I'm jumping in one talk based on one emotional elicitation in wanting individual, it's actually two different emotions and it was just looking at what happened to heart rate, second distraction when that person was experiencing profound discussed versus profound anger. And you know, the differences were not, oh you could see where the mean differences came from. You know, the fact that at the end of the day, most of the time when you're angry, your heart, it's going to accelerate much more than when you're disgusted, when you're disgusting, often decelerates so you could see how you got there. But the kind of the temporal path to that was, was so different for these two, for these two emotions and in this one individual. And you know how to characterize that and doing it in a way that's meaningful and not just descriptive, it's in, can be scaled up to studies. I think it, I think that that is one of the really important new frontiers in the study of specificity. And I think the same thing is probably true if you're looking at the brain, you know, we really want to look at not only where it ends up in terms of what the active areas are, but also how it got there. And I think the brain people with functional imaging to Barton much more inclined to, to work in that way.

Speaker 1:          15:12          Well, I mean, speaking of the brain, I mean you've really uncovered some additional fascinating insights about how neurodegenerative diseases like frontotemporal dementia FTD profoundly impact, you know, a whole host of different emotional related processes. Right from you've looked at perception reactivity as well as regulation, both spontaneous and queued. And I wonder as you're thinking about psychophysiology in this realm, you know, at the realm of sort of neural systems in neurodegenerative diseases, sort of what were some discoveries you came up, you know, in doing this research where they surprising to you. Um, what, what sort of struck you in working with this population?

Speaker 2:          15:54          Well, you know, we started with the observation that, you know, here was a well characterized neurological condition that was producing something that looked very much like psychiatric symptoms are not a real clinical psychologist, but I sort play one and my profession.

Speaker 1:          16:18          Yes you are.

Speaker 2:          16:23          I think one of the great gifts of graduate training for me was being trained as a clinical psychologist, but how a pretty good sense of why your clinical conditions and symptoms look like. And I was really struck with these patients who didn't have icebox Perry's and you know, little birth away and didn't have, you know, a psychogenic kind of factors in your life. The thing we're producing, these kinds of symptoms that they'd look very much like psychiatric conditions. Um, and so as is typical of my work, um, I was just struck by that and became very curious as to, you know, how it was that, um, damage to these neural circuits. I mean, now we understand that it's not [inaudible] it's [inaudible] markets that are really producing these changes. Could we produce things that mimic these kinds of clinical phenomenon? Um, and it seemed to me that it could tell us a lot about emotion. It could also tell us a lot about emotion based.

Speaker 2:          17:29          And so th that back to me was the kind of a striking, there's surprising, it was just how powerfully, uh, these teasers produced these symptoms. When I was in graduate school, the chapter on brain damage was always just about cognitive, with the exception maybe of Phineas gage. And that was such a terrible case study. You know, who knew what happened. But as a result, I was skipped it when I taught like uh, clinical psychology cause didn't have anything to do with this emotion. The West surprise me is that there's this whole set of, of uh, of January of neurodegenerative diseases that actually are like a silver bullet into the heart of our emotional functioning. We only under described under appreciate, I'm getting better now this, the misdiagnosis just like that, you know, he just, we call it dementia, which which suggest, you know, problems in mentation and never memory, but you know, here's this other set of disorders.

Speaker 2:          18:36          They're really quite different. And then of course the reason for that is that they hit very bad effect, very different kinds of circuits in the brain. So the exciting thing for me was here was an opportunity to really study emotion in the brain without the constraints of the scanner. We, we didn't have this like only study those emotional things that could occur too. We could do, we get to study all the things that happened in real life and linked them back ultimately cause fairly well characterized changes in the brain. I just thought this was a great, this was a great new playground.

Speaker 1:          19:12          What have you found, you know, in this research you've done with this group of FTD patients and other neurodegenerative diseases, sort of what has it told you about the role of the brain and sort of normative emotion processing?

Speaker 2:          19:24          Yeah. Well, you know, it's not a finished story. I mean, you know, I,

Speaker 2:          19:32          yeah, it's kind of like a second, like a second wind and in a career or something, you know, it's like we started, we started doing this work about a decade ago and good, good questions take decades to talk, to lead to good answers. And I sort of feel like we're still mid stream. Um, the thing that I'm really found myself thinking about a lot and the people in my lab also gravitating to and the people we collaborate with and it's really ironic, is the role of sort of the subjective emotional experience and particularly the contribution of visual perception and visceral sensations to, to our emotional lives. Um, we've trained and because this disease targets predict circuitry are critical for the processing of this visceral information. We think that the, uh, kind of the interior emotional life, if these patients

Speaker 2:          20:32          ooze kind of the visceral quality, you know, the butterflies in the stomach and, and probably some of the cinematic qualities like tensions and whatnot. This sensors have the sensor coolness and warm tingling on the skin that all of these things that are really, you know, I think we're coming to understand critical parts of how emotion influences our behavior, um, are probably being diminished and muted by this disease. And then when you see people don't have this part of their emotions, you begin to realize just how they are. Um, and it certainly has made my, my normal emotion research much more focused these days on this. Your perception, uh, trying to find ways of characterizing that and measuring it didn't have historically a very difficult problem with field. Uh, how do you characterize the, the extent of a visceral awareness and how do you monitor it moment to moment? Nope.

Speaker 1:          21:41          Yeah. So I mean this is fascinating. I mean, just thinking about where you first began in this field, you know, observing a phenomena that was mysterious and exciting to being, you know, forefront at the figure of the field of emotion and as well as in psychophysiological processes that, that help us understand emotional related phenomena and sort of having seen the field of emotion evolve over time. I guess sort of taking a step back, where do you see now the face of the future and emotion headed? What lies ahead?

Speaker 2:          22:15          Well, clearly the headlights ahead. I mean, you know, uh, emotion started as being started, the province and the autonomic nervous system, uh, you know, the older models where that, uh, linked cognition and emotion were all top down and show, you know, in the, in the early views, emotions were sort of these irritating, nasty little things that had to be brought under the control of rational processes. And now, you know, I think that there's any question that

Speaker 2:          22:50          in turned upside down, but now almost all of psychology seems to be a balance. The influence of emotion on other things, including a whole range of cognitive processing. Probably most famously how emotions influence our decisions. Um, and, and sometimes you know, cause us to, to decide things or don't appear to be rational by sort of western standards. But really our rational in terms of ar I sort of reptilian standard that's embodied cognition is another area where this is really okay. So I, so I think that one, one clear future direction is the way is this is the bottom up directions, the way emotions, what do we shape our thinking are our memories that we should stop that we've played with in the past. But I think there's a lot of good work that's necessary. Um, the secondary is clearly emotions and close relationships.

Speaker 3:          23:52          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          23:55          I think attachment theory is one of these, it's like as a Jamie, the James Lang theory of emotion on Bowlby's attachment theory is, is it great idea that really needs to be looked at with modern two goals and they think the way emotions function in making these lasting emotional some days. Last thing sort of interpersonal bonds is really another critical area. And then I think about the other one that is kind of uh, interscape and is that

Speaker 2:          24:29          he grew up in an era where I think you could say this is probably something people would argue with. I think you could make the case that progress in to treat treatment of mental illness and the understanding of it, it's really hit a wall and that, um, both in psychiatry and in psychology is really almost nothing significant in the last decade or so. It's made a huge difference in either understanding or ability to treat. We're recycling old ideas or there are a few exceptions for that. You, we don't know what will come with them. Like deep brain stimulation and things like that. Yeah, very different approach. Maybe something would come that. Uh, so I think, you know, this is going to be a huge area of growth in the coming decade. You know, really taking a fresh look at emotion is notion dysfunction. Um, in and to tobacco happened, a number of things have to happen.

Speaker 2:          25:36          You're probably not going to have no line is we have to do away with the DSM. You have to go back to much more molecular way of looking at the symptoms might be, are we only clear out all of the, um, the interference life from, from the accreditation that chiefs of progressive programs from we only training their students and the way they think they should be trained and we have to learn how to talk to now like psychiatrist, but we have to with him talk to behavioral neurologist and have a different kind of understanding about the brain and, and then sort of refocus on these issues. I think that could be the most exciting for the next generation. And I think, you know, if we could get to that point and just throwaways, today's really the baggage or some of the old systems and old ideas. I think this could be the era of making, you know, we don't progress and understanding and treating a mental illness.

Speaker 1:          26:39          So then we, we're thinking about this next generation, right? A big part of who is going to be at the, our students right now. So when the students come to you, Bob, and ask you for advice of what they should do, um, if you know wanting to embark in this field of emotion, what do you tell them?

Speaker 3:          26:56          Okay,

Speaker 2:          26:58          wow. Probably five things that you really want to know a lot about our thing. I think, why do you want to know if you're gonna Spell your motion? You better. You better learn how to observe behavior.

Speaker 3:          27:15          MMM hmm.

Speaker 2:          27:18          My opinion. Somebody disagree. You know, most of the really exciting progress in emotion has been made. Um, at least kind of contact where people directly observed emotional responding and they had ways of quantifying it. And you know, you can really, you can really parse emotion research into those who look at behavior and those who don't. So I think he needed need to understand the behavior too. You need to have a really strong foundation in biology. You don't understand the physiological systems and increasingly these days that includes a genetic systems in different systems as well. Um, and then I think, I think you need to understand what emotion looks like when it's, when it's operating within normal bounds. And also when it's operating within these sort of dysfunctional, abnormal values, and we've all emotion researchers need to have some exposure to emotion pathology, whether it's a neural, uh,

Speaker 2:          28:23          but whether it's shut off by some sort of neurodegenerative process or some sort of psychological process, which you really have to understand like what emotion looks like when it's not there blunted or when it's when it's hyperactive. And you need to see that and understand that. And so I think those are the kinds of things, you know, that, that good emotion researchers are going to have to, to know. And, you know, we don't train students that way, we, so we sort of train them in silos. So clinical students do this and neuroscience students do that and aspect of science students, you know, do something else. But I think that good emotion research is going to really require this behavior biology and pathology.

Speaker 1:          29:09          Okay. Well, Bob, thank you so much for speaking with us today.

Speaker 2:          29:13          Alright, this huge room.

Speaker 1:          29:14          Nice to see you too. Um, this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Doctor Robert Levenson from the University of California at Berkeley.
