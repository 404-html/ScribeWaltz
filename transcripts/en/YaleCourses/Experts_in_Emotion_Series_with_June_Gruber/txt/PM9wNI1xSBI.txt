Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi, welcome back to human emotion. Today I'm very excited to be continuing our discussion on happiness. And as we discussed in our last lecture as humans, it seems that we have this almost, you know, insatiable desire or yearning to both be happy and understand what happiness is. So today we're going to start again with the ancient observation of Aristotle who emphasize just how important happiness is to humans. He said happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence. So today in our second module on happiness and wellbeing will be pushing our understanding of happiness one step further by looking at how it relates to morality. And in some ways try to look at this question of how can morality influence happiness? Is there any way in which the two are intertwined? We'll be doing this today by starting with a very special guest lecture by Josh Nobe here at Yale University, followed by our takeaway questions and expert interview. So we'll first start with our guests lecture by Dr Josh Nobe. Um, so our very special guest lecture today is by Dr Josh Nobe on morality. And happiness. Josh is a professor of cognitive science and philosophy at Yale University and is one of the founders of the experimental philosophy movement. His work has also been covered by the New York Times, the BBC slate and scientific American. So welcome Josh. Thank you for your special guest lecture today.

Speaker 2:          01:24          Thanks so much. So today we're going to be taking a step in a slightly different direction and we're going to try to take a more interdisciplinary approach. So just as in all of the previous segments of this course, we're going to be using the kind of standard methods of psychology. We're going to be looking at experiments, statistical analyses and so forth. But in this segment we're also going to be taking a different approach. We're going to be looking at certain questions that came out of philosophy and certain ideas that philosophers have developed about those questions. So in essence, then what we're going to be doing is when we be ticking philosophical questions and philosophers ideas about those questions. But then we're going to be putting those ideas to the test using the kind of standard methods that we see in psychology. So this approach of mixing philosophy and psychology in this way is often called experimental philosophy.

Speaker 2:          02:10          And that's the kind of approach we're going to be pursuing here. So in keeping with this kind of interdisciplinary approach, we're going to be talking about work from an interdisciplinary team of researchers. So in particular we're going to be talking about work from Jonathan Phillips from philosophy, your instructor, John Gruber, from psychology and Julian to Fritas from an interdisciplinary program in cognitive science. And the question that these researchers were interested in was the kind of philosophical question about how to understand what we even mean when we talk about happiness. So for example, suppose that we pick out a particular person and we posed the question, is this person truly happy? The philosophical question now is, what does that question even mean? What is it that we're really trying to ask when we ask that kind of question? And a typical answer that a lot of people have thought might be right is that in asking that question, we're basically just asking a question about this person's states.

Speaker 2:          03:00          So a person would be considered happy to the extent that that person has high positive effect. So a lot of positive emotions to extend through the person has low negative effort. So very few negative emotions. And finally, to the extent that the person has a lot of life satisfaction there is to say has to believe that her life is fundamentally going in the right direction. So according to this view, as long as you have these certain kinds of psychological states, be right to say that you are happy. But some philosophers have thought maybe that view is not quite right. Maybe there's actually more to the story. Maybe there's something further going on. So those, for us, we thought maybe we can actually develop a counter example to this kind of general theory about what happiness is all about. So this thought is basically this. Suppose we mentioned someone who has all of the states, someone has a lot of positive emotion, very little negative emotion, someone who was extremely satisfied with the way her life is going.

Speaker 2:          03:51          But now suppose we imagine because that person has a really evil, nasty sort of person. Supposedly. Imagine that her life is fundamentally kind of Vapid and meaningless and she has no real friends, that she's cruel and various ways to other people to suggestion that these philosophers mid then was that even if she has all of these kinds of psychological states, we might say that she's not truly happy. So on this kind of view, maybe it's not right to say that happiness is just a matter of having these kinds of states. So now we face the question, we started out with this idea from philosophy and idea that maybe happiness is more than just a matter of having these certain kinds of psychological states and we do not want to use these methods from psychology to test that idea out to see if it's actually correct.

Speaker 2:          04:37          And the way we're going to do this is by presenting participants with certain kinds of stories, but people have various kinds of lives and then asking those participants whether the people in the stories actually are happy. So each participant is going to be randomly assigned to get either a story about someone who's leading a good life or someone who's leading a bad life. In the actual experiment, there were four different pairs that participants can be randomly assigned to receive, but just to kind of give an example to give you a sense of what this experiment was like. We're just going to pick one of these pairs and you can see what happened in the good life condition and what happened in the bad life condition. So participants in the good life condition, it received a story about someone who has a really angelic, wholesome, wonderful form of life, so they were told, Maria is the mother of three children who all really love her.

Speaker 2:          05:25          In fact, they couldn't imagine having a better mom. Maria usually stays pretty busy taking care of her children. She often finds herself rushing from one birthday party to the next and it's always going to pick up some groceries or buy school supplies. Well, Maria has been preoccupied with her children. She does get to see her old friends occasionally, almost every night. She ends up working on some project for the next day or planning something for our children's future. And then these participants were given some information about Maria psychological states in particular that they were told that she has a whole lot of positive effect, very little negative effect. And then she has a great deal of life satisfaction. And then just to make sure that participants really accepted this information, they were given some simple reading comprehension questions, just true or false questions in which they're asked.

Speaker 2:          06:09          Is it really the case that she has a lot of positive effect, very little negative effects and very high life satisfaction. And just as you might guess, participants overwhelmingly answered true to all of these questions and then came the real question. Given all this information, is it right to say that Maria is, how can you, so this first kiss might seem like a relatively simple one, probably you don't feel very conflicted as far as you find yourself trying to answer this question, but participants in the other condition got a story about another and Maria, what a very different form of life. So in this condition, participants were told Maria wants to live the life of a celebrity in La. In fact, she has even started trying to date a few famous people. Maria usually stays pretty busy trying to become popular. She often finds herself rushing from one party to the next and there's always going to pick up some alcohol or address.

Speaker 2:          06:59          Maria is so preoccupied with becoming popular that she's no longer concerned with being honest or nicer old friends unless they know someone famous almost every night she ends up either drunk or doing some type of drug just like the famous people. She wants to be like, see, this life was described in such a way as to make it as Vapid as meaningless and as callous as possible. And then after this information was given, participants were told about Maria psychological states and what they were told was just exactly the same information as in the other condition. So participants were told that she has a whole lot of positive emotions, very little negative emotions, and then she's highly satisfied with her life. Just can't even imagine anything that you'd rather be doing. So participants in this next condition then received again the exact same reading comprehension questions is the first participants.

Speaker 2:          07:48          So once again participants were asked, is it really the case that she has a lot of positive effects, very little negative effect and high judgment of life satisfaction. And once again prisons overwhelmingly answered yes to all of these questions and now comes the key question. Participants in this ladder at Quinn condition, we're asked is it right to say that Maria is happy? So participants have just indicated that Rhea has high positive affect, low negative effect, high judgments of life satisfaction. So if the fact that all there is to being happy, they should obviously say yes, of course she's happy, that's just what it means to be happy. But if the philosophers are right that something is more is going on here, then participants answer might actually be slightly different. And if you look at the results, will you find is that that's exactly what occurred in each of the cases where a person described as having a good life.

Speaker 2:          08:36          Participants overwhelmingly agreed that that person actually was happy. But if you turned out to the case in which the person was described as having a bad life, you find this strange kind of reluctance. Even though the person's described as having all of their psychological states, we'd associate with happiness, people are giving that person a happiness ratings right around the mid point you who that person is unhappy nor that the person is truly happy. So what is going on here? Why is this occurring? Why is it that when someone has a bad life, people say that she's not truly happy. So we were really puzzled by this result and it's still very difficult to figure out why it's happening. We wanted to try out one particular possibility. So in particular I teamed up with George Newman from the school of management and Paul Bloom from developmental psychology and we tried to test out the idea that maybe the effect here has something to do with the notion that people have a kind of true self, I kind of essential self or self or they have really deep down.

Speaker 2:          09:33          So the hypothesis here is maybe people think of the sophos having certain kinds of layers on the surface of the self. You might think it's something like the superficial stuff, just the way that yous people seem to be feeling if you just looked in the most superficial way, but then maybe people think there's also something deeper that fundamentally at the kind of core of a person's being like something further, something that we might call the true self. And in particular we thought that maybe people's moral judgments seem to have an impact on our intuitions about what's going on at this deeper level. So suppose that at a superficial level, a person seems to be really happy with things that are totally bad. So even though they're doing something that's really wrong or cruel to others, they seem to be completely satisfied with it. We thought maybe people think that in such a self there's some deeper core fundamental essence that's calling on them to do something good.

Speaker 2:          10:25          But importantly we thought that this would affect would be asymmetric if on the surface someone was doing something good, we thought people wouldn't think deep down at the core of their being. There was something calling on them to be more a bad. So we tested out this hypothesis with a simple experiment. They used a three by two design. So participants in one condition got a whole mix of different stories. Some of our people who are on the surface, we're doing something bad. Some of our people who on the surface we're doing something good and some of our people who are doing on the surface doing something neutral. Then participants in the other condition just got their reverse of each of those stories. So the bad stories, by reversing them, it turned into good stories. The good stories when they reversed turn it about stories and the neutral stories when reversed remained neutral.

Speaker 2:          11:11          And then in each of these cases participants were just asked whether there was some fundamental layer of the person's self. There was calling that person to do something different than what these seemed to be enjoying doing under surface. So just to give you a sense of how this experiment worked. Here is an example of one of the bad vignettes. Participants were taught, Bill has always mistreated his employees. He often yells at them and publicly embarrassing them for minor infractions and has never expressed any interest in trying to impede in to treat his employees better. And then participants were asked how much do you agree with the following statement even though he might not acknowledge it to other people or even at himself and his very essence, there's something deep within bill calling him to stop mistreating has employers. So you can just try thinking this question over for yourself and see whether you strongly disagree with this statement.

Speaker 2:          12:00          Strongly agree or whether you're sort of somewhere in the middle. Then participants in the good condition would receive something like a reversed version of the bad case. Bill has always treated his employees very well. He never yells at them or does anything to publicly embarrassment and has never expressed any interest in treating his employees poorly. And then they just got the same question. Do the agree the, even though he might not acknowledge it to other people or even in soft and his very essence, there is something deep within bill calling him to start mistreating his employers. And finally in the neutral case, participants would get stories that we're completely neutral in their moral Vance. Jim has been a red wine drinker for many years. He only drinks red wine and has never expressed any interest in drinking white wine. So what do you think? Is it the case that even though he might not acknowledge it to other people or even himself and his very essence, there's something deep within him that's calling him to start drinking red, white wine?

Speaker 2:          12:55          Or in the reverse case, if there, if on the surface he's drawn to drinking red wine, is there something deep within him calling him in the opposite direction toward white wine? So we can now look at the results and we're looking at these results, not for each separate vignette, but pulling together all of the vignettes that were had this character of being good. All the ones that are the character of being neutral and all the ones that on the surface had the character of being bad. And what we see here is a linear progression where if someone's on the surface being good, people are very disinclined to say that there's something deep within that person calling them to be bad. If someone's on the surface being neutral, it's at least possible that there's something deep within him calling him in a different direction. But most of all, when someone on the surface is doing from the bad, people are very inclined to think there might be something deep within that person calling that person to do something that's more good.

Speaker 2:          13:46          So it's this idea that we want to capitalize in. What follows, we thought maybe this could be the explanation of the effects that we saw earlier in people's judgments of happiness. So recall the basic idea behind those effects. We looked at people had a good knife and people had a bad life and we found this difference that when people are having a good life, people are more inclined to say that person was happy then where people were having a bad life, even holding fixed. All the information we provided about that person's psychological states. So why is that happening? One explanation would be that it follows from something about the way people are construing the true stuff. So in the good life case, the information being provided says that that on the surface the person is really happy with her life and because she's having a good life, people seem to be assuming the deep down the view that she's feeling having you sort of concordance with the view that she has on the surface, that she really does feel deep down.

Speaker 2:          14:44          That same thing that she appears to be filling on the surface, that this wholesome, angelic life she's living really is a good one. But now suppose we turned to the bad life case. In that case, participants are again told that on the surface she has all of these positive states, positive emotion, very little negative emotion, lots of life satisfaction. But if this kind of theory about the true self is right, maybe participants think that deep down at her core she is actually feeling something very different. The deep down there's something within her calling her toward a different way of life, a way of life. There would be different fundamentally from the one that she's been living so far. So to test out this theory, we presented people with exactly those same vineyards. There were used in the original study to study happiness. So some people were told about someone who has a really angelic list.

Speaker 2:          15:32          Some people were told about someone who has this much more vapid and meaningless life, but then we ask them additional question. So first that each participant was asked that same question that they received in the original case. Is it right to say that this agent is happy or not? But there was also a further variable. Each participant was also asked whether the agreed there. Deep down this agent actually feels very differently about her life from the way she feels on the surface. So now within a single experiment we can measure both people's intuitions about happiness and their intuitions about the true self and we could look at the relationship among these different variables. So we have for each participant whether that participant was in the bad life condition or not, whether the participants said that the agent was experiencing true happiness or not, and whether the participants thought that deep down there was something within that person's true stuff, calling her to lead a different life, we can now look at the relationships among all these different variables.

Speaker 2:          16:34          What we find first is just replicating the earlier study. When participants hear story about 200 is a very bad life, they're less inclined to think that that person is truly happy, but we're also getting this other effect. When someone has a bad life, there are more inclined to say that the person that feels very deeply differently deep down in their true south. And finally, if you look at this variable and this one, you find that the more participants think that deep down in someone's shoes off, there's something calling them towards a different way of life, the more they think that the person is not truly happy. So we can now use a statistical technique called mediation analysis to examine the impact of all these variables. And what we find is that the impact of the bad life on people's happiness judgments is mediated by true soft judgments.

Speaker 2:          17:21          In other words, what seems to be happening is that when you hear the tone is a bad life, you conclude that there's something deep within that person. The person's choose off that's calling them to live in a different way. And it's that that makes you think that that person's not truly happy. So to recap now that path of the whole discussion so far, we saw that philosophers have thought that there's an impact of morality and judgments of happiness. And in particularly as the thought that if someone's living a life that's really immoral, it'd be wrong. And somehow it seems strange to see that that person is truly happy. We wanted to do is to test that hypothesis. Do people actually feel that way and to figure out why people feel that way if they do? So, first of all, we found that people do seem to have that intuition.

Speaker 2:          18:07          They think that if your life is morally bad, you can't truly be happy. And now we seem to be getting some insight into at least one possible explanation of why it might be a crime. Maybe what's happening is that people's ordinary understanding of happiness isn't just an understanding of feeling positive emotion, not feeling negative emotion, having a lot of life satisfaction, but rather involves something sort of deeper, more fundamental. Maybe it involves a certain kind of contentment, not just on the surface of the self, but deep down at the level of the truce off. Thanks so much.

Speaker 1:          18:37          So thank you so much for that. Fantastic guests lecture, Josh. Now what we're going to do is move to our takeaway questions for today. So our takeaway questions from our very special guest lecture by Dr Josh Nobe are as follows. First, what are the three components of happiness that were discussed today? Second, what were the key distinctions made between the good life and the bad life and yet that were depicted today and how did these distinct moral yet influenced participants' descriptions and understanding of happiness? Finally, can you describe the true self theory discussed today and what where it relates to our understandings of happiness? And now I'd like to conclude with our expert interview. This is part of our experts in emotion interview series today for our experts and emotion interview. We'll be speaking with Dr. Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard University on happiness. Dr. Gilbert, um, is a professor of psychology and has won numerous awards for his research and teaching, including the American Psychological Association's Distinguished Scientific Award for an early career contribution to psychology.

Speaker 1:          19:43          And in 2008, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Here's 2007 book stumbling on happiness. Spent six months on the New York Times bestseller list has been translated into 30 languages and was awarded the Royal Society's General Book Prize for the Best Science Book of the year. In 2010 he hosted and cowrote the award winning Novus television series, this emotional life, which has been seen by more than 10 million viewers. He's also a contributor at a time, the New York Times, and NPR is all things considered and has been a guest on numerous television shows, including the today show, Charlie rose 2020 and the Colbert report. So finally, his first head talk on happiness is now one of the 15 most popular of all time. So I now turn to our very special experts in emotion interview together with Dr. Daniel Gilbert on happiness.
