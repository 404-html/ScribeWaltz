Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi, welcome back to human emotion. Today we're going to talk about the way in which emotions shape our judgements and decisions. And in particular we're going to look at how they shape those decisions when it comes to money. So can emotion really shaped the way we spend our money, shaped the way we think about our money and shape how important money is to us. So in essence, we're going to be returning to the question that we actually address in our very first lecture. Does our wallet actually reflect our feelings? Can money buy happiness? And how emotions influence our everyday consumer decisions that we make from how to spend money, whether or not to donate to charity, how to manage our purse strings during difficult economic times. And importantly perhaps how to even save for our future emotional self. So this will be our first module in a three part module and judgment and decision making.

Speaker 1:          00:53          And today what we're going to do is look into a broad framework that will help guide our thinking called the appraisal tendency framework. And by doing this we're going to start to answer the question of can ceiling really shape our choices and in particular shape the kinds of economic choices they make and everyday life. And in this we will be answering some of the biggest questions that you know behavioral economists grapple with today as well as emotion researchers too. We're going to do this by first going over what is the appraisal tendency framework and in what way is it relevant to the way we think about making judgments and especially when it comes to money. Then we'll look at some of the important or supportive empirical evidence for the appraisal tendency framework followed by our takeaway questions and expert interview with one of the most renowned scholars in the field. So let's start with the appraisal tendency framework. What exactly is this and who originated it in the first place? So here we turned to the work of Dr Jennifer Learner at Harvard University who pioneered this idea of what we now call the ATF for appraisal tendency framework. So I'm, what I'm going to do is walk you through some of the core components of what this framework says in terms of how emotions shape the kinds of judgements and decisions that we critically make in everyday life.

Speaker 1:          02:11          So the first principle of this model, again, which is a framework to help understand how exactly emotions influence consumer decision making suggests that indeed there are two different types of emotional influences on judgment and choice. And these are called integral and incidental emotions. So integral emotions are the subjective experiences of emotion that are relevant to the present judgments and choices that we make. For example, think about the amount of fear that one experiences and how that influences how much you're willing to gamble, right? This is compared with incidental emotions, which are the influences of emotions that we think should be a relevant or have nothing to do with the kinds of judgments and choices we make. So, in other words, think about the emotions that are produced when listening to music or you know, bad weather and just how the emotions may actually shape things that seem totally unrelated, such as the kind of music you choose to listen to or the kind of judgements you have about weather.

Speaker 1:          03:10          And so in other words, the appraisal tendency framework here is actually focusing on these incidental emotions are again, the kinds of emotions do you think should have nothing to do with the everyday choices and judgments that we make. And in fact, most people would deny that these kinds of incidental emotions actually influenced decision making. Now what we're going to see as we walk through it is that they actually profoundly shaped the way that we make choices, especially when it comes to economic choices. So the second principle here of this framework is this idea that it goes beyond valence. So this framework doesn't just focus on the valence. So that is whether an emotion or is positive or whether an emotion is negative, but instead looks at what we have talked about earlier in the course as the underlying cognitive appraisal dimensions that are associated with emotions.

Speaker 1:          03:57          In other words, what are the kinds of evaluations or thoughts? In other words, that kind of cognitions you have when you're in a particular emotional state. Do you have appraisals of feeling that you have more certainty over your world and more certainty over the future? A sense of control or a relative lack thereof? And we'll go through different emotions that really vary depending on these really vitally distinct cognitive appraisal dimensions. The third component of this appraisal tendency framework focuses on what is called appraisal tendencies. So as you can see here, it suggests that emotions give rise to specific cognitive predispositions or ways of evaluating the environment. So an appraisal as we talked again about earlier in the course when we looked at different theories of emotion, we know that appraisals are associated with an emotion and will predict how it influences both the content and depth, whether it's sort of more shallow or deep.

Speaker 1:          04:53          Of the kinds of judgments we make. Then we have this, uh, you know, component called the match matching constraint. So here the appraisal tendency framework really focuses again on incidental emotions, the kinds that we don't think should be relevant to everyday decision making. And again, the kind that wants, again, most people deny that these influenced decision making. So here we're going to look specifically at this category of emotions. And finally there's this idea of deactivating conditions. So the effects of emotions on decision making. Really Wayne, when the emotion deintensify intensifies or deactivates, and by contrast, the effects of emotion should intensify when the emotion activates or or increases in magnitude. So this is the appraisal tendency framework that Jennifer learner put forward to really understand how emotions and in particular incidental emotions, profoundly shaped the kinds of everyday decisions and judgments he make. So what is the evidence in support of this framework and how can it be relevant to the of economic decisions that we make in our everyday lives?

Speaker 1:          06:00          So here we're going to do is turn to our second point on the roadmap where we look at evidence. Um, and in what way evidence does support this framework we just walked through. So these are some really fun empirical studies. Um, and one of the studies that, uh, Jennifer Learner and colleagues did that was an empirical test of the appraisal framework tendency model is testing this idea of what's called the carryover idea or carry over effect. And again, this suggests that incidental or unrelated emotions may actually quote, carry over to influence the way in which we spend our money and make important economic decisions.

Speaker 1:          06:40          So you'll see here in this article by Jen Lerner and colleagues, um, that she really looked at this idea, um, called heartstrings and purse strings, the carry over effects of emotions on economic decisions. And this is one of your readings and we'll walk through some of the main findings right now. Precisely what way do emotions really sort of have this carryover effect on our economic decisions? So what this study did is it was first focused on, um, really leveraging off one of the most robust principles and behavioral economics that's called the endowment effect. So, in other words, people often place a higher value in objects they own versus those they don't. So an example is that people might, will often demand a higher price on a coffee mug that's given to them as opposed to one that they did not own in the first place. So in other words, we put higher value on things that are endowed to us versus those that really are not endowed to us are those which we don't own.

Speaker 1:          07:41          So this is the endowment effect. And so Jen Lerner took this endowment effect one step further and in her study, as you can see here, what she did is she looked at three different kinds of emotions and she studied them, um, by eliciting them through some of the most validated kinds of emotional homes that we talked about earlier in our lectures on emotional dissertation. So she elicited a relatively neutral or nonemotional state, a disgusting state in a state of sadness. And then what you see here in these two different columns are two different conditions. So the first that you see here is what she called the choice condition, right? So the choice condition was, um, a condition in which participants were shown an object which they did not own and they were asked what price would they prefer to buy this object for? This was compared with the cell condition here.

Speaker 1:          08:32          This is where the participant by contrast was endowed with or given an object and then asked again, what price would they prefer to sell it back for? So again, the choice condition, they were shown an objects they didn't own and asked how much they would buy it for and the cell condition they were endowed with or given an object and then ask what price they would prefer to sell it back for. So these are some of the films that she used to elicit, um, the sad and discussing emotion that were shown earlier. And these are widely Lee's films that we saw earlier in the course. The sad film is a film from the champ where it's a young boy crying over the death of his father. And the discussing film is from the movie trainspotting where a man is going through and digging through this, like really discussing like feces infected toilet.

Speaker 1:          09:18          While he's gagging. So these are films that have been reliably shown to illicit both sadness and disgust. So, um, you can see just a little sample of the film here for the disgusting film where he's going to the toilet. Pretty disgusting, right? And he's digging through it, gagging and most people weren't high intensity or degrees of disgust. I won't make you watch any more, but you get the, you get the gist. So what happened when she had people view these different films and they were assigned to either the choice or the cell condition? In other words, the questions she tried to ask in this study is how can emotions elicited in the lab using films? Actually quote, carry over to influence seemingly unrelated economic choices, right? How would that have anything to do with these kinds of choices we make? How much we're willing to buy or sell an object?

Speaker 1:          10:13          So here's what she found. So this idea here, if we walk through, um, in other words, it's the question really quickly of in what sense the era's depicting here. Do these emotions literally carry over to influence these seemingly unrelated economic choices in both the twist condition or sell condition. So here's one thing that the authors had specific predictions about when they were testing this model about exactly how emotions would influence this endowment effect. So they hypothesize that this emotion of disgust that was elicited using that film clip you saw brief from trainspotting, um, would have the following effects. So discuss has this core appraisal theme of, you know, being too close to some sort of indigestible substance. And so as we saw earlier and we were walking through some of the basic emotions in our course, we saw that, you know, the associated behavior of discussed is really to expel objects away from the self, right and avoid taking a new objects.

Speaker 1:          11:12          So the prediction that learner in colleagues made is that after eliciting this kind of emotion of disgust, what they would predict to see is reduced selling prices. So trying to expel the object away and reduced choice or buying prices. So avoid taking in. So for sadness, we know the core appraisal theme is a theme of loss and helplessness. And the associated behavior is a desire to change one circumstances. So it learner and colleagues predicted is that you would see reduced selling prices and increased buying prices. So again, this is this desire to change when circumstances and really sort of remedy these themes of loss and helplessness. So here's what they found. So again, we have the neutral condition in white disgust and yellow and sadness and blue. And what if you look at disgust in the middle of what you see is that consistent with the idea that discussed is associated with expelling objects regardless if you are buying or selling them discussed really wiped out this traditional and well established endowment effect in behavioral economics by showing reduced prices overall and creating no statistical difference between prices in dollars between the cell and choice conditions.

Speaker 1:          12:22          If you look on the far right though, by contrast and the sad condition in blue, consistent with the idea that sadness is associated with a desire to change your current circumstances, sadness, decreased prices in the selling condition and increased prices in the choice condition. In other words, individuals following a sad film induction sold for less money. And offered more money to buy or choose the object. This is really a sense, um, you could think of it as they'd be reversed or opposite of the endowment effect. So what you're seeing here is that emotions can dramatically shift this well established endowment effect that's associated with both how we buy and how we sell seemingly unrelated objects. Um, you know, that seemed to have nothing to do with our current emotional state of feeling disgusted or sad. So we walked through the appraisal tendency framework. We looked at some evidence, some really striking evidence that suggests that, you know, discreet emotions, even of disgust or sad, can radically change the way we both sell and buy our money and even reverse some of the most well established principles and behavioral economics looking at the endowment effect.

Speaker 1:          13:30          So now we're going to turn to our takeaway questions to summarize some of the main questions that you should glean from this first lecture. Thinking about judgment and decision making. So the first question focuses on what are the core principles of the appraisal tendency framework that we went through today. Second, what is the distinction between these integral and incidental emotions, disgust and which of these two emotion categories is most central to the appraisal tendency framework. Finally, what is the empirical evidence that we discussed towards the end of our lecture today and sport in support of this model and what distinctions are rose for discussed versus sadness. And now we'll turn to our expert interview with the true founder of this appraisal tendency framework as part of our experts in emotion interview series. So today we'll be speaking with Dr Jennifer Learner, a professor of public policy and manage management at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government on emotion and judgment.

Speaker 1:          14:33          Dr Lerner is a professor of public policy and management at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, as well as the founder and former director of the Harvard Laboratory for decision science. This interdisciplinary laboratory, which she cofounded with two economists, draws primarily on psychology, economics and to study human judgment and decision making. Dr Lerner publishes her research widely and scientific journals, summaries of which appear in popular print, such as the New York Times, as well as broadcast media such as good morning America. She also serves on the editorial boards for the Journal of Personality and social psychology, organizational behavior and human decision processes, and the Journal of Behavioral Decision Research. She's received numerous awards for her research, including the presidential early career award for scientists and engineers, and in a White House ceremony, the National Science Foundation and the president of the United States annually confer this award as the highest national honor for investigators in the early stages of promising research careers. So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview on emotion and judgment with Dr Jennifer Learner.
