Speaker 1:          00:00          Today we'll be speaking with Dr. James Gross from Stanford University on emotion regulation. Dr. James Gross is a professor of psychology at Stanford University. He received his BA in philosophy and psychology from Yale University and phd in clinical psychology from UC Berkeley with subsequent postdoctoral training at Uc San Francisco. Dr. Gross is widely regarded as the pioneer in the field of emotion regulation and his work has received numerous awards including early career awards, um, from the society for psychophysiological research in early career award from the American Psychological Association Outstanding Young Researcher Award from the Western Psychological Association and countless teaching awards such as an award for teaching excellence at Stanford University, such as the Walter j Gorgeous Award for excellence in teaching the Bass University fellow and undergraduate education and a postdoctoral mentor new award from Stanford University. His work has been supported by numerous grants from the NIH, NSF, the Nid among others. He's also published over 200 papers and edited the authoritative handbook of emotion regulation. So I now turn to our experts in emotion interview with Dr. James Gross. So welcome James. Thank you for speaking with us today. Pleasure. I want it to begin with talking with you about how you first got started in studying emotion. So could you tell us a bit about what first sparked your interest in emotion

Speaker 2:          01:33          June? That's a great question. I've been interested in emotion for as long as I can remember. Uh, academically, the source of my interest comes from a longstanding interest in philosophy where at least in the western tradition, there's this rich history of questions around the role of reason versus passions and guiding behavior. And as I wrote philosophy paper after philosophy paper at Yale as an undergraduate, I, I found that the core of my interests really revolved around problems, about when reason should be in control and when passions, including emotions should be in control. And that's what laid the foundation for my work in psychology, trying to understand empirically how to balance the two.

Speaker 1:          02:18          Oh, that's fascinating. So you had this philosophical interest in the nature of emotion that you're later able to tackle with empirical tools. Exactly. Right. So speaking of empirical tools is actually, I have a few questions I'd like to ask you about your research. Um, so we can all relate to emotion in our everyday lives, but it seems like defining things like emotion and emotion regulation are really a thorny and tricky issue. So as an expert in this field, I was curious to hear how you think about defining what emotion is and how it's different from emotion regulation.

Speaker 2:          02:49          That's a great question. Uh, in everyday life I think there's a very strong sense in which we make a distinction between the emotions we have and the things do to manage or change those emotions. And so in our work we find it useful to map onto that intuitive or lay distinction. And what we have in mind is something I think fairly straightforward in many circumstances. Uh, an emotion might start, we might start feeling angry with a spouse or a child and as that anger and folds coloring our thinking, our facial behavior, our physiologic responses, as we become aware of that anger, we may feel that that's not the right response. That's not a helpful response in this circumstance. And so try to modify or change how that anger is playing out. We may try not to show it or may even try not to feel it.

Speaker 2:          03:42          And it's that late distinction between the emotion on the one hand and efforts to modify or change it that we're trying to map onto when we make a distinction between emotion reactions on the one hand and emotion regulation on the other. Another context for this distinction that's important to us is uh, how it plays out between people because emotions aren't just things that happen inside a person, but also things that happen, uh, very importantly between people. So for example, with a child or a spouse or a parent that the other person may be in an emotional state, let's say of sadness where let's take the case of a child, someone, uh, is very, very disappointed and upset at something that's happened at school. And it's often the case, particularly for young children, they don't have the skills yet to manage or modify their own emotions.

Speaker 2:          04:34          And so they may come to a parent or older sibling for help and regulating emotions. And in that case too, I think it makes sense to try to distinguish between the emotions that are playing out in the child and the regulatory processes that are invoked in the key in this case with bio helping other. And so I think what's important June and thinking about this debate about whether it makes sense to distinguish between emotion reactions on the one hand and emotion regulation on the other is to ask for what purpose local purpose are we making this distinction. And I think part of the confusion in the literature is that some people looking at this distinction say, well that's not a distinction about real things in the world. That is to say you can't guarantee with necessary and sufficient conditions. You can always distinguish between an emotion generative process and an emotion regulatory process.

Speaker 2:          05:30          And my response to that is that, uh, I take more of a, um, instrumental, uh, perspective and, and think that this kind of distinction isn't so much about defining natural kinds in the world as it is about creating contexts in which we can ask and answer empirical questions that matter to us. And so this is a distinction of convenience and I think in some cases it's easy to draw the line between emotion generation and regulation as in the cases I've given. But in other cases it becomes more blurry. And that I feel from an instrumental perspective it's not a problem because in those cases we might not want to make such a tight distinction between the two.

Speaker 1:          06:14          That that's great. And it relates to what I was going to ask you more about, which is you really laid out this roadmap or process model of emotion regulation that really has shaped the way we all think about, um, not only when emotion regulation strategies occur, but what specific kinds of strategies or ways we use to manage our emotions. And I was wondering, when you think about sort of the future of where emotion regulation is headed, do you see this model changing or growing over time? And in what ways?

Speaker 2:          06:41          June, uh, the process model of emotion regulation is meant to be a, a framework within which we all can think about how emotions play out over time and how they can then be modified either by ourselves or by other people. And I emphasize it's a framework rather than a well developed model. And the distinction for me rests on the idea that this is just an initial sort of draft of a workspace that will absolutely evolve as we fill in with more understanding and more knowledge. And so for me, the framework a really rests on a couple of very basic assumptions that emotions develop over time. They change over time in a context sensitive fashion. Uh, they may vary dramatically across context and across people, but the, as we see emotions play out in ourselves and in others, we can usefully draw attention to the ways that we and others may try to change that emotion trajectory.

Speaker 2:          07:38          And as you say, I've tried to distinguish among five families of regulatory processes ranging from very early efforts to intervene, to change the emotion. It's playing out too much later, uh, interventions. And I think there's gonna be lots of change in that space. I think it's a very generous space. Um, they're really rests on these very basic assumptions that I think there's every reason to think well, have, um, a utility as we move forward. But there are loads of other questions. I think that this kind of model, um, requires that we ask, for example, we need to ask questions about how people actually are trying to modify their own emotions and others' emotions. And we are only beginning to understand how people go about regulating their emotions, not just what they do, but, but what their emotion regulation goals are. And from a, from a lay perspective, you might think it's easy. People try to turn down bad emotions and turn up good emotions. But what does that mean? It's certainly not as simple as, uh, always trying to, uh, to do away with negative emotions once it feel yucky or increase emotions that feel good. There are many instances, as you know, very well from your work where we want to turn down positive emotions and perhaps turned up negative emotions. So that's an example of the way that I think this framework will need to grow as people do more work on the processes involved in emotion regulation.

Speaker 1:          09:09          Yeah. Thank you. And as you think of this sort of process model or framework emerging and growing, I do you see any certain types of influential tools or methodologies that are going to be most critical on these next steps?

Speaker 2:          09:22          No, I think there's going to be a mix of um, advances that are going to be really important in this space. Um, some of these are going to be theoretical as we really try to better understand the larger context within which people are regulating their emotions. I've said that in my own work we focused on trying to draw some distinctions among processes that people use to modify the emotion trajectory. But I've said that we need to broaden our view to understand not just what people are trying to do but why they're trying to do it. And I think we can learn quite a bit from other related, uh, research efforts to understand motivated behavior more generally and goal directed behavior more generally asking in this case as in other cases, not just what people are doing and why they're doing it, but how this plays in with all of the other many goals that we have as we move through life.

Speaker 2:          10:15          And so part of the, uh, I think effort will need to be theoretical. So conceptual advances in our thinking, um, borrowing as we can from other, uh, theoretical traditions. I think another important growth point for us will be not just theoretical but empirical. And here we're at a working in a really exciting time where there as you know, very well or range of new tools, uh, more sophisticated approaches to behavior analysis, more sophisticated approaches to tracking people's subjective experience as it evolves over time, but also neuro biological assessment tools, functional imaging techniques as well as, uh, procedures for a better understanding, uh, people with various types of brain damage and in healthy individuals, uh, better understanding the role of particular brain systems through inactivation procedures. Uh, uh, such as tms, transcranial magnetic stimulation. So I think there's a range of tools, both conceptual and empirical that will be brought to bear to help us better understand how people manage their emotions as they unfold.

Speaker 1:          11:25          And I know in your more recent work, you've driven it in a direction that's really interesting, sort of relating emotion regulation to clinical health, health outcomes, and in particular focusing on social anxiety disorder. Um, what have you found when you think about and research social anxiety disorder? How do you characterize the nature of emotion regulation and the ways that may be going awry?

Speaker 2:          11:46          June? Uh, you know, one of the strategies that we and others have used is to try to understand emotion processes by looking at clinical contexts such as social anxiety disorder. And, uh, one of the surprises I think for us as, um, as been the case for other people who've used effect of science approaches to better understand clinical phenomena is that everything isn't exactly as we had expected it might be. Um, and I think that really is a testament to the value of applying effect of science measures. And, and con, uh, conceptual, um, um, sort of rubrics to these complex clinical phenomena. For example, just give you a quick example. Um, in social anxiety disorder, uh, people, uh, are often quite impaired, unable to interact with others socially unable to work as they'd like to, uh, um, outside the home and, uh, this can be really debilitating disorder.

Speaker 2:          12:46          And the core of the disorder in the diagnostic and statistical manual is heightened levels of anxiety. And that led us to the, you know, straightforward assumption that when we carefully assessed people in the laboratory using functional imaging, that we'd be able to easily distinguish between the emotional responses to have people with social anxiety disorder on the one hand and healthy matched controls on the other in terms of the magnitude of the emotional response in some of these brain systems such as the Amygdala insula that are thought to be important to emotion generation. To our surprise, what we're finding in these, uh, laboratory contexts is that when we build, uh, relevant, um, socially rich, uh, stimuli, and we show these to participants who are either characterized as having social anxiety or our match controls, you don't have the disorder. We see robust responses, physiologic responses in both groups that are often indistinguishable.

Speaker 2:          13:51          Now that's not to say that subjectively people with social anxiety aren't suffering and reporting very high levels of anxiety. But when you look at some of the core brain systems that are thought to subserve emotional responding, we see often no differences, uh, in, uh, these brain systems response in these contexts. And this is in context after context. Um, and what that tells me is that our conceptions of emotion reactivity as being simply greater and social anxiety across the board as compared to healthy controls or too simple that there's a response fractionation such that subjectively, in certainly there are parts of the brain other than these core brain systems that are thought to be important to emotion generation that must reflect this difference. But the simple assumption that there's obvious and gigantic reactivity differences is too simple. Misses the mark. I think another surprise for us is related to the notion that people with social anxiety have much greater reactivity is the idea that they uh, cannot use appropriate regulation strategies.

Speaker 2:          15:00          That the reason that they have greater reactivity is that they simply can't use a healthy strategies like reappraisal, which involves thinking differently about upsetting situations. And what we found in our laboratory studies is that when appropriately cute and instructed people with social anxiety disorder are just about as good at using reappraisal as healthy controls and that now again as a bit of a surprise and suggests that not that there's nothing to learn here but that we've been focused in the wrong place rather than assuming greater reactivity rather than assuming failures across the board. In regulation, what we think is happening is that people are unable when not queued. So in the real world they're unable to, if they have social anxiety, appropriately invoke skills that they actually have. And that then points I think to a great mystery, which is why aren't they using the skills they have? And that would be an example of the kind of thing we're learning in this work.

Speaker 1:          16:01          Yeah. And when we think about this work, you know, beyond social anxiety disorder, it sounds like there's lessons we could apply to a host of different disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, et Cetera. Do you feel like there's big picture lessons to take away about emotion regulation and psychopathology?

Speaker 2:          16:17          Absolutely. Chan. I think that um, the, the work that we and others are doing on specific disorders such as social anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, um, uh, all, all of these research programs I think are only partly about the specific disorders. And I'm actually much more interested in the general lessons, which I think are, are many that we really need to be careful with our assumptions that a clinical traditions and even diagnostic criteria may not rich to be richly informative about underlying mechanisms that when we come to the table with an assumption about greater reactivity, in one case, diminish the reactivity. And another, we need to be open to the possibility that when we use multiple assessment approaches, we'll see fractionation so that there'll be greater reactivity with some measures and not with others. Um, I think on the regulation side we need to be open to the possibility that the simple starting point of failed regulation, they can't regulate needs to be unpacked. And the reason that's so important to draw these general lessons, I think is that if we want successful intervention strategies, the more sophisticated we can be about what's wrong, the more likely we are to be able to help people make it. Right.

Speaker 1:          17:40          Thank you. So it's been great talking to you about, you know, your thoughts on how we tease a part emotion for emotion regulation. You know, how we think about the future of emotion and where it's headed and now linking it to some clinical health outcomes. And so all of that's been interesting. And when you think now sort of more broadly about the future of emotion, where do you see the, the sort of field headed?

Speaker 2:          18:03          I think that the larger fields we've talked in this conversation about the many exciting growth points as I see them for emotion regulation. Think as I've said, there's room for theoretical advance here, this room for empirical advances, applications to clinical contexts and uh, many other exciting, uh, I think avenues for inquiry even in the narrower domain of emotion regulation and some of our work, for example, we're, uh, extending and this is where they run help run in Israel looking at intractable conflict and how emotion regulation perspectives might actually make a difference in these longstanding intractable conflict. So I think even moving beyond individual level psychopathology and distressed and much larger societal ills, whether in intractable conflicts, uh, or in the classroom, uh, I think there's lots of exciting work to be done even in the narrower area of emotion regulation. I think if we broadened our view and think very generally about the field of emotion and even more broadly to effect of science, there's an incredible amount of exciting opportunities for researchers and students coming into the field today.

Speaker 2:          19:15          I think at play are basic questions about how to conceptualize emotions, whether they're things in the world that were just describing or whether there are things that are psychologically constructed, um, uh, and therefore, uh, you know, uh, amenable to various interventions. Um, I think we need to relate emotions however there conceptualized to other effect of processes like moods, all of this is basic work that still needs to be done. Um, I think because we have new tools, conceptual and empirical tools, we're going to be, I think a learning, an immense amount about how emotions play out, not just in the laboratory but in the real world where they matter, how they play out in social contexts, how they play out over the course of development. And I think there's, in each of these subareas of psychology, whatever one's starting point, a very rich set of questions about the nature of emotion and other affected processes. My particular focus of course is how they can be modified and changed over time. But I think that's just a tiny fraction of the exciting sort of opportunities in this larger space of effect of science.

Speaker 1:          20:25          So if you are talking to students, you mentioned students, you know, and sort of the future they are going to be building in, in learning about emotion and emotion regulation, what kind of advice would you have to these students or people in general who want to learn more about emotion, where, where should they go?

Speaker 2:          20:40          Yeah, so I'm a, as you can hear, very bullish about the future of effect of science. I think if I were, I'm happy to be in the field and if I were advising students, I would say, Hey, this great opportunity here. Um, they're just a very large number of problems, uh, to, to tackle that matter. Um, and I would recommend that they take a good look at the field and the ways that whatever their starting point, they can link affected processes to their, to their own interests. Again, whether it's developmental or clinical or from a health psychology perspective, lifespan, developmental, uh, biological, cognitive, any of the, uh, areas, uh, of the field, however you define them, I think, uh, are richly connected to these effective processes. So I would say this is, this is where a lot of actions going to be happening over the next decade or two in longer.

Speaker 2:          21:34          I would say please take a good look at the field in terms of, uh, how to get started. I think the series that you're building is a really exciting tool. I think they're increasing opportunities for students at different universities in different contexts. Um, as I tell my students, I, you know, when I teach psychology one, if they want to jump in and really see what psychological science in this spaces, like they should join a research lab, whether it's for a summer or whether it's for a longer period of time to really get involved in the sciences being done. I think that's the way to really get a feel beyond reading papers and end up in books, which is an obvious starting point.

Speaker 1:          22:16          Well, it sounds like it's an exciting time for the future of emotion. So I just want to thank you, James for speaking with us today. It's been a real pleasure. My pleasure, Jane. Thank you so much for the opportunity. Yeah. So this concludes our expert in emotion interview with Dr. James Gross from Stanford University.
