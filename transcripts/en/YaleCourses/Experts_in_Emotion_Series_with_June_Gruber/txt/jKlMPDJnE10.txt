Speaker 1:          00:00          So welcome back to human emotion. Um, today we're gonna continue our discussion about this, Nate, the nature of these emotions that are so intimately part of ourselves. So this is the family of self conscious emotions. And we're going to wrap up our discussion about this family of self conscious emotions by focusing today on guilt and shame. So some of our most perhaps socially painful emotions. We're going to explore why we have them in the first place and what sort of social good they actually serve for us. So we've talked about four different self conscious emotions so far, pride, embarrassment, and we've touched on shame and guilt. But today what we're going to do is really delve deeper into the nature of shame and guilt, which we know are in this broad family of self conscious emotions. People have also called them moral emotions. And what seems to be unique about shame and guilt is that they're also associated with some sort of wrongdoing.

Speaker 1:          00:58          So what is it that makes shame and guilt what they are that makes them unique and that makes them part of this family of self conscious emotions. So one of the things about shame and guilt is that they are largely and uniquely human emotions, right? They are also something that are not, that they don't emerge at birth. We don't have them from a very young age, but they seem to sort of take on, you know, a very powerful role in our life a bit later in our development. Um, and importantly, um, I've talked about them as being referred all also as moral emotions in so far as even though there are associated with wrongdoing, they also serve this function that's really focused on helping us, you know, to reign in or inhibit some of our more aggressive, harmful and perhaps socially undesirable behaviors. So they serve this function to help us reign in some of our more uh, undesirable behavioral tendencies.

Speaker 1:          02:05          Now what's interesting too, I think about shame and guilt is that you've heard these words before. We've all heard them and in fact we use them in lay conversation all the time. However we use them interchangeably, right? We sort of refer to feeling ashamed or guilty as one in the same thing. And not only do sort of our everyday friends, colleagues, you know, partners use these words interchangeably, but it seems that even psychologists who work with their clients in a clinical context seem to use some of these words there as well. So we see, for example, here, this is the Dsm or the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. We also see here if you peek into the Dsm here and this is the criteria for major depressive disorder, that what we see here is one of the core associated symptoms or features that I highlighted in blue here.

Speaker 1:          02:57          Our feelings of worthlessness or guilt. So not only is this something that we all know intimately in our lives that we use common, the conversation, but it's even part of the very criteria that psychologists and psychiatrists use to, um, sort of dispense diagnoses, you know, to sort of determine whether or not someone meets criteria for something as severe and chronic as depression. So guilt and shame play a pretty big role in our life. And yet in some ways we have a hard time distinguishing which is which. So when is it shame and when is someone feeling guilty? So I want to show you an example from a recent sort of pop culture reference and have you decide. So what I'm going to do is show you a video of tiger woods where he sort of broadcast his apology to the world for all of his infidelities. You know that he committed against his wife. And I want you to watch closely and decide for yourself whether or not you think what he's experiencing is shame, guilt, or perhaps both. So take a moment to watch this and see what you think

Speaker 2:          04:09          every one of you has good reason to be critical of me. I want to say to each of you simply and directly, I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior I engaged in. I know people want to find out how I could be so selfish and so foolish. People want to know how I could have done these things to my wife feeling and to my children.

Speaker 2:          04:50          And while I have always tried to be a private person, there are some things I want to say. Elan and I have started the process of discussing the damage caused by my behavior. As Ellen pointed out to me, my real apology to her will not come in the form of words. It will come from my behavior over time. We have a lot to discuss and a, however, what we say to each other will remain between the two of us. I am also aware of the pain my behavior has caused. For those of you in this room, I have let you down. I let down my fans

Speaker 1:          05:43          socio watch this video. What do you think? Is this shame or is the skills, and I want you to keep this question in your mind as we now go into the rest of our lecture today and define what is shame, what is guilt and in what ways do they overlap and show similarity and in what ways are they fundamentally different emotions all together. And then we'll return at the end to our beloved. Um, you know, celebrity tiger woods and ask whether or not he felt shame or guilt.

Speaker 1:          06:16          So we're going to start today by first talking about guilt. This will be followed by shame and then we'll compare and contrast guilt and shame followed by our takeaway questions and expert interview. So let's start with guilt. What is it really? So I want you to now think about again, your own experience or a time in your life. You remember feeling really guilty to again, take out a pen and piece of paper and I want you to write down what was the circumstance that led you to feel guilty. I also want you to write down what thoughts were going through your mind when you were feeling guilty. What were you thinking about? Was it about yourself, about the behavior, about other people's perceptions? What were you thinking? And then finally, what do you think the social outcome or purpose of feeling guilty was in that circumstance? Did it motivate you to do any particular behavior or to engage with other people in one way or another? So pause the video, take a few moments to do this. And then when you return, we'll go through what researchers have described, some of the core features of what makes guilt feel so bad and what makes people feel so guilty. And really what good does it serve?

Speaker 1:          07:31          So we touched on the characteristics of guilt in our last couple of lectures. And just as a sort of recap, guilt is really triggered by you having this negative evaluation about yourself. So you're thinking something I'm really sort of, um, powerful about, I'm sorry Nigga value valuation of your action. So this is about some behavior that you performed and you feel bad about it. So you might say like, I can't believe I stole that thing. So you reflect on a behavior you did and you evaluate it in a negative light. This leads you to have negative emotions towards the target and to have some sort of, um, mobilization or, or readiness to address the problem, right? Caused by your behavior that you negatively evaluate. So as a consequence, you feel motivated to address the problem. Maybe it's returning the stolen item, for example.

Speaker 3:          08:26          Okay,

Speaker 1:          08:27          now let's talk again about shame then. So again, what I want you to do, and I think this is really important to do this, to engage in these exercises because what I'm going to have you do is once you sort of compare, write down your own guilt experience, and now engage in your own thought exercise about shame. What I want you to do later is you're going to put them side by side and compare them. So please pause for a moment. Take out a piece of paper and think about a separate time in your life, not the same as what you thought about earlier with respect to guilt. Think about a tiny felt very ashamed. Now again, I want you to think about describing the circumstance that led you to feel this way. What were the thoughts going through your mind and what were some of the social purposes or outcomes as a result of feeling this way? What were you inclined to do? How did you behave around others? Did you engage with others or did you sort of retreat into your own space? So please take a moment to do this cause I assure you that this will be really important when you take your own personal life experiences. Um, as a way to really understand the complex nature of these negative socially painful self conscious emotions. So once you've done that, you can hit play and we'll go back through some of the features of shame.

Speaker 1:          09:42          So again, as a reminder, some of the characteristics of shame that we talked about earlier are that involves a negative evaluation of yourself as a whole. So it's in contrast with guilt, which was about a very local specific behavior here with shame as a whole. You're seeing yourself in this negative light. So instead of I stole that object, it's, I'm a thief. And the behavior that you typically show here again is to sort of have a sense of smallness and sort of inconspicuousness around others. So hunched over posture, try to retreat or high premier social groups. So really your behavior's really mobilized towards hiding and being undetected by others. And as a consequence, you're very unlikely to take a corrective action. You're just wanting to retreat in the whole, feel bad about yourself as a whole and not necessarily do anything to remedy the situation as you would in the case of guilt, for example.

Speaker 1:          10:36          Um, something interesting about shame is that we see some really fascinating cross cultural differences. So here what we're, if you're look here, this is contrasting individualistic cultures on the left. So you can think of the United States is a prime example with more collectivistic cultures. Um, uh, on the right here. So individuals that cultures are really sort of emphasizing the sense of me or I and collectivistic cultures are more about your inner dependence and connectedness to others. So it's more about this sense of us. Now on the left, we know the individuals to cultures. Um, you know, one self identity is really separate from other people and that you sort of follow your own individualized or personalized standards of norms for what are sort of socially acceptable behaviors or behaviors that you, yourself think are appropriate. By contrast here on the right in collectivistic cultures, the sense of one sense of self identity cannot be separated from other people.

Speaker 1:          11:34          Um, yourself and sense of connection to others are sort of part and parcel of the same phenomena or sort of how you think about who you are. Not surprisingly as a result, your standard of norms for what are acceptable or appropriate behaviors are really interpersonal. So they're really about linking you to other people or between other people. So again, what we're seeing is a sense of self and individualistic cultures versus a sense of otherness in collectivistic cultures. So then when we think about the role of shame, what we see here is that we really see it play out more in these collectivistic cultures on the right and it plays less of a pronounced role in individualistic cultures. We'll strike blacked out there on the left. So shame and collectivistic cultures is actually highly valued and esteemed as an emotion. It's also hypercard Nice. So we talked about this earlier and we talked about cultural variation and emotion.

Speaker 1:          12:31          So by hyper cognizant, this is an emotion that plays a central feature in the daily lives of people who are in collectivistic cultures. It's talked about a lot. It's the sort of subject of, you can think of, of newspaper articles, you know, literary critiques, Books, um, what have you. But it's something that's thought about a lot and as part of everyday language in a really powerful way. And as a result, the experience of shame actually does lead people to behavioral changes. They actually are motivated to sort of try to remedy or fix these group norm violations. So a lot of the work that we've talked about so far has really been in the context of individualistic cultures. So I think it's just important to keep in mind that there's always cultural variation and this is one way that culture plays a really powerful role and actually showing here that shamed can lead to ultimate good.

Speaker 1:          13:19          Whereas in more individualistic cultures, as we talked about earlier, it seems not to sort of mobilize people to do much, but they actually sort of retreat and withdraw and remained stagnant. Um, so just keep that in mind with all these emotions, the role of culture. So what I'm going to do now is show some data, um, that's going to directly compare guilt and shame. And with the caveat that this is work that has been done largely in Westernized cultures where we've tried to understand the experience primarily of, you know, us residents in the ways in which guilt and shame are actually similar and distinct. So many of us use these terms interchangeably. In what ways are we justified doing that? Are we really referring to the same thing or are we misusing these words and should really pull them apart and really recognize their nuances and differences.

Speaker 1:          14:09          So let's turn now to how guilt versus shame play out. So I want to start first with some of the similarities between guilt and shame. So here's a list of similarities between these two emotions. So broadly speaking, they're both in the family of self conscious emotions as we've talked about earlier. They're also considered moral emotions and so far as their response to what you can see below some sort of wrongdoing, right, of judging and act as being morally wrong or, or incorrect. Um, and in many ways they have the capacity to try to help promote prosocial or out touristic behavior, even though they're associated with wrongdoing. We largely see them helping, as we said earlier, inhibit aggressive tendencies and promote more prosocial or cooperative tendencies.

Speaker 1:          14:59          They're all so similar in so far as they, we experienced them socially. So we experience these emotions in the context of other people and we think a lot about other people when we feel guilt or shame. Um, but as much as these are similarities in terms of relating ourself to someone else and these emotions being socially inherent, um, the nature of the interpersonal appraisals or the way we think about our role in a social sort of context is actually quite different between guilt and shame. So for example, with guilt, what this is really about is thinking about, you know, a specific behavior perceived by others perhaps is wrong. And so this is really about, you know, guilt as a specific behavior that might be perceived by others as wrong onto the self. Whereas shame by contrast again is part of this kind of Golo noble sense of self evaluation that is negative, that is inherently flawed, that has, that is wrong or defective in some way that is then transmitted to other people.

Speaker 1:          16:05          So you feel yourself that you've done something fundamentally wrong and that this is something that should, you know, be seen easily by others. So what I want to say here is as much as these emotions are both very social in nature and they're really about the way we interact and think of our role in a social context, even within these similarities, we start to see some important differences emerge. And so with that, I want to turn to some of the more salient differences that seem to be apparent when we really pit guilt versus shame side by side. So one of the interesting differences between shame and guilt is the extent to which they focus on what's called local versus global factors. So let's tell you what I mean here. So we're looking at guilt and shame and we see this local versus global distinction. So guilt is thought of as a local focused emotion. So it's focused on something specific so you feel bad about some contained specific behavior. Um, whereas shame is more about global dispositions. So you're not feeling bad about one aspect of yourself. You're feeling bad about yourself very globally. And very generally, right? So it's just sort of diffuse and spreads all out. Whereas skill is very local and contained about a specific instance. Um, so for example, guilt would be, uh, associated with statements such as how could I have done that? Whereas Shane by contrast is how could I have done that?

Speaker 1:          17:42          And so this plays out to, whereas with guilt having these local kind of focus, the person might think there's something wrong with what I did in that specific instance where shame would be more readily associated with, there's something wrong with me overall. So guilt is local shame has a more global focus.

Speaker 1:          18:05          They also differ in the extent to which they motivate people to amend or fix the wrongdoing versus sort of retreat and hide away from it. So again, we're going to pit guilt versus shame side by side. So we see guilt is associated with more amending behavior. So you want to try to correct or redress the wrongdoing where shame, we talked about this, you're sort of, you know, hunter posture over, you withdraw into a corner, you want to hide and sort of get out of the social spotlight altogether as a result. Um, guilt is often associated with this amending behavior where you feel motivated to address the problem, where a shame you really are motivated to hide from the problem to sort of get away from it all together.

Speaker 4:          18:51          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:51          And so, um, as a result, some people have talked about guilt as sort of, you know, facing the music, right? You, you go and apologize, you try to undo the wrong and you try to repair it. Where shame has also often been talked about is trying to sort of duck the heat. So disappear or hide or escape from whatever situation made you feel ashamed in the first place. So guilt motivates us to amend or fix what happened that went wrong. Shame motivates us to hide and get away from it all together.

Speaker 4:          19:22          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:22          And this is a really interesting one because both of these emotions also have different relationships. To empathy. So empathy is this ability to sort of get in the mind of others and understand their emotions, to kind of connect to the thoughts and feelings of other people and shame and guilt are quite different and how they relate to feelings of empathy. So if we put them side by side, we see here that guilt is this very other oriented emotion, right? As much as it's self conscious, it really motivates you to try to connect to the thoughts and feelings of others. And by contrast, shame is very self oriented. It's these global negative feelings about oneself and your attention is really sort of turned inwards in this way. As a result, guilt being other oriented helps you take other people's perspective in a situation where you've done something wrong. Whereas shame being self oriented, you're really sort of taking your own perspective. You're sort of caught up in what, what is your perception of what happened? And as a result, guilt is associated with an increased stability to empathize with other people and shame is associated with a decreased ability to empathize with other people.

Speaker 1:          20:35          Also there's the sense in which there's a defensive versus non defensive attitude about the wrongdoing and guilt and shame also differ quite strongly in this respect. So guilt has a general defensive response associated with it where shame has this more defensive response. And let me give you an example of what I mean. So guilt, having a non defensive response motivates people to try to rationally discuss the situation, to kind of take proactive behavior to remedy the wrong doing or behavior they committed. Whereas shame because it's all about the self and he's a negative overall evaluations, you're more prone to try to blame other people as almost this of this way to escape feeling shamed about yourself. Um, and so for example, as a result with guilt, when we think about emotions of anger, even though you may feel angry, you know, when you've done something that makes you feel guilty, you'll feel sort of agitated about it, you're more motivated to try to manage that anger constructively and proactively.

Speaker 1:          21:35          Whereas shame people are more prone to experiencing greater anger overall, then people prone to guilt, but they also manage their feelings of anger differently. So they're actually, when you're prone to shame, you're more prone to engaging in aggressive behaviors. So again, guilt is a more non defensive way of responding. Shame is a more defensive way of responding. So I want to return now to our example with tiger woods and ask yourself now, after you know, you've learned a bit more about guilt and shame. Did he really experience guilt or did he experience shame? And I won't tell you what the right answer is, but I'd be interested to hear what you think after learning a bit about the nature of guilt and shame. And so with that, I want to conclude with our takeaway questions and then our expert interview. So our takeaway questions for today goes, follows first, what are the key features again, and you elicit or the behavior and the consequence of guilt.

Speaker 1:          22:36          What are the key features, again, elicit her behavior and consequence of shame. And as we just talked about at the end of the lecture today, what were the key areas of similarities? The way in which these two motions showed overlapping features and what were some of the really profound differences that really teased apart the ways in which shame and guilt can actually be quite a significantly different subconscious emotions as well. We'll now turn to our expert interview. So our expert interview as part of the broader experts in emotion interview series today. Um, for our experts and emotion interview. We have the honor of speaking with doctor June Tangney um, on shame and guilt, the good, the bad and the ugly. So Dr Tangney received her phd in clinical psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles and is currently a professor of psychology at George Mason Mason University.

Speaker 1:          23:32          She's a fellow of the APA division of personality and social psychology and the American psychological society. She's authored or edited several books on shame, uh, including and, and as well as guilt and self conscious emotions. These books include shame and guilt, social psychological foundations of clinical psychology, the self conscious emotions, theory and research and the handbook of self and identity. Her research has been funded by the end. Ida and I see HD and SF and the John Templeton Foundation. Um, she's also a very much loved teacher and recipient of the George Mason University's teaching excellence award. So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with doctor June Tangney.
