Speaker 1:          00:00          Our experts and emotion interview today will be with Doctor Matthew Hurts and sign. He received his phd from the University of California Berkeley and he's currently an associate professor of psychology at de Paul University where he directs the touch and emotion laboratory. So his research is conducted with students, um, in three areas including touch and the communication of emotion as well as the prediction of emotion and emotion and infants. His work has received widespread media coverage including NPR, the New York Times, ABC News, BBC scientific American mind and psychology today. So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Doctor Matthew Hertenstein. So what I thought we could start off I'm talking about is just a little bit about hearing your story of what first got you interested in the topic of emotion.

Speaker 2:          00:55          I mean, really briefly, the thing that really got me in emotion was studying babies. Um, as you might imagine, a emotions are the primary means of communication for events. They don't obviously have language. Um, and so babies are really where it started for me. And I still study infants as day, but I also study in dogs as well. So these are really what got me started down the road.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Fantastic. So I want to ask you now a little bit about your journey down the road of emotion and sort of some themes about some of the really exciting research that you've done in this domain. So you're well known for this really exciting and influential work on the nature of touch and emotion. So to begin, for those who may not have heard of this work, how can touch function as a mode of communication in general and human species?

Speaker 2:          01:46          Great question. Um, it's a question that we're, we're getting a handle on, but were there still a lot to learn? There are a lot more questions than answers. Um, but you know, we see touch in our relationships with other people. Um, you know, with our kids, with our siblings that we might have our intimate relationships. So it bonds us to other people. Um, talk is really important in power, a hierarchy. So you see different, ah, facets of touch being used depending on who was powerful, less powerful. So those differential relationships you see touching, um, touched increases liking of other people, usually as long as it's obviously used appropriately and in con proper contacts. Um, so we see it there. Uh, compliance is a big one. There's been a lot of research shows that when we touch other people, when we ask them for something or for help or something like that, touch really increases compliance. So, um, well known study where a medical practitioner touches his or her patient while telling them that it's important to take their medicine. And sure enough, the people who are touched, um, take their medicine more frequently and w uh, as instructed versus the people who in a control condition, you aren't, I still, compliance is also a big, big deal, but what I focus on and it's the how touch communicates emotion in our relationships.

Speaker 1:          03:14          So how can touch communicate emotions?

Speaker 2:          03:18          Well, no, there's a variety of ways. We're just learning about this. I mean, one of the ways is, you know, there are specific receptors within the skin that are, you know, no susceptive or another way, fancy way of saying is just induces pain pretty easily. Right? So there's, so some touches just inherently negative, but then also some touches inherently positive, right? So just in terms of the tactile receptors we have in our skin, um, they're called, those are steaming lane will influence how, what emotions we perceive through that put a lot of it, um, is potentially learning. I mean, like I, I talked to before about babies and emotion, I mean touches fundamental to the relationship between parents and their offspring. Um, so from almost day one were being poached and stroke and cuddled and all this sort of stuff, even though by the way it goes away, um, and most of our, and adolescents in our adult life, which we can have a whole nother discussion about. Okay. Um, but anyway, so there's a lot of learning and it goes on because that can mean that language, so to speak, up of touches the, to us early in line. And then I'm, I have no doubt that through some sort of evolutionary underpinnings to a lot of this, um, and you know, we can see a lot of this too, and we, when we studied chimpanzees or whatnot, um, so it's a of a combination, but teasing these things apart and understanding how they interact is sort of, you know, a future researchers dream.

Speaker 1:          04:43          So one really exciting thing about the work you've done in this domain is you've developed this really innovative paradigm for studying the communication of touch in a laboratory setting. And I wonder if you could share a little bit about this. Um, I know that the work we've done together has used your fantastic paradigm and it's just such an elegant and a unusual way. And some people might think of learning, uh, how we can study, touch in these contexts.

Speaker 2:          05:07          Yeah, I mean, actually it's pretty deceptively simple. Um, we've done it a variety of different ways. The first time, and we did this, we had two people I'm sitting across from each other at a table and that's a barrier between the two people. Um, I clock barrier, so they couldn't see each other that didn't know. You didn't know if a male or a female, Liz sitting across from you to know their age. They never spoke. So you've been telling you that. And then one person was randomly assigned to put their arm underneath the curtain and the other person basically was told to communicate a variety of different types of emotions just on the arm. And, um, the question that we're asking is how accurate are equal at perceiving those emotions. Um, and so we borrowed methodology, um, from other researchers. You've studied the face, the boys.

Speaker 2:          05:57          And so this was all on our own, um, whatsoever. Um, and essentially we found that sure enough, uh, touch communicates you specific emotions. Um, I'm the white, the face and the voice, although some different ones, which we can talk about. Um, but you know, before we did the studies, some researchers tended to think that I'm not all, but some researchers tend to think that touch might communicate positive or negative emotion, but nothing specific or the street. So it's this research line, uh, kind of debunks that idea and shows that we're actually, it's touches a really sophisticated means by which we communicate our emotions. And did you find

Speaker 1:          06:40          specific patterns of touch for distinct kinds of emotions? You could say a little bit about, I wonder if people in the audience are wondering. So how does something like anger look different from love for example?

Speaker 2:          06:50          Right. That's a great question. I mean, here's the take home message about, uh, Bob not, is there is far more diversity in how indicate uh, via touched then there are specific patterns. So we, I'm working on, we, my collaborators and I are working on coming up with clinical prototypes for uh, or refer the tapes of how we might communicate stinky emotions be attached, but there's nothing, uh, it's very difficult to come up with that. I'm partly because of the methodology is very, um, rudimentary right now in terms of measuring touch. And so I wouldn't say easy to measure a facial expression, but there was a system out there, right, that we all know that, um, I'm sure other speakers in your series discussed. Um, but there is no such standardized system and be able to touch. So we're trying to come up with one of those so that we can better get a grasp on what exactly the question you're asking. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          07:49          I mean your work on touch and emotion is also revealed some really important individual differences, right. In how we perceive, you know, this touch signal from other people, sort of what it communicates to us. And for example, I wonder if you could say a little bit perhaps about how men and women may differ, you know, and how they perceive or utilized touches to communicate emotions.

Speaker 2:          08:10          Well, just for a second, let me back up and say that in our herd and we, that we, we'd done both with the arm and then we've got a whole body touch. Sure. Wow. And we found that men and women can communicate a variety of different emotion like fear or sadness or discuss low gratitude, sympathy. All of these are above chance levels that are common between both men and women. And notice, by the way, that somebody, these emotions are the same as what is communicated, um, accurately. In the face and the voice. But some of those emotions are different, um, in the face and the voice. And I think that's a good opportunity for, for future researchers to have to kind of tackle that. So he gets to your question about men and women. Um, I really wish we were in the founding differences, frankly, um, because they sort of support these stereotypes that some people have.

Speaker 2:          09:01          Um, so I wished we went found gender differences, but we did and you know, I have to go where, where nature and so we found, you know, in our, in our paradigm, right, you can have a male, female, female and touching a male or it can have two males where you can have a few females so you can have every gender a combination possible CSP. And we found the only gender combination that was unsuccessful at communicating anger where all female died. So, um, if you get two women together and you tell one to communicate anger to the other, um, they're not above chance doing that. If you have a male involved, um, in, in that grouping, um, they are able to so, so that, so anger seems to be not as easy for women communicate as men. And then the other emotion, again, I wish I didn't find these funny.

Speaker 2:          09:59          I know one of the ones that we found was a sympathy. And as you might guess, um, meaning we're much better at this than men. When you got to have two men together, they couldn't communicate that above chance levels. Um, so again, I wish, I wish I wouldn't have found those, those gender differences. Um, but I, you know, we, and we can only take guesses as to why. I mean is it, I believe it's near harder, the origins, our evolutionary heritage in that, um, you can look to the animal butcher and see some of that. Um, but obviously socialization, you playing a huge role. Um, and I don't think I would want to discount that at this point know.

Speaker 1:          10:45          So one other area of individual differences that I know you and I have talked a little bit about is the role of communicating and proceeding touch and emotional disorders. So, for example, I know you've done some work in individuals with a history of mood disorders like mania. And I wonder if you could say a little bit about how their experience of touch and the way that they, you know, perceive touches might be different from the rest of the population.

Speaker 2:          11:09          That's a great question. Oh, we're just beginning to get a bead on that. And, um, one of our art, it's an a really nice finding, um, that our group was actually done is basically looking at people with people who are prone to high degrees of positive emotion. And those people are, we meet, I'm somewhat more accurate overall at perceiving these distinct emotions. Um, in the paradigm I discussed with you. And I'm not only that, but they tend to over attribute, um, positive emotions to all the touches they, they perceive home, um, uh, people. So this is over attribution of positive emotion, sort of under attribution of negative emotion. So, you know, I don't, we don't fully understand that completely, but we know that there is this individual difference that's, that's coming out of the data. Um,

Speaker 1:          12:01          so everything feels good, right?

Speaker 2:          12:03          Everything feels good and, and they're, they're more accurate, which is pretty surprising in some ways. Um, but maybe it's got another, so, so yeah, there's, so there's that individual, their friends, the gender is really interesting. One and a team in London actually published a paper last year, maybe two years ago, um, showing that romantic relationship status influences perception of touch. So they found that, um, strangers could not communicate embarrassment to each other via touch, but romantic couples could. So there's a nutso relationship status is also seem to play a role. So I think, I think that's the individual difference question is right. Or investigation.

Speaker 1:          12:49          So I wanted to ask you about one other theme in your work and this has all been really interesting hearing you speak about it. Um, one other area in your work has really looked at the way that touch can be used to actually regulate or shaped the emotions that people experience. And I wonder if you could say a little bit about what do you see as the most important discoveries here about how touch can actually serve a regulatory function?

Speaker 2:          13:13          Well, I mean, this is, that's a great question. I would say it honestly, it's too early to really get a good sense of that. Um, I've studied that in those infants. Um, and I think some of the bus working you've been with the infants, honestly like using a touch, caregivers touch with infants to help them understand, you know, what is good and what is bad in the world and how they should understand the world. Um, so if you introduce an object that the baby doesn't quite understand, um, in front of him or her and around the age of one year old or whatnot, um, and you touched them positively, there'll be much more likely to go approach that, that toy, that object. And if you touched them, sort of an, a negative, abrupt manner, the much more loaning to kind of retract and not willing to touch that.

Speaker 2:          14:03          And so you're literally influencing their perception of the objects around them, the world around them, and perhaps their emotional state during that. Um, you know, in terms of adults, um, there's been some work on that question, but honestly, not a lot. Um, one of the kind of promising areas is honestly is looking at sort of this a touch therapy, which I'm not as involved in in my lab. I'm a woman named Tiffany field, done in Florida, has a lot of this work and she's finding they're really, really powerful effects on mood and mental state and astro stock with, you know, this massage therapy or therapy. So it's really great for

Speaker 1:          14:43          really fascinating. So I mean, I know today we've talked about the role that touch touched in communicating, you know, emotions and the work that you've showing. They can actually communicate really distinct types of emotions and can be used to sort of regulate emotions as well. So I wonder as you sort of, you know, moved in this field and really made some landmark discoveries here, where do you see the future of the field moving forward?

Speaker 2:          15:07          Great question. I mean, I, I think, um, uh, a number of ways I can think about it. Number one, looking at physiological underpinnings of all of us. So yeah, I think that's a natural question. Wide Open for investigation. Um, and I mean, you know, central nervous system, autonomic nervous system. Um, so I think that's wide open and we've got some work going on, um, on that question. But I mean it really is wide open and obviously that work has been done for years and the face looking at facial expression of emotion, um, and some of it on the voice, um, but very little touches. I think that's one area. It's wide open. Another one is just looking at how the context of real world situations influenced how pouch is communicated. So a lot of it, uh, my work, especially at the none allow, um, but I think next step is to take it out of the lab, look at this and the real world has some more ecologically valid, uh, um, procedures to use, um, to look at how it touches you used to communicate in watching.

Speaker 2:          16:11          So I think that's wide open individual differences. I still, I mean even though we discovered some new bit of differences in terms of, um, how well people patch out perceptions of that touching when I think that it's a lot to be discovered in that area. And then finally looking at the person as a whole. Right? So we can talk about touches and modality, if he can be Katie, if we can talk about the faces and modality can be Kate or the voice or gesture or whatnot. But how do all of these come together in the real world, um, to communicate emotion, which ones are really driving the communication of emotion and how do they interact with each other? Um, we're just beginning to get a sense of of that and I think, you know, in the next decade or so, um, we should be making some big strides in that area.

Speaker 1:          17:03          So when you have students come to you asking you for advice, you know, who are thinking about embarking in this field of emotion, what kind of advice might you give them?

Speaker 2:          17:12          Big Question. I mean, just in general, in the end, beyond my specific area. Um, I think honestly asking important questions, I'm just really working hard to think about, you know, what you want to put your time into because our time is precious. Resources are precious and you can ask questions and answer them. But the question is, is, are, is what you're studying Wharton, is it really going to make, um, uh, impact on the field? So I would answer important questions, um, because it's just seen so many people ask questions that really don't out too much or maybe a bit, but I mean, if you're gonna spend your time, might as well spend your time on a big question or a set of big questions. So I would, I would definitely give that advice. Um, it's, it's the bonus, I'd say. Uh, not imperative, but a bonus if you can study things that not too many other people studying, um, having room to make some of these discoveries, um, I think is, is wonderful.

Speaker 2:          18:14          So you've done that and other people we know have done that. And so I think studying things that not a lot of people that are involved in, maybe you don't want to be the only one of course, but why I try to study some of the things that you can make a discovery and help further the field. Um, another one is integrating multiple methods I think is always a great thing. In almost any field in psychology. So using physiological measures of self report, measure behavior, all measures, all of these. And trying to bring them together to answer your question, um, in different research designs I think is really important. And then finally, you know, when, when you are in graduate school or what you are doing, your boss doc find to find people that study emotion using these different tools, you know, having great team, um, so that you can really learn from the box I think is really important to you. So asking you to important questions, studying something that ideally nobody knows too much about. Um, integrating multiple methods and then finally finding those people that can help you learn those tools, I think are, are some of the keys to see who pretty providing some good solid research in the field and moving along.

Speaker 1:          19:23          Well, thank you so much. That's excellent advice cause I just want to thank you again for joining us today. Matt, this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Doctor Matthew Hertenstein from de Paul University.
