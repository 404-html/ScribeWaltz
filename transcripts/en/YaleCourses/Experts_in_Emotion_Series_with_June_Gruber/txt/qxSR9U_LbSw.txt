Speaker 1:          00:00          Our experts in emotion interview. Uh, we have the honor of speaking with Dr Marion, the France to consider the question of whether men and women emotionally differ. So doctor La France is a professor of psychology and of women in gender studies at Yale University where she teaches courses in social psychology and gender psychology as well as nonverbal communication. So her research focuses on how emotion and power are transmitted in these subtle emotional communication cues. Some of her recent work has focused in particular on the human smile examining questions such as why do when men smile less than women? Why do women smile when being sexually harassed and to whom do babies show a coy smile? Um, this work has received widespread attention and various media outlets, including NPR, BBC, NBC, The New York Times among many others. So I will now turn to an interview with my local Yo colleague, uh, Dr Marion La France.

Speaker 2:          01:06          One of the things I'd love to speak with you about as we get started is what first kind of captured your interest in emotion in the first place? Kind of where did it all begin for you? Well, I think if I can go right back to the beginning, one of the things that I remember my mother saying to me and my Sibs, which is pay attention to how people say things, maybe even more than what they're actually saying. So facial expression, eye contact, gesture. So she said it matters how things are said. And that was a really intriguing notion, which is if it's how then it means that it's not verbal and if it's not verbal than it must be nonverbal. And the what becomes, what is it that they're really communicating and that's emotion. So that's I think, the, the core routes that's so fascinating because many of what captures our attention and emotion, our own early experiences and observations.

Speaker 2:          02:06          Absolutely. I infect dedicated my dissertation to my mom who, and I said to my mom whose ability to tell what was going on between people was the wonder of my childhood. That's wonderful. So that sparked your interest in emotion. And so I'd love to ask you a few questions now that the many things you've done, you know, since then, um, you know, in trying to understand emotion, gender and we'll talk about the smile as well. Um, so some people believe that, you know, men and women are profoundly different. You know, we've heard that they might even be from different planets. And I guess the question I have for you is, is this really true in terms of our men and women really from different, you know, emotional planets. Um, do we see evidence to suggest that might be the case? I'm going to do the academic thing and say yes and no, but mostly no, that is, it is clear that there's a profound belief that men, women, girls and boys are different.

Speaker 2:          03:02          And the assumption usually is that it is something essential that the differences are not learned, that the differences are not layered over, but in fact come at core from our genetics. It is true that there are some differences. We clearly have different organs and different bodies, but most of what makes us male or female, masculine or feminine comes much later. We acquire it, we learn it, we specialize in it will become experts in it. And the thing that's so interesting actually is if you take little kids and you say, what is your, you've just say do a little boy. What is your mommy look like? You say, do a little girl. What does your daddy look like? They posturely and expressively will do it. It will be recognizably gendered. So the very nature of how we sit, how frequently we, or how quickly we blink, um, many of these things we acquire by virtue of observation and Instruction and learning.

Speaker 2:          04:03          I mean that sounds like from what you're saying, it's not so much that men and women are born different emotionally, but at that, at something over time they learn and they're almost socialized in ways to maybe show emotions differently or maybe even talk about emotions differently. Absolutely. And I think it's all of those things. That is whatever emotion is, it's multi layered. It is. Multicomponent. So we talk about expressive cutty, talk about subjectivity, talk about physiological, talk about brain kinds of things, and at every component that we study, gender is more or less large or small and then more or less variable cross situation. So to say that women are more emotional than men. True in the sense of either self report. So you get women, are you emotional? Yes. Women say they are more emotion, but if you do online kind of coding that is, you asked at this very second, what are you feeling and how intensely are you feeling it?

Speaker 2:          05:04          Then the gender differences and emotion tend to dissipate. Oh, that's fascinating. So what do you think that as we try to understand gender and emotion moving forward, what do you think are some of the most, I don't know, challenging puzzles we're going to face as we try to really tease apart the ways in which men and women are similar, are different. There are a lot of interesting questions. A lot of data has been collected, but we still don't know a lot about under what circumstances are women more emotional than men? And is it more expressive than subjective? That is, if we measure only gender differences in say physiology, there's not much there that suggests that there are profound differences. But if you ask men and women, if you watch men and women, women are much more expressive with their faces, with their voices, with their gestures. It is part of women to be expressive, to be communicative to if you will reach out. And part of masculinity, at least in our culture is to damp it down. Keep it under wraps. Be stoic. Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1:          06:17          So interesting. So one of the things you've also looked at that's relevant to this is, you know, the human smile, you know, and that's something that we're all really interested in. Sort of why do we smile? You know, who do we smile too? What are the rules that govern different kinds of smiles? And you wrote a really compelling book lipservice talking a bit more about this and I just wonder if you could share some of the observations that you detailed in this book is to why do we smile and is this something that can also help us better understand gender differences in emotion by just looking at something as simple as the smile.

Speaker 2:          06:53          Smiley is fascinating for several reasons. One is there is not a culture or a area or historical period in which smiling has not been found. So babies come to birth smile. In fact, we know from studies of babies in the womb actually in letter stage trimester babies are smiling now they're not smiling cause they're having a grand old time. Well, they might be, but we don't know that yet. What happens then is layers of socialization, layers of culture, layers of exposure to different contexts and different social roles. So everybody smiles, but then the question becomes who smiles more under what circumstances? We do know cross many, many, many studies that women reliably smile more than men, but those differences are very, very much a function of what age. For example, you're talking about the largest sex differences in smiling with women's smelling more than men occurs between the ages of about 17 and 23 huh?

Speaker 2:          08:00          After that, the differences basically disappear so that by middle age they're not really profound sex differences. There are also really substantial within sex variations, so some men smile more than other men. Some women smile less than other women and that variability is really quite substantial. Smiling appears to be in part a signal of underlying positive ethic, but smiling is a lot more than that. Smiling in fact is the all purpose mask. When people were feeling anything but happy, they often will smile, so it covers, it allows people to regain their composure, if you will. It holds people off it the flex too much attention. So smiling is, I've sometimes referred to it as a Swiss army knife of interpersonal relationships. It is multiple. He useful, it can establish connection. It can stand is an apology. It can suggest that one is willing to cooperate. It can indicate allegiances, so people who smile at each other across the proverbial crowded room or saying, Gotcha.

Speaker 2:          09:15          See you were in this, we're a special. Um, so that there are many social functions that smiling serves besides being a readout of underlying positive emotion. That's so interesting. I mean it makes smiling, you know, TV, this complex and multifaceted thing that happens just in a blink of an eye. But that in ways is just, you know, subtly navigating our everyday social exchanges. Absolutely. Navigating I think is a terrific way to characterize it because we smile at strangers, not a lot, but smiling is one of the facial expressions that tends to be reciprocated by strangers. If I frowned at you and we don't know each other and were passing each other in the street, you're not likely to frown back at me. But if I smell it you, there may be a very quick recognition and doing it likewise so that it gets us through a lot of social situations where words would take too much time, too complicated, too ambiguous, smiling, smooths things out.

Speaker 2:          10:15          Let's us go through without a lot of tension or conflict or ambiguity. And do you think that there are certain kinds of smells that maybe, I don't know, more socially effective than other styles or it's actually great question and I think that's where the research is going. One of the distinctions that researchers have made, which I think has some terrific validity, is the distinction between what is called the Duchenne after a French physiologist, the Duchenne smile, which is apparently the really legitimate sign of genuine, spontaneous, positive emotion and to facial features are involved with the genuine smile. That's the mouth and but it also involves the eyes. It's actually a muscle. That circumference is the eye socket which squeezes, so it causes the eye to close a little bit. It raises, there's a little pouching of the lower lid. There's a little crinkling of the outer eyes.

Speaker 2:          11:11          There's a little lowering of the upper lid on the outside that is hard to do deliberately. This, that is the mouth is really easy. We all learn how to do that. All someone has to do is imma cameras and say, smile. We know what to do. We may think it's awkward and it's silly and it's you know, authentic. So there are genuine smiles, but there are many other kinds of smiles, smiles that have often say, if I'm trying to mask negative effect, say I'm feeling actually really sad at the moment and I don't want to impose that on you. I don't want you to know, I don't want to express it. So my mouth may say happy, happy, smile, smile. But if I look at the, at the inner brows, I see maybe some tension. I see some other actions. So there are smells like that smiles also that come on the face really fast and go off really fast.

Speaker 2:          12:07          Often you can see this and people who are in public and they don't think they're being observed, but then there's somebody to catch somebody's eye and the smile comes on and the people go away, small drops off. So the timing of his smile distinguishes between a genuine and a non genuine smile. There are also smiles that are purely to convey a sense of let's get through this, let's just move along. But smooth things out and that smile. Everybody knows to be polite or social, but it's not about emotion or at least it's not about a readout of what's really going on inside. It's almost like a social regulator is absolutely that interesting. One of the things he said that I thought was interesting thinking, smiling to gender differences is that there seems to be this critical period where men and women do different smiling, but then after that period, I think he said it was 17 to 23 it disappears.

Speaker 2:          13:01          What do we think is going on? Uh, why do we start smiling? It's converging in our smiles. I guess it's a terrific question. There are those of a evolutionary psychology band who would say when mating is most critical, the sexist should be the most different so that there's no confusion about who you're going to engage with. Others suggest that that's when the social pressure is at its maximum to indicate that one is appropriately masculine and feminine and there is no better way to indicate femininity than smiling. In fact, it's at that age that young men who smile, especially if they are seeing this smiling too much, the too much means there's something odd about their masculinity, so we questioned their inherent masculinity. If there's too much smiling, it also appears to be the case. That's when gender roles, in terms of occupations, in terms of vocations, in terms of preferences, gender roles really are really quite paramount and there are a lot of occupations and jobs and roles that are really gendered still that is women tend to be more care givers.

Speaker 2:          14:14          They tend to be more in public relations kinds of occupations which require a lot of smiling, so we know for example, if you put men in those same occupations, Lo and behold, they're smiling. Rates go up. If you put women in more traditional masculine occupations, Lo and behold, they're smiling drops off, so it's less maybe at certain ages than it about gender than it is about the separation into social roles that are related to gender. Yeah. It sounds really like it's all about social context. Social context matters a lot. Smiling is probably the most variable facial expression. I think when we look at expressions associated with anger, distress, a disgust, sadness, and the like, I think then the expressions are often more authentic readouts of what the underlying effect is. Smiley is the great question mark. In fact, Darwin when he talked about facial expressions was a little mystified with smiling cause it didn't appear to be functionally adaptive.

Speaker 2:          15:15          It didn't appear to arrive from some bodily or some core notion of survival. So what it is is actually still a bit of a mystery. So interesting. I wanted to ask you a little bit further. I mean a lot of your work too, it's looked more broadly, other kinds of nonverbal communication, the smile being being one of them, and just how these subtle communication, uh, pieces of information can actually communicate really important information about things like social power, which seems really, really profound. I mean, how is it that we can convey things about our gender identity, you know, personal allegiances simply through, uh, these nonverbal acts or in other words, without saying a single word, nonverbal communication is something that humans need because it is simple. It's efficient. It is, if you will, off the record. So if you say something to me of a unkind sword, I can say Jew.

Speaker 2:          16:16          What was that about? Why? Why did you say that? But if you do a little kind of scowl at me, if you bodily turn away from me, if you indicate by certain other kinds of cues, vocal tone, that you're really disinterested, I can't say, Hey, what was that tone of voice thing? It's, it would sound, maybe bordering on the paranoid would sound kind of bizarre. Well, I see a psychologist unless you're a psychologist in which we do it all the time. Um, so nonverbal communication is a multilayered way of establishing relationships, of indicating you've mentioned power, who's on top and who's not, who's striving to move up, who's worried about moving down? So smiling. Another uh, example, there's some data, there was some controversy on this, but there's some data that suggests that the lower power person person with less standing the status in a relationship is the one who smiles more.

Speaker 2:          17:13          And the high power person, theoretically smiles list. Now, what we find in our research is it's a little bit more complicated, but it can come down in some sense to the following lower power. People may smile more because they have to. In fact, we find that lower power, people say they smile when they do because of the need to please. They don't want to offend. They don't want people to think ill of them. Higher power people tend to smell when they feel like smiling and don't smile when they don't feel like it gets, they don't have to, they don't have to sort of show affiliation. Exactly. They don't have to be, be pleasant. They don't have because they've got the standing, they've got the status and other people need to rise to them rather than they need to somehow or other be compliant or um, differential or submissive.

Speaker 2:          18:05          That's not part of the high power rural often. Right. I'm sure people in their everyday lives can imagine situations like job interviews where they're finding that they may be smelling much more frequently than they normally would. For example. Um, you know, to sort of please the higher power person. But that's often some of a double edge sword. So interviewees are often told, smile, make eye contact, smile, indicate you're engaged by smiling. But often the smiling then heads into too much. So often what comes across is the sort of greenness and you know sometimes in those positions I'm smiling too much, I got to stop, but I can't because you know they're there. I am with with my smile. So smiling too much happens fairly quickly. That is to say that one can smile too much without meaning to or wanting to and it can then take the evaluation of the person from competent and socially adept into why are they greeting like that when we're talking about these series matters.

Speaker 2:          19:09          So it can be almost too much of a good thing. Absolutely. In fact, we find, especially in studies of women interviewees and men interviewees, women smile a lot, a lot, a lot, and they are seeing often is warm and pleasant and altogether really nice people. But then too much smiling sometimes is correlated with two little competence. So if a person smiles too much, they go overboard in one thing, which suggests it may be that other dimension of being smart and competent and Rudy intellectually skilled, some questions can be raised right. So it brings their sort of social power down even more. Exactly. Fascinating. So I mean this has been really great to talk about all your work on, you know, nonverbal cues, smiling gender and emotion. And so when you think about all the work you've done and sort of the puzzles that remain, where do you see the face of the future going in emotion?

Speaker 2:          20:06          Oh Wow. What a question. I think the thing that's wonderful about emotion and emotion research is that there are so many directions. So we talk about, we haven't talked today about it, but huge differences culturally, which raises a lot of basic questions about his emotion. Universal. Is it something that we all share? Well, yes, but if we say look at cross cultural differences and emotion, the rules for how much one expresses under what circumstances, what emotions are fostered, what emotions are encouraged to be damp down to go away, issues about where in these massive brains that we have our emotions located, it's likely to be multiple. He located the, one of the questions about emotion I think has to do with in some sense what is it, I mean we assume, we know it's everybody knows when emotion is, but I think what researchers are finding is it is a really complex phenomenon in its own right and as we proceed into the broader social world culture, a nation, his history, we will also be proceeding in a more micro level into the brain and there's so many questions to ask and answer have answered about those connections.

Speaker 2:          21:32          I mean it feels almost like I would thought you're saying the face of the future has also, it got us started in emotion in the first place. Kind of questioning the core, you know, I dunno. Bottom, bottom up issue of what, what is emotion, you know, in the first place. It is a really interesting question. Yeah. And lots of work still remains to be done. So in terms of lots of work, I mean some of it, you know, we'll, I'll try to do in our generation, but a lot of it too will remain for future scholars and students of emotion to try. Absolutely. I think it's one of those areas in which we've come up with a lot of interesting data, some really interesting findings, but the questions are as extensive as they ever were. So what advice would you have for students who are just embarking in this study of emotion or maybe thinking about dabbling with it?

Speaker 2:          22:24          What might you say to them? Well, maybe eat, start with an emotion that mystifies you, um, makes you angry, makes you sad, uh, gets under your skin. Start with some behavior that you've noticed in yourself. Say blushing for example. We know very little bit about blushing, which is related to emotion. If you come from some other part of the, of the world of the rural, urban, west, east, south, north, um, you, you named the location of your origin, you may be fascinated with, it seems to work different here than it does in some other kind of place. So start with something that is interesting, aggravating, fascinating. Something that says, I need to know more about this. Really? Hmm. That's a great, that's a great place to end. Thank you so much for speaking with us today, Marian. Great. This concludes our experts and emotion and our view with Dr Marion La France from Yale University. Thank you again for speaking with us.
