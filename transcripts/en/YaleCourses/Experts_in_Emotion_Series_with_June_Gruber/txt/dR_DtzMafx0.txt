Speaker 1:          00:00          Welcome back to human emotion. I want to start out with a quote that William James said when he was discussing how central the physical body is to our experience of emotion. He said, no shade of emotion should be without a bodily reverberation and hear. What he was really emphasizing is that our physiological responses are heart racing or our palm sweating, our knees shaking. All of these things are really part and parcel of what make an emotion in the first place. And we talked about this actually very early in the course and we were sort of reviewing our theories of emotion through time. So we began the first part of the chorus by discussing theory by William James, which was referred to as the physiological approach. And here he argued that feelings and emotions are actually secondary to physiological phenomena. In another words, um, he took the position eat to even argue that the essence of what an emotion is is the physiological response.

Speaker 1:          01:00          And so this is what I want to turn to today to really question what role does physiology play an emotion? Our emotions? Nothing without our heart racing and our palms sweating or are, is part of what makes our emotions physiology. And if so, in what way? So today what I want to turn to is our lecture, which will really focus on how we can learn about our emotions by studying our bodily sensations using the rigorous scientific tools of aspect of science. So today let's look at our heart and ask ourselves, is our heart really a window into our feelings? So today we're going to start our first part of a three series overview into what's called psychophysiology. Um, here, what we're going to be doing is looking at emotions through the window of bodily responses and ask ourselves whether our blood and sweat are really a clue into our feelings, our tears, and our fears.

Speaker 1:          01:56          So let's get started with an introduction to psychophysiology. So today what we're going to do is start with our roadmap here. We'll start by first asking ourselves, well, what is psychophysiology in the first place? Second, we'll go over some basic principles of how you measure physiological responses. As a first kind of first step into thinking about how we can study emotions. We need to first understand how we measure physiological sensations in the body. Then we'll move on to our, um, take home questions followed by our expert interview today with one of the renowned figures in the field of psychophysiology sled. Start here by looking at this question about what is psychophysiology.

Speaker 1:          02:37          So here you can see an article and this, this is an old newspaper article, but I really love it because what it says at the top here is electric meter test, skin to gauge emotion. And what I think is important to take away from this article is that even long ago, many of us thought that, you know, there was some way in which we can measure, you know, uh, electrical signals in the body, sweating from the fingertips as a way to study emotion. Now, back then they were using something called galvanic skin response, which is also been used as part of the lie detector. Uh, you know, uh, equipment. But we know today that there's much more to gauging emotion through physiological sensations than just the amount of sweat on our hands. So where have we come since then? Well, here we've come along ways and as part of this journey, we've really founded a field called psychophysiology.

Speaker 1:          03:29          And so you may wonder, well, what is psychophysiology in the first place? And when I want to do here, share with you a few different definitions of how various, you know, authoritative figures in the field have defined the field of psychophysiology. So you'll see here, one definition of psychophysiology is the science, which concerns physiological activities, which underlie or relate to psychic events. And by psychic they mean psychological, um, you know, not some sort of reading into a crystal globe here. Um, then we also see a definition here by Casio and colleagues where they defined psychophysiology as the scientific study of social, psychological and behavioral phenomena as related to and revealed through physiological principles, any events in functional organisms. And then finally we see Alan and colleagues talk about psychophysiology has the use of a particular set of physiologically based dependent or independent variables to gain insights into psychological questions.

Speaker 1:          04:31          Now, as important as it is to think about what psychophysiology is, which is a measurement of different physiological sensations that may map onto important psychologically relevant processes like emotion. We also want to be very clear of what psychophysiology is not. So psychophysiology is not the same as what's called physiological psychology. I know it sounds very similar, but it's actually quite different. So physiological psychology is actually a subdivision of biological psychology that studies neuromechanisms of behavior through direct manipulation of the actual neural tissue in the brain in these controlled experiments. Psychophysics psychophysiology is also not behavioral neuroscience, so behavioral neuroscience by contrast, as you can see here is the scientific study of the central neural basis of behavior and mental states. So one important way in which it's differentiated from physiological psychology and behavioral neuroscience is it doesn't have this exclusive focus on neural tissue or neural basis of behavior.

Speaker 1:          05:34          It's much broader thinking about the physiological system as a whole. And in particular a lot of psychophysiology we'll focus on the peripheral nervous system. So things like your heart rate, your blood pressure as opposed to more specifically focusing on the central nervous system, which includes measures of neural activity. So we're going to now delve into psychophysiology, um, by thinking about the pros and cons. So what can we gain from psychophysiology as budding emotion researchers and what might be some of the limitations? So if we think about the pros of psychophysiology, there's a few we can get around social desirability, which is this pressure. People have to respond in a certain way when they're in a study, especially during questionnaire studies. Um, they feel like there's a certain right answer that they should endorse on a given measure. The other pros of psychophysiology is that it helps provide information about, um, psychological processes.

Speaker 1:          06:30          So about emotion that's relatively outside of conscious awareness, meaning that it can be pretty difficult to consciously manipulate your, your blood pressure or the amount that you're sweating from the palms of your hands. So in this way, psychophysiology really lets you get outside of conscious awareness and sort of get some of the automatic processes that are happening when we experience an emotion. And then finally, um, psychophysiology enables you to identify how mental states such as feeling fearful or feeling happy are related to physical health. So you can look at things like we've been talking about, you know, cardiovascular functioning, um, you know, things like blood pressure, we'll talk about things like cardiac impedance, um, later on. And we can this way also link emotion as a psychological process to physical health outcomes. So these are some of the advantages of the psychophysiology, but like every tool and every field, there's also limitations.

Speaker 1:          07:27          So some of the limitations are what we think of as cons of psychophysiology are as follows. So the methods are sometimes difficult and expensive. So they're difficult insofar as you're hooking people up with a lot of different sensors. Some of them can be uncomfortable for people and many of them limit the kind of mobility people have. They're sitting in a chair, relatively static, and they can't really move around. And they're actually quite expensive. So if you're buying some of this equipment for your laboratory, you can easily spend up in the tens of thousands of dollars just getting the equipment there in the first place to run your study. And there's some controversy on exactly what we as emotion researchers can actually infer from the psychophysiological measures. So for example, as you see here, if you have a higher heart rate, what does that mean? Does that mean that you're angry?

Speaker 1:          08:16          Could it mean that you're sad or is it just a sign of movement? Um, or maybe someone you know recently came into your lab after, you know, taking a jog in their heart is still pumping relatively quickly. So it can be hard to know exactly what you take away just from psychophysiology alone. So let's think about what psychophysiology is, what it's not, and the pros and cons as we now delve into this. An overview of the autonomic nervous system. So again, we know we have the nervous system here. Okay. And the nervous system has two central branches. So you have the central nervous system, which includes your brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system, which includes all other nerves. And as I have highlighted here, this is the system that we're going to be focusing on the peripheral nervous system. This is where psychophysiology really concentrate its efforts.

Speaker 1:          09:07          And in particular if we look into the peripheral nervous system, we see that it's also broken up into two branches itself. So you have the autonomic nervous system or the ans which monitors sort of your internal world that kind of carries out these automatic processes. And this is contracted with the somatic nervous system, which is more about monitoring the external world, carrying out more voluntary processes. And here psychophysiology again really focuses on these automatic processes that are relatively outside of conscious awareness through the autonomic nervous system and importantly a psychophysiology. That's what we're really measuring. Then, um, his activity in these two branches of the autonomic nervous system. So you have your sympathetic nervous system, which is really this fight or flight system that really is geared towards facilitating energy expenditure as compared with the parasympathetic nervous system, which is really this rest and digest or people call it 10 number friend system.

Speaker 1:          10:01          That's really about facilitating recovery in energy storage. So today we're going to be talking about different ways you can measure activity in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system as highlighted there. Now when we get into these two branches of the autonomic nervous system, the sympathetic neurosystem and parasympathetics or SNS and pns, um, we can see a few things here. So here, if we look into the SNS, again, this is our fight or flight system. It's very excitatory. What it's focused on, uh, essentially is I'm looking at things like the release of catecholamines. So epinephrine or norepinephrine from the adrenal Medulla. So what it's a sort of seen as overseeing or um, you know, directly facilitating is things like, uh, increases in heart rate and blood pressure, slowing your digestion, dilating your pupils. Essentially what we're seeing is, as you can see here on the graph, the sympathetic nervous system is really about mobilizing your body to either fight or flight.

Speaker 1:          11:05          So when there's a potential danger or threat, it's getting your body ready to expend energy and potentially run away or um, you know, confront a particular rival. Um, so really what's happening is it's shutting down a lot of automatic processes like digestion and really getting your body mobilized. Now this is in stark contrast with the parasympathetic nervous system or pns, which is focused on this sort of rest and digest. So here what we're seeing is the facilitation of energy storage. We see a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. We see digestion becoming activated cause you're sort of at ease. You can now tend to, I'm digesting food material. You see contraction of the pupils and really interestingly, and what we'll talk about further on his activity of the Vegas nerve, that many people are now seeing as a really important of emotion regulation as well as positive emotionality.

Speaker 1:          11:57          So we'll return to that later. Um, importantly, what you want to know when it comes to these two branches of the autonomic nervous system is that they have different profiles. So there they can sort of act independently or orthogonally of one another. Um, so I just want to put this here for didactic purposes just so you know that there's kind of four different profiles you can have at any given time. And you can be high in one branch of the nervous system. So high in sympathetic activation and either high and parasympathetic are low in parasympathetic. Likewise, you can be high in parasympathetic activation in either high or low and sympathetic. So these are sort of operating in parallel with somewhat competing goals. And so they have this sort of, you know, push and pull relationship with one another. Um, that's constantly going on all the time. So you can have profiles here that are called reciprocal sympathetic activation. So the stress response co activation, which is engagement and stress, which is engaging your regulatory systems co inhibition or this reciprocal parasympathetic activation. So this is what we think of as these ans interaction profiles. Again, the ways these two different branches of the audit anomic nervous system can interact with one another.

Speaker 1:          13:11          And what's really important as we get started sort of delving into the realm of psychophysiology has to be really clear on important terminology here. So let's imagine you have an experiment here. So you have your control group and white and some comparison group in blue. You have there, um, you know, physiological response of a given measure at baseline. And you also have it in response to an emotional provocation watching a film recalling an emotional memory. And there's two terms I want to be really clear about. So the first is what's called physiological reactivity. So reactivity is really looking at a change from baseline. So how much does the control group in white increase when they're going from their baseline to the emotion provocation. Likewise with the blue group here to here. So to compute reactivity, what you really want to do is compute a change or what's called different score between this and this as well as this and this. So really you're looking at from your own baseline. When you come into a task, how much do you either move up or down? Now this is quite different from what's referred to as responding. So responding says, I don't care about the baseline, I just want to understand during this task what the raw responses were. So put everyone's own individual baseline aside, tell me how much responding we saw as a function of this part of the task. So again, reactivity takes into account baseline responding does not.

Speaker 2:          14:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:34          Okay. And we'll move more into this later on in our lecture. But I want to remind ourselves, this is something we saw earlier in class, um, which is just that, um, you know, psychophysiology is really important because it can sort of begin to provide a map or a profile of the landscape of different ranging from anger, fear, sadness to discuss and potentially even happiness at the bottom. We'll return to this later in the lecture. But keep this chart in mind as we start to go through different methods and different measurements and think about how they can actually inform the way in which our body responds when we're having different kinds of emotional states. So with that being said, I want to now move from what is psychophysiology sort of what is the field, what are the core terms, what can we learn from it to sort of getting into how we measure these responses in the first place. If you're conducting a laboratory study, where do you begin? What tools do you use? So now we're going to go on to this component of measurement.

Speaker 2:          15:33          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:34          So I want to think about two different ways when we talk about measurement. So one kind of measurement is in the lab, so you're bringing in participants to your lab and measuring responses while they're with you. And we'll talk about this first and then we'll go to outside of the lab, sort of how you can measure physiological responses and people's own daily lives. So let's start here with inside the lab. So what I want to walk through or different equipment and tools that have been used to measure physiological responses in the lab. So I love this here for historical purposes. So this is one of the earliest models that was used to measure physiological responses in the lab called the grasp model seven. And as you can see at the bottom, and even had the polygraph paper with a little impendent sort of wrote out the signals as the person was going through the task. Um, we no longer use these. They're big, they're cumbersome. You have to actually use paper to record your data. We've now moved to much more digitally based systems and the two major companies out there right now are biopack and mine were and they're both fantastic systems for measuring physiological responses in the lab. You can see they have different amplifiers that read the signals from the participant and then display them digitally on a computer monitor.

Speaker 2:          16:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:47          Um, this is a picture from my lab using, um, as you can see here, the mine were based equipment where we have people come into the lab and you have a whole row of different physiological sensors, sort of like stickers that are adhesive and they stick to the skin and we attach them to participants in our lab as you can see here, um, to measure their ongoing physiological responses. So here's one of my research assistants in the lab. As you can see on the, uh, the right hand picture, there's a little white box with Blue Line around that. So that's an amplifier. And the cables that are hooked up to her feed into that amplifier there to then produce a signal, um, while she's doing the task. So playing long, uh, with a very important task in our lab, um, singing, twist and shout. And then while she's doing that, she's answering questions on the computer, monitor recording how she's feeling. And as you can see here, we monitor her remotely from a control room and you can see not only her behavior, but you can also see her online physiological responses there in the monitor and the different colored channels and looks something like this.

Speaker 1:          17:50          So you're able, using the system that you can get people's a wide range of different physiological responses to hear. Some of the things you can see are the electrocardiogram signal in red. So this is your heart rate. Um, so we're able to see this on a second by second moment while in the lab.

Speaker 2:          18:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:05          Now let's contrast this with measuring physiology outside the lab. So what have you actually want to get people's physiological responses in their own or actual daily lives? So one of the tools that we've used in our lab is what's called the biopack bio harness. So this is a method of what is called ambulatory physiology are really getting mobile assessments of people's physiological responses. So here, um, you take people outside of the lab and they were this velcro strap that's worn lightly around the abdomen. And in the front there's a little data computer chip here that records things as you can see, ranging from heart rate to skin temperature to respiratory sinus Arrhythmia, which we'll talk about later as a potential correlative emotion regulation and positive emotion as well as general movement in three dimensional space. So just looking how much people generally are moving around, um, and to what extent that might also relate to their physiological responses.

Speaker 1:          18:56          So not only can you measure these responses in the lab, we can also get really beautiful assessments of them in people's own daily lives, which is thought to really increase ecological validity of your study. Um, let me just walk you through a schematic of um, one of the studies we've done in my lab using ambulatory physiology monitoring tools. So in this study we had participants who first visited the lab and when they visited the lab we did a baseline assessment of their clinical profile using the skid as well as getting different measures of mood symptoms and basic demographics. After the lab, they were oriented to what we called inexperienced sampling study or ESM, which we've talked about earlier in our course. And we looked at different methods of measuring emotion. So for approximately one week in their own life, they completed different assessments at random intervals throughout the day using a palm pilot, recording what they were doing, who they were with, what they were feeling, and different kinds of regulation strategies they use to manage or control their emotions.

Speaker 1:          19:57          Along with that, so you can see here is the palm pilot with the questions we talked about in terms of an effect context and regulation strategies. You can also see our participant here wearing that, um, ambulatory straps. So the bio pack bio harness. So not only are we getting in her daily life how she's feeling and what she's doing, um, but we're also getting simultaneously her physiological responses that were collected during this period. And then finally you bring people back into the lab and you collect the equipment. So now you have a really elegant measurement of both how they report their feeling and their physiological responses, which again, as we spoke about at the beginning, are relatively outside of conscious awareness.

Speaker 1:          20:40          So, um, go back there really quick. So what we're going to go over in the rest of the class, our next module is going to detail more precisely about when we look at methods that are used both inside the lab and outside the lab. What precisely are we measuring? So what separate physiological channels are we tapping into? So we're going to spend the next module going into different measures of physiological functioning, ranging from, you know, heart rate to sweat, to breathing, frequency, skin temperature, and even blood flow, uh, in greater detail. But I just want to give you a roadmap today of where we'll be going next as we sort of delve into the world of psychophysiology. So with that, I want to conclude with takeaway questions for our introductory segment today on psychophysiology. So the take home questions today are as follows. So first, what were the two main branches of the autonomic nervous system that we talked about today that are central in the study of psychophysiology and what function do each of them serve?

Speaker 1:          21:41          Second, can you name and describe several basic emotions and their associated autonomic profiles? So there was a table we showed earlier in the lecture today that had, you know, five or six distinct emotions and the different autonomic profiles that would map onto those emotions. So you might want to go back, remind yourself of that particular part of the lecture and see if you can answer for yourself this question of can you describe what the autonomic profiles are of these basic emotions? And then finally, how are psychophysiological measures of emotion assessed both inside the lab and outside the laboratory. So what are the ways that researchers who want to study physiological responses look at this in these two different contexts? And finally, we'll conclude with our expert interview for today and today as part of our experts and emotion interview series, we have the honor of speaking with doctor John Kasey Yotpo.

Speaker 1:          22:38          Um, he's going to speaking to us about psychophysiology, both the scope of psychophysiology and the promise. It bears for emotion research. So Dr Casio Opo uses a variety of psychophysiological methods in his research, including Autonomic Neuroendocrin, Fsri Eeg, Erp, as well as quantitative genetics.

Doctor Cassiopeia is the past editor of the journal Psychophysiology, a former associate editor, a psychological review and perspectives on psychological science, and it's currently in an an associate editor of social neuroscience. So I'm very honored to now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Doctor John Kasey. Yotpo.

Speaker 2:          24:43          Okay.
