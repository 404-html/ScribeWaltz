Speaker 1:          00:01          For experts in emotion interview. We'll be speaking with Dr. David Watson on personality and emotion. Dr. Watson is the Andrew Mckenna family professor of psychology at the University of Notre Dame, Dr. Watson as a personality psychologist with particular expertise in personality assessment. His work investigates the structure and measurement of personality, mood and psychopathology as well as examining how personality traits relate to clinical disorders. He works in a variety of substantive areas within psychopathology, including depression and the anxiety disorders, personality disorders, skizzy, tippy, and the sleep and associated disorders. The longterm goal of his work is to develop comprehensive taxonomic models that integrate normal range and pathological processes into a single overarching scheme. Dr. Watson has published more than 100 articles in the top journals in psychology, including the Journal of personality and Social Psychology, the journal of abnormal psychology, psychological bulletin and psychological assessment and he's currently serves as editor and chief of the Journal of abnormal psychology. So I now turn to a very special experts and emotion interview with Dr. David Watson on personality and emotion. So I want to thank you for speaking with us today. David,

Speaker 2:          01:14          welcome. Thanks for having me.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Fantastic. So one of the questions I wanted to start a asking you was really where this all began for you. So what first sparked your interest in, got you. You know, started in studying processes of emotion.

Speaker 2:          01:30          Oh, well, I don't know if my answer is typical or atypical, uh, but it's was completely serendipitous. So, uh, the backstory is my future wife got a Fulbright fellowship to study in Japan, uh, and I wanted to go with her. So I was talking to Alcatel Hogan, who was my graduate advisor, uh, and he said, well, if you're going into the Japan, why don't you do a mood study over in Japan? And I said, okay. That became my dissertation. So, uh, as part of this, I started reading up on the mood literature, which was actually pretty small back then. And I really, you know, I fell in love with it, but I can't say before that I had the slightest interest in it.

Speaker 1:          02:16          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          02:17          I never would have anticipated going into it.

Speaker 1:          02:20          So it's one of those serendipitous discoveries into the world of emotion.

Speaker 2:          02:25          Yeah. And, and you know, the world was very different back then. Uh, there was not much of an emotional literature. Uh, the mood literature was quite small. I really mastered it, I would say in a week.

Speaker 1:          02:36          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          02:36          Um, it was, it was not, it was not the golden age of emotion research back then.

Speaker 1:          02:42          Do you know what sort of kept your attention going in, in the world of emotion and mood once you got hooked?

Speaker 2:          02:48          Well, the thing I liked about it was that it was so pliable. I mean, you could, uh, you know, you could study biological processes, you could study, like facial expressions, could study situational factors. So in some of our early work, we looked at exercise, social activity, caffeine, uh, weather variables. Uh, it had obvious connections to psychopathology. And then, you know, finally, of course it was related to personality. So, you know, I think it was, uh, it was really an expansive topic. What did, which you could take in a lot of different directions rather than being restrictive. And you know, back then it seemed like it was completely wide open. I mean you, you know, there was so little research that was done, uh, than almost anything you did, uh, was innovative.

Speaker 1:          03:35          Hmm. That's so interesting. So I mean, since then you've done just a wide number of innovative things and actually had trouble finding just, you know, one small cluster of questions I could ask you about because there's just so many things on, could talk with you about. Um, the, one of the things I thought I might start by asking you about is just about your work. Um, so you're widely known for your influential work on the development and assessment of personality. And I wondered how you think research on aspect and emotion can improve our understanding of variation in personality traits?

Speaker 2:          04:09          Well, I think in a, in a couple of ways. So first of all, what, uh, when people started doing research on an affect and emotion, uh, I think the conventional wisdom was that most personality did not have much to do with emotion. I think going back to Isaac, most people thought that neuroticism was about negative emotion. Uh, but if you read about traits such as conscientiousness and extraversion, um, the, the focus was on cognitive behavioral processes, social processes, not emotional processes. So I think the emotion research is fundamentally changed the way that we've, we view these traits, I think. But in terms of, uh, the major traits or personality, maybe something like intellect or openness doesn't have a strong emotional component, but pretty much everything else does. Uh, and so I, and I think this is, this has really changed the way that we view personality traits.

Speaker 2:          05:06          Uh, when I started in the field in the 1970s, the field was primarily descriptive. Um, and now, uh, I think linking personality too, emotional research has also clarified the biological bases for these things. I mean, you know, uh, inhibition system, the approach system and how they're related to traits like neuroticism, extraversion. Uh, I think the next generation of research is going to be to try to understand, uh, their particular emotional signatures of different traits. So, uh, I think one of the challenges we're working on in my lab right now, uh, is conscientiousness as a personality trait has surprisingly strong connections to depression and the anxiety disorders. And I suspect a lot of that again, is emotionally based, but we really don't understand that very well right now. Hmm. Mm.

Speaker 1:          05:57          How do

Speaker 3:          05:57          you think we might use some of this information to better inform our clinical assessment of personality disorders?

Speaker 2:          06:05          Well, personality disorders, uh, I think offers some interesting challenges, um, particularly, uh, in the assessment of positive emotion. I think because, uh, you have disorders such as avoidant personality disorder, a borderline that seemed to be associated with deficits in positive emotionality, but then there's good evidence that, uh, there are the disorders such as narcissistic personality disorder, Histrionic personality disorder that are associated with elevated positive mode. And in fact, when you start looking at, uh, uh, specific aspects of personality disorders, um, many, uh, aspects of the related to positive emotionality and extroversion actually can go both ways. So you have people who are dependent, overly dependent on others, uh, who, uh, are, are, have, are more, almost clingy and dependent on other people, uh, that are afraid of being abandoned. And then you have people who are extremely aloof, um, and our colon and different to other people. So I think that dimension in particular has a lot of potential for differentiating different types of clinical conditions and you know, and try to figure out, you know, why, why we see such wide ranges in behavior.

Speaker 3:          07:28          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:29          that's fascinating. I mean, one of the other things about your work that I found particularly exciting is that you've also scientifically demonstrated how we can use measures of positive and negative effect to differentiate among, you know, anxiety and mood disorders, um, in ways that we just didn't understand previously. And I wondered if you could just say a bit more about what you found to be some of the most important or exciting discoveries here.

Speaker 2:          07:56          Well, probably our first major discovery was in the area of depression, uh, which, which seems to be, we've now looked at a wide range of disorders, not everything but a wide range of disorders. And depression seems to be associated with a particularly strong deficits in positive emotionality. And an extreme case is it seems to be a, an inability to experience normal levels of positive emotion, uh, and just really differentiates, uh, depression, uh, from some other disorders, even a disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, which is strongly Comorbid with it and strongly related to it. Uh, and I think one of the things that's striking from some of our recent symptom work is that a positive emotionality is actually a better, more specific symptom of depression, even though it's not part of the formal symptom criteria for depression. Then many of the current depression symptoms are, so for example, insomnia tends to be a more nonspecific symptom, which is pervasive in clinical populations. Uh, so it's an interesting system as symptom, but it doesn't really differentiate a depression from other consortia. So I, you know, I've been writing about this in recent years. I think the implication is that we need to be building a positive emotionality criteria into more clinical syndromes. I think that we're really would improve diagnosis and assessment.

Speaker 1:          09:23          And I wanted to ask you a bit about that. So in what ways do you think we can leverage this information, especially related to positive effect as you just pointed out in the case of depression? Um, to aid in, you know, differential diagnosis or developing and refining treatment interventions that are really focused on these, you know, aspect related symptoms?

Speaker 2:          09:44          Yeah, well, you know, having studied a diagnosis and assessment for a number of years in, in some ways it's impressive, but I, I think that a clinical assessment is biased yeah. Uh, toward, uh, an assessment terms towards convergent validity or if you prefer to posit toward positive symptoms. So I think, uh, clinicians have been very adept at identifying problems that patients complain about. Um, you know, so they can't sleep, they're having trouble eating, they're unhappy. Uh, but I think they've underrepresented deficits, so things that should be there but aren't, and quite often, uh, positives about positive emotional symptoms, symptoms are related to that. So when we don't, we don't see normal levels of happiness, we don't see normal levels of engagement. Those types of symptoms seem to be underrepresented. Uh, and I think that, uh, clinicians in diagnostic criteria tend to under represent a more specific symptoms. So I quite often they overweight, uh, problems and symptoms that are common to all kinds of conditions. Um, and so again, I think that's why the positive system is particularly interesting because you see the large deficits in some disorders, a few deficits in many disorders, and then you see elevations in positive and so like excessive approach behavior, overconfidence, uh, in other conditions.

Speaker 1:          11:10          Well this relates to the last question I wanted to ask you about your work. Um, so as you're saying, a lot of your recent work has focused on the assessment of positive emotionality using the eye das to scale and how it relates both to personality on the one hand and psychopathology. On the other hand, and I wonder if you could tell us a bit more about the specificity of positive emotion dysfunction that you've been showing in your work, especially since this is really a relatively new field to begin to sort of on earth in the realm of both, you know, emotion, just studying positive emotion more generally and applying it clinically. We know almost nothing about positive emotion and how it tells us about unique features of different psychological disorders.

Speaker 2:          11:55          Yeah. So then that's another serendipitous finding. I, I kind of got dragged into the assessment of a excessive positive emotionality, particularly in the context of a bipolar symptoms of bipolar disorder. Uh, it does, I wouldn't, I would not say it's completely specific to bipolar disorder. They seem to be a similar elevations in narcissism, for example. Uh, but the specificity is, is really remarkable. Um, we're still struggling to understand that because in some cases we have measures, we've developed symptom measures that seem to be similar. Uh, empirically they're correlated with each other. Uh, and yet one measure shows deficits and depression and other one shows elevations in mania. So what exactly differentiates the two from each other? Uh, you know, we, we've developed some hypotheses. We're getting some data. It seems that, uh, in, uh, disorders that are associated with elevated positive mood seem to be associated with excessive activation, uh, with overconfidence that leads to impulsivity and recklessness. Um, but I think we have a long way to go to figure out exactly what differentiates that, you know, from more normal adaptive forms of positive aspect.

Speaker 1:          13:14          And that's what I was going to ask you. Do you think there's any glimmers of ways in which we can use this scale? The I'd to, to try to tease apart, you know, more maladaptive from adaptive variations of normal, positive mood? Are there ways that we can look forward to try to make those rarely difficult distinctions?

Speaker 2:          13:32          Uh, yeah. I, I think, uh, right now worse, we're stymied to some extent by limitations in our thinking and in our assessment approach. So again, we, you know, we didn't necessarily expect these things. So, uh, one of the things we're trying to do now is just to understand, um, the specific type of positive mood that's, that's, uh, elevated in, um, for example, bipolar disorder in general, one of the problems that you face in studying positive mood is going back to Darwin. They're well developed classification systems for negative mood. I mean, if you were to ask emotion theorists, everyone would recognize anger. They would recognize fear and they wouldn't recognize discussed. But when you get into positive emotions, we don't really have a good taxonomy, a good classification system. Uh, people talk about amusement, joy, interest, curiosity, energy, vigor. I mean, um, what are the basic positive emotional states and how they differ from each other. I think that's going to be part of the next generation is to figure out what's going on there.

Speaker 1:          14:39          So thinking ahead then about the next generation, where do you see the future of emotion, emotion research headed at this point?

Speaker 2:          14:47          Well, speaking for myself, I, I think what we're seeing and, and uh, I think this is going to be the wave of the future, uh, is just complete integration. So I'm asked to write a number of, you know, chapters and papers on personality and emotion, personality and psychopathology. Uh, but I think we're reaching the point where you can't do this x and y kind of thing, that they're all part of the same systems. So what one week? When I think of psychopathology, I think primarily in terms of emotional dysfunction, that's not all of it, but that's a lot of it. When I think of personality, I think the variations and emotional processes, when I study, affect and emotion, there's obviously very strong dispositional component to it. Um, and I, you know, integrating these things, particularly in a biological context, uh, is going to be a crucial, uh, funding. Now through an Imh, uh, there are doc, um, system. I think it's an explicit recognition of this. Uh, so they're, you know, uh, and, and Imh is moving away from a DSM diagnostic categories and more in terms of these underlying bio emotional behavioral systems. So I think integration, full integration is the next step.

Speaker 1:          16:09          And a lot of the next step of course involves not just current researchers in the field, but also students who are training to become the next generation. And so when students your own or others come to you and ask for advice, sort of where, where should they be putting their time and energy, or what should they be focusing on? What kind of advice do you have for students just embarking in the study of emotion?

Speaker 2:          16:33          No, I'm not sure. I'm very good at giving advice. Um, my advice is to, uh, is to, is to find whatever is interesting to you, uh, and pursue that. Uh, I think my, my career is somewhat different from many of my contemporaries and that I really resisted doing one type of thing. Um, I started out primarily as a mood researcher. I did some clinical research. I did some personality research, uh, within the clinical world. I studied probably a wider range of disorders and just about anybody. Um, but I, I follow, you know, I just try to solve problems, uh, that interest may, and, uh, one of the, I've gotten a lot of mileage out of revisiting, uh, areas and issues and realizing that I was stymied at some point that I couldn't figure out an answer to something and that motivates me to continue on it. And, um, I, at times I resist this. I say, I can't solve this problem, but eventually I go back to it. And why can't I solve this problem? You know, why are things the way they are? That's about all the advice I can give.

Speaker 1:          17:49          That's really good advice. Thank you so much for the advice and thank you so much for speaking with us today. David. Thanks again for having, this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Dr. David Watson.
