Speaker 1:          00:00          As part of our experts in emotion interview series. We have the honor of speaking with doctor John Kasey, Opo. Um, he's going to speaking to us about psychophysiology, both the scope of psychophysiology and the promise it bears for emotion research. So Dr Casio Opo uses a variety of psychophysiological methods in his research, including Autonomic Neuroendocrin, Fmri, EEG, Erp, as well as quantitative genetics. Um, Doctor Casio Opo is the Tiffany and Margaret Blake distinguished service professor at the University of Chicago. He's the director of the University of Chicago Center for cognitive and social neuroscience and the founding director of the initiative of the office of the vice president for research and national laboratories at the University of Chicago, seen as a pioneer in the field of social neuroscience. He's won numerous awards. These include the scientific impact award from the Society for Experimental Social Psychology, a merit award from the National Institute of Health and a presidential citation from the American psychological association, the Theoretical Innovation Prize from the Society for personality and Social Psychology, the Isi highly cited, researchers and psychiatry and psychology, the distinguished scientific contribution award from the American Psychological Association.

Speaker 1:          01:18          The award for distinguished scientific contributions to psychophysiology from the psych of society for psychophysiological research and the troll and research award from the National Academy of Sciences. Dr Cassiopeia is also been elected president of several scientific organizations that include the association for Psychological Science, the Society for personality and Social Psychology, the society for psychophysiological research and the Society for social neuroscience. Doctor Cassiopeia was a past editor of the journal Psychophysiology, a former associate editor, a psychological review and perspectives on psychological science and it's currently in an an associate editor of social neuroscience. So I'm very honored to now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Doctor John Kasey. Yotpo. Welcome John. Thanks for speaking with us today.

Speaker 2:          02:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:07          That's what I thought we might get started with is asking you a bit about sort of what first got you interested in this field, sort of worded things first begin for you

Speaker 2:          02:21          the assumption that most rational abrogate luck or economists aren't interested in predicting individual behavior. They're interested in predicting the notion. Boston humans aren't completely rational. You just a little rational, but they're randomly irrational when you some across individuals to a society level, you get pure rationality. But I knew that I was systematically irrational. That made me interested in emotions are and in biological proxies that might be underlying those emotions. And so that led me from economics to graduate school in Psychology. And so I've been interested since I was 700 graduate basically because of the misinformed assumptions underlying economics.

Speaker 1:          03:05          Excellent. So irrationality drew you towards studying emotions,

Speaker 2:          03:10          you an irrational act. But uh, but one that I'm happy with.

Speaker 1:          03:14          So I'd love to move on to ask you some questions about your research now. So I mean you are widely known for really, you know, playing this pivotal role in founding the field of social neuroscience, which is devoted to trying to understand social processes, including emotion, you know, through the lens of these different physiological tools. And you know, as the pioneer of this field, I wonder what you see as some of the most exciting discoveries that have emerged from social neuroscience.

Speaker 2:          03:40          Science is a, a really interesting and unique perspective to them and it's always, it's always struck me that we're fundamentally social animals and we're fundamentally biologic class. And when I first started working in the field, social and biological perspectives were actually quite divided. Uh, my phd mentor friends, instead of be persistent on pursuing this biological approach, I won't help you get a job. It was active antagonists and the neuroscience courses I was in at lab, I worked in [inaudible] for social factors were irrelevant because there were recent evolutionary developments. They on real basic implication for structural function, even if they were, they were too complicated to understand, so not worth studying. Uh, and it, it just seemed obvious that the comprehensive explanation is required both perspectives and they required both perspectives because behavior emotions are complicated. By complicated, I mean that they have multiple causes. I might eat because I'm hungry.

Speaker 2:          04:45          Biologic cost I might eat because Uri, because people around me are eating or be conscious of the time of day, more social costs. Oh, cultural causes. And so if we're going to have come up with comprehensive explanations, we can't rule out half of the causes is irrelevant. And so that, that was something that attracted me early. And of course we're all Mona's, we're all the terminus and Mona says scientists. So if we're going to understand these processes are an important avenue for understanding these psychological and social processes, do you see is through the material based through which they express themselves and clearly work on emotion system as advanced because we paid attention the biological mechanisms which emotions are expressed?

Speaker 1:          05:24          Oh, I couldn't agree more with you. I mean, I think some of the most fundamental discoveries especially, you know in the past decade has been through understanding biological, like you're saying processes and mechanisms.

Speaker 2:          05:36          One of the, uh, yesterday dances, one of the interesting advances are it's just how important simple connections are. We, we started looking at social isolation because when we first used the term social neuroscience 20 years ago, um, I, in the very first draft of the manuscript in which I wrote that term, I put the term and I put a color man, put an oxymoron question mark because I knew that my neuroscience colleagues would say these two terms just don't fit together. But in fact, social organisms, social species, by definition, creates support. I mean, there's four structures. Those structures evolve because they help those individuals survive, reproduce, and care for their offspring long enough. But they have a genetic legacy and those structures have genetic say that our neural hormonal mechanisms that support that. So we'll work on prefontal cortex or on a mid to lower on oxytocin or all samples of biological or targets that we've now found to be instrumental in construction or maintenance of these sorts of factors. If you look at any social mammal human down to in Burger, it's Blackburn's in fruit flies, any social animal of its isolated, they die at earlier when isolated them, when they're allowed to live in the group. So there's something really interesting going on about those connections we just take for granted because we live in that if you will, global environment as part of our everyday exist. So it seems invisible because it's unchanging from our perspective. And I mean, yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:08          big part of your work that you were just talking about is really, you know, looking at the role that things like loneliness or social isolation can impact and, and play on our physiological responses. And I just wondered, you know, what you think and your work has spoken to if the implications this might have for both our physical and mental wellbeing.

Speaker 2:          07:25          Well, we've actually been doing longitudinal research and experiments to examine that when we're looking at short term effects, like whether it makes you sad. We do experiments and indeed if I make you feel isolated you get sadder. But we've also looked longitudinally using cross panels, fretful equation models to rule out alternative interpretations. And what we find is when you, uh, for whatever reason become only your, over time you actually become more depressed as a result of a feeling lonely. We've ruled out social sport, our objective stressors or perceived stressors or hostility or a number of other alternative interpretations for that effect. So it really looks like the lonelier you get, the more depressed you're likely to get your at risk for that. And the other direction. Being depressed doesn't necessarily impact a tendency for you to become an on there. It seems to be driven by loneliness making you more depressed.

Speaker 1:          08:20          Interesting. And I know you've also done some work showing that it uh, loneliness also impacts just some of our most basic, you know, physical health functioning.

Speaker 2:          08:28          We've shown everything unless you show higher levels of cortisol in the morning and then you show ladder diurnal cycles of cortisol, the stress hormone. And that's the case both when we look across p Oh and when we look longitudinally, but then a person looking at the same cross legs, Russia equation modeling approach. As I mentioned, we're looking at depression the moment that seems to also increase if you both a height limit, but Twitter, adrenal cortical access, it's very stress system. Interestingly, it doesn't affect the stress systems writ large. We don't get increased sympathetic activity, generally we don't get increased catechol and one or JV sympathetic Katrina mentioned already activity. It's really seemed to be of us favor in the HPA axis. So that's something that's not exactly a stress response, but a more specific if you will, metabolic response to the dangers of finding yourself as a member of a social species. But in an isolated context

Speaker 1:          09:27          mean what's really fascinating here is you've established all these robust affects, you know, looking at loneliness for example, and its impact on different physiological parameters that relate to our mental and physical health wellbeing. And at this point, I mean, I feel like social neuroscience has just grown and blossomed as a really strong field. What do you see moving forward is some of the biggest challenges it faces? Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:49          Uh, it's a great time to be a social neuroscientist. They, what we've seen him at the last couple of decades is that a real gravitation to more important question sees these complicated questions. Both of us social scientists and neuroscientists required either just a very molecular analysis. By molecular, I mean in, in the neuroscience side, literally a molecular approach. And the social science, I mean, uh, an isolated approach. And that we would only consider the situational factors because those were something we can do something about. Now we're understanding that you fully understand how situations impact individuals. We need to understand something about the brains of those individuals and how those brains are collectively influencing one another. And so this social neuroscience approaches being used globally, um, we've, we traveled a good bit. We have collaborations and Latin American nation, Europe, and we see this approach really big, used to take on a number of social problems around the world. And so I, there isn't a interesting question that's being asked that was social neuroscience approach might tell us something about all of the global problems that we're facing. A fundamental a here left and all the social problems. And so it's being used increasingly to try to improve the world we live in, in the coming decades.

Speaker 1:          11:07          So it sounds like right now for those who may be interested in embarking and social neuroscience, it's just this burgeoning time get on board.

Speaker 2:          11:14          That's right. Like interesting and complex questions. It's definitely be approached to consider. Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:19          I mean, in speaking of complexity, I mean your work, you know, has impressively drawn from this diverse range of physiological parameters ranging from Fmr, I. E, g, e r p neuroendocrine response and quantitative genetics, and taking this really impressive kind of multimodal approach. What do you see at this point is some of the most effective tools in your own work for studying emotion per se?

Speaker 2:          11:43          I, the breeding the chick is clearly a, a development that gives us great, uh, a greater grip on what I'm bringing processes, response to these social structures and social challenges. And so we're doing more of it that we're increasingly using both electrical neuroimaging procedures that give you spatial and temporal information and, and the functional brain imaging metabolic procedures, but the quantitative genetics, the epigenetics is really quite exciting and it's something that we showed a couple of years ago. Then they feeling isolated, connect to affect which genes are turned on and off. We've replicated and extended that finding and, and in fact, contrary to what most thought 40, 50 years ago, it's the oldest cells that are active in modulating the social environment. I in a way that makes perfect sense. Bacteria were the first, uh, uh, pathogens on the immune system, a mock balled the oldest cells that community a ball to protect against bacteria and is in fact those cells that are most sensitive to your social environment changes in the social environment. So these genes are being turned on off to help protect you against, uh, the differences in packages to which you're likely to be exposed if you're around others and an half I'm social circumstances or if you're around others in a hostel social circumstance.

Speaker 1:          13:00          That's really fascinating. I mean, so you know, you think about all these complex tools and the ones that are likely to bear some of the most fascinating implications right now for understanding social processes. What do you see as some of the sort of, um, kind of next critical a methodological next steps in this field? What are the tools that we need but we don't yet have?

Speaker 2:          13:20          I think it's really the perspective going down from the molecular to the cultural, all those levels together. And those, those titles are large, the computational tools. And so for instance, one of the things in which we're working is with the high performance computing when you used to be called supercomputing center. So then we're able to bring more computational power to looking at these mechanisms both within most of organization but also understanding the mechanisms linking across the levels of organization. That's partly what I think is important and uh, we'll be real opportunities in the future. A second, interestingly enough is conceptual philosophical. There are simply, um, philosophical, um, obstacles still to how we're making progress on a brain image can be incredibly compelling in terms of its appearance. But it's fundamentally correlation. And there had been far too many conclusions drawn policies, established publications and high profile science journals because the images appeared to be so compelling rather than the logic experimental design. And so there's, there's work in that domain about how do we go about making these translations of specific mechanisms across lots of organization. And that in part is greater computational part. And part, how are we using that computational power to gain the greatest leverage on the questions that are being asked. So we also working with some philosophers of science on just basic inferential structure underlying this kind of scientific approach.

Speaker 1:          14:58          It's fascinating. I mean when you think about then where sort of the face of the future's headed when we think about social neuroscience and how it can inform emotion. You've already talked about a lot of really important steps of looking across multiple levels of bringing in people from different disciplines like you know, philosophers of science to sort of have them bring their own sort of analytic tools to bear. Where do you see them, the face of the future headed? Is this where we're going?

Speaker 2:          15:21          Oh, that's great question. When I started, yeah, I did research and built my own electrodes. We did everything ourselves in our laboratories. That period, uh, is a little bit like when we think about yesterday, you're, it's kind of a fun memory, but it's not something that we're likely to return to. The question seven are not being asked are sufficiently complicated and they go across enough disciplinary fields that increasingly we're seeing scientific teams very much like when I was just describing. So the study of motion in it's full of flavor requires a lot of different perspectives, a lot of different disciplinary expertise and no single individual can have the kind of expertise that's necessary across all those disciplines. So increasingly what I see or scientific teams coming together that are interdisciplinary in nature and the duck tab, a leader and everybody else's, the follower, if you and I represent to dis the men, are you catching her teeth?

Speaker 2:          16:18          And we're going to work in a synergistic fashion. I can't be the leader. You're the follower. We both are going to argue. We're both bands, the intersection and our parent disciplines. And in so doing we're going to transform out. Each of us think about the problem. And so I think are also mean ass, um, administrators as grant funding agencies and entities think about scientific awards. We need to stop asking for who's the leader, who's the author of this publication, but rather to what extent was it a synergistic output of a collective group? To what extent was everybody a leader? Is everybody responsible? If you and I are producing more than a hundred percent that's perfectly plausible through synergist and stuff. Neither one can take credit for even their portion because it's a product of the interaction and that's something I think that we need to try to build in those sites to be teams and we need trying to try to reward the next generation of scientists aren't faced with the obstacles. That partly just one big evaluated for tenure and promotions.

Speaker 1:          17:20          I mean, I couldn't agree more and I think really thinking more about the collective as you're saying as opposed to the individual. I mean that's going to make better science altogether.

Speaker 2:          17:28          That's right. It allows us to ask these more complicated questions and very sophisticated fashion rather than pretending that we act to have all the expertise needed or Archie the question in a way that we can answer it, but calling it the whole, when we're only looking at a very small passionate problem.

Speaker 1:          17:43          So then when you think about, you know, students who are going to be a big part of, you know, making the future of the field, you know, as it moves forward and you have students come to you asking for advice, you know, they're thinking about embarking in this field. What kind of advice do you typically give students?

Speaker 2:          17:58          Well, the common core and the answer I give is becoming an expert in a dish. And first, I mean I don't think students understand that will spend 40 to 50 years. I have four, five, six years for Grad School, maybe of York two on post doc, then six years for tenure and then my career set, they're still very, very early. It's Brown, all of that very, very early in their career. And as you both know, as a faculty, you never stop learning. As a scientist, you're always learning something new. And so you can't contribute meaningfully to an interdisciplinary team if you have no disciplinary expertise. So it's to learn the discipline well, but recognize the importance of related disciplines. You know, we can, sonics is a collective effort. It's not a solitary inch across. I think we really need to appreciate if we can work and talk to other scientists, they can be your best tutors. You can be their students, they're your student. And together over time you acquire more and more expertise, but you don't use syrup the experts in a privileged position within that collective team. And I think that's, that's the way to become interdisciplinary. It's an awareness of its importance, a humble nuts about what you know and what you can know and a willingness to learn from others.

Speaker 1:          19:22          Well thank you so much. This was a great opportunity to speak with you. And I think that's some of the best advice a student could have, you know, sort of recognizing their own role that they can play, but seeing themselves as, you know, sort of in a very humbling way, part of a bigger mission and group. Thank you. It's been a real pleasure. Thank you so much. So this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Doctor John Cassiopeia from the University of Chicago. Thanks again for speaking today. Thank you.
