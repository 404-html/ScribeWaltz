Speaker 1:          00:00          Today for our experts in emotion interview. We'll be speaking with doctor Barbara Fredrickson on positive emotion. So doctor Fredrickson is a distinguished professor of psychology and director of the positive emotions and psychophysiology lab at the University of North Carolina. She's a leading scholar studying positive emotions and human flourishing and her research on positive emotions and lifestyle change is funded by the u s national institutes of health. Dr Fredrickson has published more than 100 peer reviewed articles and book chapters and with the publication of positivity in 2009 and love 2.0 and 2013 she's written about her research for general audiences as well. Doctor Frederickson's contributions have been recognized with numerous honors, including the American psychological associations, Templeton prize and positive psychology, and the society of experimental psychology, his career trajectory award. So I now turn to a very special experts in emotion interview together with Dr Barbara Fredrickson from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. So welcome Barb. Thank you so much for speaking with us today.

Speaker 2:          01:05          It'd be here.

Speaker 1:          01:07          I thought what might be a fun way to kick this off is by asking you a little bit about what first got you interested in emotion.

Speaker 2:          01:14          Yeah. Um, that's a great question. When I started in graduate school, there was really hardly any work on emotions. And ironically, I, I looked back at the first project that I was involved in as a first year student in college and it was somebody doing in their senior thesis on emotions. And I remember thinking, what are emotions? How could, you know, it was just that confusing to me. And even as I was part of the very first cohort of the NIH motion postdoc program that, um, Richard Lazarus and Paul Ekman put together at the time and we had a year long seminar on emotions. And I think I was still halfway through that thinking and what are we talking about? You know, you kind of had this sense, you know, there's something important here, but there was so little science on it beyond face expressions, um, and a little bit of stress and coping. So there really wasn't a fleshed out of view of it. And you know, that actually might have a lot to do with the sort of stoic upbringing I had as a family when the, nobody talked about emotions. So, you know, maybe I was coming at it very much from the outsider's perspective, but um, it's, I, I very much only came to understand emotions from an academic angle. And then I feel like I became more fully human after, after understanding more about emotions. I didn't come from it being fully human first.

Speaker 1:          02:46          And so by studying emotions you become actualized in some way, right?

Speaker 2:          02:50          You've been doing, you know, I feel like that's been my own personal.

Speaker 1:          02:54          Uh Huh. So what I'd like to ask you a little bit is about the really groundbreaking work you've done in this area, especially on positive emotions. So, I mean, you're known widely for this pioneering work and really delineating the functional significance of positive emotions. You've published numerous articles and you have several major books, you know, love 2.0 and positivity. And in particular, what I wanted to talk with you about today is your theory, you know, the broaden and build theory of positive emotions. And I wonder if you could just say a little bit more of sort of what are the central principles behind this model?

Speaker 2:          03:29          Right. Um, the theory first emerged from a, a puzzle and intellectual puzzle of um, trying to understand how emotions involved. And at the time when I got on the scene, the main story about how emotions evolved all hinged on the idea of specific action tendencies that um, you know, uh, kind of a fight or flight response and emotions get you to do what's going to save your skin in that moment. And the kinds of things that had been identified for the positive emotions really were not specific and often not actions. So the, this sort of, um, keystone concept that was our ability or wealthy of understanding why emotions involved just didn't fit at all for the positive emotions. And so when I was doing my postdoc with Bob Levenson at UC Berkeley, I started working on an idea that he had had, which he had written about casually in a chapter before then.

Speaker 2:          04:36          And I thought, that's interesting. I want to study that thing. And his prediction was that well, maybe positive emotions don't have their own physiological signature or really kind of a weight thing that they're trying to do to the body or yes as you to do, but maybe undo, um, negative emotions. And so that's where I started with, um, with Bob in Bob's lab working on tests of this undoing effect of positive emotions. I presented it at a major emotions conference a couple of years later and got a lot of heat for saying that undoing was the function of positive emotions. And that kind of sent me back to the drawing board to read everything I could on evolutionary perspectives, how to make a proper evolutionary argument. And I decided in the end that undoing is not a function of positive emotions. Undoing is a byproduct of one direct function, which are really, it comes in two phases.

Speaker 2:          05:38          Um, broaden and bill, which happened on very different timescales from each other. Thing is what positive emotions do in the moment. They literally changed the way your brain works along with you. Taking more for the nation in your peripheral vision expands. Um, you're more creative. You connect, uh, connect the dots to see the bigger picture. And that's a, a momentary cognitive change that occurs while you're experiencing a positive emotion. Now the other part of the theory is the, so what, why does that matter? How could this save your skin? Um, and the key is that it doesn't save your skin. And the same way that negative emotions might have led to a quick and decisive action that would get you away from a Predator, a positive emotion, um, that broaden mindset, um, experienced frequently allows your, um, you, you're, you're, uh, resources to accumulate and compound and puts you on a positive trajectory of growth.

Speaker 2:          06:39          So the key is the reason positive emotions we're adaptive for our ancestors is that by repeated experiences of positive emotions, we built up more social support, more, um, resilience, better environmental knowledge, better physical health. That's where most of our work is going these days. And that you basically become a more resourceful, a better version of yourself in a way that allows you to address future threats and future challenges. So the benefit of positive emotions isn't in the moment that you experienced them. The benefit of them is having them as a steady diet overtime so that you can grow and become a more resilient, resourceful person over time. So, um, broaden and build as a process isn't one thing. There's broadening that happens in the moment that happens over time. Um, but uh, together it kind of forms this upward spiral that puts people on a, on a positive trajectory of growth.

Speaker 2:          07:47          So what do you see as some of the most central, you know, empirical findings that have flowed from this model? You know, I, I, I think we've, in my lab we've done some interesting studies on how positive emotions broaden awareness, but my favorite studies on broadening awareness come from other people's labs securely. Like the work that Adam Anderson has done where he's shown that, um, uh, at very early stages of encoding people are seeing more of the peripheral vision has expanded. And that's happening at a, it's not something that people report on later. It's really happening at an intake level that people, when they're feeling good, it's like they can't help but take in more of the contextual surrounding inflammation. And it's like, um, it's like the door first of perception are opened up and people taken theirs. They're sponges for contextual and I like how his lamb has also shown that um, that more open visual perception leads to more verbal creativity.

Speaker 2:          08:59          So going [inaudible] you see a connection between different kinds of Broadman and I've also collaborated with uh, a kinesiologist and we've looked at how emotion is conveyed in body movements and we find that there's broadening in the torso to wow them with positive peoples also is expand in ways that reflect the way their mind is expanded and their visions of their social relationships are expanded. So um, this broadened awareness or this expansive way of being in the world is something that comes through in comportment and as embodied as well. So those are some of the things, things that I think are exciting on the broadening side, on the building side, I have to say the thing that I'm most excited about right now is working on changes in gene expression in the immune system. And we're doing a large scale study where we're teaching people different skills for a self generating positive emotions and drawing blood before and after. And then, uh, you know, as long term follow up to see if we can see chain ges and gene expression person that track there, um, efforts to, um, experience more positive emotion and David for life.

Speaker 1:          10:22          It's fascinating. I'm really excited to see where it goes.

Speaker 2:          10:25          Yeah, that's um, we've got very, we've got some cross sectional data that are very suggestive. The tune on data are coming in soon. Wow.

Speaker 1:          10:37          So one thing I always wonder, I mean I love your model. It's so beautiful and elegant and having come from a discrete emotions perspective, you know, myself, I, I wonder to what extent you think this model applies equivalently across states that ranged from, you know, pride, very self focused to gratitude, very other focused or just reward related feelings of enthusiasm and joy. Do we know this at this point?

Speaker 2:          11:01          You know, we really don't know this, that this by, um, uh, we and the, the data are murky in my own studies. We measure, I mean I come from a discrete emotions per se, the two, and to measure people's self reports of about 10 different discrete, positive emotions. And so far we find no distinctions between them that are interventions, which are specifically around kindness, love and compassion. They raise all the positive emotions. Yup. Yup. Said pride, even interest. I mean that could mean that people's self reports are just completely not fine tuned enough to pick things up or it could mean that people co experience these, that they, they are positive emotions are um, uh, experienced as in, in very overlapping in a blended capacities. Um, it could be that the way people conceptualize them. And I'll also, you know, currently very influenced by Lisa Feldman, Barrett pissed and then close to views on how conceptualization matters.

Speaker 2:          12:09          Especially now that I'm offering a new conceptualization of love and how people seem to react to that when they say, oh, I never thought about love that way. And then they start experiencing it a little bit differently. So, um, it's not like, uh, um, I don't think the kinds of data that I've collected can, um, actually say anything about whether emotions are discreet or, or not in terms of the way that debate has been going on in terms of are there discreet brain circuits. Um, discreteness doesn't always seem to be honored in people's, um, uh, self reports of the experience. And, um, actually I sat down with Lisa Feldman Barrett some some time ago and she said, yeah, I was thinking about how my work might relate to yours. And she and I both kind of scratched our heads and said they don't, uh, neither one contradicts the other. Um, so I think that's a great way to push the field further is to really try to understand where the boundaries between those two and where does it matter and where doesn't it matter?

Speaker 1:          13:21          One thing you alluded to in your response that I wanted to ask you more about that. I think so interesting as this work you've done on intervention. So really conducting these important, you know, translational approaches that look at how we can cultivate positive emotion. And I know you've done this among Indian, those individuals even suffering from severe mental disorders like schizophrenia. And so I wondered if you could say a little bit more about the promise of this as a potential, you know, intervention towards a building and cultivating positivity. Right?

Speaker 2:          13:49          You don't want them. What's interesting about it is that I, um, I never thought I was doing translational research or um, develop the intervention. It's just that the, the side of the shape of the bill hypothesis in the broaden and build theory, you can only test it if you look at, well, what happens if someone's daily Diet increases over time? How do they change over time? And started test that got me into a zone that, um, looks like interventions

Speaker 2:          14:23          kicked up some interventions, most certainly. Um, and we've worked particularly with the, the actually, when I first started trying to test this part of the theory, I had a number of failed interventions. Hmm. And then I realized I didn't need to recreate the wheel and build one on my own. I came across this ancient technique of meditation called loving kindness meditation and realize, you know, my a big light bulb went off and I thought I could use that test my theory. So I wasn't really doing research on meditation. I was doing research on emotions using meditation. Um, but it certainly points out the, the power of mind any as a way to learn how to regulate one's emotions. Um, one of my colleagues here, David Penn works on schizophrenia and he heard me give a talk and saw that one of our findings with our normal subjects was, um, that it's a learning, loving kindness meditation helps people anticipate or saver.

Speaker 2:          15:26          It's your positive events, which is, as you know from an cranes were very much, um, at issue with schizophrenia and the, especially the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. So we ran a number of groups where we taught the same exact class that we have hot too, um, healthy community members to community dwelling schizophrenia with negative symptoms. And one of the most surprising things is that these people were selected for their negative symptoms, which means they, they don't feel like, um, they're not very motivated, that don't want to be social. They're not, they don't really talk about emotions. Um, we almost had perfect attendance. Wow. Each thing in and of itself is that they kept coming past, really liked learning this new skill. And, um, we found that on self reports there, um, negative symptomatology was improved. Uh, so it seems to be holding some promise to kind of wake up the positive emotion system, kind of take it off the floor and raise it. Um, and I think that could be useful in a number of different clinical disorders. I'm starting to collaborate with another clinician where we'll look at the effects of, uh, of loving kindness meditation on social anxiety. So, um, you know, as a social psychologist, I do all the clinical work in collaboration with, um, people who are better trained for dealing with diverse populations. But I'm really excited to see those applications come, you know, come on into

Speaker 1:          17:02          a test. I mean, it's amazing research and it's very timely and much needed in the fact that you're saying you're getting these results with some of, you know, when we think of psychiatric disorders, the most severe and chronic of them all schizophrenia. I mean that's just so promising and it makes me wonder, you know, to what extent we can think about this as a potential trans diagnostic type of intervention, you know, to optimize mental health more broadly across populations. I know you're looking at social anxiety disorder, um, and so I wonder to what extent you think we might be cultivating some critical ingredients here therapeutically that we can apply broadly? Right. Well, you know, my, Hi,

Speaker 2:          17:38          I'm take from the theory is that positive emotions help us become better versions of ourselves. I'm mostly testing it with healthy adults and um, you know, that goes trans diagnosis, trans diagnoses. And so I don't think that would be any different when you go into the clinical domain since aspect of, um, dysregulation is so prominent across so many different diagnoses that I think that this is, this is one that holds particular promise.

Speaker 1:          18:10          So having talked a bit about just how you got started in emotion, the really foundational work you've done in positive emotion from you know, this basic science per second aspect of building one of the most, you know, integral models we had to date and then now looking at intervention research. I wonder as you think about the path that you've come through this far, where do you think you see the future of the field headed from this point forward?

Speaker 2:          18:33          Yeah, I think that it's going to be more and more critical for, um, emotion researchers. And this is happening already, but to work in team science with chemists and a genetic guest experts and uh, imaging expert. I mean, and see how far we can understand the physical and um, community effects of emotions. I think that's, um, you know, I'm originally trained as an experimental social psychologist and our kind of bread and butter studies are small laboratory studies, one time tasks. And I think that we're ready to take that out to two larger, bigger, bigger timescales, deeper into the body. And, um, we can't do that. Um, as individual labs, this needs to be done as kind of a big team science. So I see that as something that we should all be heading towards as at least part of what we do. I mean, I think there's, they'll still always be a place for, um, one time laboratory studies, you know, to, to test ideas out, but to, to take it to a larger scale courses depends on funding and things like that. But, um, I think that's going to be a really important funding priority too.

Speaker 1:          19:54          And then related, I mean, when you have students come to you asking me for advice who are thinking about embarking in this field, what do you typically tell them?

Speaker 2:          20:03          You know, I think that, um, you, everybody needs to find a part of the fields that they're absolutely passionate about because, um, I mean, being an academic is, is, uh, a tough job. And the payoffs in terms of, you know, when you get publications are good news is few and far between. So you need to be fueled by your own passion. And there are tons of great questions out there. And, um, just find the one that you want to work on and dig it. And don't worry if it doesn't pay off right away. There are a lot of people who have very slow career starts. I will always be one of that. Um, some, you know, sometimes that just, it just takes a while to get it going. Well, thank you so much

Speaker 1:          20:48          for speaking with us today. It's been wonderful. Okay, thanks. Good to be here. So this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Doctor Barbara Fredrickson from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Thank you again, Barbara. Okay, so.
