Speaker 1:          00:00          Welcome back to human emotion. So today we're going to conclude our discussion on psychophysiology. And essentially going back to the question we started with, which is to what extent is our heart really a window into our soul and our emotions? So we're going to do so today by starting out with an exercise to conclude our discussion on the psychophysiology of emotions. So what I'd like you to do is take out a piece of paper and the pen and think about a time in which you felt a really strong emotion. So maybe you felt really happy or excited, maybe the rice sad, maybe very nervous or scared. Try to identify one moment that really stood out to you. And as you think in this moment, I want you to answer three questions about it. So what did you notice in terms of what triggered it or what was the illicit her second, what did you notice happening in your body where you aware of your heart racing? Were you aware of your palms getting sweaty, where you're aware of your breathing becoming more rapid? And how long did this last? So I'd like you to pause, take a moment to write this down. And when you're done, you can resume the video where we go through our final lecture today on emotions and the body.

Speaker 1:          01:14          So today we'll wrap up our discussion of psychophysiology in our third component, looking at our final, uh, sort of discussion into the question of, is our blood and sweat really a window into understanding our tears and our deepest fears. And here we'll talk about two main themes that are emotion specificity. So how much can we really map specific physiological profiles onto unique motions as well as this idea of coherence, or how well does our heart racing and our skin temperature increasing actually map onto what we would subjectively report we're feeling in the moment. So with today, we'll start first with this question of emotion specificity. And here what we'll start with is looking at this question of whether or not different emotions actually have different autonomic or physiological profiles. So some of you might remember this table that we've introduced at different points throughout the course and earlier on in our discussion of psychophysiology.

Speaker 1:          02:14          So this is a table, um, that you'll see more in readings by Bob Levenson that really advocated for what's called the sort of emotion specificity hypothesis. And this hypothesis suggested that for many of our most basic emotions, we should have unique and distinct profiles, um, a physiologic corresponding in our autonomic nervous system. So here you would see anger is uniquely associated with Bozzo dilation and pupil expansion. You should also see things or sorry, Vaseux um, yeah, dilation, you would see reddening in the skin. You're but blood vessels bulging, you know, your pupils actually constricting, right? With fear. By contrast, you see vasoconstriction, sweat, glands activating. This will lead to changes of seeing sort people becoming Pale, you know, sweating, clammy palms, higher skin conductance or sweat, sadness associated activity. And the tear glands, right discuss is different from all of these. We see activation in the salivary glands where people are actually salivating and drooling when they're feeling disgusted.

Speaker 1:          03:16          And then happiness is one of the most interesting and mysterious emotions to date we see associated with activity in the Vegas nerve or the parasympathetic nervous system. Um, and people will describe this tightness in their chest or goosebumps. So what we're seeing here is really specific kinds of physiological changes associated with distinct emotions. Um, and what you have to ask though, you saw on that table there that have the emotions we have, there was only one on the bottom and that was just happiness, broadly construed. So emotion specificity really took flight by looking at differences among different kinds of negative emotions. So answering the question, in what way does our body change? And we're feeling anger versus fear versus sadness. And not until very recently. So just in the past, you know, five years even have people even begun to try to understand what way different kinds of positive emotions actually look differently in the body.

Speaker 1:          04:13          So we know overall that people have associated experiences of happiness with activity in the parasympathetic nervous system. But what have you take this broad umbrella of positive states and try to look and see if they're different. So our positive feelings, like excitement, different from positive feelings of love or pride. So, in other words, the question you've been seeing here, what about differences among positive emotions? Do we see support for this emotion? Specificity hypothesis there? So here, this is um, a paper that I worked on with my colleagues. Um, we're began to try to look at this question by looking at positive emotions at rest and we found that what you see here is that increased activity of the parasympathetic nervous system. So you measure this using Rsa, which we talked about earlier actually seem to really index important aspects of individual differences in positive emotionality.

Speaker 1:          05:06          So in this study we found for example, that higher degrees of Rsa at rest actually predicted even at these, you know, eight month outcomes, greater increases and you know, positive emotionality. So for one, what we see is that there are physiological measures that seem to map onto positive emotionality and they even longitudinally predict greater increases in positive emotionality. But as you can see here, this is really talking about positive emotion as a whole. So again, what about distinct kinds of positive emotions? Do they look different physiologically? So by and large, this is a field that is still very new and has a lot of unsolved mysteries. Um, so what I'll be presenting to you some data that was recently published in 2011, the very first study to look at distinct autonomic profiles among positive emotions. And I think what's exciting about this, as it opened up, it opens up an entire door of research to more further these mysteries.

Speaker 1:          06:05          Um, but it also brings up a lot of questions too. So this was a study done by Michelle Shiota, um, a professor at Arizona State University where she looked at a broad variety of physiological measures here. So we have heart rate projection period, skin conductance response or electrodermal activity, respiration, Rsa, again, that's respiratory sinus arrhythmia as well as blood pressure, mean arterial pressure. And here she looked at this in response to, as you can see, here are five different categories of distinct positive emotional stimuli. So people watched different emotionally evocative films that really mapped onto emotions of enthusiasm, love, a attachment style, love and nurturing style of love, amusement and awe. And hear what I have highlighted in these black arrows are significant differences that emerged that differentiated each of these five emotions from one another and an upwards Arrow indicates an increase in that of activity in that physiological channel and a downwards Arrow indicates a decrease.

Speaker 1:          07:05          So what can we learn from this? Someone will walk you through the findings slowly and then I want you to think about toit extent. This actually makes sense to you. So the last time you felt enthusiastic or you felt amused, did this seem to map onto your own bodily states? So let's start first with amusements. So if you look here, what we're seeing with enthusiasm, uh, sorry, thieves. Yasmine is increase in skin conductance response and a decrease in Rsa. So in some ways it seems surprising, right? Because we thought that happiness was associated with an increase in Rsa. The way that the author argues that this makes sense is that enthusiasm is the state of excitement and joy. And it's supposed to promote the sort of pursuit of rewards, sort of, uh, increased activity in what's called the behavioral activation system. And so as you're getting really excited to sort of go after that reward and obtain it, what you really want is to get your body mobilized.

Speaker 1:          07:54          You want to get, you know, your skin conductance up and you want to sort of turn down your parasympathetic nervous system. So excitement might actually be a really unique emotion and then it's actually associated with getting that sympathetic activity up and running so you can go pursue and get that reward. When we think of love. So you think of attachment, right? So maybe it's an attachment to a romantic partner. Um, you know, and this is really interesting because what they suggest for example, um, in this research here is you also see an increase in heart rate and a decrease in Rsa. So again, what we're seeing is body bodily mobilization. When we look at discreet or specific kinds of positive emotions. So they would argue that this attachment kind of love it was perhaps mobilizing your approach behavior to go seek out a potential mate, right?

Speaker 1:          08:41          And sort of engage them with you and that you can't just be sitting and resting and digesting. You need to kind of get up and go out there and try to pursue that potential mate or attachment partner. We look here at nurturant love, we see an increase in heart rate and an increase in respiration. So, um, nurturant love actually is a bit of a physiological mystery. We don't quite understand why the body changes in that way. So nurturant love you're thinking of the love you might feel towards a young child or some people who are pet owners will say they feel this way towards their dogs or their cats. Why is our heart racing and we're breathing faster when we're sort of cued to see images of those things is an exciting but really unknown mystery. And I love for you to think about how you would hypothesize, you know, uh, this story to sort of make sense, um, in your own understanding of uh, nurturant love when we get to amusement.

Speaker 1:          09:32          One of the key differences here that really picks out amusement is an increase in respiration. And if you think about the last time you laughed when you were feeling amused, what happens when we laugh? So we talked about this earlier in class. What happens when you laugh as you're actually engaging in a series of very rapid, very short breaths. So essentially when you're amused, you're laughing and that causes your respiration rate to pick up, not surprising. Right? And then finally there's this magical and mysterious emotion of awe. So Ah, is supposed to be this emotion that picks up a sense of wonder and amazement sort of being around something bigger than the self. Um, and this was sort of in contrast to what I think the authors hypothesized. So, um, this is interesting because what we're seeing here is it's not leading to a decrease in physiological arousal, but it is consistent some ways with this sort of cardiovascular undoing hypothesis of amusement.

Speaker 1:          10:26          So in other words, what we're seeing here, um, in some ways, uh, you know, is the sense in which we're sort of disengaging our parasympathetic parasympathetic system, but we're breathing more rapidly and we're even seeing to some extent, um, and increase in pep actually means a decrease in sympathetic activity. So we're seeing in some way, uh, is able to slow our sympathetic nervous system down, right? Maybe to help us sort of take in the vast wonder of things around us. So again, this is the one of the first studies ever done and I'm excited to think about all the new studies that may come after this and start to look at emotion specificity in the whole landscape of broader positive emotions. So, and I want to turn to emotion coherence. And again, if you remember from way back when we first talked about what is an emotion, we talked about what are different features of emotions, sort of what are the core constituents of what makes an emotion and emotion.

Speaker 1:          11:19          And one of the definitions that's proposed by one of the most famous figures and emotion Pollock men, um, when he tried to answer this question, he said, well, there's these, you know, kind of six fundamental features of what is an emotion. And one of them that's taking for granted is coherency. So this is the idea that we should see, um, all of our different channels of emotion, our behavior, our physiology, our subjective quality of what it's like to feel an emotion that these systems work together and they come online together at the same time. So the minute you feel an emotion, your physiology should kick in and should also see an accompanying facial expression. But here people have actually begun to question this basic premise of what is an emotion saying really our emotions really coherent. And one of the first studies that tried to look at this looked at whether or not our physiological, you know, responses that we've talked about in these lectures actually are coherent or map onto subjective reports of how people are actually feeling.

Speaker 1:          12:17          So let me show you what some of these studies have looked like. Um, so for example, what we're going to be looking at here in these studies, in other words, is to what extent does our physiology, so an internal physical sensations, to what extent do they map onto the quality, uh, you know, at the top, sort of what does it like to feel an emotion? Do they actually cohere to, they actually increase and decrease together or are they completely mismatched? So here we're going to ask the question, our emotions really coherent and where's the empirical evidence? So here this was work pioneered by IRS mouse and colleagues who took people into the lab and looked at emotion coherent systematically. So she had people come in and watch emotion films while sitting at a computer, positive, negative and neutral films. And while they're watching these films, she measured second by second assessments and changes in their heart rate.

Speaker 1:          13:09          She also looked at using a continuous rating dial moment by moment, self reports of how a person was stealing from very negative to very positive. And she was able to take these two measurements of heart rate and continuous, uh, self-reported assessments of emotion to be able to look at to what extent we see coherence or correlations between moment by moment, changes in heart rate and moment by moment changes and how people self report their feeling states. And the upshot of the work by Iris Nelson colleagues from this sort of complicated, uh, correlation table that you see here is that there's at most moderate coherence on average, you see the highest coherence between people, self-reported experience and their external expressions of behavior. But since we're talking about psychophysiology, we see almost no match or coherence between people's physiological states and either their subjective experience using the rating dire we saw earlier or their outward displays of emotional behavior.

Speaker 1:          14:06          So really it seems to be the case that emotions might not be as coherent as we just assumed them to be. Now researchers interested in looking at whether or not this was really true for everyone conducted a really interesting study here and this has done by Jocelyn z and colleagues at UC Berkeley where they looked at coherence using a similar paradigm, looking at associations between heart rate and self reported emotion and looked at different kinds of people to see, well maybe emotions are more coherent and some kinds of people than others. So here you can see they had healthy control adults who showed the lowest coherence followed by two really interesting groups of people that are thought to have a sense of increased bodily awareness. So the, these were dancers and meditators and as you can see, they found meditators had the highest degree of coherence between what they reported feeling and what their heart rate actually showed with dance or somewhere in between, in between. So this suggests to some extent that the greater bodily awareness you may have and the greater sort of internal awareness of your own mental states, the raider coherence you're going to show between your body and your mind. So interestingly, there may be coherence, but maybe better for some than others in terms of this almost mind body connection.

Speaker 2:          15:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:21          So with that, I want to conclude now with our takeaway questions, talking about motion specificity and coherence. So what is the physiological evidence in support of emotion specificity, especially for the basic emotions we first talked about that were primarily negative emotions.

Speaker 2:          15:40          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:41          Then what is the physiological evidence in support of emotion, specificity for distinct kinds of positive emotions? Right? So this was this new generation of research as trying to look at distinct autonomic profiles for different positive emotions. And then finally, is there evidence, action, support of emotion coherence, which is thought to be a core part of the basic definition for what is an emotion and what sort of individual difference factors might influence this relationship. So what kinds of people have the lowest coherence and what kinds of people might have the highest coherence.

Speaker 2:          16:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:13          And today I want to conclude with our expert interview as part of the experts and emotion interview series.

Speaker 2:          16:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:20          So today as part of our series we'll be speaking with um, doctor Robert Levenson from the University of California Berkeley, who is going to be speaking with us about this question that's guided much of our discussion today. Blood tears, sweat and fears, the autonomic nervous system and emotion. So doctor Levinson received his phd from Vanderbilt University in clinical psychology and he's currently a professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of California Berkeley, where he's a member of both the behavioral neuroscience, clinical science, developmental and social personality programs. He currently serves as the director of the institute, or a personality in social research, as well as the director of the clinical science program. So Dr Levinson's research program is in the area of human emotion studying the Organization of physiological, behavioral, and subjective systems. The way that these systems are impacted by neuropathology normal aging and culture, and the role that emotions play in the maintenance and disruption of committed relationships. Dr Levinson's research has been supported by grants from the NIH and Nia, and he is the past president of the Society for psychophysiological research and the past president of the association for Psychological Science. So I now turn to a very special experts in emotion interview with Doctor Robert Levenson from the University of California Berkeley.

Speaker 2:          17:44          Okay.
