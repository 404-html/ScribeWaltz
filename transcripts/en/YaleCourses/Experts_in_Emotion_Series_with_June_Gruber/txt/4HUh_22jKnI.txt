Speaker 1:          00:00          So today we'll discuss what meditation is and how exactly it relates to emotional wellbeing. Indeed, we've seen a surge of interest in this concept of mindfulness and meditation in recent years. We see articles here in the New York Times talking about how meditation may actually change the brain. We also see articles here is suggesting and the Huffington Post, that you can unlock the power of meditation to feel happier and more at ease or, and the La Times. This is your mind on meditation, that if you meditate, you'll engage in less mind wandering and do get engaged in more doing or living your life. So it's not surprising that mindfulness and meditation more generally has gained this exploding momentum and be when widely advertised in the media and popular press even more so. There's a sense in which people feel that we ought to be teaching mindfulness in this digital age, that this is an antidote to help solve our current conundrum of being.

Speaker 1:          00:58          So my, you know, so engaged, uh, in mind wandering, so distracted, not focused in the present moment that we need to teach mindfulness, that it's not only an option, but it's actually something that's a dire need. So with all this hype about mindfulness, both in the scientific realm and in the popular media rum, we have to ask ourself what is mindfulness and how exactly does it relate to our emotional health? So today what we're going to be thinking about is what is mindfulness and what does it mean to actually meditate? And also how can we exactly be mindful of our own emotions? And if we're mindful of our own emotions, in what way might this actually change our emotional health? So when we think about this, the Buddha thought and deed that we, mindfulness indeed does promote and, uh, not only promote emotional understanding, but promote increased health.

Speaker 1:          01:53          So he would say to enjoy good health, to bring true happiness to one's family, to bring peace to all one must first discipline and control one's own mind through these sort of contemplated practices like meditation and mindfulness. So today we're going to start our second series on emotional health by delving into the realm of mindfulness and asking ourselves, can we really accept our emotions in the present moment? We're going to do so by first, um, approaching the idea of mindfulness and trying to understand, well, what is mindfulness in the first place? And once we get an operational definition of mindfulness or review some key empirical findings that have associated mindfulness with emotional wellbeing, then we'll conclude with our takeaway questions and expert interview. So first let's ask ourselves, you may have heard of mindfulness in the news. You may have heard friends or colleagues talk about mindfulness, but what exactly is it?

Speaker 1:          02:53          So when we think of mindfulness, it's a form of really cognitive training aimed at learning how and where we guide one's attention. So this involves maintaining awareness of attention from one moment to the next and gently but firmly escorting it back to the initial target object when the mind becomes distracted. So the point of mindfulness meditation is really to train the mind in a way to make it stronger, to get the muscles you know, bigger and better. And faster to be more stable and let it disengage from our typical more automatic thought processes. As you can see here, these are what I think of as four core components in most discussions of mindfulness. So we can think of these as the four critical ingredients of mindfulness. So it includes awareness, sustained attention, focus on the present moment, and nonjudgmental acceptance. So let me walk you through these four elements of mindfulness right now, just defining them briefly and discussing them in turn. So I'll start with the first component of awareness. So what is awareness and a mindfulness oriented approach? So awareness has really defined as the conscious knowledge of one's experience. It includes conscious knowledge of one's body sensations such as breathing, once, thoughts and emotions, and external events and sounds.

Speaker 1:          04:13          What about sustained attention? What does it mean? As the Buddhist said to really discipline one's mind to really gain sort of control over your attention and observe where it takes you, sustaining it in the present moment. So by sustained attention, this is really focusing on placing one's attention on, on an ongoing stream of internal and external stimuli. So it involves bringing attention to the target of observation. And when we get distracted, having your attention gently brought back to the original targeted focus. So often the attention will be focused on one's breathing. So bringing one's breath to your attention. And when you get distracted, your mind wanders to other thoughts about what you want to have for lunch and what you're worried about tomorrow and what's coming up next week. Gently bringing back your attention to your breath. The third component is this sort of focus on the present moment.

Speaker 1:          05:08          And by that what we're talking about is directing one's attention with or without effort to internal and external phenomena at each moment of awareness. So this is a distinct concept from being preoccupied, from fantasizing, and also from ruminating. So here you're literally just focusing your attention on whatever is occurring in the present moment. It may be internal, your thoughts and maybe something external and the environment and you're just letting that happen in the present moment. Just noticing and observing each moment in the present and being fully aware of it. So the final and fourth component often discuss in definitions of mindfulness is nonjudgmental acceptance. So by nonjudgmental acceptance, what this is focusing on is really experiencing the thoughts, sensations, and events as they are at the moment. They enter one's consciousness without judging them as either good or bad, or as desirable or undesirable. And really what you're doing here is you're allowing all experiences, whether good or bad, to arise without trying to change control or of white.

Speaker 1:          06:18          Then this applies both to concrete experiences such as sensory pain, as well as abstract things such as having thoughts or feelings of rejection. So acceptance really allows individuals to appreciate the experience, even if it includes things like negative valuations. Thoughts such as I'm a failure. And what it suggests is that you can simply embrace these thoughts without trying to suppress them, distort them, or sort of escape from them through fantasy. So you're simply accepting whatever thoughts and feelings arise with a nonjudgmental stance towards them. So what I'd like to do now is to think about these four elements and to really highlight the point that all of these four elements are required and important in order to achieve a full moment of mindfulness. So I think of it this way, um, if we have mindfulness in the center, in order to have it, we need awareness, sustained attention, nonjudgmental acceptance, and the focus on the present moment that it's all these four elements that need to come together to have this full circle and embrace and sort of give rise to an experience of mindfulness.

Speaker 1:          07:30          Now, interestingly, recent models that have been proposed and work by myself and some of my colleagues here at Yale have really tried to think about what is the mechanism or process that underlies mindfulness? What is it doing for our emotional life? Does it d automatize our emotional life? So we know that much of our mental life is largely automatic. It's Ha habitual, right? It's literally spontaneous, quick, and even happening before you would realize it in your own conscious and awareness of times. And the process that my colleagues and I have argued here is that what mindfulness does is it helps sort of break us of our habitual modes of responding and really focus on d automatizing emotional life, making one more aware of our attentional processes and thoughts so that we can notice and even change them to ultimately, you know, promote enhanced emotional wellbeing.

Speaker 1:          08:20          So what you see here in this figure is that mindfulness promotes these four components we talked about earlier. Awareness, attention, present moment, focus and nonjudgmental acceptance. And that each of these four critical components of mindfulness gives rise to what we think of as d automatizing processes. So wearness promotes, um, you know, a discontinuation of automatic inference processing. This is from literature looking at priming and stereotyping. Increased and sustained attention enables us to enhance our cognitive control over our emotions, both at, at the attentional control level and gives us cognitive flexibility. Being focused on the present moment helps facilitate metta. Metacognitive insight helps us engage in decentering and sort of less or non elaborative processing. And finally, nonjudgmental acceptance prevents us from engaging in things that would take us away from the actual emotion we're having, right? It, it actually makes us, enforces us to be exposed to the emotions in their raw form, preventing us from suppressing the emotions, distorting them, and even escaping from them.

Speaker 1:          09:23          All of these d automatizing features ultimately produce, promote adaptive self regulation leading to desirable individual and societal health outcomes. Now we've talked a lot about mindfulness, but really what does it actually like? So let me briefly guide you through a meditation exercise, just walking through some of the common steps that you would see often occurring in these exercises with a focus on the breath. So, uh, I'll have you follow these instructions. So first I'd like you to take a moment to adjust your position in front of your laptop computer student probably, and gently close your eyes and settle into your body.

Speaker 2:          10:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:03          If you're sitting in sure that your body is upright and comfortable for you,

Speaker 2:          10:09          okay.

Speaker 1:          10:10          Now in your own way, take a few moments and try to simply relax your body.

Speaker 2:          10:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:22          Once you've done that, perhaps you'll feel the muscles in your body softening, maybe even loosening, relaxing and releasing.

Speaker 2:          10:33          Okay?

Speaker 1:          10:34          Just simply letting go and perhaps even taking a deeper breath. Taking a couple deep breaths. As you breathe out, notice that natural feeling of relaxing and releasing a little more with each out breath. Remember to just simply let, go. Try to pay attention to any sounds you hear. Just listening with a gentle curiosity, letting the sounds come and go, not needing to judge them,

Speaker 2:          11:30          okay?

Speaker 1:          11:31          As you bring awareness to your breath, notice what sensations there are as you breathe in and as you breathe out, feel the air, touch your nostrils. Feel the slight movement of your chest and stomach. If you notice your attention wandering or becoming distracted, you're not alone. We all do this, but you can simply bring your attention back to your breath.

Speaker 2:          12:03          Okay?

Speaker 1:          12:03          Being aware of this breath, being aware of what it is to be breathing in, being aware of what it is to be breathing out.

Speaker 1:          12:15          So that was a very brief introduction to the kinds of exercises one would do in a guided meditation exercise. Um, it would be done for a much longer period. But just to give you the sense that you're picking a sensation, often the breath and focusing on it in the present moment, in a nonjudgmental attitude, simply focusing on it. And if your mind wanders or gets distracted, which it does for all of us, simply noticing it, observing it, and bringing your attention back to the breath. Now if you're interested in doing more of these kinds of exercises, UCLA, the mindfulness awareness research center has some fat, fantastic free meditation. PODCASTS is one place to get started. Um, you can see here they have different exercises focused on, um, but the breathing meditation similar to what we did today, um, as well as meditation, focus on different kinds of, of things such as working with difficulties, loving kindness, um, and breath sound and body. So we've talked about the definition of mindfulness. We've talked about potential mechanisms underlying it such as d automatizing our emotional life, and briefly sort of got a glimpse into what some of these exercises might look like. So now I want to turn to some of the scientific and empirical evidence on how mindfulness may be associated with enhanced emotional wellbeing.

Speaker 1:          13:34          So first we've seen studies that have shown that mindfulness meditation actually is associated with decreased emotional reactivity. So this was a study done by Judson brewer and colleagues comparing mindfulness therapy to traditional cognitive behavioral therapies. And what they found here is we're looking at self reported emotion. Our mindfulness therapy group is in black. And what you're seeing is that as a function of engaging in this type of mindfulness spaced, um, treatment, individuals are reporting reductions in anxiety, sadness, anger, and fear. So we're showing that indeed mindful meditation seems to decrease the motion activity, especially for negative emotions.

Speaker 2:          14:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:17          There's also been really an explosion of work that was originally spearheaded by Richie Davidson at Wisconsin and now other colleagues such as heady Cobar and others, looking at how mindfulness meditation may actually change your brain. So one of the original studies done in 2003 included an eight week randomized controlled study in mindfulness meditation as compared to a weightless control group. These are all healthy adults. At the outset. And what they found is that those who are assigned to the mindfulness meditation group showed actual changes in their brain activity. So we saw increases and left hemispheric. And as you may remember from our earlier lectures on the emotion and brain, when we see sort of lateralization with relatively great activity in the left hemisphere, this has been associated with the subjective experience of positive mood and emotion.

Speaker 1:          15:07          There's been more recent studies also looking at potential neuromechanisms underlying mindfulness training, showing that it alters the neural expression of sadness. So here, authors used in Fmri study to compare neuro reactivity to a laboratory provocations of sadness and those who either underwent eight weeks of mindfulness training or waitlisted control group. And what they found is that those who are in the mindfulness training group exhibited greater what they called visceral and Somata sensory activation in the brain during sadness. And that this pattern of neural reactivity was associated with decreased depression severity scores. So what this suggests, they argue is that mindfulness may help sort of balance, um, this, this intricate balance between emotions and sensory networks and may actually support a fuller portrait of both the conceptual and body-based representations of emotion. And by doing so, this may help actually reduce vulnerability to depression. We also see if we think of clinical applications, there's been many now studies looking at clinical applications of mindfulness meditation across a host of Dsm disorders ranging from anxiety disorders to depression to even bipolar disorder.

Speaker 1:          16:19          But one of the studies that, that I'm highlighting today is looking at substance use and abuse. So here there's been studies looking at mindfulness meditation as a way to actually curb cigarette craving and use. So what you see here is if you compare mindfulness training, um, what you find is that it actually is associated with Gregor smoking abstinence. Um, so it's really fascinating when you look at this work again done by Judson brewer here at Yale University. And additional work has filed this up by Heti, Cobra and colleagues as well. Looking at how meditation actually is associated reductions and craving for a whole host of substances outside of simply cigarette use. So what we're seeing is that it helps curb addictions, helps us retain control over some of these impulses we have towards using substances that may ultimately be harmful for us. So here's an example of one study that Heady Cobra was an author on showing that mindful attention reduces neural and self reported cue induced craving and smokers.

Speaker 1:          17:16          So again, this is further suggesting that we're not only seeing reduction than self reported craving to different types of substances such as cigarettes, but we're also seeing parallel and robust patterns when we look at neural patterns of activation and response to cues that would normally elicit craving in smokers such as cues of a cigarette. Now if you look at this here, um, for those of you that like to watch ted talks, um, I highly recommend this Ted talk on the habits of happiness. Um, this, this, this man is, is a Buddhist monk at author and photographer and has often been called the happiest man in the world. He has a really interesting quote where he says, mine training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors cannot happen at the same time. You could go from love to hate, but you cannot at the same time towards the same object or the same person want to harm and wants to do good. So this is one of the most popular talks you can find on the Ted talks and I highly recommend watching it if you're interested in learning more about some of these core principles underlying mindfulness. I'm from a very scholarly Buddhist monk, author as well as photographer.

Speaker 2:          18:23          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          18:24          so we've talked a little bit about mindfulness, what it is, what are the mechanisms? We've sort of scratched the surface of some of the key empirical findings that have associated mindfulness with reduced emotional or activity changes in neural reactivity and even changes in craving for substances as well as knowing that it's associated with reductions in symptoms severity such as depression, vulnerability. What I now want to do is turn to our takeaway questions for today. The first question asks, how would you define mindfulness and what are the four critical ingredients? Second, what does the support of evidence that suggests that mindfulness can actually alter patterns of self reported emotional reactivity. And third, what is the supportive evidence that suggests mindfulness can also alter patterns of neural activity that are commonly associated with emotionality as well as cognitive control over our emotions. So now we'll turn to our experts in emotion interview series.

Speaker 2:          19:26          Okay,

Speaker 1:          19:26          today we'll be speaking with doctor heady Cobar on craving and mindfulness, Dr Cobras and assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine, as well as the director of the clinical and affective neuroscience lab and director of research at the Yale therapeutic neuroscience clinic. Doctor Cobras interest are focused on using a multilevel approach to understand the use of cognitive strategies to regulate emotion. She's used both behavioral and neuro imaging tools to better understand the psychological and biological mechanisms that underlie processes related to emotion craving, the cog cognitive regulation of emotion and craving in both healthy adult as well as psychiatric populations. Dr Cobra has received several honors, including the National Institute of Drug Abuse, women and Gender Travel Award, the National Institute of Drug Abuse, early career investigator travel award, and the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation Scholar Award. Her work has also been mentioned in the popular media, including outlets such as CNN, ABC News, La Times, and US news and world report. So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with doctor heady. Cohbar.
