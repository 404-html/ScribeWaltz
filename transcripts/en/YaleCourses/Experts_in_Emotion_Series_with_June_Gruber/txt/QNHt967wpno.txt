Speaker 1:          00:00          Welcome back to human emotion. Today we'll be talking about the relationship between emotion and hormones delving into the neuroendocrine system and all its glory and mysteries. As you can see here. And in particular what we're going to be doing by concluding with our third segment on emotion and health is looking at in what way do hormones actually make us emotional? So when you think of this as a common expression, that hormones make you emotional, but to what extent is empirical science in the world of emotion actually support this sort of lay notion? Do emotions actually lead us to be more hormonal and do hormones make us more emotional? So let's talk about hormones. Let's first start by defining what is a hormone in the first place. So here you can see in Greek hormone means to excite. So stalling was the first of formally define hormones as the chemical messengers, which speeding from cell to cell along the bloodstream may coordinate the activities and growth of different parts of the body.

Speaker 1:          01:04          What is the function of hormones? So we know that hormones bind to specific receptors located throughout the organism and they're involved in various bodily processes such as reproduction, digestion, growth, metabolism, mood, cell death or survival, as well as immune responsivity among the whole broad host of functions. So what's important to know is that there's three main categories or types of hormones, so we have steroid hormones, androgen estrogens and glucocorticoids. We have peptide hormones such as Vasopressin, oxytocin and insulin, and then we have monoamine hormones such as norepinephrine and epinephrine. Okay, so steroid hormones, peptide hormones, and Mondo mean hormones.

Speaker 1:          01:50          What evidence do we have though, for interactions between hormones and behaviors? Right? Especially those we're going to think about as we delve into this lecture today that may be relevant to emotions, so we know that hormone only dependent behavior should disappear when the source of the hormone disappears, right? We should also see that when you restore that missing hormone or hormone source, then that should restore the behavior. We should also see that the hormone concentration and behavior frequency should positively correlate with one another. In other words, is the hormone concentration goes up. The frequency of that given behavior, we think to be associated with the hormone should also increase. So we've talked about what a hormone is, what its function, what are the different types of hormones, and what evidence we should see a scientist to suggest that there is a relationship between a hormone, any given behavior.

Speaker 1:          02:42          But how do we collect hormone data? So there's three different ways we do it. And the bottom line here is that many of our common bodily fluids contain hormones. So the most common way to collect hormonal data is to do it through saliva. And this is most commonly done of ease. Um, so participants will spit saliva into a tube and you'll then be able to look at its contents for different kinds of hormone level concentrations. The second method is blood collection, though it must be collected with a sterile needle and done by a certified technician or phlebotomist. Um, so it's a bit more complicated when it comes to the feasibility of collecting these particular types of data. The third is urine, so it's similarly reliable to blood, um, but it's cheaper, easier, and noninvasive.

Speaker 1:          03:30          So how do you store data once you collect it? So what's really important when it comes to collecting hormone data is that it must be frozen quite soon after you collected. And the storage temperatures are incredibly cold, so negative 20 degrees Celsius, and then you must analyze it within four months of freezing. So you've got to put it in the freezer right away, keep it cold and then analyze it pretty quickly. Um, interestingly you also see what are called super cold or super low freezers that are negative 80 degrees Celsius. And these are used if you need to keep a particular sample longterm or what they call archival storage. And if you do this, you have no limit on, on storage length.

Speaker 2:          04:12          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:12          And then the idea of scoring hormones or an assay. So hormone levels are determined if you're looking at saliva, blood or urine by a process called Radio Immuno Assay. So unless your lab is certified for benchwork, you have an entire lab devoted to this process. Most psychology labs we find often will ship these frozen samples to independent labs to score them. And what you'll get and once you send your samples out is you'll get a nice spreadsheet back with numbers that are ready to conduct statistical analyses on your hormone of choice. So I spent some time going through background of what is a hormone, what is the function, you know, how do we relate it to behavior and how do we collect it and score it so that now we can be in a better position to start our roadmap, where we're going to talk about two broad domains of hormones that's in critically important for emotion functioning. This includes stress hormones and sex hormones. So we'll go through these two categories today and then we'll conclude with our takeaway questions and expert interview. So let's start first now with stress hormones.

Speaker 2:          05:14          Okay,

Speaker 1:          05:14          so stress, we talked about this in a recent lecture, but let's revisit what is stress? So stress has been defined as the degree to which people have to change and Rayanne readjusts in order to maintain their sense of homeostasis. So stress can be either psychological or it can be physiological and it can either be acute, so very time limited and brief or can be more chronic sort of spanning a longer duration of time. When it comes to psychological stress, it is defined as the degree to which people have to change and readjust their lives in response to an externally event. And as we spoke about and one of our earlier lectures, stress need not be necessarily associated with a good or bad event, but we can see stress occurring in all kinds of situations ranging from is widely from weddings to funerals, to graduations, all of these types of events or sources of potential psychological stress.

Speaker 1:          06:07          When we think of physiological stress, by contrast, it's been defined as the degree to which your body has to regulate its processes in order to maintain a type of physical homeostasis. Okay, so these are two different broad types of stress and when we think of stress we, there's kind of two different kinds of major stress axes. So we have the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal access or what's called the HPA axis. So the HPA access releases glucocorticoid such as cortisol in response to stress. And you also have what's called the Sam access or the sympathetic adrenal Medulla Larry Axis. And this releases catecholomines in response to stress. So these are kind of our two main kinds of stress axes or systems. Let's start with cortisol. So this is one of the most widely known unpopular I stress hormones that's been utilized across a whole variety of different types of studies in the field of psychology and specifically in the field of emotion.

Speaker 1:          07:03          So Cortisol, what is cortisol? So it's a catabolic stress hormone regulated by the HPA axis that we just talked about a moment ago. And in terms of action, what it does is it helps metabolize lipids and muscle tissue in order to help release glucose. And what it can measure then when it comes to psychological parameters is acute stress. So you can look at Cortisol reactivity by looking at what are called phasic changes from one time point to another. So from someone's resting baseline measured by saliva. And you can also then look at these levels of saliva that reflect cortisol released 18 minutes earlier. So you can see phase it changes in reactivity from baseline in response to a stressor. But what's really important to know is that cortisol doesn't react right away. And then what you're likely to see in the saliva is reflecting cortisol that was released approximately 18 to 20 minutes earlier.

Speaker 1:          07:55          You can also look at chronic stress through the use of cortisol. Here you can look at what's called the cortisol awakening response. So you can look at the trajectory of Cortisol and hour upon waking. Um, and you can also look at what's called hair cortisol. So these are, if you actually sample someone's hair, you can see their average cortisol levels over the previous four months. So it's almost crazy to think that we show signs of stress physically in our hair and that it's a marker of how much stress we've undergone the previous four months of our life simply by looking at a strand of hair. Now I want to move to d. H. E. So this is an anabolic stress hormone, also released by the HPA access and it's action is to protect against tissue damage caused by cortisol by promoting healing and tissue growth. So it measures reactivity of sulfate of Dha, EPA, also known as Dha, EPA posture, be s and that phasic changes. You can look at from baseline, also measured in the saliva. And similarly it's reflecting levels that were released 18 minutes earlier. And you can also look at what's called the anabolic balanced by looking at the ratio of Dh s to cortisol as well.

Speaker 1:          09:10          And then there's the alpha amylase. So here, this is a catabolic stress hormone released by the Sam access as opposed to the HPA access. And what this particular stress hormone does is it met, helps us to metabolize starches in the blood as well as brain sugars. And the key measure is often looking at reactivity in this particular stress hormone. So again, you can look at phasic changes from baseline, measured in the saliva, but here you've got a shorter time window. So when you look at levels of saliva, you're seeing amounts of the stress hormone that were released five minutes earlier. So we've talked a bit about stress hormones and what I want you to take home here is that cortisol has been the most popularized of all of them thus far and is typically measured using saliva samples. And you can look at it both to measure acute stressors.

Speaker 1:          09:54          So sort of Phasic, reactivities stressors in a lab situation as well as more chronic or longterm stress by looking at the cortisol, awakening response and even measuring hair related cortisol releases. What I want to turn now though, is to look at sex hormones. So we have three different categories of stress hormones. We have testosterone, we have extra dial as well as oxytocin. So let's walk through each of these. So when we start with testosterone, we know that testosterone is an anabolic sex steroid synthesize in both the testes and ovaries. And we know that tonic or sort of baseline levels of testosterone are related to dominant behavior. So this is really interesting. We think about emotion because my Disney associated with socially dominant categories of emotion, like pride for example. It's also associated with the regulation of the HPA stress, access during dominance related tasks, and of course as related as many of us think about in terms of sexual libido, both for men and women.

Speaker 1:          10:51          Interestingly, when we think about, again, emotional behavior and in the realm of social dominance, we see phasic increases in testosterone after people win competitions. So we might think about this as an index of dominant related behavior. And again, I think of the discrete emotion of pride, which is associated with displaying one's elevated status within a social hierarchy. So can we think of testosterone is helping us gauge specific kinds of emotions that are related to elevating one's sense of self status or experiencing some sort of social class distinction of one being more socially dominant than another. These are some interesting questions that are currently being explored. What we have seen when you look at testosterone in situations of social competition is that you see phasic changes in testosterone after competition. So while winners of a competition show an increase in testosterone losers show a decrease. So we're seeing also testosterone change in terms of whether people experience, you know, rewards or losses as well.

Speaker 1:          11:51          So it's sensitive to the type of stimuli that is emotionally laden as well as an environment too. So reward we've talked about in this course as being associated with a whole type of positive approach related emotions and loss as being associated with a type of negative withdrawal related emotions as well. Now here we think of estrodial. So this is an antibiotic sex steroid metabolites from testosterone and tonic levels are related interestingly to positive mood and lower levels are related to the experience and severity of mood disorders. Now interestingly, if we turn to Oxytocin, we also see that head has wide reaching implications for emotion as well. So oxytocin is a neuropeptide that doubles as a hormone and there's been a lot of research on oxytocin as what they call the love hormone or the attachment hormone. So we see it associated with a whole host of affiliate of types of behaviors between people.

Speaker 1:          12:47          So it's really set these kind of key social attachment events. So sexual climax, but also childbirth and nursing in a monogamous mammals. It coworkers with dopamine receptors in the brain and it actually increases trust among strangers. So there's been experimental studies showing that if you can manipulate the levels of oxytocin people experience sometimes their intra nasal spray, they'll actually trust other people more. So it's a sense in which it sort of brings us and binds us socially to other people. So hence has been called the love hormone. And if we think about how might this be relevant to our emotional lives? Well we've talked about a whole variety of different distinct classes of emotions thus far. And you might think about some of the socially relevant or prosocial emotions. And to what extent do motions like compassion, love, maybe even gratitude. To what extent can we look at these in conjunction with levels of oxytocin?

Speaker 1:          13:41          So these are some of the exciting empirical questions that are being investigated by aspect of science researchers, is how can we look at some of these hormones we've talked about today and relate them to some of the key kinds of emotions and they're distinct functions that we've talked about thus far in this class. And how can we think about the measurement of hormones through neuroendocrinology as a really important and novel tool in our repertoire? So we've talked about subjective reports of emotion, outward displays of expressive behavior, neuroimaging. To what extent can we now think about leveraging insights from our understanding of hormones and human behavior to even better understand our emotional wellbeing and regulation on another level. So I talked about hormone state because it's an exciting new methodological tool that only recently have people in the field of human emotion really tried to grasp onto and to leverage, to gain insights into how it might help us understand our own emotional makeup.

Speaker 1:          14:37          So with that, we've talked a little bit about stress hormones, a little bit about sex hormones, talked at the end about what kinds of potential empirical insights we can gain from this. And again, these are sort of novel cutting edge tools that were only recently beginning to apply to the study of emotion. So want you to think about as a student or someone who's interested in emotion, how might you use these tools to better understand emotions ranging from pride, compassion, gratitude, as well as social bonding and how emotions help subserve that function. So with that, I'm going to turn now to our takeaway questions. Our first question asks, what is a hormone and what are the specific types of hormones that were discussed at the beginning of our lecture today? And in what way can you try to conduct data collection if you're someone interested in scientifically measuring and collecting these data samples. Second, what are the distinct stress hormones that were discussed today and what does each of their respective functions?

Speaker 2:          15:35          Okay,

Speaker 1:          15:35          what are the distinct sex hormones that were discussed today and what does each of their respective functions as well?

Speaker 2:          15:41          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:43          Now I want to turn to our expert interview. This is part of our experts in emotion interview series today for experts in emotion interview. We have the honor of speaking with doctor [inaudible] Mehta. So Dr Mehta is currently an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Oregon. He received his Ba from Williams college and his phd in social personality psychology from the University of Texas at Austin. Before starting at the University of Oregon as faculty, he completed postdoctoral fellowships as a Columbia University, as well as Erasmus University and the Donders institute in the Netherlands. His research examines the psychological and biological processes that help regulate status, hierarchies and decision making. So I now turn to a very special experts in emotion interview together with Dr [inaudible] Mehta on emotion and hormones and upcoming and very exciting field.
