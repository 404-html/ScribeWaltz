Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello, welcome back to human emotion. Um, today we'll be returning to a discussion of morality and emotions. So what role can emotion actually play in making us moral creatures? So how can it influence whether we behave good or whether we behave bad? And how much do emotions actually influence our decisions of what might be right from what might be wrong? And then how much in turn can influence our own moral behavior? Can it shape whether we act virtuous and good or act wrong or bad? So this is where we're going to turn to questions such as, can emotions actually underlie morally good behavior? Can emotions actually make us good people or good citizens of the planet? By contrast, can emotions also make us bad as well? So today though, we're going to focus on the ways in which emotions may actually make us good. So this is our second part in understanding emotion and morality.

Speaker 1:          00:59          So here we're going to talk about the good side. So we're going to talk about feelings of compassion, of elevation, and of gratitude, and what way they may actually shape morally virtuous or good behavior. So in other words, this is the lighter side of emotion and morality particular, we're going to cover our roadmap today as follows. We're going to start with compassion, turn to gratitude and elevation and conclude with our takeaway questions and expert interview. So let's first start with this emotion that we've probably all felt but maybe never thought about. How it might actually shape our own moral, the good behavior, which is this emotion of compassion. And if we were turned to our broader moral emotion families we saw in our last lecture, we'll see that compassion falls in what's called the two smaller families of moral emotions outlined by Jonathan Heit. Now he said that compassion is what's called an other suffering emotion.

Speaker 1:          01:56          So remember that the core feature of moral emotions included prosocial or benevolent action tendencies. And it was, we know from discussing earlier in class, um, emotions motivate certain kinds of behavioral action tendencies. Originally we talked about them in terms of flying or fighting or fleeing or fighting. But when we get to the moral emotions here, we're going to see action tendencies that are more intended towards benefiting other people. And upholding the social order. So here, let's start with this other suffering class of emotions called compassion. So this is the oldest class of moral emotions, originally referred to as sympathy. And also compassion. And early scholars wrote about compassion as the foundation or backbone of human reality, including Adam Smith. He said, when we see a stroke aimed and just ready to fall upon the leg or arm of another person, we naturally shrink back and draw back our own leg or our own arm.

Speaker 1:          02:59          And when it does fall, we feel it in some measure and are hurt by it as well as the sufferer. So as you can see, an Adam Smith's early observations, compassion is really defined as being moved by another suffering or a deep feeling and understanding of the misery or suffering and and of another person. And having this sort of concomitant desire to try to alleviate suffering in someone, to try to help them feel better. So compassion is really interesting too because it was also talked about, um, in early evolutionary theories, as you can see here by Darwin. So he thought that compassion, which he called sympathy, was associated with natural selection, survival of the fittest, and thought that compassion was actually one of our strongest instincts. So he argued that it has been increased through natural selection over time, and that those communities which had the greatest number of the most compassionate or sympathetic people would flourish best and rear the greatest number of offspring.

Speaker 1:          04:01          So he said that just hear that sympathy will have increased through natural selection for those communities, which included the greatest member of the most sympathetic members would flourish best and rear the greatest number of offspring. So not only is compassion seem to be some of the most central moral backbone of who we are, Darwin here even argued that it's what promoted our longterm survival and was naturally selected for over the course of evolution. So we've been selected to be compassionate species. He would argue. So compassion's interesting because indeed, as you can see here in all these pictures, we've seen a variety of humanitarian crises in recent years such as Hurricane Katrina or the major earthquake in Haiti. And compassion doesn't just drive us to help people who are related to us, but often drives us to help complete strangers. And people we may have never even met.

Speaker 1:          04:58          So for this reason, when we think of kind of evolutionary analyses of compassion and pro social behavior, it can be sort of difficult or tricky to explain, right? Because when we act for the benefit of others, it's often that a great cost or maybe even risks to our own selfish wellbeing. So why will we be born as these compassionate beings moved to try to help people that we don't even know that live thousands of miles away to help them at our own selfish cost of time, of resources, of energy as it because we are truly an innately compassionate human beings that care about the broader, greater, greater social order of humanity. So I think we want to first start then when we think about how powerful compassion is and how much it's been discussed as the central feature of what makes us human by first taking a step back and asking ourselves, well, what is compassion in the first place? So compassion is defined as follows, the experience of feelings, chiefly emotions similar in kind to those expressed by or known to exist in another person. It sets aside our own personality and moves us to partake of the pleasure or pain, the happiness or misery of other people.

Speaker 2:          06:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:19          So when we think about our analysis we've done with many emotions in this course and break it up in terms of an illicit or action tendency, compassion has really evolved out of this mammalian attachment system. And as such, it is elicited by perceiving distress or suffering in another individual. This need not be just our own kin. It need not even be just humans. As you can see here. We also may feel it for other animals such as dogs, um, and other pets in our lives. And the action tendency that's really important is when we proceed this distress or suffering and other people, we are motivated to act pro socially to help them to comfort them or alleviate their suffering. So compassion has this really prosocial orientation to try to remedy the suffering of others at first sight of it.

Speaker 2:          07:08          Okay?

Speaker 1:          07:09          So we know 'em and work by Daniel Batson. As you can see here that compassion and related feelings of empathy really take us outside of ourselves and orient us towards other people. So in Daniel Batson's work, he asked participants to feel empathy and or he asked them to just be objective and found that when people are asked to feel empathy, which is related to compassion, that it actually led to greater concern for other people and importantly motivated more helping or pro social behavioral tendencies. So it not only turns our attention outwards but then motivates us to act in ways that assist or aid other people.

Speaker 2:          07:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:49          Importantly, compassion is something that we seem to almost be born with, right Darwin and say we were naturally selected or to have the system in us from very young. So you see research showing that from birth to 14 months in infants that they will react with distress to cries of other infants, perhaps showing compassion for distress of other individuals around their same age. And then after the first year of life, this distress of others can actually then lead them to engage in helping behaviors. So they first pick up on distress and mimic it. And then later on in life, even just after one year of age, this distress that they see admitted and others actually motivates them to try to go alleviate suffering and to help others. So indeed, it does seem to be that were profoundly compassionate beings and that this is something that emerges very, very early on in life for us.

Speaker 1:          08:43          We also see, uh, compassion across species. So for example, one study looked at on a distressed albino rat who was suspended in mid air as you can see here on right. And what they found is that another fellow rat would actually make the effort to press the lever to lower this rat to the ground. So there's a sense in which they saw even albino rats who see another distress rat will be motivated to engage in behavior to help that individual and relieve or alleviate their suffering. Similarly, we also see this in nonhuman primates. So rhesus monkeys will also press a bar to receive a food reward, large or small. The large food reward, however, causes electric shocks for another monkey. So upon realizing this, most monkeys will forego a larger food reward and stop pressing the bar in order to alleviate the distress of the, uh, electrically shocked McGee.

Speaker 1:          09:40          So they're not only trying to alleviate the distress of a muggy, but they'll forgo their own personal concerns for food. Right? So it seems that humans and other species are really built to try to Ha, you know, be a compassionate and alleviate the suffering of others. So we've talked about compassion and now I want to turn to gratitude and elevation. So this is our final four cell box here where we're going to conclude with this final, smaller family of moral emotions, which are called the other praising moral emotions like gratitude and elevation, again, as outlined by Jonathan Height. So when we think of gratitude and elevation, it seems that they may represent this sort of brighter side of moral emotions. So we know that people are sensitive to good deeds and moral exemplars, and these immoral emotions, gratitude and elevation are thought to be products of good or virtuous acts by other people.

Speaker 1:          10:37          You can see here helping people, you know, in a soup kitchen, helping suffering animals and helping small children in need of aid. So first that we think about gratitude, again, using this kind of functional analysis, we see that gratitude is elicited by a perception that another person has done a good deed for yourself, whether it's intentional or voluntary, right? Someone's done something good for you. This leads you to feel grateful or gratitude for them. So it's defined as a state of being grateful, warm, and friendly towards some benefactor. And gratitude is thought to be this important human strength as well, right? It contributes to personal wellbeing, civic engagement, and even spiritual satisfaction. Um, and the action tendency then associated with gratitude has this what they call moral motive. So it makes people act more pro socially and help others. So when you feel grateful for something someone has done to you, you're more likely than to go and sort of pay it forward by doing something good to someone else. So, not surprisingly, a whole host of psychological interventions under this broad umbrella of positive psychology have actually created and cultivated what they call gratitude interventions to try to elicit feelings of daily gratitude and people in to not only have them appreciate the benefactors are people that have done good for them, but in turn to motivate people to pay it back and do good deeds towards others.

Speaker 2:          12:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:05          And interestingly, um, there's been research showing that gratitude not only as good for other people in terms of promoting pro social behavior, but gratitude in and of itself may actually be healthy for us. So Michael McCullough did a study where he showed that increased gratitude not only benefits those who are the recipients, but that the more you feel gratitude, so the more you're feeling grateful on a daily basis, it actually enhances your resilience to stressors. Your physical health improves as well as your overall quality of life. So feeling grateful is it really good for you? And so, as we touched on earlier, this has led to a really prominent and powerful focus. Um, some people even call it an explosion of these gratitude interventions that are aimed to promote psychological wellbeing alongside more traditional psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy or psychodynamic therapy. These gratitude interventions really seem to be playing a big role that has yet been until recently been understudied. Just the fact that gratitude can actually promote all kinds of fantastic physical and emotional and social benefits.

Speaker 2:          13:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          13:19          So when we think about gratitude and elevation, so again, this is in this what's called other praising family. Um, what we saw here, we just talked about gratitude. So you know, the perception that another person has done a good deed and motivates this kind of moral motive or more prosocial action tendency. Um, but there's also this emotion of elevation. So this is a really mysterious, really exciting, um, and really kind of all inspiring state. So elevation has also been called awe, the awe, awe, and it's experienced, um, in response to being around things that seem larger than the self, almost this larger than life phenomena. So you might remember a time you felt really elevated or awe, all inspired when you saw something. Absolutely beautiful. Um, maybe it was a work of art in a museum. Maybe you went on a hike in nature and you are at the top of the mountains looking out over the world. Um, or maybe you saw someone who had just exceptional actions or abilities. Um, someone you really revered, someone you really respected. And by seeing people who saw or, or things in the environment that are really larger than life, what it motivates you to do is to become a better person yourself. To try to take a step up towards being something that's larger than your current self.

Speaker 2:          14:37          Okay?

Speaker 1:          14:38          And Jonathan Heit talked about the state of elevation, which he recalled as this manifestation of humanity, humanity's higher or better nature. So when people experience elevation, they report these pleasant and even almost like tingling, goosebumps, sensations. Um, and what it does that's really interesting is that it turns your attention away from the self towards becoming a better person and towards helping other people, right? So elevation is this positive emotion that's elicited when you observe other people or other parts of your external world that are particularly virtuous, commendable, or maybe even spiritually magnificent in some way. So it's almost experiencing something just absolutely amazing and larger than life itself.

Speaker 2:          15:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:30          Some of these discussions we've had today about moral emotions and including discussions of law. I'm very interested in reading further. I highly recommend this book by Dacher Keltner at UC Berkeley called born to be good. The science of a meaningful life in which he talks about all these ways in which not only are we innately born to be good people to act compassionately, to experience elevation and gratitude, but what are the ways that we may continue to try to, you know, leverage our own dispositions to continue to cultivate a better and more meaningful life as we continue forward. Um, if you're also interested in reading, um, Dacher Keltner is also the founder of the greater good science center at UC Berkeley. You can see here, greater good.berkeley.edu and hear what you can see as uptodate discussions of scientific events, community events that are occurring, such as you can see here, different conferences that try to talk about mindfulness and compassion, um, as well as a whole host of other ways to really try to understand and participate in what they called the science of a meaningful and morally virtuous life. Similarly, at Stanford University, they've recently founded the center for compassion and altruism, research and education. So it's CC care.stanford.edu if you're interested in really trying to understand how can we, uh, conduct research to better understand compassion and altruism and what are different ways to educate the world, both students and the general community, um, to be a more compassionate society.

Speaker 2:          17:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:02          And in closing, as Jonathan Heit said, morality is therefore like the temple on the hill of our human nature. It is our most sacred attribute, a trait that is often said to separate us from other animals and bring us closer to God. So something's really special about this lighter, virtuous side of morality. It's what makes us human and may actually help bring us to a more elevated place and our own existence here on the planet earth. Um, and with that we will turn next week to talk a little bit about in our third module on emotion and morality. What does it look like in certain individuals who may lack these fundamentally virtuous emotions such as compassion and empathy? Right? So these emotions are just so critically important because when we seem to have an absence of them, we can see some people performing what my order considered some of the greatest evils possible.

Speaker 1:          18:00          So here we can see Ted Bundy, who many would argue really had a profound lack of compassion, empathy when describing some of his heinous act say, you know, I mean, there's just so many people. So we'll have Dr Joshua Buckholtz from Harvard University speak with us more as we think about not only the lighter side of morality, but what happens when these morally virtuous emotions go awry and we delve into the darker side of morality and emotion. So with that, I want to now conclude with our takeaway questions from our second module on emotion and morality. Looking at the lighter or good side. So the first question asks, how was compassionate moral emotion? What are its illicit, hers and Associated Action Tendencies? How is gratitude a moral emotion and what are its illicit bitters and associated action tendencies? And similarly for elevation, how is it in a moral emotion? And again, what I really want you to have here as a sense of how are these emotions truly moral and what trigger them and what behavioral tendencies follow from them.

Speaker 1:          19:05          And with that we'll turn to our expert interview as part of the experts and emotion interview series. Today we'll be speaking with doctor Jamil Zaki on empathy and emotion doctors. Aki is an assistant professor of psychology at Stanford University. His research examines the neural basis of social cognition and behavior. In other words, how do people come to understand each other and decide to behave towards each other? So this work spans a number of domains, including empathy, theory of mind, social influence, and pro social behavior. Doctors, Zach, he received his BA in cognitive neuroscience from Boston University and his phd in psychology from Columbia University, after which she conducted postdoctoral research on altruism and prosocial behavior at the Harvard Center for Brain Science. He's received research and teaching awards from the Society for personality and Social Psychology, the cognitive neuroscience society, the Society for neuroscience, the American psychological association, the association for Psychological Science, autism speaks as well as Harvard University. So I now turn to a very special experts in emotion interview with one of the most, uh, empathic people that I know, which is doctor Jamil Zaki speaking with us on empathy and emotion.
