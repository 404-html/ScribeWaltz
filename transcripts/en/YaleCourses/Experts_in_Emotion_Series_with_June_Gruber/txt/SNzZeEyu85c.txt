Speaker 1:          00:01          Dr. Bailey is a professor of psychology at Northwestern University and highly regarded for his work on the etiology of sexual orientation, gender nonconformity, the genetics of sexual orientation and the sexual arousal response. He's the author of the well known book, the man who would be queen the science of gender bending and transsexualism, which was published in 2003 and his work has received widespread attention in the media, including the Boston Globe and Washington Post, CBS, CBS news just to name a few. So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Dr. Michael Bailey. So welcome Mike. Thanks for speaking with us today.

Speaker 2:          00:44          Thanks for having me.

Speaker 1:          00:45          So one of the questions I wanted to ask you about, um, so you start off our conversation today is what got you interested in studying emotion and sex, sort of, where did it all begin in the first place?

Speaker 2:          00:58          Well, uh, I was, uh, clinical psychology graduate student at the University of Texas and I was taking a graduate, uh, sex course and it became clear to me how much interesting questions, how many, how much interesting work there was to be done, uh, in that domain. Uh, you know, let's be honest, everybody finds sex to be a pretty interesting topic, but for various reasons, people tend to avoid it. And it seemed like an each, uh, that and you know, I really glad that I went there because I've, uh, been able to do some interesting things.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Fantastic. And so some of the interesting things you've been doing or exactly where I'd like to Kinda start off our questions today about your work, because it's something like you're saying, that appeals to almost everyone yet I'm really, I think until use pioneer work in this area, we knew almost nothing, especially when we related it to things like sexual arousal and emotion. Um, so what I'd love to ask you a bit about, so in this realm, I mean, you're really widely known for demonstrating distinct patterns of sexual arousal response between men and women. And men and women of differing kind of sexual orientations. So I wonder if you might say a little bit about what you saw as some of the most exciting discoveries when you first embarked in this line of research?

Speaker 2:          02:21          Sure. So, uh, we've known for awhile that men, uh, there's a close at that start over. Uh, we've known for awhile that in men, uh, there is a close correspondence between their sexual orientation and their pattern of sexual arousal in the laboratory. That is, for example, a homosexual men. Uh, we'll get, uh, erections to stimulate depicting men, uh, but not so much to stimulate depicting women. A heterosexual men show the opposite. Uh, in fact, I think that, uh, for men, uh, sexual orientation is a pattern of sexual arousal. That's how we know what our sexual orientation is. Um, we really haven't known much about women for Awhile, uh, in part because how to measure sexual arousal in women, uh, was less clear. Um, and men you can measure, uh, the degree of erection. You know, that's a pretty obvious way to do it. And women, what do you measure?

Speaker 2:          03:34          Well, Eh, uh, people have constructed an instrument that seems to work pretty well. Uh, it measures, uh, blood flow and the vagina and in both men and women. Uh, genital arousal depends upon the flow of blood and the genitals. Um, so anyway, uh, we were interested in whether in women as well. Uh, sexual orientation corresponds with a pattern of sexual arousal. Uh, and so we did the analogous study. And by the way, in our studies we showed videos of couples having a pretty graphic sex. Uh, and the, uh, most interesting kinds of couples are same sex couples that is either two men or two women. Uh, people who like men should, uh, respond to the stimulate with two women, people who like men, should I respond to the stimulate depicting men. So we did this study with, uh, both heterosexual and homosexual women, and we found, uh, that heterosexual women, uh, really respond, uh, to both equally, uh, very different than either heterosexual or homosexual women. Men, uh, who show a strong bias. They, their preferred sex. It will a heterosexual women show a bisexual arousal pattern in the lab. That's not to say that they are bisexual, it's just to say that their sexual arousal pattern, their genital sexual arousal patterns provide no information regarding their sexual preference or sex with men. Sex with women, lesbians, uh, showed a somewhat biased arousal pattern. They got slightly more sexually aroused, uh, to, uh, female stimulated than to mail stimulate. Uh, but it was not nearly as strong a bias as men show. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          05:43          So what do you think this tells us about, you know, you've spoken a bit about this already, but to the relative influence of, you know, gender on the one hand and sexual orientation on the other end, really kind of predicting our degree of sexual arousal?

Speaker 2:          05:57          Well, I think that the clearest thing that shows us is that men and women do sexual orientation differently. Uh, and, uh, men, I think we understand pretty well. Uh, and I'll just repeat. I think that for men, sexual orientation is precisely a pattern of sexual arousal. It's their emotional response to a attractive men versus attractive women. That's not what sexual orientation has for women. In fact, I think that we barely understand sexual orientation and women, there's a lot of work to do, but it's not about sexual arousal at least as far as we can tell.

Speaker 1:          06:39          So it's really interesting and I mean, you've really, you know, pioneered other research related to sexual orientation that I want to ask you a bit more about as well. I mean, one of the lines in particular is on gender nonconformity and you know, what, that your work seems to really interestingly support some of the common stereotypes that we may have for gay men and lesbian women. And I wonder if you could say a bit more about these findings.

Speaker 2:          07:03          Well, okay. Um, first of all, we've known for quite a long time that, uh, childhood gender nonconformity is associated with adult homosexuality. That is a boys who are, uh, relatively feminine. You have a better chance than boys who are typical, uh, in their gender role behavior, uh, to become gay man. And a, an analogous, uh, uh, relation holds for, uh, women. Um, we know this both on retrospective studies and prospective studies, uh, and there are clearly stereotypes about the way that, uh, for example, gay men, uh, move and speak and what their interests are and so on. And there are also stereotypes about lesbians. Uh, are these stereotypes true? Well, it was a very fashionable in the seventies and eighties and into the 90s, uh, to say, well, of course not. There are no differences between heterosexual and homosexual people except who they want to have sex with. Um, but we have started to study these phenomena in the lab.

Speaker 2:          08:20          Uh, we've actually gotten pretty far and there's no longer any doubt that on average the stereotypes are true. Uh, we, if we videotape a homosexual and heterosexual men, for example, people are much better than chance at, uh, telling who's who, even though the men don't mention their sexuality at all. Uh, now I should emphasize that, uh, people aren't perfect at it. Uh, these phenomena are true on average, which is the only way that stereotypes are ever true. Um, and I'll also say that, um, there's nothing wrong with these stereotypes, in my opinion, that a gay men are somewhat feminine, does not mean to me that they're inferior in any way. Uh, I think many straight men could stand to be a bit more feminine. Uh, stereotypes in the gender realm tend to be a true on average and this is one of the [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          09:24          And so it's interesting to, I mean, you've also looked at how behavioral genetics right can also inform our understanding of sexual orientation. And I wonder, you know, to what extent your work and work of others you've read does suggest that sexual orientation can be influenced to some degree by genetic factors.

Speaker 2:          09:42          The genetics of sexual orientation is something that I've been interested in ever since I entered sex research. It's one of the things I studied in my dissertation and I had done several twin studies of, uh, sexual orientation. My views on what the data say have evolved somewhat. Uh, the early studies seem to show a very strong, uh, influence of genes on sexual orientation. Uh, those studies. However, um, we're not the best studies in terms of, um, the way that, uh, participants were sampled. Uh, since I did most of those studies, I can criticize them as, uh, and uh, as, uh, sampling has gotten better with the use of twin registries. And so on. Uh, the, uh, concordance rates, that is the degree of similarity between twins have the same pair, have shrunken, uh, and, uh, estimates of genetic causation have shrunk and somewhat to, uh, I would say that it still looks like genes play a role, but, uh, less of a role then for, um, most other traits that have been studied. Uh, that makes sense to me. Uh, given the evolutionary paradox of how genes for homosexuality, uh, might persist, you know, a homosexual people, uh, uh, seem not to be as interested in mating with the opposite sex and reproducing a as heterosexual people. And so we would expect genes for homosexuality to, uh, uh, be disadvantaged evolutionarily. And, uh, I think that the, uh, genetic data, the best genetic data are consistent with that.

Speaker 1:          11:39          So, I mean finally, this has been really interesting talking with you about your work on, you know, sexual arousal, sexual orientation, and even the role potentially have, you know, behavioral genetics and helping us understand to what extent genes play a role in these kinds of sexual, you know, preferences and behaviors. And so I think one thing that's really important in all of this is that, you know, your work has used these really precise methodological tools to study. You know, as you said at the outset, this is one of the most fundamental domains of what makes us human. And it's such a central part of, you know, motivational systems at the same time, it's been largely taboo for, for various reasons. And so I think part of what's great to talk with you is also to hear about your expertise and sort of what you see as the most innovative tools or stimulating or ways that researchers can try to study, you know, sex and sexual arousal better. Given that it is a domain that seems not to be as largely tapped into as others. So I just wonder if you might say a little bit more about this, where people who are less familiar with this kind of work?

Speaker 2:          12:41          Well, I do think that studying sexual arousal is very important for people who want to study, uh, sexual orientation, uh, in part, uh, you know, otherwise we're reliant on people's self reports and, uh, that can be misleading, uh, particularly, uh, when some sexual orientations or stigmatized as homosexuality has been, although it is decreasingly stigmatized, obviously. Uh, so, uh, and also people don't always have perfect insight into what their sexual feelings are. Uh, so I do think it is important to try to use objective measures and, uh, genital sexual arousal is an objective measure. Uh, it does have some problems in that. Um, people don't always, men especially don't always respond enough to give a good signal. A one innovation that we've been trying is to, uh, move the action upstairs to studying the brain, uh, using brain imaging. Uh, Fmr. I, uh, we've done a fairly large study by FMRP standards on men and we're completing one on women. And, uh, my preliminary results I would say are that, uh, well I'm a little disappointed. Uh, I would have thought that Fmr, I would have had an advantage, uh, over genital measures because, um, you know, sexual feelings start in the brain and, uh, you know, one can have the feeling of sexual arousal without an obvious genital response. Uh, nevertheless, I think that, um, our results suggest that a brain imaging as it stands today in 2012 is not as sensitive and measured as the genital measures.

Speaker 1:          14:49          So what do you see then as some of the challenges in conducting this kind of work?

Speaker 2:          14:54          Well, I think, uh, the biggest challenge remains, uh, people's squeamishness, uh, regarding matters of sex. And that, um, starts with, for example, a potential participants. It also affects Irb, institutional review boards and their scrutiny that they give, uh, research. And, uh, perhaps most importantly, funding agencies. Uh, and, uh, people who hire for jobs at universities, uh, are all hesitant to, uh, favor of sex research or they, they're all prejudiced against sex research actually. So I think that we need to work on having people accept that sexuality is an important, uh, part of human life and as deserving of attention as any other emotion.

Speaker 1:          16:00          So then as you think about the future of, you know, research and emotion and how it can try to include measures of sexual arousal and sexuality more broadly, where might you see the future of the field headed in a way that can begin to really, you know, except you know, and expand this line of work on, like you're saying, an important part of what makes us human important part of everyday life?

Speaker 2:          16:25          Well, I think that, um,

Speaker 2:          16:31          I think that one direction will depend upon, uh, breakthroughs in the field, which is simply, uh, you know, the instruments to measure sexual arousal. We have to keep trying to develop better instruments, things that are less, uh, intrusive, uh, you know, for example, a genital measures, you know, have to go on the genitals and the lab and, and people are, uh, uh, hesitant to do that. So we need to develop a better instruments or at least less invasive instruments. Uh, and we just need to keep educating people about our findings. Uh, and hopefully there'll be interested enough in the findings, uh, to want more.

Speaker 1:          17:20          So finally, I want to ask, you know, related to the future of the field, a big part of this are the next generation of students that are going to be pushing this kind of research forward. So when students come to you and they're interested in sort of embarking in a study of sexual arousal or sexual orientation, what kind of advice do you usually give them or would you give them?

Speaker 2:          17:40          Well, I, I, I would say it's a fine thing to be interested in. It's important I'd be aware of the barriers in this, uh, field research, uh, the attitudes that people have. Uh, the, the fact that, uh, finding this hard to get that jobs are relatively few, uh, and trying to change that. If you can't. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          18:06          Well, thank you very much. Um, it was a pleasure speaking with you today.

Speaker 2:          18:10          Thank you.

Speaker 1:          18:11          And with that, this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Dr. Michael Bailey from Northwestern university.
