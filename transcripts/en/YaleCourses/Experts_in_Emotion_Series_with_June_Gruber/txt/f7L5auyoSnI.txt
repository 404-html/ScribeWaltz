Speaker 1:          00:00          Welcome. I'm excited to be talking to you today again about something very near and dear to most of us happiness. Um, we know that happiness is something that's been ingrained in our society as humans for many, many, many years. If we look back at ancient philosophical writings by Aristotle, he said, happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence. Likewise, the Dalai Lama has indicated that in many ways, the very motion of our life is towards happiness. So indeed as humans, we seem to have this insatiable desire or yearning to be happy and to understand happiness better. Today though, I want to talk about perhaps unusual and understudied aspect of happiness. So this is our third segment and our module on happiness and wellbeing. And it's the day we'll be looking at what I refer to as the dark side of happiness.

Speaker 1:          00:54          So in other words, can feeling good, sometimes be bad for us. So we'll start with this unusual question of the dark side of happiness followed by our takeaway questions and expert interview. So when we think about happiness, it seems to be something that we all want to understand. And indeed we see an increase scientific focus on happiness with magazines coming out about the science of happiness as well as a flooding of pop culture. Attention on happiness. We see books like the happiness project, stumbling on happiness, authentic happiness, the how of happiness, the art of happiness. And a recent favorite of mine. Um, get happy today. I'm with a dolphin soaring out of the water suggesting that maybe our interest in happiness is being taken to an all new, potentially dangerous level. Um, we also see an obsession with, perhaps you might argue happiness in our pharmaceutical industry.

Speaker 1:          01:55          So we see sales for a host of antidepressants skyrocketing in recent years, including prescriptions for Prozac, Paxil and Cymbalta. And there's no surprise in many ways that we would want to be trying to attain happiness. So we see a growing work of psychologist, you know, really pointing to many of the key benefits of feeling happy. This includes building, you know, vital social bonds, enhancing our creative thinking and even building physical immunity. Distressors. So, even though we know all these robust benefits of feeling positive, should this upward pointing trend towards greater and greater degrees of happiness always be our desired goal? Or should we pause, maybe take a step back and perhaps ask ourselves just for a moment whether or not happiness is always a good thing. So I think we should, and that's what I'm going to try to convince you of today. Because in life we always know that there's two sides to every story.

Speaker 1:          02:56          And why should happiness be any exception to that? So in many ways when we think about this, people often refer to this as trying to look at the other side of happiness or you know, you might consider as the dark side of happiness, right? So I don't know how many of you are star wars fans out there, but for those of you who are, perhaps what we're doing is really looking at the Darth Vader side of happiness here. So when we think about the dark side of happiness, one way to begin our journey and to really grasping the central themes of it is again going back to Aristotle, who seemed to have the most amazing pressing observations about emotions of anyone. So he said, getting angry or sad is easy and anyone can do it, but doing it in the right amount at the right time and in the right way is not easy, nor can everyone do it.

Speaker 1:          03:46          So this quote, although it talks about anger and sadness, highlights three key themes I want to walk through with you today, apply to happiness. So some codes looking at the amount of happiness, the timing for happiness, and the way in which we tried to become happy. So this will constitute the three core themes as we journey into the dark side of happiness. So this includes the amount of happiness, the timing for when we're happy, and the way in which we become happy. So let's begin with our first core team here. Looking at the amount of happiness and asking the question together of whether there can ever be too much of a good thing like happiness. So recent work has suggested that the relation ship between our happiness on the bottom and our psychological health as you can see here over on the left is not straightforward or linear and instead it actually seems to mimic more of what you can think of as an upside down or inverted u shape.

Speaker 1:          04:44          So I'll walk you through what this looks like. So you can see in many ways that as happiness increases as we saw earlier in that upward pointing Arrow to some extent is our happiness increases. We see at at, um, sort of advantages for our psychological health socially, cognitively, and even physically. However, this truism about happiness seems to only hold up to what I think of as a certain tipping point. And after that point it seems that the benefits of happiness actually begin to unravel. Um, and our psychological health actually goes down and this continues downwards until we reach what we think of as the potential dark side of positive emotion or where we begin to see happiness associated with a variety of negative outcomes when it's experienced that too extreme of a degree or where perhaps there's too much of a good thing. So I'll give you some examples here.

Speaker 1:          05:35          So what we see is that as happiness increases to greater and greater levels, um, it actually shows decreases and creativity. So we no longer see positive mood facilitating this sort of creative exploratory thought. When it's experienced at a heightened level, it actually impedes our ability to think creatively. It also is associated with increased rates of a, of maladaptive behaviors. We see heightened levels of positivity associated with increased risk taking behavior, alcohol and drug use, as well as increased risk for mental illness. And in particular we've studied in my lab a particular form of psychopathology referred to as a mania, which is a core component of bipolar disorder. I'll show you a quote now that illustrates in what way too much positivity can be associated with mental illness. Such as bipolar disorder. So I think this quote here illustrates that theme really nicely. It says, the case for the dangers of positive emotions is made most straightforwardly by individuals with mania.

Speaker 1:          06:35          There joy is infectious, their optimism and self confidence unbounded. One manic may give away his life savings on a whim while another joyfully drives a hundred miles an hour to a sexual liaison with the potentially dangerous stranger. So here we can see that a heightened amount of positive mood and mania contently to risky and even dangerous outcomes. So when we look at this graph here, again, what it suggests is that this upside down, you suggest that happiness is by and large good up until we hit a critical tipping point. And beyond that certain point, it indeed maybe too much of a good thing. So now let's look at the timing here. We're going to ask the question of can there ever be a wrong time for happiness? Are there certain contexts or places where it may not be to our advantage to be feeling happy? So here what I'm going to suggest is that happiness is not adaptive in every context.

Speaker 1:          07:31          And instead it seems to be specifically tuned for situations that involve building resources, savoring, achievements, and cementing social bonds. But that's not every context of our everyday life. And so indeed there may be wrong times for feeling happiness. I'll provide you with a couple of examples. One example is situations that are competitive. So here, recent work by Maya Tamir has found that people induced to experience a happy mood, actually perform worse on tasks that require competition or confrontation. In her study, she looked at a competitive video game, um, that people perform worse on this competitive video game compared to individuals who are actually induced into an angry mood state. So when we need to confront someone or compete, we actually seem to do worse when we're in a happy mood, especially when we compare it with an angry mood state. Another important context is one involving loss.

Speaker 1:          08:24          So we can probably all readily imagine how that, how feeling happy during the situation of loss would impede our ability to appreciate the absent object or person or if imagine a loved one came to a screening and we respond to them with like a smiling expression on our face, how that would not only hinder our connection with them, but it would impede our ability to actually empathize with them and comfort them in their time of mourning. So work in my lab has really looked at this particular context and found that individuals who are experiencing heightened positive mood while they're watching films of a young boy crying over the deck of his father, that is those individuals are at greater risk for developing mood disorders later on in their life. We've also found that individuals, when they're watching other people share moments of personal suffering and loss, either with a romantic partner in the room or watching a video of a real live human telling a story about the time that their mother passed away, that those individuals who are at a greater risk for developing mood disorders like mania indeed seem to show greater positive emotion experience and even perceived other people to be feeling more positive in these contexts.

Speaker 1:          09:32          So it suggests that feeling positive in competitive situations causes you to perform worse in those situations. Whereas feeling positive in situations of, you know, very clear loss or suffering or tragedy put you at risk for developing mood disorders later on in life such as mania. So let's turn to our final team here. Looking at the way, by the way, what we're really talking about here, it's concluding with the question of whether or not there can never be wrong ways to find or pursue happiness. And here, um, again, we'll return to this idea we've talked about in our earlier lectures of this ingrained in all of us. You know, especially in the u s and then our own declaration of independence even is this notion of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And even though this is a core kind of central cultural value of ours, should we stop for a moment in question whether or not we ought to always strive to be happy?

Speaker 1:          10:27          And indeed research suggests that yes, we really should consider that the way we pursue happiness may actually set us up to be less happy. So original work here was done by iris mouse at UC Berkeley where she found that those individuals who endorsed high degrees of valuing the pursuit of happiness, so saying that was very important for them to be feeling happy and they put great efforts and expended great effort to try to attain happiness, that it's these individuals who actually set themselves up with higher standards for being happy. And as a result she argues are likely to experience disappointment when such standards are not met. And this is most apparent in positive situations such as watching a happy film where you might desire or expect to be feeling happy. So this paradoxical pursuit of happiness, she would say is that those people who value happiness the most and expanding the most effort to pursue and attain it actually may set themselves up for less happy lives.

Speaker 1:          11:28          And in work with Iris Nelson colleagues, our lab has found that those individuals who actually endorse valuing happiness the most are also those individuals who report greater, um, reports of symptoms of depression. So they're actually the most depressed. Um, we also have looked at work in individuals with bipolar disorder as well, who also endorse heightened levels of valuing happiness. So both for the general population that seems not to be an ideal strategy and seems to also characterize individuals diagnosed with or at risk for mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder. So again, it seems that we always turn back to ancient scholars, uh, when we, when we find these conclusions, um, who has suggested early on John Stuart mill that those only are happy who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness. So where should we go then in our ultimate quest for happiness?

Speaker 1:          12:22          So we see this idea of accepting your happiness as it is, wherever that is. And I want to leave you with three take home points. First, I hope that you take home the idea that happiness is a critical ingredient of what makes us human and gives meaning to our lives. There's nothing inherently bad and happiness per se, but which is the second point. We need to treat happiness with care and be mindful to experience it in moderation. So not too much at the right time, which is not all the time and in the right way. So letting it come naturally rather than, you know, obsessing over finding happiness and maximizing it. And finally, the third point is that it's critical to find the right tools for attaining happiness. And this is what I allude to in this quote here. So one of them being sort of radical acceptance of your current state.

Speaker 1:          13:12          So this sort of traces back to ancient Buddhist traditions that really suggests that rather than trying to strive for happiness, to simply accept your happiness as it is, wherever that is. And this perhaps is the true secret to happiness. And a way to sort of, you know, get away or bypass some of the dark sides of happiness that we've talked about in our lecture today. If you'd like to see more of me talking on this topic, you can go here. This is something that myself and my lab spend a lot of time thinking about. So now I'll conclude with our takeaway questions and expert interview. So our takeaway questions today go as follows. First, can there ever be too much of a good thing when it comes to happiness and related feelings of positive emotion? Second, what is the wrong timing for happiness? What contexts or times is it not in our advantage to be feeling happy or good?

Speaker 1:          14:04          And finally, what is the paradoxical pursuit of happiness discussed today? And to what extent does this suggest that we should be striving to be happy? So now we'll turn to our expert interview as part of our experts and emotion interview series today for our experts and emotion interview. We have the pleasure of speaking with Dr Maya to Mirror on the dark side of positive emotion. Dr Tamir is an assistant professor and the director of the emotion and self regulation laboratory at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She completed her undergraduate degree at Tel Aviv University, received her phd from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champagne, and completed her post doctoral training at Stanford University. Dr Tamir is most interested in understanding what motivates people to regulate their emotions and in her quest, she studies the implications of both pleasant and unpleasant emotional experiences and people's beliefs, thoughts, and feelings about emotions. So I'll now turn to a very special emotion and expert interview with my colleague, Dr Maya Tamir on the dark side of positive emotion.
