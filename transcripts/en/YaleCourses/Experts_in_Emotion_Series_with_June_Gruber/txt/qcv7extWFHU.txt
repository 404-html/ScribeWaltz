Speaker 1:          00:00          In this expert interview, we'll be speaking with doctor Brian Commute son who's an associate professor of psychology at Stanford University and the director of the symbiotic project on affect of neuroscience. And he is one of the leading figures in this area. We'll speak with us about the field of neuroeconomics and emotion. So doctor Knutson, um, received his bachelor degree in psychology and comparative religion from Trinity University and his Phd from Stanford University after which he did postdoctoral research and affect of neuroscience at the medical school and the National Institute of Health. His laboratory uses multiple methods including psychometrics, psychophysiology brain imaging and pharmacology to investigate neuro mechanisms that underlie emotional experience. And he also explores implications of this work for clinical disorders have an effect and addiction as well as for economic decision making. Their discovery that neural activity correlates with expected value and can be used to predict choice, including financial risk taking and product purchases has helped seed new and exciting interdisciplinary fields including neuro economics, neuro finance and neuromarketing.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Dr [inaudible] has received young investigator awards from the American Psychiatric Association, the National Alliance for research on schizophrenia and depression. And the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research. He's also a fellow of the American Psychological Society and Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research. His research is funded by grants from several organizations, including the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation. He's been invited to speak about his research and psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, economics, finance and marketing departments around the world. And his laboratories. Research is regularly featured in top journals and popular media outlets. So I now turn to our very special experts and emotion interview with Doctor Brian Knutson. So welcome, Brian. Thanks for speaking with us today. Thanks for having me. So I know we're all curious to know a bit about what got you first interested in emotion. Um, I know that you came to this in a path that isn't typical of everyone, and I'd love to hear your story,

Speaker 2:          02:10          right? So this sort of dates me, but when I was a psychology graduate student, uh, people talked about emotion and the brain somewhat, but they never talked about the two together. So, um, I studied emotion at that time, facial expression of emotion. And I went to work with a guy named Paul Ekman who studies facial expression of emotion and I was a postdoc in his lab and he noticed that I was spending a lot of time taking classes in the medical school and he said to me, uh, you can continue doing this. You're doing your work, it's fine, but you really want to do this, go this route. Then you need to work with somebody who thinks about the brain and thinks about emotion. Uh, and there are only three people in the world who do that right now. Uh, one was Richie Davidson and that was Joe to do in other was Jaak Panksepp.

Speaker 2:          02:54          So I decided to take the risk and go work with Jaak in. And he was very interesting at that time because he was claiming that animals had emotion and you can model it and in rats, all these very radical things at the time. So I did, I went and worked with Yak and I really got my hands dirty working with the brain and neuro pharmacology. And based on that, that sort of sent me off on this weird trajectory of affect of neuroscience. I ended up at at uh, uh, the National Institute of Health for another post doc. And there I got exposure to brain imaging. Uh, my boss basically said, I have this time, do you want to do something with it? And uh, that then got me into brain imaging. So I've always been interested in emotion, but the neuroscience part came later. We're married.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Cool. So I'd love to ask you a bit more about your current research now. Um, so I mean we can all relate to some extent to the way that emotion shift, the way we spend money or how our economic situations influence how we feel in the moment. And your work is really cool here because it looks at this sort of neuro economics of emotion. So this bridge is fields of psychology, neuroscience and economics. And it's this very timely and exciting field to so many people. And at the same time it's this rapidly developing and, and new field as well. And so I just wondered if you could share with us some of the kind of scientific puzzles that are gripping people in studying these kinds of questions.

Speaker 2:          04:18          Absolutely. I mean, it's a very exciting time. Yeah. Uh, this technology for looking into the brain, not only at the cortical level, but deep in the subcortical level, uh, at a second to second temporal resolution has really only been with us for the past decade or so. So, uh, as we're discovering new things, we're also innovating new methods. And that doesn't just apply to the fancy magnets or the head coils, but also to how you designed the study, how you analyze your data. Timing is really important. And in fact, one thing that we've been focusing on is can you not only see arousal in the brain, but can you see valence, which seems very basic from an emotional perspective, but really it's, it's a question that's at the root of all studies of athletic and emotion. And the reason we're so focused on payments, meaning good versus bad, is because we think that not only will it allow us to see how people were reacting to things, but also what they're about to do.

Speaker 2:          05:07          And so we've specifically focused on two emotional states, which is rather limited, really to be honest. Um, two emotional states that we think are evoked when people anticipate, uh, uncertain, good events are uncertain, bad events. Uh, we call them positive arousal and negative arousal, and they fit right into this aspect of framework. I'm thinking about, uh, people's experience. So positive arousal involves emotions like excitement, energy, even pride. Uh, negative arousal involves emotions like anxiety, irritability, um, and so, uh, these kinds of emotions are especially important to us because we think that they occur not only in response to something that just happens and outcome, but also in anticipation of things that have not yet happened. So they're truly psychological and we also think that they drive behavior. So they will push you towards approach or avoidance respectively. So they will in essence, allow us to predict whether somebody will approach or avoid a situation. Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:05          How fascinating. So what do you think that are some of the major challenges researchers are going to face in this field of neuroeconomics of emotion?

Speaker 2:          06:13          So one of the challenges, a lot of them are sort of the same challenges that most emotion researchers face when there's an additional layer. So the same challenges that emotional researchers face is that they want to measure something that often is assessed with self report, uh, and correlate it with either, you know, behavior or skin conductance, you know, physiology or something like that. And those correlations can be pretty loose. Uh, so, you know, people aren't always aware of, I think what they're feeling, but sometimes they can act in an emotional way and not be aware of it or come up with an explanation that really isn't relevant to the w why they behave that way. In fact, we can set up situations like that in the lab. So one of the problems is that things don't always hang together very well. Another problem, uh, which is unique to our situation is the problem of timing.

Speaker 2:          07:00          Uh, everything that we do, uh, we have to make predictions not only about what will happen where, but also when, especially when it comes to anticipating things. And so we have to think very carefully about the timing of events that happens in our, in our, in our both in our experiments and our analysis. And we have to be precise about that. And that's something that in psychology, you know, some people have thought about, but really we've lacked the technology to sort of really link up physiological measures online with emotional tendencies and emotional self reports. And what I mean by that is that you would want to have sort of a self report of good versus bad, sort of on an ongoing scale. But the very act of doing that kind of a rating may interfere with the emotion. And so there are a lot of technical issues that we need to resolve to get things on the same time scale so we can really test our hypotheses about how affect matches up with brain activity.

Speaker 1:          07:53          Well, it's interesting you're talking about timing and kind of the Tempur or focus of the studies that we do because one of the many amazing things you've done, your research, but one of them has really been to parse apart the anticipation from the consumption of rewards. And so I know this is something that is relevant to just a host of different fields, not only in you know, aspect of science, but in clinical science, you know, thinking about economic decision making. And I wonder if you could just tell us a little bit about what this distinction is between wanting something and liking something.

Speaker 2:          08:24          Right. So, um, I joke with people that a lot of my, you're imaging experiments that are really built around rat experiments and it's really true like going in and studying rats and they're basic motivational states really informs even our, uh, studies of how people decide whether to invest or not or whether they want to buy an item or not. Obviously ratchet aren't doing this, but they're deciding, I want to get that food. I want to look away that Predator. Uh, and we think that those motivational surrogates are not only conserve but are used by all of us in our day to day decisions. Um, so, uh, I want to make sure I get your, uh, the answer your question, right. Locations of this, what is the difference between wanting and liking? So once thanks in rats, it's very interesting. He's by Kent Berridge at the University of Michigan is he's been able to neurochemically and to some extent in euro anatomically dissociate, um, wanting, what do you call is wanting from liking a, and then he does these clever experiments where he has rats eating food and he puts them on a plexiglass plates. You can observe their mouth movements. He can distinguish, uh, you know, um, at the tasty movement of licking your lips to us, sucrose solution from the, the disgust expression of gaping and spitting out things which also human infants and even show

Speaker 1:          09:38          and typical expressions of Brian's here.

Speaker 2:          09:41          Yeah. So I often make these expressions, unfortunately, you know, my students complain about it, but you do. Uh, yes. But so, uh, he can distinguish these as hedonic measured. So when he calls liking from actually how much food you eat. And what he finds is that if you give them raw dopaminergic drug that stimulates dopamine, they'll eat more. They don't show more tasty expressions, you giving them an opiate charging drug like heroin. Um, they will actually not eat, but they will show more lip smacking. So we can distinguish the so called wanting from liking. And one idea that we've uh, uh, we've used his ideas and we've sort of extended them into the human realm is that the one thing is about appetitive motivation is about going out and getting good stuff. It has an evolutionary value, uh, and the liking is different. It's about saying, okay, this was good and now we should go for more of it.

Speaker 2:          10:30          And so obviously those things should be correlated, but it should happen at different points in a cycle of consuming something. First you have a positive motivation. If it gets you to go out and get good stuff, then you have the liking and that she can better feed feedback and informed the Watson. But the, the, the new developments in brain imaging have allowed us to actually just explicitly in time separate out when you want something from when you like it. And we haven't actually looked at at tastes so much even looked at money cause we wanted to focus on the wanting component and money is really great. It gives you lots of control. Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:03          Yes. I wondered if you actually wanted to say something about this. I mean you developed the tasks that thousands of researchers have used the monetary incentive delay task. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          11:13          Yeah. So we didn't stay, we developed this task because we were frustrated with other aspect of stimuli. We've found them to be too variable that people had variable reactions even in the sugar water. Uh, it's pictures and so forth. And so we thought, well money should engage people. And, and in fact it does and it shouldn't elicit affective responses. And in fact it does. That's a big advantage. And we've seen this, you know, not only an undergrads but also in community samples and people all around the world when they are anticipating a monetary gain. We see a prominent positive arousal. We see neural responses when they're anticipating losing money. We see positive and negative or, uh, a prominent negative arousal, not positive. And we also see other neural responses to that. And so it just so happened adventitious leave that money turned out to be great brain imaging tool to elicit activity and these motivational circuits.

Speaker 2:          12:01          Um, and so, uh, we did that work funded by the NIH and they di, they funded us because they wanted us to be able to visualize these circuits that have also been implicated, not just in one thing and so forth. Uh, but also in, uh, uh, psychiatric disorders. And so, um, there's sort of two levels of what we do. One level is what I call the phasic level. It's sort of like the decisions we make on an everyday basis. Yeah. There's what I'd call the tonic level, which is sort of individual differences and the responsiveness of these circuits. And that's, that's the level at which people are interested in these tasks. Not just to understand economic decision making, but to try to disentangle the different symptom profiles that people, psychiatric disorders, Sab, and maybe visualize what the overall responsiveness of these circuits and try to understand whether that can help us to predict how they'll do with a therapy or a drug regimen or whether they'll improve

Speaker 1:          12:51          such important clinical health implications of the work you do and of the tasks you developed. I know many people use it in myself, in my lab trying to parse apart the nature of, you know, reward and people suffering from mood disorders thanks to your task. Well, I hope it will be useful.

Speaker 2:          13:09          It's a little scary. I mean, you know, uh, I didn't think it would be so widely used when we developed it. Uh, and you never know with neuroimaging, what's going to be a good probe. That's part of the reason we have to do all this localization work is that, you know, you never know actually how the brain is responding to things. Uh, you know, and this is an issue, you know, just going back to emotion research, we don't know actually how the brain is emotionally responding to things. We don't know if it's doing so in a dimensional way, in a categorical way if it's not doing so at all. Some people are arguing that you can't even see value in the brain, you know, and, and this seems unlikely to need, but it could be true. So on the one hand, there's all this promise, you know, maybe we can tease apart psychiatric symptom profiles, we can predict choice. On the other hand, there's still a lot of open questions about how actually is the brain responding to things emotional and, uh, and how can we visualize that using the tools that we have.

Speaker 1:          14:05          So lots of unanswered mysteries, which keeps academics and researchers in the field busy. Right? Keep us busy. So you talked a little bit about how this work has implications for psychopathology and mental health. Do you think it has important implications also for economic decision making?

Speaker 2:          14:22          I do. Um, you know, I just got back from Nyu where I was talking about neuro marketing. Hmm. So there've been all these kinds of fields. Neuros dash field's emerging from this and a lot of promises, you know, uh, by, not necessarily by scientists but by people run businesses or the press. And you know, there's a lot of hype to be honest. But I do think there is promise. Uh, and the reason I think there is promise is that we can actually at this point take these signals out of the brain, these anticipatory that we associate with positive arousal, negative arousal, and use them to predict better than chance whether people will decide to buy something, whether they will decide to take a financial risk, whether they'll decide to take a gamble for instance. Uh, and we don't have to know this is without knowing anything about who you are, uh, what you saw or your explicit stated preferences for those items.

Speaker 2:          15:12          Um, so this is pretty exciting. This is almost like mind reading, if you will. And we know that these solutions generalize across people. So it's not just that, you know, I have a really good map of June's brain, but it's not going to work in my brain. Um, so for us this is very exciting because it gets that not just description and explanation that also prediction and perhaps control which are the goals of science. Um, and, uh, right now I'd say we're, we're at about 75% in predicting what people will buy a and if we ask people what they like and how much they'll pay a, I'd say we get a similar predictions. So, uh, but there are other instances where people have predicted choice even in, in the, in the case that somebody has not said that they explicitly likes something. So I'm thinking of a study by Greg Burns on adolescents listening to music and then trying to predict how well those songs sold three years later.

Speaker 2:          16:05          Uh, and using nuclease to Cummins activity to actually predict songs. Sales when adolescents, explicit writing ratings of liking did not predict this on sales. Those kinds of experiments are like science fiction and they need to be replicated obviously. But it's pretty interesting from, uh, from the standpoint of applying science. Well, and you've also to try to understand how we anticipate aspect and how that relates to financial risk taking too. That's right. Yeah. I mean, we think that I'm using these methods, uh, we can just get another window on anticipatory effect and the people and use that to understand not only just minute to minute or second to second decisions, but also life financial outcomes. And you know, a lot of people have looked at, uh, health outcomes and emotional traits, you know, and I think that's very important, actually understudied. Um, but not many have looked at life financial outcomes.

Speaker 2:          17:00          It's like, you know, how many assets do you have? How am I, how many dads do you have? Um, what is your risk preference profile? Uh, but in fact, you know, uh, it could be that these things are completely circumstantial. So that is that, you know, the things that happened to you in life. And we all know that those can have a serious impact on your finances matter quite a bit. But it also could be that they're enduring dispositional effective styles that influence your financial decisions over and over and over and that that can have a cumulative effect on your life. Financial outcomes. And we just started in deed defined that some of our markers, you both behavioral and neural of an effect of style are Arlene to life financial app. And so we can find for instance that a performance on a simple game learning task is linked to assets, uh, or performance on a simple loss learning tasks, which looks the same to a behaviorist is, is linked to an absence of debts. This is one of the far out findings that we have recently that you know, we're replicating but um, we can look at these efficacy profiles sort of bed many levels. And that's exciting to me too. So we can not just be comfortable with asking people on a questionnaire the psychometrics, but also trying to link that to brain structure and brain function. Uh, and to distinguish it from other types of, um, individual differences is like the working memory or reversal learning or things like that.

Speaker 1:          18:24          It seems like a really important theme in your work has really been just linking data across multiple levels of analysis to really get at the questions that are most important.

Speaker 2:          18:32          That's actually how I characterize our work to students. As I say, you know what we were added value is or what we seem to be good at is saying, here's a really big effect up here. Here's another big effect down here. How are those connected? Are they connected at all? And it sounds really easy, but it's actually quite difficult because you have all these other effects at this level and at that level and they're sparse connections. So only a few of those things are actually robustly connected. But I find it, it's really rewarding. It allows me to talk to and work with colleagues in other areas and that's how I want him to fastest.

Speaker 1:          19:05          So when you think then about where the sort of future of the field is headed, do you think a big part is linking these disparate areas or where do you see the future of emotion headed and Europe?

Speaker 2:          19:14          Wow, I'm biased by you know, the direction we're going. So I will be really interested to listen to your other interviews. You know, what other people say, be educated. But of course, you know, for, for us what I want is this linking of the levels. So I want to see how his brain function connected to effect of self reporting and how is that connected to choice and how is that connected to life outcomes. I want that vertical linkage. Um, and, and you know, I want it to be empirical. I want it to have numbers. Um, I wanted to have sort of transfer functions that we can use to like say, okay, if this event happened, if dopamine fired, um, if they're likely to take this financial risk. And if they do that enough, they're likely to put more money in their bank or not, you know, and that will have the following social impact. So it would be really cool to have a theory with that kind of power, that kind of cross level power. Um, so that's one, one thing on my wishlist is to have something like that. That's a fantastic wishlist. Items. Hopefully we'll see what the funding agencies thing.

Speaker 1:          20:18          So then the last question I had for you is just what kind of advice would you give students who are thinking about embarking in this kind of wild field, almost science fiction? Like as you said of emotion.

Speaker 2:          20:29          Um, what, what would you tell them? It's tricky and I should have thought about this more before we talked, but you, because what I usually tell my students is don't do what I did, uh, which is, you know, I spent, I literally spent, you know, nine, eight or nine years without any interviews. So I graduated with a phd, I went into a Postdoc, I was on the market, you know, for eight years. Uh, nobody was interested in what I was doing a, or they probably just thought it was pulling two preliminary and then suddenly a eight interviews and four offers. So, uh, that was about the time I was publishing my brain imaging stuff. So for a while it looked like, you know, this guy is doing crazy stuff and then suddenly everybody's like, oh, this is feasible. We can do this. This is interesting.

Speaker 2:          21:16          And so it's very hard to predict the Zeitgeist guys. It's sort of like investing. It's hard to predict the market and I don't know what the optimal strategy is. I think, I almost think for a person like me, if you're like me, which probably many people are not, um, I had to have the intrinsic motivation to pull me through. Uh, and, and the conviction that what I was doing was really the right way to answer the question, which is how do emotions were. I felt like I had to go to the neural level. Um, I'm not sure if that's a good strategy. Now I guess what I would say, the two things I would say are get a good strong effect. The behavioral effect, not a, not a neural effect that you can really tweak in different ways and explain and explore different levels. Um, that's one thing that I think is useful.

Speaker 2:          21:59          Another thing is, uh, get a good method and, and explore a new method that you can be an expert in a, because I think then you're not only an expert on some sort of field or the fact that you've investigated, but to be an expert in a Methodist, quite valuable, especially in neuro imaging, the way that things are advancing every year that are the new things. And there are new things to explore. It's not as easy as it sounds because you want to be an expert in a method that you think will have some longevity. But there are so many needs out there for better methods. Um, and so I think there's a lot of opportunity for students to become experts in that way.

Speaker 1:          22:33          Thank you so much for speaking of the three, Ryan. It was great. Great hearing your thoughts. This concludes our expert and emotion interview series. That's doctor Brian Knutson, front of Stanford University.
