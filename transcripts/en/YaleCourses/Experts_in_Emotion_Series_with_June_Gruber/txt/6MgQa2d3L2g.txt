Speaker 1:          00:00          Today for experts in emotion interview. We have the honor of speaking with doctor [inaudible] Mehta. So Dr Mehta is currently an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Oregon. He received his Ba from Williams college and his phd in social personality psychology from the University of Texas at Austin before starting at the University of Oregon as faculty. He completed postdoctoral fellowships at the Columbia University as well as Erasmus University and the Donders institute in the Netherlands. His research examines the psychological and biological processes that help regulate status here arkies and decision making. So I now turn to a very special experts in emotion interview together with Dr [inaudible] Mehta on emotion and hormones and upcoming and very exciting field. So welcome prawns. Thanks for speaking today. Thanks for having me. It's always a pleasure. Um, what I wanted to start out asking a little bit about is what first got you interested in emotions?

Speaker 2:          00:59          Well, I think just by nature of being a person, you know, we all have emotional experiences and so we're all, I think in intrinsically interested in emotion, but specific to my work when I'm finding compelling about emotion is I'm trying to understand the process. So, um, how our biology feeds into the things we do, how we think, um, and then how, um, our behaviors and our, um, in our environments can influence our biology. And I think that's why, um, recently I've been really interested in emotion as kind of the psychological process by which our biology piece into our behavior. So,

Speaker 1:          01:36          yeah. Cool. Very cool. I actually want to ask you then a few questions about your research in this domain. So I mean, first of all, I mean you are so well known already for your pioneering work that's helped found this brand new field, you know, referred to as social neuroendocrinology and as a field, I wondered if you might share with us what you see as some of the most, you know, fundamental discoveries thus far about hormones and social behavior, etc.

Speaker 2:          02:02          Absolutely. So I think one of the important things to recognize is that research item, uh, hormones and behavior in humans, it's relatively new. So a lot of this work on pioneering work was done in animals. And so just the fact, uh, over the past, uh, decade in particular, there's been a resurgence and research on an interest in studying, uh, hormones in social behavior in humans. So just by nature of doing the work, um, I think that's pioneering ended up itself. Um, but we've also learned a few things. Um, so a few things that we do know now is that, um, there's a, this, this hormone cortisol, which is released by the HPA axis that plays a really important role in stress responses in humans as well as animals. So we do know that, um, that's pretty clear. We also know that, uh, the steroid hormone testosterone, which is, uh, which exists in both men and women, um, plays an important role in behaviors linked to status, such as dominance.

Speaker 2:          03:04          And we're also learning a lot about oxytocin's role, um, in social behaviors specifically. Uh, it seems to be involved in a lot of pro social behaviors. Um, so I think those are the basic discoveries that we've made and, but what's really exciting is kind of the nuance that we're adding as a field. That these kind of simplistic views of testosterone, dominance, cortisol, stress, oxytocin bonding are being uprooted in some ways and suggesting that there are other kind of processes depending on the context. Um, and depending on the kind of person you are that are dictating how these hormones work. Um, so the fact what we do and our emotions as well. So really exciting. I wonder too, you know, how do you

Speaker 1:          03:48          thank this field might be moving forward in terms of next steps to really try to leverage, you know, this methodology to better understand emotional behavior.

Speaker 2:          03:57          Yeah. So I think there's a number of cool things that are going on in the field right now. The first one is, um, this idea of I'm mechanism or process and I think that's where emotion really is an important domain to start, is to start looking at process. So, um, one domain we've looked at is the brain. Of course, we know that hormones like testosterone and cortisol cross the blood brain barrier and bind to receptors and influence, um, uh, activity in the brain. Uh, but we also know that there's, uh, an experience, a psychological process that is going on, um, that might trap with what's going on in the brain of course, but that needs to be studied independently. And I think that's really an exciting new direction, uh, that we're, we're taking as a field is some when your testosterone levels rise, you know, how are you feeling?

Speaker 2:          04:48          Um, and similarly when your testosterone levels drop or your cortisol called cortisol levels rise as well. Um, so that, that's one step is getting a mechanism and process and I think emotion is going to play a critical role in that. Um, the other thing is, um, uh, more about this idea of nuance. And what I'll be a little bit more specific about that is that I'm, there seem to be contextual cues that effect when hormones such as testosterone or cortisol are released in a predictable way. So, for example, we know that, um, when we threatened people status, that's really when testosterone, Roland social behaviors strong, but under normal conditions when status threat isn't really relevant, we're not getting a profound effect. So kind of understanding these context depending, qs is really, really an important critical next step that we're taking as a field. And the other thing is not just context dependence but person dependent.

Speaker 2:          05:45          So how do you see yourself? What's your personality like and how does hormones such as testosterone influence say someone who sees themselves as really dominant person versus someone who doesn't? And what we're seeing is really drastically different effects depending on these kinds of self perceived, um, personality processes. So I think there's just a lot more to do in terms of mechanism and uh, and nuance. And that's kind of where the field is heading, is debunking kind of these age old myths about just these simple views and really trying to understand them in a more systematic way. And I think emotion research is in a play a important role in this new resurgence of research on hormones and social behavior. So

Speaker 1:          06:28          well, it's exciting to have you here at the forefront, you know, leading this work at probing mechanism, steeply, understanding the nuances. And, and related to this, I mean, I think about how you've already started to do this, you know, with your dual hormone hypothesis where you really examine really carefully this interrelationship between cortisol on the one hand and testosterone on the other, you know, predicting a wide range of behaviors already from social status to decision making. And I wonder if you could just tell us a bit more, what do you see as some of the most exciting discovery so far?

Speaker 2:          07:00          Yeah, sure. I'd be happy to share that. So, um, as I sort of mentioned, we've sort of had this view that cortisol is the stress hormone and testosterone is the dominance hormone. And for the past a hundred years, both in humans and animal work, it's been these systems that have been studied pretty much independently. So you'll see long tradition of research on Cortisol's role in social behavior and you'll see a similar parallel line of work on testosterone, swollen social behavior. But if you look deeply and critically at the literature, what you'll find is a lot of mess. So you'll see Messi findings at sometimes see a fax and sometimes you won't, um, across really similar behaviors such as, um, stress related processes or motions or, or decisions like you're saying. And so what we wondered based on some, um, biology evidence is one of these two systems could interact that is, might the influence of testosterone on behavior depend on whether someone is low or high in cortisol.

Speaker 2:          08:03          And what we're seeing in now about 10 studies is this, this seems to be the case in a number of different domains. Um, so for example, someone high in testosterone and low cortisol, uh, they tend to have a more challenge response to threats. Um, they tend to have a more approach oriented and resilience style. So dealing with a threat in the environment, whereas someone high in testosterone and high in cortisol, they seem to have a more negative effect or distress related response to these kinds of threatening situation. So we're, we're really trying to understand these profiles, not just understanding one hormone, uh, independent of other homo system, but these profiles, uh, specifically in this case testosterone and cortisol and we're finding is some counterintuitive new new directions for the field of social VR. Um, specific to, um, the study of emotion is, um, an interesting finding related to train anxiety or trait neuroticism in that is that people high in testosterone and low cortisol, they tend to have a more calm, cool, uh, style, uh, with dealing with stressors in the worlds.

Speaker 2:          09:14          And this actually makes them perform better in positions of leadership is what we're finding. So I just saw some low cortisol people are low in trait anxiety. In contrast, people, high testosterone in high in cortisol seems to be really high in trading side. And like I said, they have threat related responses, uh, uh, to stressors in the environment and they tend to not make as good leaders. And we think it's because of this, um, these feelings of anxiety and distress that they're feeling. So I think that's one segue into how this kind of dual common approach might, um, might provide insights into emotion research in particular.

Speaker 1:          09:56          It's really cool to hear how you're mapping these profiles onto domains relevance to aspect as well as clinically relevant kind of emotion profiles are talking about anxiety and neuroticism. So it's just, it's wonderful to see this work happening. So I think like you're hinting at, it's going to yield so many important discoveries in the years to come.

Speaker 2:          10:15          Yeah, I think so as well. So it's specific to your point about clinical utility that's an exciting new direction that, um, that we're hoping to take in the next few years. So specifically, like you said, it's hinting at that, um, for, for example, we know that neuroticism is a, is a predictor of, uh, aspect of disorders, clinical aspect of disorders. And so we just have some of the first evidence of that. Um, but we need to do a lot more work so we know that I'm studying emotional experience in the real world. So these were just one time measures of emotional experience, but really studying and mapping these hormone processes on to real world emotional experiences and important on direction for future work. And really, um, some of the studies that I've talked to you about emotion, we really looked at just a little snapshot of the Neuro neuroendocrine specifically looking at maybe one sample, um, to provide a window into how the system works. But we know that the system is a lot more complex. Specifically, we know that there's, um, diurnal curve, so cortisol and testosterone are highest in the morning drop throughout the day. Um, and so understanding the slopes and shapes of these curves are going to be an important and exciting way to go specifically in the land of emotion.

Speaker 1:          11:30          Excellent. Well, my final question about your work really touches on, you know, the ways in which you're exploring just innovative approaches to utilizing tools of neuroendocrinology to inform and enhance our understanding of psychological disorders, which you just hinted that including mood disorders. And I wonder, you know, we've just talked about this clinical application, but do you think that there's some division of, um, you know, the potential clinical utility that these methods might bear for maybe understanding emotional disorders that you've alluded to, but maybe even more accurately detecting them or treating them? Do we think this might be a possible translational approach as we move forward?

Speaker 2:          12:09          I definitely think so. June. Um, I just think we need to do the basic science to understand what we're trying to predict. So, um, so I absolutely think that this type of clinical application, so like I said, if, if we're finding that there's a specific profile, um, neuroendocrine profile that's associated with risk factors for a, a social anxiety disorder, um, uh, clinical depression, it would be really important obviously for clinicians to know this information. Uh, I think the first step is we really have to be kind of confident that this is what's going on. And, um, like you said, we need, we need rich or methods for studying, uh, the neuroendocrine system. So, um, for example, uh, we've of course brought people into the lab, are really, uh, tracking people and their daily lives is one important domain. Uh, another, uh, important way to study the neuroendocrine system is, um, by giving people hormones are changing their hormone system to exoticness administration. So we're working on studies, uh, where we give people testosterone for example. So you might've seen commercials on Androgel, um, that come on. And really this is a, a, uh, a way for researchers to sort of study the causal processes. So the causal links between hormones and emotion. Um, and so yeah, I think there's a lot of exciting, uh, new directions that people can go. And I think ultimately there, these will have translational and clinical applications.

Speaker 1:          13:35          So, I mean, you've really nicely alluded to like where you see the future of the field headed, which sounds really exciting. And I wonder, as part of this, you know, when you have students come to you and ask you for advice or they're thinking about embarking in this domain, what advice do you give them when you think about their future and where the future of the field is headed?

Speaker 2:          13:53          That's a great question. I think, um, one of the privileges of being in a really young field is that there's a lot of questions that are in some ways low hanging fruits for students because they'll have this idea, they're interested in the topic, let's say race bias and emotion, um, or prejudice. And so for example, in my, one of my student's job is interested in this topic, but if you look at the research on this, there's no work really that's looked at the neuroendocrine processes that might be related. Um, and so I think at least for students right now in the field, um, I think just sort of going with what your passion is, what the psychological question is and um, and it seems to be the case that for a lot of these questions there just hasn't been the work done to study the hormones.

Speaker 2:          14:38          So that's one thing. But even in the cases where there are, I think just thinking about things in a slightly different way or approaching the question in a slightly different way is going to be the key to sort of contributing to the bigger science process. There's a number of ways you can do this. Sometimes we just kind of combine different ideas from different fields and this can be a new way. Sometimes we have a new method that we approached the question with. So I think, um, I think this is a great time for students to get involved in social neuroendocrinology work just because it's so young.

Speaker 1:          15:10          Well, thank you so much for speaking today. Primes. It was wonderful, and your insights are just very inspiring and really opened up a lot of questions for this newly emerging field. You know that I see you as at the forefront of

Speaker 2:          15:22          thanks so much for having me. It was a great, great time.

Speaker 1:          15:25          So this concludes our experts in emotion interview with doctor [inaudible] Mehta from the University of Oregon. Thanks.
