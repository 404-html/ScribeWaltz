Speaker 1:          00:00          We have the pleasure of speaking with Paul Ekman, who's going to share his perspective on the evolution of emotion and whether emotions are culturally universal. So Dr. Paul Ekman is a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California San Francisco and has authored or edited 13 books most recently as we showed earlier in the course emotions revealed. Um, and he's also the coauthor with the Dalai Lama on emotional awareness, overcoming the obstacles to psychological balance and compassion. Paul Ekman has consulted with federal and law, local law enforcement, national security, corporate sales and negotiations, health and education professionals and animators at some of the largest animations Siri studios in the world. Um, some of you might know the show lie to me and he was one of the consultants there to sort of teach them how to detect a facial expressions of emotion being also the founder of the facial action coding system, which we talked about earlier in the course.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Um, Paul Ekman has received countless awards and honors. I couldn't even list all of them today. Some of them include the distinguished scientific contribution award from the American Psychological Association. And his work has been discussed in the New York Times. Washington Post, some, some Smithsonian magazine psychology today, and the New Yorker Time magazine not surprisingly selected him as one of the hundred most influential people in 2009. Um, he's appeared on numerous sort of media outlets as well, uh, for live interviews including 48 hours, dateline. Good Morning America, 2020 Larry King, Oprah, Johnny Carson, and many other TV programs. Um, so it's an honor today to have this amazing experts in emotion interview with what is perhaps the founder of emotion as we know it today with Dr. Paul Ekman discussing the topic of our emotions culturally universal. So welcome Doctor Ekman. Thank you for speaking with us today. You know, as really the pioneer that got the study of emotion, you know, put on the map in the first place. I'd love to hear a bit about, for you, what got you interested in studying this topic? Sort of how did you come about to land on the science of human emotion?

Speaker 2:          02:27          Yeah, better than maybe the true reason cause I don't know that we always know the reasons or choices. A long time ago and I was an undergraduate that goes back to the 1950 [inaudible] early. I thought that the answers are the world's hills was psychotherapy you really important places. Individual psychotherapy we would take to the law was group therapy, just getting pretty popular. And so I started observing through a one way mirror therapy sessions and the issue wasn't forced high would prove its effectiveness and the only tools around for measuring what people were doing and group therapy dealt with their words but only one person speaks at a time. But the others react with your posture, with your gaze, facial expression and this is being ignored. And I thought, gee, we need to measure that if we're really going to improve the effectiveness of therapy. So all take on developing the methods and the concepts for dealing with what I then call non verbal behavior.

Speaker 2:          03:45          Everything other than the speech itself. And a little did I realize as I started, you know how there wasn't much there, there weren't tools already available that could be employed. I would have to develop the tools and there wasn't much conceptually it was very relevant. Um, after eight or 10 years I found Sylvan Tompkins and, uh, he gave me a lot of help in showing me where he was getting me information face. But his theory I didn't find very useful. So it was a lot to do. But I liked that because it was an empty, pretty much empty field. Uh, and so there wasn't a lot of the kind of rivalry and backbiting that often occurs in hunter fields in psychology. And, uh, also it meant using cameras and I was making half my living when I first got my phd as a photographer. And so the idea of bringing the two together, uh, I'd use cameras to understand people.

Speaker 2:          04:53          I liked that. And also, and it became clear that in order to sell the most fundamental question, which is, is not her behavior, a culture specific language, lung phenomenon or is it more product or our evolution? We're biologically, if he was in universal in order to answer that, you'd have to travel for a lot of different places. Oh my God. I wanted to travel and so I bought g Agri News. Cameras are getting to travel and nobody's going to be competing with me because at best, I mean actually I was told repeatedly you're wasting your time. There's not the year. That was the opinion of academics psychology. The former head of NSF, we recently also retired as head of all 10 UC systems. Told me the 1960s don't you know, this is a dead end. Why are you wasting your time with it? I recently saw him and he said, Oh, who were the suspected that you are able to certainly not yet have you start off by clinicians. They knew eras information there. Uh, not the accurate in sorrow and those days and I made, she was willing to take a risk. I was doing high risk research area. No one hit. So far we've been successful. Have you support for 30 years. Every grant that I wrote was worth it.

Speaker 3:          06:30          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          06:31          That's an amazing story because I mean, since then, I mean your work has just been pioneering in developing what we know to be the most, you know, rigorous and widely used tool for coding, you know, expressions of human emotion in the face, you know, your facial action coding system. Um, and I wonder if you could say a little bit more about the development of this system, sort of what, what were the first initial steps and what do you see as some of the most important applications of this coding system?

Speaker 2:          07:04          Low is a giant task to undertake and I didn't want to be cognitive of you taking it if I read your license or degree eight years, cause I got one, I only had a grant for five years, I thought I'd get done from start to finish five years. Silver talkers. So I mean not to charge to Prophylax I've ever succeed and yeah. Uh, after our one major false start, uh, I realize that what you're seeing is really a mechanical system and their muscles underneath that skin and those muscles are pulling the skin from one place to another. And if you can learn the anatomy and how these muscles are creating each expression, you could dissect the expression it just from looking at video or film, you don't need to average the faceless. Ooh. Uh, so you had your truck freezing and our reason, and I worked together 25 years, we were just recently cars learning about how did we managed to work together for 25 years and I can argue very clear division of labor of who did what work beautifully.

Speaker 2:          08:25          At the end of five years I was nearly out of money and I was almost there. All right. [inaudible] take one more year and I wrote her a big move. It's already be in there. Imh three years, 20 years. And they said, ah, no more honey. Oh No. See you didn't build this. Doulas talk down. We're not going to put what we've are starting to put more money into it just by accident. I was contact. Why Robin, you lion or tiger who then we're running a small foundation, this small Guggenheim Foundation and they called me. I haven't fostered were in town. Your work. We'd like to give you some money. This is why I'm tired. I said her mom, you are, you're pulling quite late. Tiger walks if you want to give me no, no, no. They said we're really serious. So really you just for a drink down charm? I did. And they gave you that money. He should get it. Justin drove a block. I'd be wise, I would have been hanging out a shingle. They tried to do psychotherapy, which I doc activity somehow.

Speaker 1:          09:43          Yeah. It's amazing how much happens just by serendipity. Like you're, you're telling him that story.

Speaker 2:          09:48          You guys, I was a, I asked her a few years ago or do you give a truck to the medical students about my career? I was the first year this all I science to see if it's successful. The Korea and I titled the Jaw Zera Deputy Perseverance a time. That was, I said, we're in order for any one of those less than figure out how you're going to turtle. So things fell into my lap. Oh, why did I start with this? I got back from uh, the work in your day. It was an hour afterwards. Solid evidence for the fact that Darwin really was right around expression. I use your gestures or not are totally different. They're a coaches specifically. Russians seem to be universal issue. Sir, I taught she, we've gotta be able, or Tom kids can go up to the screen and show me where are you as needing anger, where he was the fear I should be able to develop an, which is awesome. So that was the inspiration and I didn't realize how hard it was going to be, how long it was going to change. And yet it still remains the gold standard and it's a lot of progress has now on automating it. If you use facts, you know you are about an hour to score one minute if you behave. So it's a slow process are very precise. Well, soon a 70 or 80% of what people do get scored.

Speaker 1:          11:28          That would be a big time saver. Being a fax coder myself, you know,

Speaker 2:          11:32          you'd be a big truck. Is all little movies left for you or the things that the carding automated cutting systems having problems. So it'll hop down,

Speaker 4:          11:42          uh,

Speaker 2:          11:44          more risk and increase the number of people who are using facts. Am I colleague Robert Levinson. We'll do hard collaborating or years looking at the relationship that you express your physiology, awkward cheese and iceberg says that's going to really beat you bad cause then all equal, we're in a rush and her started using vaccines will be a lot of trashy research right now the people will use facts after the very committed because it's a process.

Speaker 1:          12:13          So I wanted to ask you then, what do you see as some of the applications of facts both within the laboratory and outside the laboratory and these kind of real world applications that I know you've been taking a large part in as well?

Speaker 2:          12:26          Well, we've developed separate tools, uh, for people who watch to spot it seals emotion.

Speaker 4:          12:35          And

Speaker 2:          12:36          you're here to learn facts. You don't taste with your 50 and 900 hours to learn the first five, since I've retired and not your two hours, you've been marked your recognize conceals emotions. Uh, that's an injury. I'm sure 109,000 people. I've learned it already. We just want our line and Margaret people from all over the world with all kinds of purposes in my back's remains and the researchers for example, how many synonyms are there drag or uh, we know there are a lot of different ways over 80 different ways show anger. Well, what's your, those are relevant. Just sulking. Which Jane indignation, which do exacerbation, which their Curie, which an annoyance and how many of them show a type of Agora that we don't have here. We have to name shine. You only have a functional words for different types of Agora. That's your anymore expressions.

Speaker 2:          13:36          So are they expressions just simply synonyms or are they naming things that we have not given her words or words or representations of emotion? They're not an emotion. I think his argument with other people in the field or the people who are you with me? I stopped arguing rocks. I answered the device. That's actually, but there are people who were really concerned with the words. Really each emotion has its own narrative and underlying store. So anger has to do with protecting yourself against threats or insults there. That has to do with it in some way. That's the underlying story. I was very, very different than the underlying story of sadness switches has to do with it this morning.

Speaker 4:          14:25          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          14:27          It should be just, there are many reasons why you could be disappointed. You're going to be disappointed in yourself that you didn't really act the way you wish you had active. You can be disappointed via a lover who rejects you are fat you year to get an article published. There are many different ways, but they all have to do with disappointment, feeling sort of lovely rejection. At least that's the same story. So to represent our emotions with a single word like sadness, anger, seals, a lot of these differences have facts, measures everything. You could do yours in anything you can do with a very slick blacks can't give you a way of describing and then it's up to us, the scientists to find out what these things sick. Why in the world with nature give us 80 different ways of displaying anger. He were all senators be waste of time.

Speaker 2:          15:21          We have to do with different nuances and those would be interesting too. I've covered. All right. Another thing I'm most interested in at the moment, yeah, is a great long shot Andy North for some shot because it's such a long shot, although it happy, nervous benefit, say Mars are so far from the last 10 years have not been able to get any government agency to support it. Maybe they will. I was a recent event that's this tragic event I had a kid has made violence arch were saying, so what I'm interested in and what I have some leads for is what it, is there a signal that warns us of impending violence? Is there something you can see 20 or 30 seconds before the violence versus stripes orange you hear about too, if there was intervention, say bars, you can save the life of the violent person because most of these people been themselves after they go go.

Speaker 1:          16:29          What do you see as some of the potential hypotheses about what might be some of the micro expressions that might occur immediately before violent behavior strikes? Yes.

Speaker 2:          16:38          Reservists game here, but you go more than a hundred assassination. If you're someone who was shooting the arteries that should even be heard. Your camper either a hamburger or a newsperson and then suddenly a weapon and fears her stripes and it's, I could see the expression on his face or I try 20 surgeons, the borders, the same expression, scattered reports drop serious crime, five country Western, aren't you? Sorry, I have some really good leads. I'm not going to tell you what they are because I am not certain. I want those who are, you know what it is they need to suppress. Sure. Well, let me ask, I ask

Speaker 1:          17:30          a question about something you brought up earlier, which is you're really groundbreaking work on the universality of emotion expressions and recognition of emotions and I wonder if you could describe what some of these initial insights were in your early work that really gave you clues to, as you said, that Darwin was really on to something in his initial observations of emotion expressions.

Speaker 2:          17:54          Well, just by luck, I ran into a program officer and the Defense Department, what was that called? The advanced research projects agency, and he was married to a woman from Thailand and they were having some marital problems and he thought maybe they were misunderstanding each other's emotions and expressions. So he said to me, I wasn't liked to go out find. What's your, is it Brittany that universal or is it all culture specific? I want you to do basic research on this. I'll give you as much money as you need and uh, find out Margaret mead writers, Darwin, right? Or are they both? Right. So we have a proposal in the next week or a video dollars sounds right now this was 1960 $5 is all lot of 65, it would be like 10 to 20 million now. So I went back, is that what you start? I started, I of you called me and he said, where's the proposal? I said, I'm not going to do it. He says, I'll see you tomorrow. [inaudible] sister. And he wrote the proposal.

Speaker 2:          19:10          So I then talked to all of the experts I already do to. I got Margaret needs to be willing to talk to me. She wasn't very here. I talked to her, talked to her, well I talked to Charles Oscar, you watch the dude there thing that you really need to do is you need to find division. We isolated group couldn't have been influenced by the media or our son. And by a stroke of luck I sound medical scientists who had been working with a isolated group, the beginning, find out what was causing a grain disease. Cool. Kurt [inaudible] and he had been wise enough to recognize it. As important as the work he was doing is just documenting life in the stone age option. So he hired a fulltime cinematographer and he shot [inaudible] shot a hundred thousand feet, just social life. I of course he had never looked at Dr. Thompson fee and he said, we want to take a look, I'll give you a cop. So sock checked her coffee recently and I spent a year so I was ahead of all of this.

Speaker 1:          20:32          So that's true.

Speaker 2:          20:34          And that's where I found out with a story where I was, because I never saw an expression I hadn't seen before. If he was the right guy, I should see things on a basis I'd never see. And when I could tell from happened before or afterwards in the episode, my interpretation was right. So no one's going to hold the year was the proof. But that's, I can't put that film and drew take Earth Science, I have to figure out how can I possibly do research on this. And I went to this medical designers and I said, I want to come to your area a new day and look at these people and figure out what kind of experiment I can do. Why? And he said it. So I went, I had funds. Do you do anything I wanted? I got the funds if that were administered by the state of California and they wanted her to receive her. Every penny was, it was smacking. And I said, these people don't have their free lyric. They don't write check at your receipts. I have to get a lesson. We would a project from a Buddha doctor, you won't be off to the writer of seafood here. All hard material goods. So I went to Johnson and robbed the first time the evidence was not there. I was telling stories to these people and asked them point that first year to do that, I would show them a photograph of him. Emotion. I've never seen her photograph before. I had no trouble recognizing they had never seen her newer. Hmm.

Speaker 3:          22:20          Really

Speaker 2:          22:21          attraction. Sorry. Sure, sure. All right, so tell me the story. What was happening before? What's after you now? What else you could see square ordering off the I want, I've never asked them to do such a strange thing. It's not like it's story about this thing that they'd never seen before and they recognize me. They record black making after the stories and when I got the stories and their stories were a reasonably consistent reach your emotion, right. I didn't have a big sample. Hated doing. So I did publish the results in science, but they weren't really robust and they were based really on 30 40 50 feet.

Speaker 2:          23:14          I came back here like, God I just did or how to crack this, that by luck I remembered a paper. I read rise apologist for drop job Dashiell if he had worked for three and four year olds, are they going to have a written by? So it was his idea. Where he would do is he read shogun couple of photographs, each run of a different emotion. He was telling of the story, why are these people is out to fight friction? One of these people or a child who's pitching, what are these goofballs see brands. And we really liked working with Christian Arthur. Oh my God, he's, so I went back to New Guinea and I use that procedure and we got closer jolts shoulder and we got almost 10% of your child culture. Or of course I went back the second time they do, I was just a harmless person and the word 50 strike, this was really easy.

Speaker 2:          24:18          And I give them a bar of soap. You're going to bars, sir. So people I didn't have to hike to remote villages and every morning stood online basketball and then they were off. So it was wonderful. Now why formulation is how sure her VA's even single system. And so it influences exactly what triggers the emotion and influence is what I call the spray rules. The chimps advantage in most instances it already [inaudible] how are you your attitudes about having recently, uh, edge what you're likely to do? So it isn't, this is a response is culture plays no role what it is, right or wrong overlay on a universal signal system. Charles Darwin's word. Sure.

Speaker 3:          25:29          Oh Man.

Speaker 1:          25:32          So as someone who's been a pioneer and really understanding human emotion and extent to which it says, you're saying universal and then having this veneer of cultural influence above it, where do you see the future of emotion going from here, sort of on the horizon? What's next?

Speaker 2:          25:54          No, I'm not a good forecast. I didn't write everything just sort of dropped into my lap. It isn't, is it hard? Well, what's the most important for you? Do you understand the nature of impression or you have to actually take advantage of opportunities. So it's really good. Japan with the opportunities, I believe that we should stop spending so much time showing people emotion. And Archie measure emotional behavior and you need to get out. It's not as if this is something of term three years. I tried to get people to go to the funerals. I never was able to bring just a student. She had arose. Weddings, confirmations are all of these type of situations. Correct. Tense, emotional, just raising sure as well as it first in the bedroom and the kitchen. It's harder to get in there, but still you can. John Gottman is a friend or colleague for many years studying marijuana directions where a steady apples are having trouble. Uh, he's also studied couples who are having trouble. It's not that they don't have disagreements. Every one of your chapters, disagreement seat. Yeah. Or even very lucky person doesn't mean you're going to agree with him about every aspect of how to live your lives together and separate. But the issue is how you handle those disabilities. Your handles them out.

Speaker 4:          27:26          Uh,

Speaker 2:          27:27          anger your answer anyway.

Speaker 4:          27:29          Harmful.

Speaker 2:          27:31          No, I've developed a new online tools to try to help people do that. It's called mapping your anger. Rough law to go through it. You're just rubber by moving. Spiders are cuter screening the unique ways in which you experience and how that differs or ready to work as it should have. You can look at each other and how you perceive each other. That should be online I April or, right.

Speaker 1:          28:03          Fantastic. I'm sure a lot of couples will find that a useful tool.

Speaker 2:          28:07          It is. It's fun. Also, if it isn't fun, you're no longer has to be enjoyable. As it says tedious, I'm learning vocabulary or foreign language. That's just memorization. Really tedious thing. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:24          Uh Huh.

Speaker 2:          28:27          Learning about emotion, raw motivated. Let's take, we would most likely be able to do this to be able to chew. What would you be comfortable sharing about and choose how we behave would be our approach now. Nature didn't want you to have either of those choices, so you respond most people and you respond not necessarily the way that it's going to be most useful to this situation. What's built into you? What was really useful in living in a tribal society? We don't anymore. We live in very, very different contexts, so, but there are skills. Oh, did she can learn her. Describing one of my books were the exercises and you're actually booger. You'll start to increase your awareness of emotion. You're having the emotion. Just to realize afterwards, oh my God, I lost my head. You say I lost my head. What are you saying?

Speaker 2:          29:34          You're saying my head was not really involved. I wasn't really funny to show my emotions running the show and I only got in afterwards. Are you willing to give you right at the beginning you want from her? Recognize that involves the trauma emotional and be able to choose wherever you want to act on Azure and dry. My last [inaudible] who was the Dalai Lama calls emotional awareness events. She is awareness. It's early in the episode as you can and that will require it worked on. It is your dog new exercises and new brain circuitry that will allow you to monitor what you're actually doing as you're doing it and you will develop are what the Buddhists call a watcher part of yourself that is observing yourself. Then you're a lot more choice. This is what we go a lot.

Speaker 1:          30:35          So when you talk about learning emotion and you know twice as well, I mean these are important questions that students or people in the community who want to learn more about emotion might come and ask you about how can I learn more about emotion or what choices do I have, any emotions I experienced? And what kind of advice do you give people who come to you asking about how can I get involved in wanting to study this? You know, fascinating but complex and sometimes ambiguous phenomena. That's emotion.

Speaker 2:          31:06          Well, there's a number of things you could read their jewels, you get Jake, then we'll make you a more acute observer. I've just putting another online training tool that helps you learn how to respond to what others versus emotions in the most effective, right? Cause this is my to know now you're concealing it. Perfect. All right, you're not supposed to work. We're, how do I respond to that most effective way? And this new tool teaches you how to do that. So we can teach you online how to recognize the emotion. Either respond to it, but what we don't yet have an online, more water is working on it. She's here. Your Phd is developing their momentary awareness as the impulse psoriasis. I, for some of us, that's going to be a really easy for us. You have her brother's gradual slope of emotional arousal and your others are lucky attack dogs of emotion. They go from zero to maximum.

Speaker 2:          32:20          That's going to be much harder. It's paradoxical, but people need to learn. This is the most or argued the hardest so far. He goes, let's go to their system is fast responding. Didn't say you're merged, your moderated, so they'll have more chores. Those are exercises, those exercises. All right. I like to use the example of chairs or you can even watch the game of tennis on TV. Any sense of it? If you don't know the rules and you could read with the rows are 10 or 15 minutes on our, everything you need you to have that will make you a good observer. Okay? Where'd you won't care it while over in the hat for that practice and the coach,

Speaker 3:          33:10          she's trying

Speaker 2:          33:13          why little copy read their book shops to drug each that we ever, or some emotional skills. It's four days long. There's a lot of exercising and I practice jade brown or it's like getting your GP, you get the ball longer than that in immersion snaps. It gives you all the tools you'll need, which if you Virginia to use the really increasingly have choice about your emotional.

Speaker 3:          33:43          That's what we're really lucky.

Speaker 1:          33:45          Well, I mean this has been wonderful speaking with you as someone who so revered in the field and I know many, many people including myself were inspired by when I was first a young student thinking about, you know, trying to understand what emotions were. So I just want to thank you so much doctor acne for speaking today and being part of this series
