Speaker 1:          00:00          Welcome back to human emotion. Um, in this course we've sort of thought about what an emotion is, sort of what are tools we can use to trigger it and how we can measure it's varying representations in our own face, our laughter, our bodily signals and most recently even our brain. Yet the most striking feature about emotion is that it's usually not experience in isolation. In fact, we experienced it around other people and it's what binds us to other people. And in fact emotions are actually thought of as the social glue of society. Um, so given that emotions are rarely experienced in isolation and that we have them to connect us and bind us together, we need to better understand this social world of emotions we live in. This can include experiencing emotions with intimate partners and sort of one on one or dyadic exchanges as well as experiencing them as part of a larger group of people such as when we cooperate or compete.

Speaker 1:          01:09          And so as we think about emotions and how important they are to our own individual life, we want to remember how critical they are to our social life. And how they're literally the glue that keeps us together as social creatures. And so with this thought that we live in this inherently social world, um, how much do we know about emotions in our social world? How do emotions look in these lives, social exchanges, how do they underlie our most important relationships and interactions like romantic relationships, cooperating with other people, working in teams. These are some of the questions that we'll begin to examine today in our first part, um, of the emotions and social world series. Um, and in particular, um, what I'd like to start out as we think about emotions in a social world is to ask you to engage in a thought exercise.

Speaker 1:          02:10          So what I want you to do is after I explained this to you, to pause the video, take out a piece of paper and write down this little exercise. And when you're done, you can click, play and resume the video. So what I want you to do is think about a recent time where you experienced a very intense emotion. It could be positive or it could be negative. And what I want you to do is just to write about first describing an emotion and all the ways and tools that we've talked about so far. Sort of what did it look like, you know, and your facial expressions. What did you feel physiologically in your body? Um, what kind of subjective experience did you have go through all the different multiple channels of emotion responding we've talked about and when you're done with that, think about for a second, what was the social context this emotion was embedded in?

Speaker 1:          02:57          Were there any other people? The emotion was about, were you around other people when the emotion happened and was the emotion something that really tied you to have a relationship with another person? And I'm curious to see if you find that most of the intense emotions we experience in everyday settings are rarely about things that have only to do with us. And more often than not, they are often truly about other people. And they're the things that really get us going. The things that make us feel joyous things is that make us feel angry and sad are the emotions we have around others or about others. So take a moment to try to do this. And when you're done, we'll come back and talk a bit about this introduction to emotions in a social world. So here we go. We're going to start in our introduction of emotions and a social world.

Speaker 1:          03:48          And I think of it as a question of will I feel you feel we feel. And in a sense, what I want you to think about is the fact that any one of us feels emotions, but we're often thinking about the emotions of other people and the emotions of all of us together as a collective group. And so what we're going to do, and sort of thinking about this introduction to social emotions is go through the following roadmap. We're going to start with an introduction to what social emotions are in the first place, followed by an account that's been provided, have a social function of emotion across different levels of analysis. Conclude a takeaway questions and our expert interview for today. So I'm going to start here with an introduction to sort of what our social emotions in the first place. What do we mean when we think about this?

Speaker 1:          04:32          So again, this is our graph here, thinking about this idea of emotions and a social world and asking the question of why are our emotions so social. So you may remember earlier on in our course we talked about the evolution of emotion and here we discussed the early ancestral origins of human man and how he evolved into the current form of human species. We know today and in particular we talked about the early environment that man is thought to have evolved in called the, you might remember the acronym, the EEA or the uh, environment of evolutionary adaptiveness. And I would just want to do a quick refresh because some of its central properties I think are really critical to answering this question of, well, why are our emotions so social in the first place? So when we talked about, for example, the EEA, right, we went through the different properties of it. And let me just go through some of these properties that appear to have given rise to our current emotional state and just how social it really is. So we talked about early man arriving, sort of originating in an environment where it was really important to care for offspring, right? And that they be vulnerable, that we build this important attachment system of dependency between a caretaker and their human offspring. So that it's important that we have emotions like compassion and nurturant love. We also talked about the importance

Speaker 1:          05:57          of relatively monogamous bonds, right? That we have this strong underlying tone of commitment to a single partner, and that this is really important to build emotions of love and commitment and the importance of jealousy and keeping us together with these partners.

Speaker 2:          06:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:14          And then we talked about the emergence of caring and compassion, which is due to the fact that hominids lived very long lives. And so we're in a society where there's many older individuals who require caring, right? And so the existence of both vulnerable offspring, young babies as well as older people really suggest that caring and compassion, these socially rich emotions are a core feature of what we've evolved to be. There's also the flattening of a social hierarchy in society, right? Um, that suggests that in many ways that early societies, hunter gatherer societies were relatively egalitarian. And because we lived in this egalitarianism, it was really important to have emotions that fostered cooperation and bonding with others.

Speaker 2:          07:00          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:01          And then finally we talked about this need for a collective action related to the point beforehand where again, a central part of the societies included needs for working together towards a common goal and being cooperative, being prosocial, putting aside one's individual needs and feelings for the bigger, greater group. So it seems in many ways that we evolved to be social creatures and hence our emotions are just so richly social at all levels. So when we think about sort of this introduction to how social we are and where it came from, recent researchers have tried to sort of better quantify this, to think about, well, if emotions are so social and we live in this inherently social world, what exactly is the social purpose or function of emotions, sort of what do they do for us? Sort of what, what can they, you know, feature and unique ways, you know, that that makes us function as social creatures.

Speaker 1:          07:59          So when we think about social functions of emotion, um, this has been broken into four main levels of analysis proposed by Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Height. And first they talk about this individual level. And again, this is a lot of what we originally studied thus far in the course. So we've studied emotions as this kind of sensory response system where we have really coordinated expressions in our face, vocal intonations, things like laughter. We have autonomic, physiological, you know, signatures, heart rate, skin conductance, breathing that are associated with different emotions. And then we also have specific neurosignatures of emotions as well. And that these help us sort of solve, you know, different types of relationship based problems as well as survival and group behavior. So that's the first level,

Speaker 2:          08:48          okay.

Speaker 1:          08:49          But yet there's more than just the individual. There's the dyadic level. So here when we talk about dyadic, we're talking about a specific exchange between two individuals or a Dyad, right? And so here it's really important to have an emotional response system where you can, you know, coordinate with another individual in terms of having facial expressions that you can pick up on one another using the important intonation in the voice, having, um, coordinated physiological responses that mirror one another as you're engaging. Um, and even having brain systems that people now like Jamil Zaki are studying that help us actually empathize with other people. Empathy being the ability to understand the, what another person is feeling or understand cognitively what they're thinking. Right? So this dyadic level is critically important. Um, the third level of analysis I'll hold on just really quickly before we get there. Um, and turn to this quote by Paul Ekman who really hearkened at the value and critical importance of the dyadic level of, um, you know, social functions of emotion. He said the primary function is to mobilize the organism to deal quickly with important interpersonal encounters. So almost the father of human emotion as we study it today, really underscored the importance of emotion as essentially helping us navigate social or interpersonal endeavors or encounters. So emotions, again, are inherently social.

Speaker 1:          10:20          And here what I want to do as well before we continue further is to make two important distinctions here. So the important terminology that we need to make is between interpersonal and intrapersonal. So interpersonal that we see here on the left with this has really for referring to his emotions that occur within an individual. So again, this is mapping emotional processes of one specific individual. And this is contrast with interpersonal emotions. So these are emotions between two people and hear when you study interpersonal emotions, you're looking at how emotions structure relationships among individuals. Okay. So again, what we're going to be talking about today is we started with a dyadic level of analysis and we move on to different levels is are these interpersonal emotions and if you're a member, when we talked about dyadic methods earlier in the course, hopefully you remember our early lectures on how to study emotions and different methods. We talked about dyadic interactions

Speaker 1:          11:25          here. When we talked about dyadic interactions, we had specific examples of two people coming into the lab and having people, it could be between spouses, family members, caregivers, friends, and often when we study them, we have them engage in conversations and at the end of these emotionally evocative conversations, we have people write their emotion experience sort of how are you feeling right now as well as their emotion perception of their partner. How is their partner feeling right now? And we talked about some of the kind of emotion processes you can get when studying dyadic interactions are looking at reactivity, regulation, understanding of emotions as well as some of the, some of the advantages as well as disadvantages of studying dyadic interactions. Some of the advantages is you have good ecological validity. You're looking at a naturalistic social context. And the disadvantages being that they're somewhat idiographic and that emotional responses are really complicated when you study them in to people that they can be mutually influenced by both members of the dyad.

Speaker 1:          12:29          So what I want to turn to now is studies that have looked at dyadic interactions in married couples and really identified core emotional ingredients that sort of predict who are going to go on to have a successful longterm dyadic relationship or marriage as a really cardinal example and which individuals are going to have trouble. So here we're thinking about research by Levinson and Gottman who uncovered the power of emotion and relationships. So they found that or they reported that, you know, up to 40 to 60% of marriages end in divorce, right? And it's often hard to understand exactly why, right? So, um, what they tried to do is they did longitudinal studies to try to unlock what are the emotional mechanisms that predict who do and do not go on to get divorced. And they identified, you can see these four circles here, but they called the four horsemen of the apocalypse.

Speaker 1:          13:28          So what they did is they brought a married couples into the lab spouses, and they have them interact with each other in these sort of brief 10 minutes snippets of conflict arguments or topics. And what they did is they coded these conversations offline, watching the videos very carefully, kind of second by second and identified, well, what are the ingredients that predict divorce? And here's what they found them to be. So the first was criticism. So if couples were very critical of each other and not praising each other, that was a bad sign. The second was content. So we can all think of contempt. It's this idea of people sort of feeling that they're morally better than the other sort of looking down upon their partner. So if you saw people sneering during these conflict conversations, or even like rolling their eyes, that was a second horseman of the apocalypse.

Speaker 1:          14:19          The third was defensiveness. So this is where someone sort of maybe says something to you that sensitive or critical and you just fire back, right? You're very defensive, very sensitive, instead of being able to kind of engage in the conversation. And the fourth and the one that I think is often perhaps the most interesting is stonewalling. So this is literally like you become a stone wall and you just sorta refuse to talk about anything your partner thinks is important. So they found that individuals in these very brief 10 minute, if they show these four ingredients that they were able to predict divorce 13 to 15 years later at a rate of 92% accuracy. So if you see these four things in a conversation, in a couple of, they would say signs are, it may be bad news. So what I like to think about taking away from this is that there's these micro behavioral, um, emotion laden behaviors and just brief snippets of dyadic interactions between the two most intimate kinds of partners. You can think of, you know, people in a marriage that can be signs as to the quality of that relationship even 10, 13, 15 years later.

Speaker 2:          15:33          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:34          So the third level then in this is the group level. So here we're thinking about big groups of people and we're thinking about social hierarchies. How do people in high versus low scs situations, you know, how do they fare emotionally, how does socioeconomic status plan to emotional wellbeing as well as power. So a lot of these studies have been done by fascinating people like Dacher Keltner and others at UC Berkeley that find for example, that people in low scs situations are twice as likely to have depression, right? That they have compromised immune system functioning, right? And they've also looked at power and that individuals with higher power really display a whole different repertoire of emotional related behavior with people of low power settings.

Speaker 2:          16:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:20          And then finally in one that's particularly important when we think of kind of global level conflict and cooperation is the between group level. So here what we're talking about is in group versus out group. And this is a kind of collective level, right? And a very central and controversial idea here, you know, comes from sober and Wilson related to evolutionary theory. So they would say if we evolved in groups, which is clearly true, and if there were numerous groups competing with each other, which also happens that there's tens of thousands of people in specific groups. So there may be some emotional traits that helped some groups do better in competition against other groups. So it's this idea of ingroup versus outgroup and what sort of emotional behaviors give rise to competition versus collaboration. So this is a very controversial topic and plays a really important role and we think about global conflict and how can we leverage insights from understanding emotion and aspect of science to try to think about emotion on a broader group level scale as well as cooperation. So this has been an introduction to social emotions. And for the next second and third modules in this series, we're going to have a couple of very exciting and very esteemed guests lectures. And I want to give you a quick sneak peek as to who's going to be coming up in the next two modules on social emotions.

Speaker 2:          17:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:45          So one of our guests lectures is a beloved colleague of here at Yale University. Dr. Margaret Clark, who's a renowned expert on emotions and relationships, and so she's going to speak with us about some of the most cutting edge findings as to how we can think about our emotions and the way they navigate our relationships, especially romantic relationships. We'll also have day at Dr. David Desteno. I'm from northeastern university who's just one of the founders of this field of social emotions, who's going to be talking with us about emotions and social interactions touching across a broad range of really central and important themes.

Speaker 2:          18:25          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          18:26          so we've talked about an introduction to what our social emotions, we've talked about the social function of emotions across four different levels of analysis.

Speaker 2:          18:35          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:36          I've given you a little sneak peek into the two upcoming guests lectures that are going to conclude our module on social emotions. And so now we'll conclude with our takeaway questions. Our first question asks, what were the features of the early he a that gave rise to social emotions and humans from an evolutionary perspective? Second, what were the four levels of analysis inherent in a social functional approach to emotion? And finally, can you describe what are called the four horsemen of the apocalypse research by Gottman and Levinson. And what does this tell us about emotion, romantic relationships, sort of what are the most important emotional ingredients that can predict who will and will not go on to have a healthy romantic a future together. And we're going to conclude with our expert interview today.

Speaker 2:          19:35          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:35          This is part of our experts in emotion interview series.

Speaker 2:          19:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:40          So for this uh, lectures experts and emotion interview series, I'll be speaking with Dr. David Rand on emotion and cooperation in the social world. Doctor Rand earned his phd from Harvard University and systems biology and his Ba from Cornell University in computational biology. His work focuses on human cooperative behavior. His approach combines empirical observations from behavioral experiments with predictions generated by evolutionary game theoretic math models and computer simulations by doing this doctor ran ass. What prosocial and antisocial decisions people make in particular situations and social environments. The cognitive mechanisms that determine how these decisions are actually made and the ultimate explanations for why our decision making processes have come to function as they do. He draws on methodologies from psychology as well as economics and evolutionary biology and is interested in applications including law management and public policy. Doctor Ran, has published in high impact journals, including nature and science, was named wired magazine Smart List, uh, in 2012 as one of 50 young people who will change the world. And his work has widely appeared in the media, including the BBC. NPR is morning edition marketplace and all things considered scientific American, Huffington posts, a New York Times, La Times, the Atlantic, The Washington Post, and Msnbc among many others. So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Dr. David Rand on emotion and cooperation and the social world.

Speaker 2:          21:20          Okay.
