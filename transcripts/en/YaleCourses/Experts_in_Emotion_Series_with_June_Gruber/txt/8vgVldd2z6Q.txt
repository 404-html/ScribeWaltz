Speaker 1:          00:00          Welcome back to human emotion. Today we're going to be talking about emotions as they relate to ourselves. And we're going to be doing this by first answering the question of what are self conscious emotions. So how many of you recognize this painting? So for those of you who don't, this is a painting called narcissist, a narcissist. And the story of narcissists as depicted in this painting tells us a young man who falls in love with his own reflection, gazing upon it. As you can see in the water and modern emotion theorists use this painting of narcissists as a classic example of when there's perhaps pathological levels of self conscious emotions. Too much of an emotion like pride. And this is an emotion we'll be discussing in class today. Um, sometimes when people are thinking of what our sort of modern kind of pop culture, you know, contemporaries of narcissist, I don't know if the sunglasses, um, make you think of anyone in particular for me and for many others out there when they see these sunglasses, they think of one of the pop culture.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Um, you know, songwriters of our day, Kanye west who said in one of his songs there's a thousand of use and only one of me. So let's think about this theme of self conscious awareness and what kinds of emotions my we experience when we're really thinking about ourselves and how we relate to the social world around us. This is the realm of self conscious emotions that we'll talk about today. Um, a lot of this work has really been pioneered by some of the people you see here, Jessica Tracy, Richard Robbins, and it's funny to see someone else named June but June price tangy. So they edited this book called the Self conscious emotions theory and research. Um, and this really contains a lot of readings that you'll see within the course. I'm really drawing on the wide scope of work in this field, linking the self to how we feel.

Speaker 1:          02:02          So here's our roadmap for today. We'll start out by really reviewing what are the central features of self conscious emotions. So how are they different from some of the emotions we've discussed thus far? Like anger, sadness, happiness, what is really different about these emotions? Then we'll go through some examples of self conscious emotions followed by takeaway questions and our expert interview for the day. So let's first start by defining some features of really what makes an emotion self conscious in the first place. So when we think about the features of self conscious emotions, um, one of the first kind of core features is that they involve a sense of self awareness or the ability to have a mental representation of I or me. And so if you have a sense of yourself, of the eye of the me, then you have this ability to be aware of yourself, to have a sense of self knowledge, which is absolutely in order to experience self conscious emotions.

Speaker 1:          03:02          So since the first sort of central feature of what makes up a self conscious emotion experience and there's others as well. So the second feature that's really different and unique about self conscious emotions is that they are not innate. These are not emotions like those we've seen before, like you know, sadness and crying or happiness that emerge really early in life. These are things that actually take time to develop mentally emerge. And here you can say see that they don't emerge early in life as infants, but they actually seem to come on much later. So they emerge later in childhood, often by the age of three. So we're not seeing a sense of self or awareness as well until that age. So it's no surprise, no surprise that we would see these emotions as well take flight as soon as they're just a mental representation of the sense of self, a sense of I or me.

Speaker 1:          03:53          The third feature that's really important about self conscious emotions is that they also help facilitate social goals. So they're really central not only to sort of understanding one's sense of self, but also to one understanding one sense of self within a broader sort of social group or social here. Archi. And so they play this really critical role in helping us establish and maintain these delicate social bonds and relationships that we live as human beings living in a social environment. So in order to be social creatures, one component that helps us sort of navigate those, uh, sort of waters is having the experience of self conscious emotions. And we'll go into that more in just one bit.

Speaker 1:          04:37          Um, an interesting feature of self conscious emotions, which seems to really fly in the face of everything we've talked about so far with respect to emotions, which is that they have a subjective experience. They have an external, you know, universally recognizable behavioral display. Um, you know, physiological parameters. One of those three components we just don't see when it comes to self conscious emotions, at least not yet. We don't know of any universal facial expressions. Um, instead it seems that self conscious emotions really, um, the way that in which they're manifested is really this combination of bodily postures and head movements that there's not just one universal facial expression that can pick out these emotions that involve a sense of self awareness. And that really helped us facilitate our social environment. So you might wonder, well what do self conscious emotions then look like? And that will be something we'll talk about today if we don't see them in the face. Where do we see them?

Speaker 2:          05:34          The fifth

Speaker 1:          05:35          feature about self conscious emotions is that they're really cognitively complex, much more so than the basic emotions we talked about earlier. Again, the ones that were evolutionary heart, evolutionarily hardwired like anger, disgust, sadness, fear and happiness. So we're fear. For example, a basic emotion really only requires you appraising the environment, it's being threatening or scary self conscious emotions that we'll talk about later. Like shame and guilt and pride really require these mark cognitively complex representations. You have to have, for example, a stable representation of yourself across time. You have to have the cognitive ability to self reflect upon your actions and assess them against your own internal, you know, norms and past experiences as well as sort of, you know, evaluating against the broader social norms that are external to the self. So they are much more cognitively complex than some of these basic emotions. Not surprisingly, as we said, they don't emerge until, you know, later on in life as well around the age of three.

Speaker 1:          06:37          When you start seeing glimmers of them. So these are some of the five features we've talked about that sort of help us begin to understand what our self conscious emotions. And here again more much more cognitively complex. So we've talked about five features of self conscious emotions that are really sailing it, kind of pick them out and differentiate them from some of the more basic emotions we've talked about thus far. You may be wondering as I've told you all these teachers, they'll self conscious emotions. Well well what are that? It's self conscious emotions and what are these funny emotions that are more cognitively complex that don't emerge until much later in life. And that really seemed to involve a sense of self awareness in order to experience them. So what I want to do now then is walk you through some examples of what are some of the prime candidates or examples that have been discussed so far as really kind of you know, your poster child kind of icons for the family of self conscious emotions.

Speaker 1:          07:33          So here I'm going to walk you through four commonly discussed self conscious emotions. And there is follows. This includes pride, embarrassment, shame, and guilt. And what I'll do today is just walk you through brief definitions of each and then what we'll do for the remainder of our module on self conscious emotions is go into greater depth and, uh, and each of these four emotions. So let me give you a brief overview today of these four really interesting, uh, examples of emotions that centrally involved the self and an awareness of oneself within a social group. These are the family of self conscious emotions. So let's start here with pride. So what is pride in the first place? So you know, we think about what does pride look like and if you look at these photos here, you know, do you see examples of pride, um, that are not only evident, you know, in humans that are of the bodybuilding, you know, variety, but do we also see them in some nonhuman primates as well?

Speaker 1:          08:41          Sort of. Is there a sense of elevating your sense of self and sort of displaying your social status that makes up what the nature of pride is? Um, and here if we talk about what are the characteristics of pride, I break it up into three categories here with respect to the solicitor. So what triggers pride, what is the associated behavior of pride and what are some of the consequences of experiencing pride? So pride is typically elicited if we start here at the far left by some sort of personal achievement or success. So the self has had some sort of accomplishment that is really directed towards yourself. Something good has happened to you, you've achieved some goal, you've obtained some reward, you've gotten some sort of self praise or recognition and the behaviors we saw earlier in the bodybuilder and even the chimpanzee seems to signal a way in which you're sort of puffing out your, your posture, your advertising, advertising to others that you have an elevated sense of status.

Speaker 1:          09:45          It's like, look at me, I'm important right now. And so you're signaling to others as it says here, I'm a successful person who deserves some sort of recognition and perhaps higher status within my social group. So again, it's this very like, you know, expanding your posture and saying, look at me, I'm important. And the consequence of this sort of experience and display of pride is thought to be, um, sort of focus towards gaining respect within your social hierarchy. You achieve something, you display it, and that should boost you up within the social ladder that you live in. So these are some of the characteristics of what pride is thought to sort of be about and sort of the ultimate social goals that it's supposed to fulfill. So that's a little bit about pride. Now let's briefly walk through the nature of embarrassment here. Again, we're just going to go through some of the basic features of what makes up embarrassment.

Speaker 1:          10:38          And I remember in our very first class we sort of opened up, you know, the topic of emotion by having you think about, you know, an example of a time in your life in which you made a major social phobia and had this almost painful experience of embarrassment. Now what good would embarrassment serve? Why would we want to be experiencing it in the first place? And why are we hardwired or built to be embarrassed. So here I'll walk you through the characteristics of embarrassment, just like I did with pride. So when we think of the solicitor, so what is it that gets pride or sorry gets embarrassment going. We see that embarrassing. It gets triggered when an individual violates some sort of social convention or norm. Again, they transgress. Um, what is known to be a social rule. They make a social fo pos. So this could be saying something that feels really stupid in front of a new colleague or boss.

Speaker 1:          11:29          It could be, you know, just tripping in front of other people. I always joke that I spill things a lot like this, you know, Star Trek Coffee Mug. So you can, you know, spill coffee on someone. You're doing something that's not, you know, within the normal bounds of social behavior. And so you feel embarrassed and the kind of behavior that you display is really intended to let others know that you know that you made a mistake, you know you the social pho par, but that the behavior suggest that you have the intention or desire to remedy that social transgression and ultimately repair your social relationships with others. So it's a way of saying, look, I know what I did was socially unacceptable. I'm really sorry I want to repair this with you. I want to remedy it. And not surprisingly, what happens when people show embarrassment displays is that they elicit forgiveness and others they become more likable.

Speaker 1:          12:21          As you can see here, it elicits laughter and others and actually makes people trust you more. So there's been some studies that have shown that people who are more prone to experiencing and displaying embarrassment or often rated as more likable and trustworthy by others because in a sense what you're doing is saying, I know that I made a mistake and I want to make things better. And that makes people feel like they can trust you and they like you, that when you do violate social norms, you're going to do something about it to correct it. So those are some of the kind of key features or characteristics of embarrassment. Now we'll turn to shame. So what is shame? It's a word that we use a lot in our daily lives will stand. I'm ashamed of what I did or you're ashamed of someone else. And it seems to be, as you see this quote here that shames and essential or core part of humankind's.

Speaker 1:          13:10          So it says here, men cannot live without shame. A sense of shame is the beginning of integrity. So is there something about shame that pushes us towards more sort of morally righteous or prosocial outcomes? Well, when we think about shame from a sort of aspect of science perspective, again, breaking it up by all this sitter behavior and consequence, we see the following. So things that tend to trigger shame are committing acts or being in certain situations that trigger you to sort of negatively evaluate yourself. Right? Sort of thinking that something might be wrong with you as a whole, as a person. So it's kind of a global evaluation of the self in a negative light. Um, some of the behaviors that are associated with shame, again, you don't see a characteristic shame display in the face. Again, what you see as a sense of a behavior that is intended to sort of make the person physically appear smaller.

Speaker 1:          14:07          So people hunched over in their posture and they'll even sort of pull away from the group and sort of go and retreat. So you can imagine someone sort of hunched up, you know, in a little ball in the corner. So it's a sense of making yourself invisible in the eyes of others and actually trying to find ways to make yourself look physically smaller. So then in many ways it's the complete opposite of pride where you're expanding your sense of self and you're looking to gain recognition from others. Shame is you're diminishing your sense of self physically trying to look smaller and you're retreating from the group. And the consequence here is interesting. So it seems that you're less likely to take any corrective action against what you think is negative about yourself, but instead you sort of withdraw and retreat. Um, so Shane doesn't really seem to have the kinds of pro social consequences that we sipped seen so far with both pride and embarrassment.

Speaker 1:          15:03          So with that, let's turn to our fourth self conscious emotion, which is guilt. Um, and I'm sure we can all think of in our daily lives times in which you've done something that we felt guilty about. Now, how is this different from feeling shame about something that we did? So let's walk through this really quickly. So guilt, um, we've all experienced this in our daily lives. We cannot think of something that made us feel guilty, but really what, what were the kind of key ingredients that made up that feeling of guilt? So here again, breaking it up by a solicitor behavior and consequence. What we see is that the kind of core characteristics of gilts are as follows. So what kind of triggers guilt? What kind of gets it going? Is this a negative evaluation of one's action? So again, here, you're not negatively evaluating the self as a whole.

Speaker 1:          15:52          What you're doing is evaluating some specific action you did. So for example, if you stole something, you might have the thought, I can't believe I store. Um, this then sets off a series of behaviors where you actually become very motivated to address or remedy the problems. So maybe looking for ways to return the item that you store or to find ways to apologize for having stolen the item as a consequence. Um, and you'll see this is really different from what we just talked about in the context of shame, is that guilt actually does motivate these kind of prosocial, uh, you know, good outcomes. So as you can see here, it's described as motivating good consequences such as trying to address the problem. So guilt is interesting because it's about an action or behavior and really gets the person mobilized to try to do something about it, to try to correct it, such as this woman who, you know, maybe he feels guilty because she ate something from the fridge that she wasn't supposed to do, or maybe with someone else's food.

Speaker 1:          16:54          She's going to be more motivated to maybe do something about that in the future. And so again, these are our four main self conscious emotions that we'll be talking about in the subsequent two modules where we go more in depth, kind of delve into more deeply the nature of pride and embarrassment followed by the really complex nature of shame and guilt and what ways they're similar and what ways they're actually quite distinct. And so with that was our introduction to the world of self conscious emotions. I want to conclude with our takeaway questions. So the takeaway questions for today, um, are as follows, the first and what you should make sure you understand here is what are the five distinct features of self conscious emotions that really make them unique and differentiate them from some of the more basic emotions that we discussed earlier. A second. What are the examples we just talked about a moment ago of the most for commonly discussed, uh, self conscious emotions in the literature. And then finally of these four motions that we discussed, can you name the solicitor behavior and associated consequence for each of these self conscious emotions.

Speaker 1:          18:09          And now we'll turn to our expert interview. Um, and here we'll be asking them to speak with us about their perspective on self conscious emotions. So here's our experts in emotion interview series for today. Um, today for the experts in emotion interview. We'll have the honor speaking with Doctor Jessica Tracy. Um, Dr Tracy is an associate professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada where she's also a Michael Smith Foundation for health research scholar and the Canadian Institute for Health Research new investigator. She received her phd from the University of California Davis in 2005. Doctor Tracy's research focuses on emotions and emotion expressions and in particular on the self conscious emotions of pride, shame, and guilt. She was the lead editor of the self conscious emotions edited handbook we saw earlier in class and is currently an associate editor at the journal emotion. Dr Tracy has published over 60 journal articles, book chapters and theoretical reviews in 2005. She won the James Mckean Katell dissertation award from the New York, New York Academy of Sciences. And in 2010 the international society for self and identity, early career award. And then later in 2011 at University of British Columbia Kill him research prize. Dr Tracy's research has been covered by numerous media outlets, including ABC's Good Morning America and prs, all things considered the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Boston Globe, the economist, the New Scientist, and scientific American among many others. So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Doctor Jessica Tracy.
