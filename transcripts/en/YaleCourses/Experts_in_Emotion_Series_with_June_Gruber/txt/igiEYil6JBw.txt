Speaker 1:          00:00          For our experts and emotion interview. We'll be speaking with Dr Ronald Dahl on emotion and sleep in adolescents. Dr Doll is a professor in the school of Public Health and the director of the Institute of Human Development at the University of California Berkeley. He obtained his MD and fellowship training in sleep and neuroendocrinology at the University of Pittsburgh and completed a pediatric residency at Duke University at the University of Pittsburgh. He led a program of clinical research at the interface of child psychiatry, pediatrics and psychology, focusing on the development of sleep and arousal as well as aspect regulation and their relevance to behavioral and emotional health in children and adolescents at UC Berkeley. His current work is now extending these lines of investigation to bridge from developmental, social and aspect of neuroscience to address a broader range of clinical, educational and social policy issues with a primary focus on adolescence. So I now turn to a very special experts in emotion, interviewed together with Dr Ronald Dahl. So welcome, Ron. Thanks for speaking with us today.

Speaker 2:          01:03          Thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:04          So I thought we could start with, uh, me asking you just a little bit about what first got you interested in emotion.

Speaker 2:          01:12          I've heard really longstanding and deep interest in, in emotion and affective dimensions of experience broadly. And I think even going back to my early training in pediatrics, the relevance of how feelings influence real behavior and decision making was just central. So I think so much of my experience and trying to target problems. And then the second thing is that early on in my research career I was focusing on emotion disorders. Uh, I'm depression anxiety and that raised a whole set of questions about emotions and how to think about them and emotion regulation and that interface nicely with the sleep and arousal regulation from a developmental perspective. So it's, it's sort of a long standing interest broadly and affective domains and the role of feelings in the development of young people and their social experiences.

Speaker 1:          01:55          Excellent. So I wanna now just ask you a few questions about your work in this domain. So, I mean your work is so exciting and you're widely known for this work you've done on the relationship between sleep and emotion, especially among adolescents. And I wonder if you could say just a little bit from your perspective about what do you think are the most exciting discoveries here?

Speaker 2:          02:16          There's really, there are a couple things I want to focus initially on this idea of by directional interactions and the evidence has been growing. I think we, there were a lot of hints for that early on just just from basic observational studies that emotional arousal can interfere with sleep and a variety of ways and emotional distress can interfere with sleep. And this idea that sleep is turning off vigilance. So anything that raises arousal vigilance can interact negatively with sleep. And then the fact that insufficient sleep or disturbed sleep interferes with aspects of emotion regulation sets up this framework for spirals, negative spirals of bi-directional interactions that fits, that spiraled down. The flip side of that is if could intervene strategically, particularly in key windows and development to scaffold each of these processes in positive ways. It could really alter the trajectory. And so to me those are the exciting questions to understand more deeply how these interactions occur. The, the, the not just mechanistically to understand but, but practically how does this play out in, in young people's lives, vulnerabilities and then how insufficient sleep or emotional disruptions can start these, these cycles of interaction in ways that can be spiraling down or then with intervention, a scaffolded to caught up in healthy ways.

Speaker 1:          03:38          So do you think that the spider actual relationship applies equivalently across both positively and negatively balanced emotion states? What's it?

Speaker 2:          03:46          So it's a good question and I think, um, I have a few compliments about that. I think first of all, I think it's an empirical question at the, at the current state of the science, I think there's strong evidence for negative spiraling components for both aspects of negative emotion and positive emotions that, that there's an increased vulnerability reward sensitivity. In fact, some of the work I've been doing with Matt Walker here, we're trying to pull that work down into adolescence. And we beginning to look at that. And I think that can set off the sort of risk taking excitement seeking dimension. And some of this is relevant to bipolar disorder, but I think that there's also very strong evidence for the four aspects of negative emotion and how insufficient sleep makes it more difficult to deal functionally with some aspect of negative emotion. But then I also have to say that my personal bias is that I don't like lumping emotions into these two categories as if positive, negative, right.

Speaker 2:          04:46          And I know even the people that do that understand the nuances, but increasingly I've been interested in the idea that the emotion specific differences in what emotions people like to feel or don't want to feel or behaviorally seem to amplify or avoid can be so different. And I think that even the, using the language of what are positive emotions and what our negative emotions can obfuscate some really important questions. And to come back to your, your initial question, I think we may be better off served in understanding how sleep and emotion specific regulatory processes interact. And it may be, there are similarities across any domain of emotional activation or arousal. There could be commonalities, but there also could be specific types of interactions, for example, with fear and vigilance or certain kinds of reward seeking that may not apply to other emotions even if they're broadly negative or positive. So I think these are really important questions empirically to, to get in and, and disentangle, uh, in, in, in more specific ways.

Speaker 1:          05:51          Right. And as you're saying, it's, it's complex, right? And there's so many open questions, right as to how the directional relationship works with different kinds of emotional experiences.

Speaker 2:          06:03          And it's an important framework for my, my approach to these questions is the idea of looking for windows, uh, windows, a brain development, windows of social and emotional development, where in these patterns of interactions may set up particular vulnerabilities for particular youth in particular environments. And I think that's another place where emotions specific or even positive emotion, negative emotion, specific interactions with sleep could be really important. You have patterns of learning and we've been interested, for example, in the onset of puberty as a time of fundamental shifts in both sleep and fundamental shifts, shifts in some aspects of emotion. Um, some of it positive emotion, reward seeking and sensation seeking, but also sensitivity to social threat and negative emotions and vigilance. And I think that that the emotional learning and the role of sleep in learning, um, including emotional learning could be just as important as whatever, what the short term effects are on these systems.

Speaker 1:          07:01          What do you think when you think about these developmental trajectory is, to what extent do you think is relationships bear similarities during adolescents as compared to middle or older adulthood?

Speaker 2:          07:12          So I think there are two frameworks within which I think about these things. I think in, in many ways there are, uh, continuity's and this sort of a deep theme of development that there are continuity and discontinuity is, I think in some ways there are similarities in how these systems work and how learning occurs and how regulatory systems interact in young children, school aged children, adolescents, adults. And I think that there's a lot of, um, value and understanding the commonalities. I think that in addition to that, just like any other measure of growth or development, there are what I call inflection points. And I think the important issue about inflection points in a trajectory is that there's a relatively larger impact of learning and experience. And so one or two or three bad experiences at a key window of time may have a bigger impact on the geometry.

Speaker 2:          08:03          And that's the kind of model, not that it's categorically different, but there are unique opportunities for positive early intervention and unique vulnerabilities that the same sort of hit or challenge or, or stress to the system. And especially if there are a few of them in a script, you know, relatively unstable or changing transition can have a bigger impact. And so rather than just talk about a broad group like teenagers, I think should understand developmental processes and, and some of the developmental process, these are social. Uh, when you graduated from high school and Start College or trade school, you get your first job. Uh, but some of them are biologic and puberty happens to be a biologic transition that is powerfully impacting a subset of these neural systems. And I think that sets up a potential imbalance because there's new change in sensitivity. Some of these neural systems but not others. And puberty has been happening earlier and in contemporary society. And the social challenges of, of young children in middle school, um, is, is increasingly complex. So I think there are opportunities to understand these inflection points even if there are similarities to what happens in older adults, middle age adults transitioned to old age, other inflection points. I think there are reasons to zoom in on the unique opportunities in these early witness to develop,

Speaker 1:          09:23          I mean, speaking of this early window of development and makes me think about, you know, this really novel neurodevelopmental model that you've proposed to try to understand emotion regulation in adolescence, this sort of peak time of discovery from a scientific perspective. And I've heard you speak about it as this time of all gas and no brakes. And I just wondered if you could say a little bit about what this expression can notes in terms of the unique role of emotion processes during this critical developmental phase.

Speaker 2:          09:50          So I'm actually glad you asked that that way because I want to, I think there's some nuances to the metaphor and the variations in the metaphor that are really important. And we actually just published a paper in nature reviews neuroscience, um, last year when we did a met analysis and revisited some aspects of this. So let me zoom in on this idea of the accelerator and the brake. I actually think that a better metaphor, the initial metaphor was starting the turbocharged engines without a skilled driver. Um, and then people, and then Larry Steinberg emphasize the, the, the, the gas and the brakes. But I think the, the, the metaphor has limitations. Yes, there is this capacity for acceleration, reward seeking sensation seeking that seems to kick in individual differences. Some kids still are shy and cautious when they hit puberty. But the tendency when gage novel, exciting, uh, ambiguous environment seems to increase at puberty and that can clearly overwhelmed the capacity to be driving carefully or putting the brakes on appropriately.

Speaker 2:          10:55          But I think we shouldn't overstate that metaphor because when adolescents are highly motivated to do a complex task, including a task that requires a lot of inhibitory control, cognitive control, tedious tasks like text messaging, they can, if they're motivated, they can recruit frontal cortex pretty effectively. And in fact, in some situations they may outperform adults. And so I think the very ability in the recruitment of these control systems and the degree to which they learn this quickly very so much on social context. And I think the metaphor is still relevant because the capacity for these excitement seeking systems to tip the balance and overwhelmed, you know, inhibitory control, the ability to put on the brakes or to steer carefully is relevant to understanding what can happen to really smart adolescents who can make good decisions. But I don't think we should imply they're incapable of the steering and brakes.

Speaker 2:          11:54          Part of the metaphor they can, it's just they're vulnerable to zooming in on the relevance of the social rewards and that tipping the balance. And I think that sleep deprivation or insufficient sleep can amplify that imbalance. Uh, the emotional or the effect of signals relative to the pausing, cautiously evaluating for a moment before acting is probably tipped a bit more. And I think that's part of the initial thing we were discussing about the synergy, the negative synergy or negative spiral. It's sleep deprivation on top of someone who's already a sensation seeking type of personality in an environment that's very excitement seeking and has a lot of risks and then add on to that staying up really late, getting up early preschool and being sleep deprived. Those can add up for risk factors that contribute to some of these impulsive sensation seeking dangerous activities.

Speaker 1:          12:52          So when, this is all really interesting and I liked the CAG out, you put that, it's not that they don't have the capacity for the breaks, it's just there's contextual factors and motivational factors that influence when and how they put on the brakes. Right? Yeah. It makes me wonder sort of what unique treatment implications might this have for adolescents and managing their emotions and you know, thinking about the intervening role asleep too in that process.

Speaker 2:          13:15          That's a great question. I, so I think I'm going to oversimplify some complex things to sort of zoom in on my intuitions in this area. I think one of the principles that's emerging is that having goals be socially salient to that individual. And again, it's the cart that the heart of and the art of motivational interviewing, um, as an approach a of where the techniques that, that are used with adolescence, uh, to, to really ground the motivation for change. It's something that's relevant and salient to that individual's own ambiguous feelings and, and, and, and, and what's salient. And having that be socially salient to adolescents, um, is a powerful way to activate these more natural motivations. Something that's abstract and cognitive that something could happen to you. You know, abstractly, theoretically in some future time is not as sanely and it doesn't get into the aspect of emotional domain and compete as effectively in the moment and the charged moment.

Speaker 2:          14:15          And so I think there are two themes to that. One is having young people do the thinking and planning early in the process, anticipating that they're going to get into a situation with more emotional charge and not easily be able to pause and think and reflect. Um, that's a, that's one part. And the second thing is to have the motivation to do that. Be linked to these emotionally salient, socially salient goals or, or, or fears or worries. I think those anchoring the change, the reason to change. So, so just telling someone to go to bed earlier so that they can get better grades or study more or uh, interact with less irritability within their relationships could be done in a way that taps salience for an individual adolescent. But it also can be done in a way that's like, okay, here's another adult giving me advice about what I should do. And when it's 11 o'clock at night and a friend is texting them about something exciting that's going on, it's just not going to compete. So I think grounding these in ways that are socially and affectively salient goals and then helping adolescents, you know, align their motive, their own individual motivations, uh, in those ways are, are important parts of, of intervention approaches.

Speaker 1:          15:32          Thank you so much. I mean, so the last question I wanted to ask you soak in a little bit about this is just trying to understand the role of these different emotional related systems and that sort of development or etiology of psychopathology among adolescents in particular. And I wonder from your perspective, what you might consider to be some of the most important developmental trajectories here whereby emotion might play an influence and onset of mood disorders like depression, some of the things you've studied in your own work.

Speaker 2:          16:01          So I'm going to, I'm going to dive into the line of question that I find most compelling right now. Sure. As relevant to what you asked in terms of the trajectory to affect disorders. But I think it's actually relevant to a broader set of health relevant issues in adolescence. And that is that I think affect of science generally and affective neuroscience generally, particularly as it's focused on adolescence and a and on these disorders has focused almost exclusively on emotions and emotion regulation. And I think the effect of dimension of motivation, it's relatively understudied. And what I mean by that is there's aspects of motivation that are, that are linked to goals and and cognitive processes. But a key part of motivation is the feeling of desire, the feeling of value, the fast automatic processing that something has salients and motivational learning in this aspect of domain is I think part of the window of unique opportunity in adolescence.

Speaker 2:          16:59          I think the brain expects new motivational learning to occur about what really is salient to your goals as an individual. You becoming an individual and a complex society and the feeling of what has meaning purpose, value, uh, connects to your passions. Um, these are key windows of learning that create fast, automatic prioritizations about motivate. Not that you make yourself do something you don't want to do, but falling in love with literature or dance or changing the world or, or a particular activity that becomes so strong, you don't make yourself do it. Someone would have to prevent you from doing it because you, you've in essence fallen in love with a particular kind of activity. And that's sort of the extreme end of this spectrum. But I think there's a dimension of motivational learning that I think extremely important. Depression is a bit of a paradox in many ways.

Speaker 2:          17:54          What happens with depression is a loss of certain kinds of motivation, especially this aspect of dimension. This, this pull towards social rewards and pointing engagement. They can make themselves do it, uh, to some degree, but it's not as naturally motivated. And I think this inflection points where some motivations can fiercely attached to very unhealthy things like drugs and alcohol risk taking, uh, sensation seeking, um, some can really disengage loose motivation as another inflection point. And then finally healthy versions of these passions, a mastery curve of channeling your, your goals and these feelings of motivation in ways that are really leading to productive engagement. And I'm over simplifying some very complex issues, but I think justice affect of neuroscience has brought a new way of thinking about emotions and emotion regulation. I think there's exciting opportunities to understand motivation and motivational learning and the role of feelings and motivations and particularly in this interval of adolescence.

Speaker 1:          18:55          I mean that's just really wonderful and really interesting and it makes me think, you know, you've illuminated a lot of complex issues in this field. Where do you see the future of this work headed? What are some of the most critical next steps? So

Speaker 2:          19:08          I'm going to, I'm going to focus a bit in my, in and these comments on process and having worked in this area for more years than I want to admit at this point. Um, I think the most important issue is creating teams of people, teams of researchers who can tackle the complexity, especially developmentally. These are really complicated issues. If you try to reduce emotion or motivation too narrowly to a laboratory task or an imaging study or controlled experiment or if you just sample in ways you can look in natural environments and really ecologically valid ways to do cross sectional studies versus Longitudinal to really understand the nuances of the social dimension, the affect dimension, uh, peer interactions and emotions really requires teams of people who can slice through the complexity with well the science studies sample appropriately in the diversity of things that can influence these issues.

Speaker 2:          20:06          Think about the context as you mentioned, how important context is for activating different kinds of emotions and motivations and follow them longitudinally to understand development trajectory. No one or two labs can do those things well and so I think one of the challenges in, especially for young people who are told they've got a super specialized in one area and become experts. Yeah, it's how to do team science, how to learn to be having pockets of expertise but engage in these interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary teams that I think are really going to tackle the next level of integration and work across these levels. Especially for things as complicated as emotion and motivation.

Speaker 1:          20:45          So related then, what kind advice would you give students who are just thinking about embarking in this field?

Speaker 2:          20:52          So it's hard to get, I mean I think it, it can be quite different for different kinds of students, but I think the idea of balancing that, that the Yin Yang of on one hand, zooming in and getting expertise and developing the specialization that's required to do science well. But I think other head balancing that with breadth and, and, and having co mentors or, or we're spending some time with interdisciplinary teams because I think increasingly the high impact socially and clinically relevant questions are going to require these teams. And if people spend all of the formative years and their development professionally, um, you know, doing individualized work, they're not going to develop the skills and ways of thinking to really integrate and do these, these collaborative that not everybody could do collaborative work and, and we still need the, the industry, the brilliant individual who really pushes knowledge forward in their niche. But I also think we need more young scientists who are going to do these cross disciplinary, um, approaches and integrate and really creative ways across these stickers

Speaker 1:          21:56          levels. Well, thank you so much for speaking today. It was really wonderful to hear your insights in this field and realize just how complex the issues are and how much do we need these interdisciplinary teams to move these important questions forward.

Speaker 2:          22:11          Well, thank you. I really enjoyed it and I look forward to hearing other people in the series comments, uh, on these really interesting issues and, and um, and it's an exciting, I think the other thing I wanna say, it's such an exciting time in this field. It's, there's so much new knowledge and opportunity, so the more young bright people we can get into the field thinking about these things and helping us understand them the better.

Speaker 1:          22:33          Right. So, thank you so much. So this concludes our experts in emotion interview with Doctor Ron Dahl from the University of California at Berkeley. Thanks again.
