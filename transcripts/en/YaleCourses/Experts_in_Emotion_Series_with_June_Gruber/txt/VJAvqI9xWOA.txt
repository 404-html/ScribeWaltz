Speaker 1:          00:00          So today for our experts in emotion interview series, we'll be speaking with Dr. Michael Norton on consumerism and emotion. So Dr. Norton is an associate professor of business administration and the marketing unit and a Marvin Bower fell at the Harvard business school. He holds a BA in psychology and English from Williams college and a phd in psychology from Princeton University. Prior to joining the Harvard Business School, Dr. Norton was a fellow at the MIT media lab and Mit Sloan School of management. He's the coauthor along with Elizabeth Dunn of the Book Happy Money. The signs of smarter spending. His work has been published in a number of leading academic journals, including science, the Journal of personality and social psychology, Psychological Science, and the Journal of consumer research. His work has also been covered in media outlets including the economist, the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post. Dr. Norton has also appeared on the national public radio and written op eds for the New York Times, Forbes and the Los Angeles Times.

Speaker 1:          00:58          His research has twice been featured in the New York Times magazine year in ideas issue in 2007 for his work on ambiguity promoting liking. And in 2009 on the counter if itself his the Ikea effect when Labor leads to lab was featured in Harvard Business Review's breakthrough ideas. In 2009 in 2010 he won the theoretical innovation prize from the Society of personality and social psychology. In 2011 he won the Sage Young Scholars Award from the foundation for social and personality psychology. And in 2012 he was selected for wired magazine's smart list as one of the 50 people who will change the world. So I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with Dr. Michael Norton on consumerism and emotion. Welcome Mike. Thanks for speaking with us today. So I'd like to begin by speaking with you about how you got started studying emotion. So could you tell us a little bit about what first got you interested in emotion?

Speaker 2:          01:54          Sure thing. So I was working at the time with my frequent collaborator Dan Ariely, and Dan is an Israeli Jew. And I am an Irish Catholic and we made a bet which was who was more miserable, uh, Catholics or Jews. And the way we decided to test it was to send some undergrads out to different places of worship all over Boston and get pre and post ratings of happiness before and after religious services. And we wanted to see the paper was going to be called any given Sunday. And the idea was if you had to pick one religion to go to on any given day, which one you should you go do to get happiest. So it really started as a, and I won't tell you the answer because it was controversial, but yeah, I would really started as a bet, which was if we think about daily things that we can do in our life, what are little things that we could do? So not like how do you get a better job or increase your salary, but literally if you've got an extra hour of time and you wanted to do something vaguely religious, what should you go and do? And then we started to look at also things like going to the gym and going to yoga. So what are the best little activities that you can do to improve your happiness? And that really was the interest along was the little things that you might be able to do rather than sometimes the big global things we often think about.

Speaker 1:          03:05          Wow, that's really interesting. And how long ago was that first project that you did?

Speaker 2:          03:10          We did that in probably 2003 or four or something like that. We've actually published a paper related to those data, which, which was about, uh, the fact that religion makes you really happy, which a lot of people have shown, but only if you believe a lot in your religion. So in fact, if you look at people who say that they're Catholic or say that they're a Muslim and then they don't believe that much in their religion, they're actually less happy than people who don't go to church at all or don't go to services at all. So it looks like there's a point at which it's better to be believe in nothing than to believe a little bit and whatever religion you belong to.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Thanks. That's really interesting. Um, what I'd like to ask you about now, it's just some questions about your current research. Um, so we've all heard the expression, you've heard it many times, I'm sure that money can't buy happiness. Um, but your recent research suggests that this is not entirely true. So in what ways can money actually make us feel happier?

Speaker 2:          04:07          Yeah, I think that this, uh, um, a lot of kind of religions have this phrase of, you know, money can't buy happiness and a lot of self help gurus have it as well. And I think the sentiment behind it is true, which is that, uh, money isn't the only thing that can buy you happiness or maybe even more of that. The key to happiness isn't just money. So if you think that the only thing you should do with all your time is get more money and that's what will make you really happy, you're probably wrong. But at the same time, that doesn't mean that the way that you use your money can't really impact your hat happiness a lot. So when Liz and I started this research, the idea was basically maybe money can buy you a little bit more happiness than it does right now.

Speaker 2:          04:45          And the reason it doesn't right now is it because we don't spend it well? And if you think about what we and I spend our money on, usually it's things like stuff for ourselves. So we buy a bigger TV and a nicer car and a bigger house and those things are all great and they're nice to have. But research shows they don't really make us that much happier, are just nice to have. And we thought, well, what are things we could get people to do with their money that are different than kind of buying stuff for themselves? And the original idea really was, well what if we just radically changed the focus of who you're spending on? So maybe if you stop spending on yourself all the time and being selfish, but spent a little money on somebody else for a change, that it might actually make you a lot happier. They'd get happier for sure because they're getting a present. But it might actually make you happy or a result of engaging in what we call pro social spending.

Speaker 1:          05:31          Very interesting. So you know, related to that, you know, your book with Liz Dunn, you know, it's talking about the science of smarter spending. So I wonder your thoughts on how can we balance both spending our money wisely but also trying to be happy as well. How do we balance those two things at once?

Speaker 2:          05:48          Yeah, it's, it's very hard actually. So I mean, one of the things that we don't do, not clearly in general with our money to save it, uh, so, uh, savings rates in are very, very low compared to other countries. It actually gone up a little bit since the 2008, 2009. It looks like they're going back down again now. Uh, and saving is good. Not just because it's why I've just financially and interest rates and all those sorts of things. But because if you save now, you're basically guaranteeing yourself some happiness later in life. So having no money when you're 65 and is not pleasant because you have to somehow when you retire. But again, those are kind of big longterm decisions that people make and those are really important to make. But would we want it to look at, are these everyday little behaviors that you could do right now? So literally, if you have an extra $5 today, what should you do with the $5 to make yourself happiest with that $5? And it's things like literally rather than buy yourself a coffee by somebody else, a coffee. Yeah, you don't get the caffeine and the optimum Starbucks thing for yourself, but giving it away to somebody else and we have data that that supports this will make you happier than spending that little amount of money on yourself.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Sounds like a great book. I'm looking forward to reading it myself. Happy money that signs a smarter spending. Um, what I thought might be fun to talk about in our last question is some of the work that you and I've been doing together, um, where are we find that sort of the greater abundance and variety of emotions that people experience shows that they're actually better off both mentally and physically. And I think this brings up the question, is it really better to have more emotions overall? Uh, even negative emotions? What are you thinking about this?

Speaker 2:          07:25          Yeah, definitely it comes to mind. So I think it's, it's pretty counterintuitive. I think even even for us, that, that having more negative emotions on any given day, you're feeling ashamed and sad and fearful and things like that, that could possibly be better for you. Hmm. Uh, but I think if you think about what the counterfactual universities, it makes a little bit more sense. So for example, imagine all day, every day you felt really happy, every minute of every day you felt happy, happy, happy, happy. I think, and we don't have the data for this cause no one really feels that way. I think you'd probably go crazy if you felt the same exact positive thing all the time. And if you didn't go crazy from feeling happy, happy, happy, happy, you might also just get used to feeling happy. And we know that things like adaptation happen over time, so happy is great, but we can get weirdly tired of happy and we can wish that we were something else other than happy.

Speaker 2:          08:15          And in those cases it might be great to feel proud instead of happy or another positive thing, but it might be the case then it's sometimes good even to feel scared or sad instead of happy just to disrupt the sameness of everyday life. And I just actually was reading some interesting research about um, people who have generalized anxiety disorder. And one of the issues is that, that um, the research was suggesting is that they, if they have, if they have depression and anxiety, they don't want to be depressed anymore. But the idea of doing anything different provoked so much anxiety that they'd rather stay depressed then take the risk of some change. That might be very anxiety provoking. And if you think about how that out with the diversity of your emotions, it might be better to feel, not just depressed all the time, but maybe scared, at least scared is different from feeling depressed and that might prompt you to have higher wellbeing.

Speaker 1:          09:06          That's so interesting because if, you know, this work is saying that a different variety of emotions is going to sort of open our mind to new kinds of experiences and actually be healthy for healthier for us. But at the same time, some of the people who need that the most like people suffering from generalized anxiety disorder having the hardest time doing it. That's right. Yeah. Interesting. So you know, this is this work on emotional, uh, diversity and variety. Do you think there's any way you can link it with the work on spending? So should we be trying to spend our money on very different kinds of emotional experiences to sort of buy different kinds of variety for ourselves in our emotional life?

Speaker 2:          09:42          I think so. I mean, I think if you look at at some of the research, uh, on, on how to spend your money to get happier. So Liz and I and our colleagues have done research on spending money on other people as a way to make yourself happier. And that's a thing that we don't often do. So if you think about what we do every day and how we feel every day, just the act of spending money on someone else is different. And that difference in that diversity might be enough. Tom Gilovich and leaf and Bowen and their colleagues have shown that spending money on experiences instead of stuff for yourself is also associated with more happiness. And again, you can think that buying different experiences, again, we'll increase the diversity of your emotions and that might be part of the reason why buying experiences makes you happy. So it could be part of the reason that spending your money differently makes you happier is simply because doing different things make you happier, which I think is what our research tends to suggest.

Speaker 1:          10:32          That's really interesting. So we should be spending our money on other people and spending it on different kinds of experiences.

Speaker 2:          10:38          All right. And ideally both at the same time actually. So experiences with other people is kind of a the perfect storm.

Speaker 1:          10:43          Excellent. Excellent. So I mean, you've done such interesting research on spending and happiness and emotional diversity. So if you think about the face of the future for emotion, what do you see in store? What do you see as the next steps on the horizon?

Speaker 2:          10:59          To me, I think one of the most important next steps and the reason that it unimportant next step is because it's very hard to do, is to look at how these interventions that that I and lots of other people have been coming up with to change your happiness in the moment might lead to sustained changes in your overall happiness. And we know from lots of research by Dan Gilbert and other people that in general we have this hedonic treadmill where once something good happens, but then we kind of get used to it and we end up a little bit closer to where we were when we started then we'd like to be. But thinking about how the kinds of interventions that um, behavioral scientists are coming up with can not only make you happier today or this week, but really change your happiness over time. And, and both in regular people, you know, just making you feel fine, but we could make you a little happier. But I think especially in clinical populations where you have, you know, severe depression, are there interventions that scientists have come up with that can change their wellbeing? Again, not just for a day or an hour a week, but really in the longer term.

Speaker 1:          12:01          That's great. And so when you think about the future and a big part of the future, our new students and people wanting to embark and new directions and emotion, if they came to you, Mike, and they said, what advice were you, what'd you have for us as we're thinking about, you know, embarking on this new, uh, you know, area of emotion, what should I do? What might you say to them?

Speaker 2:          12:23          That's a hard one. I think one of the key things for any academic, I still work on new things. And so, uh, which is terrible advice to someone and she was working on something new, but don't tell them what the new thing is. But I think if you think about the way emotion goes, you know, there are different researchers working on different aspects of emotion. And often the biggest impact research is people who take an entirely new approach to how emotion works in everyday life. You know, whether it's looking at different populations or coming up with new interventions, whatever those things might be, there's a tendency to kind of iterate and as you know and academia on, now that we know this one thing, let's really unpack it and that's very, very important for science because we need to understand what's going on in great detail.

Speaker 2:          13:08          But for a new researcher, which you're really trying to push for is what is a new area of emotion that we haven't studied and my sense is that there are a million things that we don't know about of all the great work that's been done by people in the field. There are a million things that we don't know. So just as one example, a graduate student of mine, the lean to nick and I started a project on the feeling of being talked about, which is I think, and if you think about how you would feel if two people went into a room and you knew they were talking about you and you had to sit there and wait until they came back. It's a weird aversive, unique feeling. I think it's probably a actually an important human emotion because gossip and reputation are so fundamental to how humans work, and we know, I'm not saying this is the most important emotion, but we know nothing about that feeling. It probably drives a lot of social behavior and other things. I think there's lots of emotions and people disagree on how to define what an emotion is, but there's lots of these really just street emotional experiences that are very fundamental to being human that we know very little about, and they're just waiting to be studied by somebody.

Speaker 1:          14:08          That's interesting. I guess we'll have to wonder what people are going to say about our interview today. You know, we're not watching. Well, thanks. It can be ugly. It can. It's a discrete emotion experience. Hmm. Well, thanks Mike for Speaking with us today. This concludes our expert and emotion interview with Dr. Michael Norton from Harvard University.
