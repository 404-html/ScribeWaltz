Speaker 1:          00:00          Today, uh, for our experts in emotion interview. We have the honor of speaking with doctors, Lita cosmetics and John to be together who will help us answer the question of whether and how emotions are products of our evolutionary history or our emotions evolutionarily evolved. So doctor cause and two B are well known for their work in pioneering the field of evolutionary psychology. They're both professors of psychology and anthropology at UC Santa Barbara where they co direct the center for evolutionary psychology. They began their collaboration 29 years ago at Harvard University, just undergraduates and have received since then numerous awards including the NIH director's pioneer award, the American Association for the Advancement of Science Prize for Behavioral Research, American psychological associations, early career award, um, the national science science foundations, presidential young investigator award and Guggenheim fellowships. So I now turn to a very special one of a kind duo experts and emotion interview together with Dr Lita caused NEIdeas and Dr John Tooby. So welcome Lita and John, thank you so much for speaking with us today. Thanks so much. Thanks for, I guess what I thought I would do, I'm with you, is first ask you each a bit about what first got you interested in studying emotion, um, and a leader if you want to go first.

Speaker 2:          01:23          Well we, we started together. I mean we were trying to, we were trying to figure out what it would be to have an evolutionary approach to psychology more generally. And you really can't have that without some approach to emotion. And we, we talked about it a lot and we were thinking that, um, there's a phenomenology of emotion, which is so real to all of us, right? But on the other hand, at some point if you think of the brain is a system, the processes of probation, there needs to be some sort of computational, some sort of information processing level description of what, what an emotion is. What we were thinking is that if you separate those questions, just like in envision, um, at first people dealt with the phenomenology of vision and what, you know is my experience of yellow, like your experience and be yellow or and so forth. But when people, and those are, those are important questions, but two, they start to really make progress when they start to get computational about it. And so we want it to think, well, what would it be to have a computational approach to emotion with the notion that at some point you'll understand the phenomenology but maybe maybe doing the computational part first would help.

Speaker 3:          02:32          So, uh, what I would say is that, yeah, the thing about evolutionary psychology, which is perhaps not widely appreciated, is that it's very theoretically principle that, uh, is this, uh, the, the other westerners psychological approach to a whole ocean.

Speaker 4:          02:48          Uh,

Speaker 3:          02:49          hello. Straight forwardly yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:51          Out of, uh, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:54          out of an analysis of how a brain, which is a, consist of a lot of different problems and solving mechanisms would, or evolutionary time confronted again and again, we, with even situations like fighting or having to form a meat shop or dealing with sexual infidelity or all these different situations, if the mind is full of different mechanisms, like your smart phone is full of ass. Okay. Each one of her function, uh, they won't all be turned on. Uh, always, uh, in all situations, right? Some situations where you are, uh, you know, there's a perimeter around more you have to turn off the vigilant system. You have to increased heart rate because you're going to have to flee if you identify which direction the present Cruz in it's on. So it's a what emotions are, are there modes of operation or a, an orchestration of all the different mechanisms turning some off, turning assignments in particular situations which are particularly well designed to deal with the challenges of keeping the situation.

Speaker 3:          03:59          Um, and so for example, if somebody is taking your stuff with beating you up, then uh, anger Russian system turns on you need to defend yourself. You need to, uh, uh, perhaps the cap, the other person. Um, and uh, so that's going to be very different than what you would do if you're dealing with your newborn and trying to make sure that it's going to be fat, right? So not just the physiology changes, that's just one set of mechanisms, but all sorts of other things. Uh, in terms of memory is almost every feature speecher of psychology. Your name will be tweaked, uh, into a mode which is the evolutionary longterm best. Yeah. Dealing with that kind of situation.

Speaker 1:          04:41          Thank you. So actually I wanted to ask you both a bit more about your research here. I mean, you're both well known for pioneering this evolutionary approach to understanding emotion. And you've already alluded a bit to some of the fundamental principles of this approach, but I wondered if you might just say a bit more and as well as how do we define what an emotion is according to an evolutionary approach that makes it unique from this perspective?

Speaker 2:          05:04          Well, we, we think of it as a, as a super word program that when it kicks in, they're happening situation detectors, parts of the system that say, am I in this particular situation? So for example,

Speaker 3:          05:17          is it a recurring thing, something that's happened, a lot of no particular local situation,

Speaker 2:          05:23          the threat by a Predator or somebody treating me badly or somebody has treated me much better than I ever expected and I'm, I'm grateful and how then do y? How then should I deal with that person? That's what when we buy, buy, buy situation, it should be trigger a whole set out a signal. Maybe part of that, maybe part of our conscious experience of emotion is the experience with that signal. I don't know. But that's one hypothesis. But to a lot of different mechanisms that are honing. So let's say let's take the simplest of um, it's dark, you're alone and there are creaking noises outside whether somebody is coming break into your house or not. Lots of things change. Your hearing becomes more acute. You notice sounds that you would never have noticed before. Inferential processes get turned on. So was that a random set of noises or was that, what steps do you remember?

Speaker 2:          06:25          Uh, you retreat from memory is all kinds of information that is relevant to figuring out whether you're under threat or not under threat and what to do. Um, you might have, uh, you know, um, it might change some of your learning settings. I'm learning mechanisms, lots of things that might be changed. So if you can think of it as a coordinated, a supportive program that coordinates a lot of sub programs in a way that's particularly efficient for solving that adaptive problem. But it doesn't have to be something as, as simple as the Predator situation. It can be, there are a lot of interest in social emotions, um, that can be, that have to be there to regulate the kind of complicated social interactions that we have, including cooperative ones, lots of times people focus and an evolutionary point of view on, on, um, negative emotions. Um, and those are certainly, those are very important. But once I gratitude and, and, um, you know, gratitude, compassion, uh, and so forth are as important in regulating cooperation, for example, as, as we would argue. Angerness. Um,

Speaker 1:          07:30          all right. So I was going to ask, you know, from your perspective, do you feel like this framework applies to particular class of emotions or you know, all emotions broadly? I mean, you're bringing up things as diverse as gratitude, anger and fear.

Speaker 3:          07:43          Yeah. So, um, yes, we think it applies to everything.

Speaker 3:          07:49          Is it realistic as possible? Uh, so if you start out as Darwin did, looking at emotion from the perspective of facial expressions, okay. Uh, that's, uh, that's a very good start. But that really limits you because whether or not an emotion will be paired with a facial expression, a depends upon over the evolutionary long term, whether it was big of broadcast your internal state or not. Okay. So we have a small number of facial expressions of emotion and we, I think there's a much larger number of emotions which are not designed to be broadcast and therefore didn't devolve this signal that tells you to tell everyone around you. I am in this particular state of mind. Okay.

Speaker 2:          08:35          So some of them, if they're maybe negative aspects to broadcasting them, other emotions, it may be the juiciest no utility to. So for example, wonder, um, it may be that certain emotions are there to help organize your adaptations, to calibrate them and organize them in certain ways. When you see something, um, certain kinds of events, uh, like a sunset or the stars, um, those may be part of what those may be is a system designed to calibrate mechanisms in your brain. It's a very unromantic but, uh, to calibrate mechanisms of vision and, and color perception and so forth on evolutionarily recurrent events, things that we're reliably present in the ancestral path. It could be used to sort of tune mechanisms, um, didn't get two of them in the face of a,

Speaker 3:          09:24          the noise of the world as a simple idea about this is that, uh, in broadcasting there are test patterns in the function of it. Test pattern is too, you already know what the signal should be, so then you can treat your equipment until you see the signal, you know, you should see, okay. And revolutionary time always been stars. Okay. And, uh, so, uh, the mind knows what they should look like and therefore if you don't have anything better or more important to do and you're a hunter gatherer or sort of sitting around at night, okay. Uh, it's kind of mildly rewarding to look up at the stars. Okay. And, uh, and then these things, an infinite optical distance allow the different revenue topic mass to be aligned and so on. So it's, so in general, the aesthetics should be things which help the brain organizes itself and to pay attention to, we'll hope to organize it. And it should be a mildly, mildly pleasant because you want to do it, but you don't, it shouldn't, you know, uh, you shouldn't ignore predators. You shouldn't be more the hunger crowds of your child for it. Okay. It should be just the right level when you have nothing better to do. Right.

Speaker 2:          10:38          So I mean, when you start thinking about it from an ad, a patient's perspective, not all emotions are going to be there for the same kind of class of problem. Some might be there for very, very different reason. And also some things that we don't think of as emotions might be. Well thought of as emotions. Like when you have, when you, uh, when you get a concussion in your, um, what's the word I'm looking for? Hold on when you're in a coma. Thank you. Okay, so this is works

Speaker 3:          11:05          she fair. When there were no or traumas. Right. Right.

Speaker 2:          11:10          Yeah. Licensing. Right.

Speaker 3:          11:12          So, so you shouldn't, because there might be internal injuries and moving around with aggravate them. You shouldn't be not moving at all. Okay. And you shouldn't be exerting energy. You're getting excited by other events that are happening. So the shuts down, it's a very organic homa is very organized. Okay. And we just think of it this bad ramifications of the remainder of people who, uh, unfortunately never leave the state because they're so damaged. Okay. Right. Right. But for most people in situation, so, so you're, you're, you know, basketball hits you in the head and you're knocked out. Okay. That's this system. Uh, and that's when I was talking earlier about, uh, starting with facial expressions of emotions, which is a great to start, but there's these other things which have nothing to do with, uh, signaling to others. And, uh, so there's a great class of emotions. He was Accenture to talk about addiction because you don't have a feeling, right. But, uh, either, so you don't have the expression to me, I have a feeling, but it's an, it's a mode of operation for the whole system.

Speaker 2:          12:11          It's, it's, you can think of it as a super order program. It's just down a lot of different programs so that all the energy can be put into your immune system and into prepare processes. So weirdly on this perspective of subordinate programs that are coordinating other ones, you could think about Komatsu with emotion, which is not nine Twitter, but uh, it's fascinating to think of it that way. Yeah. So how would you classify then those emotions that really do need some sort of external display, you know, to signal something to other people. And what would be those emotions that really don't require that? Are, you talked about wonder or what people call off this idea of a coma in it and it keeps them anchor. Um, we've been working, uh, with, with a lot of our collaborators like Erin Cell and they know Caesar on, yeah, Chin.

Speaker 2:          12:56          That anger is, I'm triggered by the perception of somebody. Somebody is putting much too little weight on your welfare more too. They're not taking your welfare into account to the extent that you think that they should be given the nature of your relationship. And that that should exactly trigger a whole bargaining and anger as a bargaining system where you're, that operates in both cooperative and, and, and aggressive sort of situations. But where you were, if it's a cooperator, you need to communicate to them that you don't like what they did, that it impose costs on you, that they impose costs on you for a very little benefit to themselves. No. And that, that's not okay. And you, your bargaining basically it activates all kinds of desires to argue with and can talk to the person to argue, to bargain for better treatment in the future.

Speaker 3:          13:46          So you have basically two ways to bargain and one way is to say along with the costs on me, okay, and then you pay attention to what I want. Or the other way is in a cooperative relationship. Uh, you know, it's, it's conceivable we haven't experienced ourselves, but sometimes husbands and wives fight. Okay.

Speaker 2:          14:05          Never, never

Speaker 3:          14:07          doesn't mean you're going to shoot each other ninth each other. It's that you're in a relationship. So what marketing power, uh, so harmony power in a nonprofit relationships is this ability to harm the person who can affect more harm, stronger and so on. They have more liver leverage. Okay. Uh, but in Walker relationships where you were coordinating your behavior to achieve a great mutual outcomes, okay. One, the bargaining power is the extent they can confer with Walt benefits. Okay. And so what the what and the anger, again, cooperative relationships. It's, it hasn't seen water as a thing except what you're doing is, you know what, when somebody's spouse also their base Chile and it's one that's the external signal, um, uh, or even beyond that, okay, but that's the external signal that from them broadcasting that they think you haven't put enough weight on their welfare and therefore they're going to down regulate the amount of weight they put on your role

Speaker 2:          15:07          or that there better be a good reason why they didn't do it. Hopefully it was for a very large benefit to the other person. If they weren't, if they were doing something that was harming you or not, taking your welfare can counsel that needs to be communicated. If it's not communicated, the whole point of that adaptation patient can't, the function cannot be fulfilled unless there's some sort of a bribe. And it may be also often what does it paints? Anger is information that we're, that's conveyed where you realize, oh, the person did not, it's not that they put two little weight on my welfare, it's that I misunderstood the situation. They didn't know they were putting a cost on me where they didn't do it on purpose or they did it for a very large benefit to themselves, not for something trivial. And then that, that just, it just sort of the ANC grows, it disappears

Speaker 3:          15:51          that one. But that's sort of the system we're putting weight on each other's welfare, that those being tied together. So,

Speaker 4:          15:59          hmm. MMM.

Speaker 3:          16:02          The wind that, uh, it's a, it's a delicate interplay and uh, so each essential, so, so anger, which seems like a hostel, bad thing. Uh, and, uh, you know, team has to be connected to violence, which would be hard bargaining. Okay. Uh, actually it's also essential to cooperation because people make mistakes. Information processing makes mistakes. There's always errors. Okay. And so, uh, it's, uh, necessary to communicate your volumes where things are happening that are not what you expected in Muladhara. Okay. And so then, then you then in fights, people are, it turns out there are, are all the gear and sell with this theory has looked at arguments and the arguments structure or things like,

Speaker 4:          16:51          uh, you know,

Speaker 3:          16:54          you hurt me a great deal. Uh, I didn't intend to or you don't have your stand, uh, I didn't realize that was important to you. Or alternatively, you don't understand the full importance to me of having to do this other thing. So it's always about the relative costs and benefits and knowledge states. And these are acronyms are hurt.

Speaker 2:          17:14          All right? You can think of it as there being a grammar to anger and had the grammar to it. And that people, when they're arguing and negotiating the, they use that grammar both in arguing with the person that they think harmed them and with a person responding to them.

Speaker 3:          17:30          The nature of these evolved mechanisms are their second name or their first nature to us rate. Uh, and uh, uh, so we're not necessarily aware of they're watching. Okay. So you can do this highly organized thing in a fight with your spouse and not know anything about the, your company. Okay. You feel it. It's guiding you in certain ways. It brings up certain concepts.

Speaker 2:          17:54          You remember all the times they didn't put, we don't and welfare in the past. You see, it's part of the pattern for the times. Like really, really helpful. That's great. Right. So I had a question for both of you to, which is, what are the questions right now that you're grappling with and most excited about in this domain of, you know, emotion and taking an evolutionary approach to studying it? Well, many of the things you've been talking about. Yes. But, uh, the more, a more general perspective, this whole idea of bringing the emotions into the cognitive sciences and, and trying to get serious about the computational architecture of, of emotions so that the top of emotions is as normal a part of the cognitive sciences as a study of memory or the study of attention is because I wa from our point of view, you can't pull these things apart. They're all intertwined. They're all that they're not only intertwined, but there is a computational account of emotion and you won't fully understand emotion without understanding that in the same way that you would not fully understand vision if you were only dealing with phenomenology and you were not dealing with the computations that allow people to recognize objects and know where they are. If you didn't know those compensations, you wouldn't really understand vision. Totally.

Speaker 3:          19:11          So to make that concrete, uh, we think there are certain things we follow internal regulatory variables like, okay, uh, I, I'm the weight. So implicitly my brain is calculating a, what's the word of this other person that they're putting on my welfare? When it's too low, then the brain triggers, which you going to the anger, uh, anger turns on it as a bargaining of ocean is designed to raise the other person's a walkup trade off towards you. Or if that doesn't happen to lower years towards standards, but you're not wasting resources on more energy on somebody who doesn't care about you. Okay. Uh, then there's, but at the same underlying variable welfare tradeoff ratio in yields, for example, that would be men, you didn't, you, uh, something you conduct yourself in a certain way towards somebody. It turns out that was really much worse for them than you expected.

Speaker 3:          20:07          And then you need to be calibrated, uh, how much weight you put on your welfare because you opening to level two level, uh, well grounded gratitude is where you find somebody else's but is putting on larger way done with your welfare than you've expected and anticipated. And therefore you need to reciprocate. Turn up your thumb tr your ballpark trade off print shows, no to just submit this new higher level of cooperation. And so and so the idea is to map these magnitudes and the mind in which we now we can do now and relate them to the logic of emotions that emotions often play its role and recalibrating your, what you're prepared to do or the other person where your response together person. And that's why, that's why we think there's this small app.

Speaker 3:          20:55          Phenomenology is there's a sort of rob casting, which she dealt the mechanisms to say, change your settings on, on this network of variables because you have new information about the way the world is. And it takes time to feel okay, so when your mother dies or something like that, people want to go away and be alone. And just, and so any utilitarian unit, Darwinian Utilitarian University, why engage in such spectacular? We done functional behavior. Our idea about offices and some calibration, uh, requires a lot of process and it takes time to all the ramifications of the fact that it, this person was a separate part of your life and now they're gone. Sure, sure. All the different ways in which that was reflected in your decisions at all, has to be rerated maybe down new support would you didn't have before. So you can feel lonely or anyway,

Speaker 1:          21:48          such, just the question then when you think about the future of emotion, right? And you have students coming up to you and asking you, so what's in store for the future and you know, what advice do you have for me? You know, if I'm thinking about embarking in this field, what do you typically tell them?

Speaker 5:          22:03          Okay.

Speaker 2:          22:03          I suggest to them that while they, they, if they use your intuitions as, as, uh, as some guide, but really try to take very seriously, uh, the kinds of thinking seriously about the kinds of adaptive problems our ancestors had to solve well in ancestral environments. Because if you really start to take those seriously, you realize that they're much more complicated than you would otherwise think. And it can lead you in new directions that nobody would think to look before. So that and, and also to actually try to get very specific about what that the architecture of those programs is going to be.

Speaker 1:          22:43          That's great advice. Same advice from your end.

Speaker 3:          22:49          Absolutely. I mean it's, as I say, it's very, you could make a surprising amount of sense of the chaos of human behavior if you take this engineering first principles approach it.

Speaker 5:          23:02          Mm.

Speaker 3:          23:04          What are recurring out adaptive problems and what would a assistant as well designed to deal with those. And then in the modern world we have often completely different problems. And so the behavior looks non functional or strange or why, why have that? And uh, but then you can, when you look at the logic, you could make sense that that organize it again around this engineer can spill it makes enormous sense. And then you can then explore questions of like, well then what? Like what can we, can we do a little bit of a better with the world if we understand actually, uh, principles of your driving

Speaker 2:          23:38          well and even questions like, are certain things that are considered disorders, are they really disorders? Are they the normal functioning of a, that evolved to do, to behave in certain ways, to, to create certain kinds of mental states. And there are questions like that about grief and about certain kinds of depression. There can be very destructive forms of all of these things. Um, but it's an, it's an interesting question. Are we seeing an extreme form of something that's really an evolved that a patient or are we seeing a disorder, uh, true, um, dysfunction of an adaptation. And that can be very helpful in thinking about, about whether and how to treat

Speaker 3:          24:16          with depression. For example. You could just see it as a malfunction, but it might be that it's a major recalibration will load so that you've lived your life in a certain way with certain expectations would need somewhere and then you get this big signal that's not happening and invested in a marriage or even best, you know, you've spent your life trying to get a in the academia and then you can't get a job. Uh, okay. So all the ways you organize your life on a daily basis in the intermediate values, your grain in storage to do certain things. You now have this powerful signal that those were a major seventh mistakes. Okay. And so maybe, uh, we have no evidence about this, but it's quite possible that interfering with, uh, the recalibration process by drugs or something you might come out better if you go through a, we used to have grief stage of doing this processing. Um, and uh, rather than to simply think it's unpleasant, we should arrest it. Of course. What I think the major or the major depression might be something else entirely aware of things that would have brought you out of bed to ancestrally don't happen. And I'm not saying depression is a bit necessary. I'm just saying you want to understand the logic of been things are doing or about functions.

Speaker 1:          25:33          Well, I just want to say thanks to both of you for making the time to speak today. It's been such a pleasure and honor to hear you both speak about some of these fundamental principles underlying where our emotions come from and what functions they serve for us. So I want to thank you both for speaking today. Our pleasure, and thanks for having us. So this concludes our experts in emotion interview with doctor [inaudible] and doctor John tooby from the University of California Santa Barbara. Thank you both so much. Again.
