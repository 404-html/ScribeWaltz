Speaker 1:          00:01          For experts in emotion interview. We have the honor of speaking with Dr Leah Summerville on emotion and adolescence. So doctor Somerville is an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard University. She received her phd from Dartmouth College where she examined how individual differences and anxiety influenced the physiological and neural processing of threatening and unpredictable information. She then completed her post doctoral training at the Sackler institute for Developmental Psychology, psycho biology, Athey Weill Cornell medical college currently work in the affect of neuroscience and development lab, which she directs is focused on unique relationships between brain development and everyday behavior as both are changing during the adolescent years, heavily influenced by her experiences working in the team crisis center. A longterm objective of her lab is to inform a potential linkage between adolescent specific emotional changes, brain functioning, and the tendency for psychiatric illness and sub optimal decisions to emerge during the second decade of life. She's also teaming up with Boston area middle schools and high schools to conduct outreach activities, focused on getting adolescents excited about science and most notably, Dr Somerville's first job was as a waitress in a greasy spoon diner. So with that, I now turn to our experts and emotion interview with doctor Leah Summerville. So welcome Leah. Thanks for speaking that. That's today.

Speaker 2:          01:24          Thank you. Thanks for having me.

Speaker 1:          01:26          What I wanted to start out with asking you about is a little about your journey into the world of emotion. So what first kind of sparked your attention and got you interested in this topic?

Speaker 2:          01:36          Sure. Um, well I got interested in emotion I think right at the beginning of my college years. Um, I thought that um, I would probably end up as a psych major even going into college. Um, but when I wanted to really gain was experienced working in laboratory settings. Um, so I ended up working in two different labs, um, early on in my college years, both of which approached the study of emotion in very different ways. So I worked in one lab that was looking at cognitive biases and clinical depression. So looking at, um, emotional sort of processes from a clinical perspective. And then on the other end I was working as well in a neuroscience lab that was trying to really pinpoint the role of a subcortical part of the brain, the Amygdala in sort of detecting and assigning relevance to cues in the environment. So these two research experiences, although they were really different, um, sort of had a common thread of emotion in them. And I think that it kind of hooked me. And then I went to, there was no turning back from there. So now you're hooked and stuck forever. I think so.

Speaker 1:          02:39          So I wanted to ask you a little bit about, since you've been hooked, kind of what you've been doing research wise, I'm cause you're doing some really exciting work. Um, so one of the questions I wanted to ask you about is, I mean, you've really conducted fascinating research using these tools of neuroscience to better understand the way that the brain develops and shapes our emotional experiences sort of from childhood into adulthood. And I'd love to hear your perspective on what you think some of the most interesting and exciting discoveries are here.

Speaker 2:          03:09          Sure. Um, I think the, the main discovery that I am very excited to have had a chance to work on is not necessarily my own, but when that's been sort of developing and changing over the last, let's say, decade, um, which is the idea that part of the reason why adolescents may behave in unique ways in terms of their emotional lives and experiences may in fact be due to the way that in part by two the way that the brain develops. So, um, typically adolescents are thought of as having a sort of unique profile of emotional experiences. So one could say that they're oriented toward rewards, which leads them to take risks. Um, people could consider them as moody or more volatile in their emotional reactions. And there is some data supporting this characterization. Um, however, people have used in classically used these characterizations as, as things some sort of negative and um, almost, you know, unfortunate things about adolescence.

Speaker 2:          04:08          Um, some people have characterized them as being in a state of temporary insanity or that they're unable to control themselves and seeing things along those lines. Um, however, in the last 10 years I brain imaging has allowed us to pinpoint that in fact, um, trajectories and ways in which the brain develops during the second decade of life may in fact lead adolescents to be more susceptible to the influence of emotion on their day to day behavior. And this, and this might change or reframe the way we can think about adolescence as a way from a sort of deficient period of the lifespan in toward thinking of this as a very normative and almost sort of mediated by developed by typical developmental trajectories of the brain.

Speaker 1:          04:52          So right, so you study this at this period of adolescence, which is such a unique and memorable time in everyone's life, but at the same hand on the same hand, like what you're saying is it's described as this period people say of like storm and stress, right? With all gas and no breaks, for example. And I mean from your perspective then, I mean it's an expert in really studying the emotional lives of adolescents in the sort of neural bases. Why have you found this group such a particularly interesting population to work with?

Speaker 2:          05:22          Yeah, that's a really interesting question because, um, as you know, I'm not a developmental psychologist. In other words, I didn't enter into psychology wanting to, um, you know, pick apart aspects of human development. Um, but I've gotten really, really interested in adolescents even in the last five years because they offered a really unique tool or really unique sort of lens to understand basic emotion. So what I mean by that is that adolescents really is a time where we see a lot of changes in the way that people experience emotion, um, both in their daily lives as well as things we invoke in the lab. Um, so adolescence is a period of life that is, it's sort of characterized by emotions that are, um, not, uh, that are similar sort of qualitatively to other periods of the lifespan, but they might be sort of dialed up in their extremity.

Speaker 2:          06:15          So the, um, adolescents tend to experience more frequent, both positive and negative emotions. And when they experienced them, they tend to experience them as sort of heightened as date of a, of extremity. And this is also a period of life where, um, there tends to be a common onset of psychopathology. So relative to childhood as well as adulthood. Um, mood and anxiety disorders in particular tend to emerge during adolescence, um, in their sort of initial onset. So, um, the way I think of adolescence is a really unique period of their lives and where we can track a couple of things. One is these common and typical changes in the way that emotions are experienced and then we can relate them to ways in which the brain may be behaving or functioning uniquely during this time of life. And so this can tell us both about sort of basic aspects that link emotional experiences to a brain functioning as well as sort of, um, give us a lens to really zoom in on this really particularly interesting period of life.

Speaker 1:          07:16          It's fascinating. And not only are you studying emotions, you know, in sort of healthy adolescents, but your work has also explored really important clinical implications. For one emotion goes awry with the focus on anxiety. And I wondered if you could just elaborate a bit on how your brain imaging work on anxiety can help us understand, you know, emotion more generally.

Speaker 2:          07:38          Sure. Um, yeah, this is you're referring to is work that I really got interested in doing graduate school. Um, and based on reading a great deal about, um, you know, the brain and neuro basis of emotion. One thing that I noticed was that most of the studies that study emotion in the lab tend to use him a procedure where emotions would be evoked using some sort of Q and the environment. And then we would measure sort of brief response to that cue. Um, but we know that in our everyday lives and in the real world, emotions don't necessarily play out over these very brief, uh, sort of reactive timescales. And so what we wanted to do, um, in this work was to try and provide new tools and new ways to try and understand how emotion might be maintained over time. And this would be sort of trying to understand how sustained emotion may be sort of held on to, if you will by circuitry of the brain.

Speaker 2:          08:30          And with this work we actually identified some interesting distinctions between the brain circuitry is that can sort of evoke in eScience significance to emotional cues, um, relative to those that actually remain persistently active, that could hold on to let's see, an anxious state for minutes at a time. And so, um, one of the things I think is cool about this work is that it might provide us new avenues to try and understand maintenance in the lab, which is not a simple thing to do, but it may have relevance to a number of different sort of clinical disorders that aren't particularly those that are marked by sort of hyper arousal that maintains over time or disorders of rumination where I'm worrying or other kinds of mood states might be maintained over time. And so we're hoping through, um, future studies and some current studies that I'm working on to apply these ideas to try and ask the question of whether these sustained emotion systems may in fact also have a prominent role in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders.

Speaker 1:          09:33          And do you think from this, I mean that's just such interesting work. Do you think there might be particular implications for understanding anxiety and adolescents that's unique or different from adults?

Speaker 2:          09:44          Yes. Um, I think so. So one of the interesting features of the emergence of anxiety disorders is that certain anxiety disorders based on epidemiological work, um, tend to emerge relatively early in the lifespan. And these are have sometimes been referred to as fear disorders. That is those that are marked by extreme reactions to some sort of environmental cue. Um, but disorders of the anxiety disorders that are more characterized by these sort of lengthy states of rumination or worry, um, tend to initially present themselves during the adolescent years. And so one thing we're testing right now is whether brained properties of brain development in the circuitries that I sort of mentioned earlier may in fact be distinct. And potentially sped up in path and in I'm anxious adolescents who tend to have this sort of worry like profile. And this is something that we are examining right now through some clinical studies with some collaborators that I have in New York. So stay tuned. Very exciting. I can't wait to hear.

Speaker 1:          10:47          So then, you know, as you're thinking about the work that you've been doing and what got you first hooked into the study of emotion, when you sort of like look forward into the future, where do you see the field headed?

Speaker 2:          11:00          I think that, um, even in the last 10 years, um, I'm trying to understand that sort of neural bases and underpinnings of our emotional experiences has really transformed. I mean, this is a field that's rapidly evolving and I think we're getting a better and better handle on some of these basic functional aspects of different circuitry in the brain that may mediate, um, emotional experiences and regulation of emotion. Um, I think what a lot of people are working towards now is to try and use that information to help inform, um, sources of risk as well as sources of resilience. For psychopathology. So to try to translate this, these basic findings into a more sort of clinically relevant way, clinically relevant contexts, which may in fact help us to, um, say something really important about the sources of, um, sources, variability, sources of risk and resilience I relevant to psychopathology.

Speaker 1:          11:58          And so when you talk then to students who are asking you not only where the face of the future headed, that, what advice would you have for them as they think about embarking into this field? What, what sorts of things do you say to them? What do you think are sort of important kernels of wisdom to take is as someone thinks about getting into this field and getting hooked?

Speaker 2:          12:18          Um, so I think that one important thing to consider is that being an active participant in working in research laboratories, I really provides insight into how emotion an emotion research works that you can't really get from a textbook or from a sitting in a classroom. And I, so I would encourage people who might think that they're interested in this field to really get their feet wet and try out a number of different experiences working in laboratory setting and potentially working in a broad array of them to really try and hone in on to the particular interest areas that you have. Um, the other thing I would mention is that, um, although we don't hear about it as much these days, um, some of the, the very classic and really fundamental things we understand about emotions have in fact been derived through the use of animal models. And I think that, um, as a student I was really encouraged to do a lot of reading on these very basic and fundamental findings that may diverge from sort of a human emotional experiences, but really provided the basis and foundation upon which the field of emotion has been able to build into the studying, you know, all the way up to human emotion in psychopathology.

Speaker 2:          13:35          So I would also encourage students to really go back in time and, um, and read and really make sense of some of these very fundamental findings that have shaped the field.

Speaker 1:          13:46          Great. Thank you so much for speaking with us today, Leah. It was great to talk to you.

Speaker 2:          13:50          Thank you. It was fine.

Speaker 1:          13:52          Thanks. And this concludes our experts and emotion interview with Doctor Leah Summerville from Harvard University.
