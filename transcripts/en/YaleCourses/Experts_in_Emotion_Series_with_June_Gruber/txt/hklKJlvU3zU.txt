Speaker 1:          00:00          We'll be speaking with Dr and [inaudible] professor of psychology at the University of California Berkeley and a member of the Institute for Personality and Social Research on schizophrenia and emotion. Dr. King received a BS in psychology from Ball State University and her MBA and phd in clinical psychology from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Dr [inaudible] research focuses on emotion and psych pathology with a specific interest in the emotional features of schizophrenia, assessing negative symptoms of schizophrenia and the linkage between cognition and emotion and schizophrenia. In addition, she also studies emotion healthy individuals with a focus on individual differences and expressive behavior, gender differences in emotion and linkages between cognition, personality, social context and emotion. Dr. Craig has received numerous awards including a young investigator award from the national lines for research on schizophrenia and depression, the Joseph Subin Memorial Fund Award and the Distinguished Teaching Award from UC Berkeley. She's currently president elect for the Society for research and psychopathology and has served as an associate editor for the Journal of abnormal psychology as well as cognition and emotion and a member of the editorial boards for Schizophrenia Bulletin.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Psychological Science and the public interest and applied and preventative psychology, emotion and Journal of research in personality. She's also the author or editor of three books and several scholarly papers in top journals in the field. So I now turn to our special experts in emotion interview with doctor and crane on schizophrenia and emotion. Com. And thanks for speaking with us today. Thanks for having me. So I wanted to ask you as a place to start sort of what your journey into the world of emotion was. So what first got you interested in the topic of emotion?

Speaker 2:          01:48          Well, when I was a graduate student I was looking around for some sort of research, uh, to land on and uh, it wasn't schizophrenia, but, uh, I had an advisor that was interested in schizophrenia and interested in some of the symptoms of schizophrenia, which to me sounded an awful lot like a problem, that emotion. So that led me, um, as a graduate student 20 years ago to really start reading about basic emotion research. And that's when I first got the idea to translate some of the research and basic emotion to the study of schizophrenia. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:22          So speaking of that, I'd love to now ask you some questions about your research on emotions, schizophrenia. And so, I mean, you've really pioneered this field and really advanced almost everything we know about the realm of emotion and schizophrenia. And one of the things that has been most interesting and sort of most illuminating was really, um, understanding the way in which emotion experience on the one hand, maybe intact and schizophrenia, whereas other domains, you know, like expressive behavior may be less intact. So you've described this as the disjunction between different components of emotional responding. And I was wondering if you could say a little bit more about how research has illuminated this potential disconnect between internal emotion experience on the one hand and external emotion behavior on the other, among individuals with schizophrenia. Well,

Speaker 2:          03:11          again, it started as a graduate to really where I was reading all this fascinating research in basic emotion in healthy people. And so I thought, well, why not use those same methods, uh, to understand what's happening in schizophrenia. Prior to doing that, I think people in the field of schizophrenia thought that, um, people without people with schizophrenia just had no emotion at all. They were just completely without emotion. And so what we did was we actually imported some laboratory paradigms to the study of schizophrenia and we took a close look at their outward expression, their experience, their physiology. And what we found was quite surprising. I think too many people who had studied schizophrenia for years, and that will cause that just as you said, that people with schizophrenia reported feeling things very, very strongly, just as strongly as healthy people did. They, uh, they, uh, felt very happy and amused.

Speaker 2:          04:05          Um, they felt very disgusted and scared and sad. But what distinguished people with schizophrenia from people without schizophrenia was almost a complete lack of outward expression. So we would show people I'm using film clips or uh, put a plate of tasty food in front of them or a show them some very disturbing pictures or ask them to tell sad stories about their lives. And no matter what we would do, people with schizophrenia would say they felt things very strongly. They felt very amused. They felt very pleasant. They felt very sad, but yet they would not show that on their face. They didn't cry, they didn't show a lot of smiles. Um, so this is the disconnect it with that. We observed that people with schizophrenia field things strongly, they just don't show it outwardly. And so they kind of simple a take home message from, from this line of work is that you, you don't want to judge a book by its cover. Just because someone would get to phrenia it doesn't show an outward expression of emotion. Doesn't mean that they don't feel it because chances are they feel things very strong.

Speaker 1:          05:07          And so how did this work at the time fit with previous conceptualizations of the emotional lives of individuals with schizophrenia?

Speaker 2:          05:15          Well as I said that, uh, before that I think that the typical, uh, view of people with schizophrenia was that their lives were emotional vacuums. They just had no feelings. They, they didn't show any feelings that a what a bleak existence. So I'm so I think people mistakenly assumed that because people with schizophrenia and weren't expressing emotion, they weren't laughing at funny joke. So they weren't looking scared or when a car came barreling down the street that they just had no emotion experience. But that was absolutely not the case. They just weren't showing it outwardly, but they were feeling it very strongly. Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:51          So you've also demonstrated another really interesting feature of the emotional experience in lives of people with, which is that they show these really unique patterns of emotional related difficulties that depend on sort of the timing or temporal frame of the emotion itself. And I wondered if you could say a bit more about your work that's really teased apart this distinction between the anticipation of emotion versus the more kind of online consumer Tory experience of emotion among people with schizophrenia.

Speaker 2:          06:20          Well that that blind of researcher rose from an interesting paradox we observed. So I'm, one of the symptoms of schizophrenia is called Anhedonia, which means, uh, a lack of interest or pleasure in things in life. Um, it's not specific to schizophrenia. People with depression also have this, but it's a pretty common symptom. As many as three quarters of people with schizophrenia have this symptom, uh, which would suggest that in the presence of something pleasurable, I'm a milkshake or a amusing heartwarming film clip. People with schizophrenia shouldn't enjoy it, but in fact they do. And that's what we demonstrated in our early studies that in the presence of pleasant things, people with schizophrenia enjoy it just the same as as you are. I would. So how then could they have the symptom of an Idonia? So that led us to think about, uh, what is the time course of an emotional response.

Speaker 2:          07:14          And so certainly, uh, when you present somebody with something or you have a tasty meal, you enjoy that, that we call that in the moment or consumer Tory pleasure. But there are other aspects of the timing of an emotional response. So, for example, just even thinking about what am I going to have for lunch today that might conjure up a representation or an image of what you might like to have for lunch and then, um, that would then make you anticipate that, boy, I'm really looking forward to having a, uh, a tasty salad for lunch. And so you might even have a kind of a mental image of that salad and you might really be looking forward to it and you might feel good now knowing that you're going to have a, a tasty salad for lunch and that anticipatory pleasure we call that will then motivate you to get up and leave and go get a that the tasty salad for lunch show up.

Speaker 2:          08:06          Um, uh, and then you have it and you enjoy it. So what we then begin to think about the problem that schizophrenia is not so much enjoying, they're tasty salad, but it comes in the looking forward to it or the anticipatory pleasure of that. And so we did a number of laboratory studies and we also did a study called an experience sampling study where we took a look at, uh, the emotions that people with schizophrenia experience in their daily lives in the context of the things that they do. And what we found was in fact that people with schizophrenia do have trouble in anticipating that things in the future, whether it's a tasty salad for lunch or going out to a movie with friends or visiting with family, they have trouble anticipating or predicting that that will be pleasurable. And that in turn interferes with their motivation, their behavior to go seek out those pleasurable things. But once they have those pleasurable things, whether they're having, um, a tasty lunch or watching a movie with friends, visiting with family, they'll enjoy it. But where they're going to have difficulty is anticipating that they will enjoy it and then seeking it out or going after those kinds of activities in life.

Speaker 1:          09:16          I mean, it's just so interesting. It reveals how complex the nature of emotion isn't schizophrenia. And so based on these really interesting and nuanced insights that we now have in the schizophrenia, thanks to your work, um, you know, it makes me wonder, you know, to what extent can we be translating these to interventions for individuals with schizophrenia, which I know is something you're actively doing in your own work now.

Speaker 2:          09:39          Well, we, we have to in these findings and tried to translate them both into assessments and into a interventions for people with schizophrenia. So, um, the most standard way of assessing, um, some of the problems that people with schizophrenia, my experience as a clinical interview. And so, uh, along with my colleagues, we've developed a new, uh, interview, uh, for the symptoms of schizophrenia that specifically targets anticipatory pleasure. Um, so that we're actually building that into our assessments now. Um, but we're also trying to work to develop some psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia because unfortunately, uh, the best we have to offer people with schizophrenia right now anyway in terms of treatment is medication and the medications don't really do a good job of helping with this anticipatory pleasure, a deficit or this problem and outward expression of emotion. So we've developed a couple of psychosocial treatments. One involves a type of meditation that focuses on emotion. Another is a skills based treatment that really tries to build people's skills and uh, looking forward to things in the future and savoring and hanging on to those emotional experiences, um, as an effort to try to make a dent in some of these problems. And anticipatory pleasure.

Speaker 1:          10:55          I mean, when you've also, I mean, another line of work related to all this is identifying important sources of gender variation and emotion among individuals with schizophrenia. And I wondered if you could just tell us a bit more about that too. Well,

Speaker 2:          11:09          in some of the early studies we did where we identified that people with schizophrenia work showing very many outward expressions of emotion, almost all those studies were done with men. So it left this big gaping question. Is that also the case for women with schizophrenia? Because we know in healthy people that in general, men tend to be less expressive than women. Women are more readily show all sorts of outward expressions. And so we wondered if our observations of this, um, diminish outward expression and emotion might be just a function of our having studied only men. So we didn't have worked to recruit, uh, samples of women with schizophrenia. And here what we find actually is the same thing that women with schizophrenia are also very much diminished in their outward expression of emotion compared to women without schizophrenia. So, uh, even though women in general tend to be more expressive than men, women was schizophrenia also tend not to show very many outward expressions of emotion, but also like Ben was schizophrenia, women with schizophrenia feel things very strongly, just the same as men. Was schizophrenia just the same as healthy men and women. Um, so, uh, what we've been able to see that despite the fact that women in general are more expressive than men, that doesn't seem to be the case with people with schizophrenia. Women who have schizophrenia are also not very outwardly expressive.

Speaker 1:          12:30          Hmm. So it seems that some of the common gender differences among men and women and turns of expressivity are slightly altered an impacted when a diagnosis of schizophrenia is at play. [inaudible] right. Great. So this is really interesting to hear about kind of what got you into emotion in the first place in all the discoveries you've done illuminating the nature of emotion and schizophrenia, how it's relevant for you know, intervention and treatment and what are some important sources of sort of gender variation, you know, in, in this emotional profile. And so I wonder as you think about sort of where you've come from and what you've done, sort of where things are going, um, in terms of where do you see the future of emotion research headed from here?

Speaker 2:          13:11          The big question, sorry. I think, uh, you know, it's a good question though. I think this is a super exciting time for emotion research because, um, I think, you know, for the first time in probably 30 years, there's some really exciting new theoretical models of emotion that are turning our, uh, kind of longstanding conceptualizations about what emotion is on his head. And those are exciting. I think paradigm shifting moments in the field of emotion. So, um, if the past 20 years of, um, newer imaging research has taught us anything, I think it's taught us that the brain doesn't really recognize our discrete categories of emotion that we use and lay life. Uh, but also that's really been at the forefront of emotion of research. Um, the idea that emotion, the emotion pie can be carved up into things like happiness and anger and fear. You know, the brain just doesn't respond that way really, um, to these different discrete categories and make common sense to us and that have guided our research.

Speaker 2:          14:16          What we know now is really that, uh, emotion, and this is a, I think one of the most exciting theories is that some of the work of Lisa Feldman Barrett showing us that emotion is a very similar to other sorts of psychological processes that we experienced in daily life. But yet, uh, what we've learned about emotion to our language and just the simple act of labeling can really influence how we feel. The label a term like happiness can really constrain, um, the way we perceive emotion in other people, the way that we ourselves feel. Um, and that is something that we've learned and constructed an imposed upon, uh, the feelings that we have in our bodies and make sense of a, as we navigate through the world. So I think probably in the next 10 years or more, um, uh, people are gonna look back on our kind of antiquated views of emotion and we'll have a whole new paradigm I think for thinking about emotion, which is exciting I think for the field.

Speaker 1:          15:15          And I think one of the things that's exciting for the field to is thinking about what the next generation of scholars and students are going to look like. And you know, as someone who learned emotion from you, um, you're my very first mentor, you know, into this field. That was emotion. My favorite question to ask you is sort of what advice do you have for students embarking on emotion? I know you've given me a lot of great advice that I now give to my own students. Um, and so I'd love to hear just the advice that you could share with a broader audience of what, what should students be focusing on or what are the most interesting puzzles they should try to approach?

Speaker 2:          15:52          Well, if people are interested in emotion, I don't know if this is the advice that I gave you, but it would be, I would say to study broadly and not just stay within the fields of emotion but read in philosophy and in a neuroscience and in economics of cause. We emotion is something that impacts a daily life across all fields and, and walks of life. Um, so to get kind of a broad conceptualization of emotion, get outside of a psychology and read broadly and study, uh, just to emotion as it unfolds in a daily life. I think that, um, we'll give people, um, who are interested in becoming scholars of emotion and a really nice perspective rather than a very, a narrow one that we all can sometimes get when we just stay within our, uh, individual fields boundaries.

Speaker 1:          16:44          Well, thank you so much and for speaking with us today.

Speaker 2:          16:47          You're welcome. Thanks for having me.

Speaker 1:          16:49          Well, it's a pleasure always. Um, so this concludes our experts in emotion interview with doctor and cream from the University of California Berkeley. Thanks again Ann.
