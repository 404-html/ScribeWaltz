Speaker 1:          00:00          Welcome back to human emotion. So when we think about emotions, we know that they're inherently social, they're a vital part of our social relationships, and they help bind us to other people. So to what extent when we think about emotions, are we really thinking about emotions in a social world and what is that social world like? And to what extent do our emotions play a pivotal role in shaping the social world that we live in? So these are some of the questions we'll be returning to today and our roadmap. We'll be looking at the question of emotions in a social world. This is our second part of this broad or a question of looking at emotions and social contexts. And we'll be having a very special guest lecture today with a renowned expert on this very topic. What we'll be doing today is first starting with a special guest lecture on social emotions. I'm very pleased today to have Dr. David Desteno, a professor of psychology at northeastern university who'll be speaking with us today about this very puzzling but incredibly exciting question of social emotions. So I'd like to welcome Dr. David Desteno today as our special guest lecture.

Speaker 2:          01:12          So when I talk about social emotions, I usually like to start talking a little, a little, a bit about the idea of character. Character after all refers to our morality, our reputation, basically how we navigate the social world. And what I would like to suggest is that our idea of character and primarily how emotions fit into it needs a little bit of updating. Now the term character, the origins of the term comes from a word that referred to the marks that were indelibly stamped in ancient Greek coins. Once they were stamped, they were fixed. Once you had your character, that was it. Um, the motif that we usually are familiar with is one of an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other. And as you grow up, if you learn to listen to the good voice, well everything will be wonderful. Your life will be great, you will be a virtuous person and all be right with the world.

Speaker 2:          02:06          There's just one problem with that though. And that's the data from everything that we know from the past 15 years of psychological science. It's that human morality, human social behavior just doesn't work that way. And so what I want to do is to suggest to you that character, morality, social behavior itself is a much more dynamic process. And a better metaphor really comes from thinking of it as a scale, a scale that's always in motion. And where that scale is at any one moment is going to determine what your social behavior is going to be. Now the correction I want to make is it doesn't really make sense to think about social behavior as the mind having good and evil mechanisms. Unless we're talking about psychopathology, it makes little sense to assume that the mind would trave truly evil mechanisms. What would they serve? Rather, what I want to argue is that the size of this scale, what determines our social behavior are two classes of mechanisms that are captured best buy a subs fable of the, of the grant and the grant of the ant and the grasshopper.

Speaker 2:          03:14          Um, and for those of you who don't remember it, let me tell you quickly, um, the story goes that the ads worked hard all summer and toilets so that for the long term it would have food while the grasshopper wiled away. It's days having a lot of fun and enjoying itself in the moment. And what I want to suggest to you is that a lot of human social life is really a battle between these two types of mechanisms in our mind. Now, one of the classic examples of this comes from work by Walter Michelle, what's in what's colloquially known as the marshmallow studies. And in many of you probably know this, but for those who don't, let me, let me tell you, I'm, Michelle did a, did a wonderful, uh, experiment where he would bring young children in the lab and we'd put a marshmallow down in front of them and he would say, I have to go do something.

Speaker 2:          03:59          If you don't eat that when I come back, you can have two, right? Classic Longterm, short term, short term trade off. And what you would see if you ever get a chance to watch these tapes I, these videos, I encourage you to do it because it's great. You'll see the kids, they'll peek through their hands at the marshmallow, they'll lick around the table and you can see them exerting a lot of effort. Um, some of them to not eat them. And some of them of course, gobbled them up. And what Michelle found is that the individuals who were able to wait to forestall immediate cravings to engage in self regulation longterm had wonderful outcomes. They had better social outcomes, they have better academic outcomes, they are viewed as more loyal, more intelligent, more trustworthy, et cetera. And this idea has given rise to the fact that we have two mines, right?

Speaker 2:          04:46          We have this older emotional mind that cares about, uh, donuts and sweets and sleep. And we have this newer rational mind, right? That cares about, uh, what's good and what's right in the world. And the way we come to think of that is that the way to be a good person socially is that if we can just tamp down those crave and emotional responses, that's where virtue comes from. That's where being a good, reliable partner in honest friend, someone who perseveres for the longterm, that's where it comes from. And sure it can come from that. But what I want to suggest to you is that it's wrong to assume that all emotions are craving and that all emotions are there to focus on immediate results and immediate desires in the short term. I want to suggest to you that I'm both the rational level and the emotional level.

Speaker 2:          05:36          This battle between short term and Mecca and longterm is being fought and social emotions are a special class of emotions that I think exist to push people toward favoring longterm outcomes. So the next few minutes, what I want to do is give you some examples of some central findings of of this and how we go about actually studying it. So let me start with a basic question, which is why do we cooperate? Right? Cooperation is fundamental to lots of human endeavor. But the problem with cooperation, if there was always a risk, right? If one person gets aid and then doesn't help the other person. So if, um, if, uh, June, uh, gives me money that I can borrow, if I don't pay June back, I've done really well for myself, but the problem is longterm June's probably not going to want to cooperate with me anymore. And so what makes me remember that I have to do my end, that I have to take costs.

Speaker 2:          06:31          It's also support the relationship because true social bonds only work when individuals can suppress short term desires and engage in behaviors that long term foster better social bonds. And so what I want to suggest to you is that one way we do this is a function of the emotion gratitude. So George has Emelda the sociologist is known for saying gratitude is the moral memory of mankind. It's what doesn't. Let me forget that I owe you something, even though in the moment I might want to get away with not paying you back. Um, Robert trevors who came up with the idea for reciprocal altruism, um, where we help other people because longterm they're going to help us back. That view's pretty well known. What's less well known is that Trevor's himself actually postulated that there would be discrete emotional states that would mediate these social behaviors. And so what I want to give you an example of is that gratitude can function as a distinct emotion that mediates social or economic reciprocity.

Speaker 2:          07:32          And I want to show you how it functions to push people to favor longterm gains over short ones and thereby build social capital. The problem of course is how do you study these things? If I ask somebody, are you going to be an honest person, a fair person, are you going to cooperate? Most people will say yes sometimes because they know they won't in they're lying. But more often because people are very poor predictors of knowing what they're going to do when hypothetical situation, w two hypothetical situations. So in real situations arise and when push comes to shove, that's what we can really see, what role emotions are going to have. And so in my experiment, what we typically do our stage events. So uh, in real time we can evoke these emotional states. So let me give you a quick example of how we do that.

Speaker 2:          08:19          Here we have always a, a real subject and a person who is a confederate that is a person who works for us, but who the other subjects believe is also a subject. We have them come in and we have them work on a task together. The only purpose of this is just so that they can get some experience working together and when we ask them later on the real subjects, what did you think of the other person? There's a context for doing it. They didn't engage in along an onerous task and the only thing you need to know about that is they really don't like doing it. And that's by design. At the end of this task, the computer is rigged so that it dies and the poor subject is sitting knowing, oh my goodness, all my work has now gone away and I'm going to have to do it again.

Speaker 2:          09:00          At that moment, the confederate comes over and says, oh, what happened? Oh, let me see if I can help you with that. And through a set of prearranged activities, she'll go about fixing the computer, at which point the computer comes back on. And the subjects are always very grateful for this because they don't want to Redo that very tedious task. And then we have them play this economic game together. And that's the economic game. The point of that is it really compares self-interest, short term self interest versus longterm communal interests. And our sense is that would gratitude should do is enhance your decisions toward longterm gains towards communal outcomes. And so the way the game works is each person is given four tokens. Each of my tokens is worth a dollar to me and worth $2 if I give it to the other person. And so the best outcomes that you can have realistically in terms of, um, uh, selfish gain is not to give anybody anything and to get them to give you all of theirs.

Speaker 2:          10:02          And then you'll have $12 and they'll have nothing. The best communal outcome is for each person to completely exchange everything and then they'll have $8 each. And so what you can see as long term, it's better for me to not cheat June and to exchange everything I have with her, but short term I can gain on my own if I don't give anything. And so what happens? Well, in these experiments what we have is a situation where um, individuals, their computer either breaks or it doesn't and they feel gratitude where they don't. And what you see here is that the amount of tokens they give, the more tokens you give, the more communal that you're being, the more fair you're being. When you feel gratitude, you actually give significantly more tokens. Then when you don't, now you might say, well that's interesting, but this person just helped me.

Speaker 2:          10:54          Maybe I'm doing it because I feel like I owe this person and that would be fair. So what we do is we also run the experiment where they now play the game with someone they've never met before. So yes, someone has just helped them, but now they're going to play the game with someone they've never met and to whom they don't know anything. And here again, simply feeling grateful encourages people to be more prosocial, to suppress their own desires for self interest and self profit in favor of larger communal gain. And if you look at actually how this plays out in terms of people's emotions, it's a pretty straightforward relationship. The more gratitude you feel, the more you actually give in a fairly linear fashion. Now we've done this again with other things that aren't monetarily based. We've done it with requests for help. And so in this case, uh, we have a situation where individuals feel gratitude and they are given the option to help a complete stranger.

Speaker 2:          11:56          So they leave our experiment after they're feeling grateful and they're walking down the hall and someone asks them for help. And you can see here this is the time spent helping. They will help an individual significantly more if they're feeling grateful. But the reason we know it's gratitude as if before they leave the lab, we say to them, hey, the other person in there, they helped you in your computer broke, right? And they'll say, yes, that person did help me. A, what we're doing is we're binding the feeling of gratitude toward that person. They can't miss a tribute to someone else. And then when someone else asks them for help, they don't help any more than they would if in fact they weren't feeling grateful at all. And that's how you know it's not a pay it forward. You know, it's not that I am, I'm helping this person because someone just helped me.

Speaker 2:          12:42          When we remind you that someone helped you and remind you who you should feel grateful toward, you don't help anybody else. But when you're just feeling grateful, you could miss a tribute to that to a new person and thereby help them as well. And so we know it's an emotion based effect. Let me give you one more example. This is compassion. Now, compassion is a really interesting thing to study because the world is full of more people who need help than we can possibly help, right? If we tried to feel compassion for everyone, it would be impossible and overwhelming. And so the question is out of all the people in the world who need help, how do we decide who it is most beneficial to help? Who is worthy of compassion? And what I want to suggest is the way we do this again is based on this trade off between long term and short term mechanisms.

Speaker 2:          13:32          And I'm going to show you how our emotions help us solve this problem. Short term, it makes no sense for me to help anybody. It's going to cost me money, time, effort, some type of resources to help someone. But long term if I help them then when I need help they're more likely to help me. And so the question is which way is the scale gonna go? Who among the people who need help are going to be the ones that I choose to help and what are the longterm is going to push me to do? How are they going to determine what compassion I feel and what I want to suggest. He was one way that we go about deciding whether or not we should help someone or whether or not we should feel compassionate toward them is by a simple analysis. And that is do we see ourselves in them?

Speaker 2:          14:24          And so I want to suggest that one way compassion works is it's based on a simple metric and that metric is similarity. The idea is the more similar someone is to me, the more compassion I will feel for them even though they're suffering the same objective. Uh, tragedy as is another individual. And what this suggests is that distress is really in the eye of the beholder. How much compassion I feel for someone isn't a function of befallen them. It's an a, it's a function of their links to me. Now, if I said to you on the battlefield in American soldier comes upon a wounded member of the Taliban and, and wounded American soldiers and they feel more compassion for the American soldier, that might not be surprising to you. Those groups were in a conflict for a long time, but what I want to suggest to you is that this bias is so deeply embedded in the mind that we can see it with the subtlest of cues and said, the cue I really want to look at stripping it down to bare bones is simple motor synchrony, right?

Speaker 2:          15:26          Moving in time together. If you move your body in time together, it's a marker of that. Now, the, for this moment to individuals or one they're purposes are joined, their goals are joined and those are the individuals who longterm are most likely going to help me. So how do we do this? We bring individuals into lab and we sit them down at a table across from each other and they put on earphones. They think they're in a music perception study and their goal is simple. Tap your hands to the tones you hear. The only difference is sometimes they tap their hands in unison. Sometimes the tones are random, so they're tapping and it completely asynchronous way. They don't talk, they don't do anything else. What happens next is you see the partner who you were tapping with, engage in another experiment that you're observing where uh, he or she is cheated by another subject and get stuck doing this onerous, tedious task.

Speaker 2:          16:32          And then simply what we do is we ask people, um, if they want to help this person or not. Now we don't ask them as experimenters because there might be pressure there at the end of the experiment that computer simply says to them, there's a lot of work to be done. If for some reason that you'd like to help somebody else, please find the experimenters and let them know. And what we found, I have to admit to you is rather astounding to me. The simple act of tapping your hands in time, make people feel more similar to each other. Now they couldn't tell us why they were more similar. They would create stories about why they were more similar. They didn't even talk to the person, but yet they felt more similar. And what that similarity did is it gave the longterm mechanisms of the mind greater power to increase the compassionate Rio in the field.

Speaker 2:          17:24          To make us help these individuals. Because out of the two, those individuals were more likely the ones who would benefit us in the longterm. And so here you can see the amount of compassion they felt was also influenced by whether they are not, they tap their hands and time. Remember in each case, the person is victimized in the same way and is cheated in exactly the same way, but how much compassion we feel for them is a function of how similar we feel to them. Moreover, if you look at the decisions to help, there's a really large difference, right? 17 out of 35 people decided to help an individual with whom they tap their hands in time. Only six out of 34 decided to do that in cases where there was less similarity. And if you look at the time they spent helping, it's even more dramatic, right?

Speaker 2:          18:11          If I felt similar to you, I helped you for much, much longer than I did. If I felt that you and I, we're not similar. Now, the interesting thing about this is if you look at how the, the variables are linked, um, yes, if I tap, if you tapped your hands in time with me, I felt more similar to you and I liked you more. But how much I liked you didn't predict how much compassion I felt for you. It didn't predict how much I helped you. Similarity did. And there's where you can see the trade off between short term and long term. And again, the more compassion I felt, the more effort I engaged in to help you, which longterm with cement those social bonds. And so what these data and findings like them suggest is that yes, human character, human morality is flexible, but it's not only the case that the way we solve these problems of longterm versus short term trade offs is to suppress our emotions.

Speaker 2:          19:14          Rather as if we cultivate these emotions, these social emotions, things like gratitude, things like compassion. They will push us to act a virtuous to cement social bonds, to act in ways that raise all boats as opposed to giving one person to asymmetric profit. And they will do so in a way that doesn't require willpower because willpower can fail. And what it suggests is that the way to navigate our social landscape most successfully is really, at least in terms of a psychological mechanisms, is to find the right balance between short term and longterm. It was Aristotle who said that virtue is to be found between the two vices, the vice, that's selfishness and the vice of selflessness. One can be too selfless, at least biologically speaking. And what our social emotions do are they help push us as a countervailing wait to selfishness to act in ways that builds social capital and cement our social bonds. And thank you for your attention.

Speaker 1:          20:16          Thank you Dr. David Desteno for just stay fabulous guest lecturer. That made us all think a bit more about what our social emotions and what role do they play in shaping us to be not too selfish but not too selfless either. So what I want to turn to now, our takeaway questions, and these are going to be some of the major take home points for you to ponder. After you heard our very special guest lecture today. So for today, our take home questions are as follows. So the first question says, what is the pro social function of gratitude? How can gratitude be experimentally induced and what are the associated behavioral tendencies? Second, what is the social function of compassion and how can compassion affect perceived similarity and helping? So some of the experimental data that Dr Desteno spoke about just recently. And then finally, this was sort of a interesting take home point that was talked about it both the beginning and end of his guest lecture.

Speaker 1:          21:18          To what extent do social emotions tell us something about our moral character and about the different vices that he talked about of trying to be both, you know, selfish but not too selfish and selfless but not too selfless. And so with that, I want to turn now to our expert interview. This is part of our experts in emotion interview series today for our experts and emotion interview. We have Dr. David Desteno. Um, he'll be speaking with us on emotions and social interaction. So Dr Desteno received his phd in psychology from Yale University and is currently a professor of psychology at northeastern university where he directs the social emotions lab at the broadest level. His lab examines the mechanisms of the mind that shape social behavior from hypocrisy to compassion, from pride to prejudiced, and from honesty to punishment. His work continuously reveals that human moral behavior is much more variable than most people would predict. Dr distended was a fellow of the association for Psychological Science and editor of the American Psychological Association sternal emotion. His work has been repeatedly funded by the National Science Foundation, and he has been regularly featured in the media, including the New York Times, Newsweek, CBS, Sunday morning and PR, and the Wall Street Journal. He's also the coauthor of the Wall Street Journal psychology bestseller out of character, and as written about his research for the New York Times and Boston Globe. So I now turn with excitement to our experts and emotion interview with Dr. David Desteno.
