Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. Where are we? Today we're going to study, I'm going to talk about Aristotle's, Aristotle's comparative politics and focusing on the idea of the regime. This is the theme that you remember in the opening day. Uh, I said was really the central concept or the leading thread of this, of this course, and it's in books three through six of Aristotle's politics that he develops. Uh, his, his idea of rich, of the regime and regime politics books book one that we spoke about last time really in a way tells us something about the, uh, you might say almost the metaphysics of Aristotle's politics today. Aristotle speaks more empirically, more politically about what a regime is.

Speaker 2:          01:03          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04          His idea of regime [inaudible] again, the same word, the same word that was used for the title of Plato's Republic is the centerpiece of Aristotle's politics. Literally, it occupies the, the theme of the third of the middle three books, books three through six. These books are difficult in many ways. They're complicated. They're not everybody's favorite part of the book, but they are my favorite part because it tells us more precisely than anywhere else. How Aristotle understands the nature of politics in that after all, it's what we are most interested in. A regime refers to both the formal in numeration of rights and duties within a community, but it also addresses something closer to what we would call the way of life or the culture of the people. There are distinctive customs, manners, laws, habits, moral dispositions and sentiments. And Aristotle's constitutional theorizing begins by asking a simple question, what is the identity of a city? What? What gives it its identity and enduring existence over time? And his answer is the regime. The regime is what gives a people in the city its identity.

Speaker 1:          02:35          Aristotle distinguishes between what he calls the matter and the form of the regime. Let me examine both of these. In turn, the matter, the substance, the material basis of the regimes concerns it's citizen body. That is to say the character of those who constitute a city. And here he reject a number of alternatives for what constitutes a citizen body. He rejects the idea that the city is defined simply by a group of people who inhabit a common territory, the same space as it were. The identity of a Paul as he writes, is not constituted by its walls at is to say it is not constituted by geography alone. And similarly, he rejects the idea that a regime can be understood as a defensive alliance against invasion by others. Uh, in our terms, for example, NATO would not be a regime, a purely military or defense of alliance. And finally, he denies the possibility that a regime exists, that whenever a number of people come together to establish commercial relations with one another, uh, organizations like Nafta or the WTO, the World Trade Organization, do not a regime make a regime cannot be understood simply as a, as a commercial, uh, alliance. What is a regime then? It is evident. Aristotle said, this is it. A city is not a partnership in a location or for the sake of not committing injustice against one another or for transacting business. So what is a citizen body?

Speaker 2:          04:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:30          The citizens who constitute a regime. He tells us do more than occupy a common space, but are held together according to Aristotle by bonds of common affection. It is affection, loyalty, and friendship that make up a regime. This sort of thing. He says this political partnership is the work of affection. Phi Leah is, his word is the work of affection for affection is the intentional choice of living together 1288 if anyone's interested. It is the intentional choice of living together. Friendship he writes is the greatest of good things for cities, for when people feel affection for each other, they are less likely to fall into conflict. But what kind of friendship is he talking about? Is it the kind of friendship that, uh, you feel for your best friend or for your parents or siblings? What kind of friendship are these bonds of affection that he says holds the city together and that make it a regime? Political friendships he tells us are not the kind of thing that us to forgo our own individual identities in the way that one might find in passionate relations of love.

Speaker 2:          06:08          Right?

Speaker 1:          06:10          We had did they presuppose relations that is to say political relations, not between lovers or even best friends of some kind, but between civic partners who may in fact be intensely rivalrous and competitive with one another for positions of political office and honor civic friendship, civic five Leah is there, in other words, not without a strong element of what might be thought of as sibling rivalry in which each citizen strives to outdo the others for the sake of this civic good. Many of you have siblings and know a little bit about what sibling rivalry is like siblings is, everyone knows maybe the best of friends, but this does not exclude strong elements of competition, rivalry and even conflict for the attention of the parents

Speaker 1:          07:08          and fellow citizens for Aristotle are like siblings each competing with one another for the esteem, the affection and the recognition of the city that serves for them as a kind of surrogate parent. That is the way that Aristotle understands a civic body, a citizen body, so that when he says that citizens are held together by Chi ties of common affection, he means something very specific. The civic bond is more than an aggregate of mirror self interest or rational calculation as was going to be defended by someone like Thomas Hobbes or by most of today's modern economists who believe that society can be understood simply as a series of rational transactions between buyers and sellers of different goods and that can be modeled along some kind of game theoretic lines. Aristotle denies this, explicitly denies this. He seems to have known something about the modern economic theory of society long before modern economics was even developed.

Speaker 1:          08:24          But again, when Aristotle speaks of the kinds of affection that hold a citizen body together, he does not mean anything like the bonds of personal intimacy that characterize private friendships. What he means when speaking about civic affection is more like the bonds of loyalty, camaraderie that hold together members of a team or a club. These are more than, again, ties of mutual. They require loyalty. Trust. What social scientists today sometimes call social capital. That successful societies requires social capital. A distinguished political scientist at another university. I will not mention its name here at another university, has spoken about the importance of social capital or trust as the sort of basic, uh, relation, the basic component of a, of a healthy democracy. Aristotle knew that he didn't, he didn't use a kind of ugly social scientific word like social capital. Rather, he spoke about civic friendship and Phi Leah, the political partnership, he says, must therefore be regarded as being for the sake of noble actions and not just for the sake of living together.

Speaker 1:          09:53          The city, as he likes to say, exists, the regime exists not merely for the sake of life, but for what he understands to be the good life, the life of friendship, that life of, again, competitive relations for positions of honor and office. So we can say that a regime is in the first instance constituted by its citizen, but it's citizen bodies. Citizens are those who share a common way of life, the citizen in an unqualified sense. Aristotle writes is defined by no other things so much as sharing in decision and office or as he puts it a little bit later. Whoever is entitled to participate in an office involved in deliberation or decision making is a citizen of the city. Listen to the words he uses there in describing the citizen. A citizen is one who takes sharing in decision in office who participates in deliberation and decision making as citizen is one.

Speaker 1:          11:01          Therefore who not only enjoys the protection of the law is not merely you might say a passive beneficiary of the protection of society and its laws, but is one who takes a share in shaping the laws and who participates in political rule and deliberation. Aristotle even notes, you probably observed that his definition of the citizen, he says it's most appropriate to citizens of democracy were in his famous formulation. Everyone knows how to rule and be ruled in turn. It is this reflection and the character of the citizen that leads him to wonder whether the good citizen in the good human being are one and the same. Can One, can a person be both as it were, a good man, a good person and a good citizen?

Speaker 1:          12:00          Famous discussion in Aristotle's book, Aristotle answer to this is perhaps deliberately obscure. The good citizen he tells us is still relative to the regime. That is to say the good citizen of a democracy, well not necessarily be the same person or the same kind of person is the good citizen of a monarchy or an aristocracy citizen virtue is relative or we might say regime relative only in the best regime. He says, well the good citizen and the good human being be the same, but what is the best regime, at least at this point he has not told us. The point he's trying to make is there are several kinds of regimes and therefore several kinds of citizenship appropriate to them. Each regime is constituted by it's matter. That is to say by its citizen body as we've been talking about, but also now by its form, by its formal structures.

Speaker 1:          13:06          That is to say every regime will also be a set of institutions and formal structures that give shape to it. Citizens regimes or constitutions, you might say our farms or formalities that the determine how power is shared and distributed amongst citizens. Every regime, uh, is an answer, uh, consciously or, or not to the oldest political question of all who governs who, who should govern. Every regime is an answer to that question because every regime sets forward a way of distributing formally distributing powers and distributing offices among its citizen body. So we move now from the matter of the regime. It's what constitutes its citizens and its citizen body to the question of the form of the regime. It's forms, it's formalities, its structures and institutions. You might say entirely too much of modern political science is focused on simply the forms and formalities of political life. Not Enough in my opinion, with questions of the citizen body and what makes, what constitutes the character or the virtue in Aristotle's term of its citizens. But nevertheless, Aristotle gives extraordinary importance and attention to the forms or formalities that make up a regime. What, what does he mean by that?

Speaker 1:          14:48          Aristotle defines this strictly formal criteria, other polity or twice in his politics. And I'm sure you noted both times where they appeared. Yes.

Speaker 2:          15:03          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:04          Book three chapters, six famous definition. The regime he says is an arrangement of a city and arrangement of a city with respect to its offices, particularly the one who has the authority over all matters for what has authority in the city is everywhere. The governing body and the governing body is the regime. The regime is an arrangement of a city. He says with respect to its offices in every city, we'll have a governing body. That governing body being the regime. The second definition appears at the beginning of book four chapter one for a regime he writes is an arrangement in cities connected with offices establishing the manner in which they have been distributed, what the authoritative element of the regime is and what the end of the partnership is. In each case a similar but slightly different definition of what constitutes the formal structure of regime politics, but from these two definitions

Speaker 1:          16:19          appearing in book three Chapter Six and book for Chapter One we learned a number of important things. First is to repeat a regime concerns the manner in which power is divided or distributed in a community. This is what Aristotle means when he uses the phrase in arrangement of a city with respect to its offices. In other words, every regime will be based on some kind of judgment of how power should be distributed to the one to the few or the many to use the Aristotelian categories of political rule or, or some mixture. Uh, some, some mixture of those three classes that constitute every city in every regime. One of these groups he says will be the dominant class will be the dominant body, the ruling body, as he says in that definition and that ruling body will intern. He says, define the nature of the regime. But Aristotle tells us something more than this. A regime, his regime topology is to say his division of power is division of regimes into the rule of the one, the few and the many is based not only on how powers are distributed,

Speaker 1:          17:47          that's purely factual base way. He also distinguishes between regimes that are well ordered, well governed and those that are corrupt. Uh, those that are well, those that are corrupt, what, what does he mean in terms of this distinction? Aristotle's distinction is now seems to be not only empirical, uh, again, based on the factual distribution of powers, it seems to have a non at what we, what we might call today a normative component to it. It makes a distinction or a judgement between the well ordered in the deviant regimes, the corrupt regimes. On the one side, he tells us the well ordered regimes are monarchy, aristocracy and what he calls polity rule of the one, the few and the many. And on the corrupt side he calls, he describes them. Is Tyranny, oligarchy and democracy also ruled by the one, the few and the many. But what criteria we want to know does he use to distinguish between these, uh, as it were six fold a classification of regimes.

Speaker 1:          18:55          How does he distinguish the well ordered regimes from the corrupt regimes? And here is where Aristotle's analysis gets in some ways maddeningly tricky, uh, because in many ways of his general reluctance to condemn any regime out of hand. If you were to read, uh, more than I had assigned for you in class, if you were to read throughout, through, through all of books, six, for example, you would find Aristotle not only giving advice to Democrats, uh, democracies and other regimes on how to preserve themselves. You would find a lengthy discussion description of how, of how tyrants should, uh, moderate or how tyrants learn to preserve and defend their own regime. It seems as if it seems almost as if living before the incarnation of pure evil in the 20th century with the rise of modern totalitarianisms, that Aristotle seems to think that no regime was so bad. No regime was so devoid of goodness that its preservation was not worth at least some effort. Think of that rather in many ways he provides reasoned arguments for the strengths and weaknesses of several different regime types. But consider, uh, the one that's closest to our own democracy, let's consider what Aristotle has to tell us about that regime.

Speaker 1:          20:43          In fact, it would be an interesting question for people to consider. Uh, do you know how would Aristotle, uh, confront or what would his analysis be of a regime like Hitler's Germany, uh, Stalin's Russia, the around of Khomeini, uh, regimes that, uh, are clearly tyrannies, but do they even go beyond in some way the tyrannies that Aristotle spoke about? And what kind of advice, what would he, what would he have to say about them in any way? Let's think about democracy. Interestingly, we find Aristotle defending democracy on the grounds that it may contain collectively greater wisdom then originally am ruled by the one or the fuel. In Book Three, Chapter 11, for example, he writes for, because they are many, that is to say the citizen body, the ruling body of a democracy, each can have a part of virtue and prudence and on their uniting together and under joining together, he says the multitude with its many feet and hands and having many centers becomes he writes like a single human being.

Speaker 1:          22:02          And so also with respect to character and mind, think of that the people in a democracy, he says, coming together, uniting together, become like a single human being with many hands and feet. And he says with greater character in mind, we even here more than any single individual. And in the same text we also hear Aristotle praising the practice of ostracism. That is to say exiling banishing goes individuals deemed to be preeminent in any particular virtue or quality. And he makes a similar point in book three, Chapter 15 and describing the process of democratic deliberation, uh, as a superior means of arriving at decisions. He compares it to a potluck dinner. Any one of them, he says that is to say any one of the citizens taken singly is perhaps inferior in comparison to the best, but the city is made up of many persons just as a feast to which many contribute.

Speaker 1:          23:10          It's finer is better than a single and simple one. And on this account, a crowd also judges many matters better than a single person. Furthermore, what is many he says is more incorruptible, like a greater amount of water? The many is more incorruptible than the fuel. So he gives, they're a powerful argument in defense of democracy, like a potluck dinner, each individual cook may not be as good as the best chef, but many taken together will provide many more dishes in many more. A variety of for a variety of tastes. Then does a single chef.

Speaker 1:          23:56          And he says, furthermore, a crowd, the many is more in incorruptible than the few, uh, less light, an incorruptible. Here I take it in a kind of ordinary sense of the term, less susceptible to bribery. You can't bribe a lot of people in the way that you can a single individualistic or Aristotle's views on democracy. Correct. Here in his analysis, uh, do in fact many chefs make for a better dinner than a single chef. Uh, well, no, no. Would you rather have dinner at the Union league and there's one chef or master chef? What would you hear there? Have dinner with a bunch of your friends each providing some piece of the dinner. Wow. It's a good arm. Gets an interesting argument. It's open to debate it at any rate. Yet at the same time is Aristotle is seen defending democracy and providing reasoned and in many ways, sensible arguments for democratic regimes. You find him in the same section of the book providing a defensive kingship. And the rule of the one

Speaker 1:          25:09          in book three, Chapter 16, he considers the case of the king who act in all things according to his own will. One's like a kind of absolute monarch of some kind. This is the part of Aristotle's politics. It seems closest in a way to the idea of a platonic philosopher, King King, who rules without law and rules for the good of all simply on the basis of his own superiority. Aristotle coins a term for this kind of king overall. He calls it the Pan Boster layer, Basa layer being the Greek word for king, uh, like the name. You know, people like the name Basel Bazell Basel. It's the Greek word for king and a pan meaning universal, uh, pan buster layer, the universal king. The King of our Aristotle does not rule out the possibility of such a person, uh, emerging a person of what he calls excessive virtue, almost hyperbolic excellence.

Speaker 1:          26:17          He says, who stands so far above the rest as to deserve to be the natural ruler overall. But how we want to know does Aristotle reconcile his account of the pound Bazza layer, the king of overall with his earlier emphasis upon democratic deliberation and shared rule, the citizen recall is one who takes turn ruling and being ruled. In turn, when readers look at Aristotle's account of kingship, and particularly this notion of the pond Basa layer, the king overall, the suggestion must at least occurred that there is a hidden Alexandrian or Macedonian streak to Aristotle's political thinking that owes more to his native mastodon than to as adopted Athens. The idea of universal kingship. Think of Alexander the great later on and in fact, in one of my favorite passages in the book, which you will read for next time, uh, I cannot resist quoting already a passage from book seven and near the end of the book, book seven Chapter Seven or Aristotle writes as follows, he writes to the nations in cold locations and Kolbe locations, particularly in Europe, are filled with spiritedness.

Speaker 1:          27:49          There's that platonic word again through most are filled with thumos but lacking in discursive thought, lacking in the deliberative element. In other words, hence they remain free because they're through modic, but they lack political governance. Those in Asia, on the other hand, he writes thinking, probably hear of Persia, Egypt, places like Egypt and Persia have souls endowed with discursive thought, but lack spiritedness lack thumos. Hence they remain ruled and enslaved. But then he goes on to say the stock of Greeks, Sharon both just as it holds, he says the middle in terms of location for itch. That is to say the Greeks are both spirited, are both through modic in endowed with deliberative thought and hence remain free and governs itself in the best manner. And he writes and he concludes at the same time is capable of ruling all should it obtain a single regime that these Greeks are capable of ruling all he says all who is all, what do you mean by the all here, the Greeks, the rest of the world, uh, should are, are capable of attaining it seems as single hegemony a single regime, uh, are if in fact circumstances, uh, develop.

Speaker 1:          29:20          So here is a passage in which Aristotle clearly seems to be pointing to the possibility of a kind of universal monarchy under Greek rule as at least as a, as a possibility. And this passage I read at length, uh, is important, uh, for a number of reasons. Let me just, uh, try to explain in the first place, it provides us with crucial information about Aristotle's thinking about the relations of impulse and reason of Thumos. And reason, as you might say, the determinants of human behavior are the crucial path term in that passage is this again, this platonic term spiritedness which is both a cause of the human desire to rule and at the same time a because of our desire to resist the domination of others, it is the unique stores of human assertiveness and aggressiveness as well as the source of resistance to the aggression of others.

Speaker 1:          30:34          It's a very important psychological concept and understanding politics. And second, the passage tells us something about certain additional factors extra in many ways, extra political factors such as climate and geography as components. Uh, in the development of political society. Apparently apparently qualities such as through most and reason through most and deliberation are not distributed equally and universally. He says he distinguishes between the peoples of the north, he calls them the Europeans, spirited and warlike but lacking through most those of Persia and Egypt containing highly developed forms of intellectual knowledge, no doubt, thinking about the development of things like science and mathematics and Egypt, but lacking this quality of most, which is so important for self government, for self rule. These are one might think about this. These, these things he says are at least in part determined by certain kinds of natural or g geographic and climatic, uh, qualities.

Speaker 1:          31:50          Uh, a modern reader of this passage that comes to mind is a skew in the spirit in his famous book, the spirit of the laws with its emphasis upon the way in which geography and climate and environment, uh, become impart determinants of the kind of political culture and political behavior exhibited by different peoples. And finally, this passage tells us that under the right circumstances, at least Aristotle suggests the Greeks could exercise a kind of universal rule if they chose. He does not rule out this possibility. Perhaps it testifies to his view that there are different kinds of regimes that may be appropriate to different kinds of situations to different situations. There is no one size fits all model of political life, but good regimes may come in a variety of forms. There seems to be at least built in to Aristotle's account of politics, a certain flexibility, a certain, uh, latitude of discretion that in some kit Kat passages even seems to border on a kind of relativism.

Speaker 1:          33:11          But nevertheless, Aristotle understands that a person, this pond Basilea this person of superlative virtue is not really to be expected. Politics is really a matter of dealing with less than best circumstances, which is perhaps one reason why Aristotle gives relatively little attention to the structure of the best regime. Such a regime which I do want to talk about tomorrow. Wednesday is something to be wished for but is not, uh, for practical purposes. Something to which he devotes a great deal of time. Most regimes, and for the most part we'll be very imperfect mixtures of the few and the many, the rich and the poor. Most regimes for the most part, most politics for the most part will be struggles between what he calls oligarchies and democracies ruled by the rich oligarchies ruled by the poor democracies. And that respect, Aristotle seems to add an economic or sociological category to the fundamentally political categories of few.

Speaker 1:          34:20          And many. The few are not simply defined quantitatively, but they are defined as it were also sociologically the rich, the poor again defined as the many again defined by him as the poor. It was not. You have to see when you read these passages, it was not Karl Marx, but rather it was Aristotle who first identified the importance of what we would call class struggle and politics. Every regime is in many ways a competition between classes, but where he differs from Mark's right where he differs is not is he believes that the fundamental form of competition between classes, it's not just for resources. It is not a struggle over who controls what Marx calls the means of production. It is a struggle over positions of honor, of status and position of positions of rule. Struggle is in short political struggle, not economic struggle. Every regime he believes it will be in some ways a site of Qantas station with completing, with competing claims to justice with the competing claims to political rule for who ought to rule.

Speaker 1:          35:43          There is, in other words, not only a partisanship between regimes, but partisanship within regimes where citizens are activated, different groups of citizens, different classes of citizens are activated by rivalrous and competing understandings of justice and the good, the Democratic faction he tells us believes because all are equal in some respects they should be equal. In all respects, the oligarchy tells us because people are unequal in some respects. They should be unequal in all respects. For Aristotle, the point and purpose of political science is to mediate the causes of faction to help causes affection that lead to revolution and civil war. Aristotle's statesman, Aristotle state craft is political. Science is a form of political mediation. How to bring peace to conflict ridden situations. And it's always surprising to me that many people think that Aristotle ignored or has no real theory of political conflict when it seems to me conflict is built in to the very structure of his understanding of a regime. And again, not just conflict between rival regimes, but conflict built into the nature of what we could call domestic politics, different classes contending with different conceptions of justice. And how can political, how can the political scientist to bring peace, bring, uh, bring moderation to these deeply conflict ridden situations.

Speaker 2:          37:27          Uh,

Speaker 1:          37:29          Aristotle proposes, how does he to pros to do this? He proposes a couple of remedies to offset the potentially warlike struggle between various factions. And the most important of these remedies is the rule of it.

Speaker 2:          37:45          Law Law

Speaker 1:          37:52          ensures he says the equal treatment of all citizens and prevent arbitrary rule at the hands of the one the few or the many law establishes what he says is a kind of impartiality for law. He says his impartiality one who asks the law to rule. You said it's in book three. Chapter 16 is held to be acting is held to be asking God and intellect alone to rule. Why one who asks, man asks the beast desire is a thing of this sort. And spiritedness. He writes again through most spiritedness perverts rulers and the best men and to law is intellect, appetite, even the best men he says can be perverted by spiritedness. Uh, law is the best hedge we have against the domination of partiality and desire. But this is not the end of the story. In fact, it is only the beginning. Aristotle raises the question, very important question, whether the rule of law is to be referred to the rule of the best, the best individual. And typically again, he, he seems to answer the question from to two different points of view. Giving each perspective it's, it's do, it's justice. He begins in many ways by appearing to defend Plato's view about the rule of the best individual. The best regime he says is not one based on written blah.

Speaker 2:          39:28          Okay

Speaker 1:          39:29          law. And there's a reason it seems to be something like this. Law is at best, a clumsy instrument, a clumsy, clumsy tool because law is only deal with general matters and cannot deal with particular concrete situations for their more law seems to bind the hands of the statesmen and legislators who always have to be responding to new and unforeseen circumstances. And yet at the same time, Aristotle makes the case for law the judgement of an individual, no matter how wise is more corruptible, whether due to passion or interest or simply the fallibility of human reason. Then as law, he notes as a practical matter, no one individual can oversee all things.

Speaker 2:          40:24          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          40:26          Only a third party in this case law, uh, is capable of judging adequately. Again, he seems to give reasons and good reasons for both cases. So he, but he moves to the question, should lobby changed his law changeable? And if so, how? And once again, he puts forward different arguments in book two, Chapter Eight, he compares law to other arts and sciences and suggest was sciences such as medicine and uh, his exhibited progress. This is true. This should be true for law. The antiquity of a law. A alone is no justification for its usage. Aristotle seems to reject a, you might say Burkey and conservatism, uh, long before the time antiquity or tradition alone is no justification. Yet. At the same time, he, he seems to recognize that changes in law, even when the result is improvement are dangerous. He writes it as a bad thing to habituate people to reckless disillusion of laws for the city will not be benefited as much from changing law is it will be harmed through being habituated to just obey the rulers. In other words, he's saying lawfulness like every other virtual is a habit. It's a habit of behavior and the habit of destroying, disobeying, even an unjust law will make people all together lawless.

Speaker 1:          42:02          This emphasis upon law is a constraint on human behavior in many ways. Seems to introduce a strong element of conventionalism in Aristotle's thought. Okay. This is the view that justice is determined by laws, by customs, traditions that are just conventions. No, most in the broadest sense of the term that constitutes justice. And as I indicated, there's also seems to be a certain degree of relativism associated with this. Since conventions vary from society to society to standards of justice will seem to v to again be regime dependent and this seems to be entirely consistent with parts of Aristotle's anthropology. After all, if we are political animals by nature, then the standards of justice must derive from politics are right. That's transcends. Society cannot be a right natural to man. Yet Aristotle's conception of our political nature seems to require standards of justice that are natural or right for us. Rule of law presupposes that there was a form of justice or right natural to us. But what is the Aristotelian Standard of natural, right or natural justice? Aristotle makes it surprising assertion. Uh, unfortunately it's an assertion and a book. You're not reading a book, the Nicomachean Ethics Book Five, Chapter Seven, he says there that all natural, right is mutable, are changeable.

Speaker 1:          43:52          All standards of natural justice are changeable. And by this he means that natural right is revealed not in general propositions or universal maxims is for example, Emmanuel. Kant would argue later on, but in the concrete decisions of a community or its leaders about what is a right or wrong, natural right is mutable because different circumstances will require different kinds of decisions.

Speaker 2:          44:21          Okay,

Speaker 1:          44:22          so does this mean then that for Aristotle, there are no universally valid standards of justice or right? Did it all depends on that justice like the good citizen is as it were, regime dependent. Is this not to fall into the boundless field of machiavellianism that declares right and wrong to be entirely relative to circumstance? Context dependent? Is that what Aristotle is saying? Not at all. Aristotle emphasizes the mutable character of natural right in part to preserve the latitude of freedom of action required by the Statesman. Every statesmen must confront new and sometimes extreme situations that require inventiveness and creative action and in such situations where the very survival of the community may be at stake, we might call these emergency situations. The conscientious statesmen must be able to respond appropriately.

Speaker 2:          45:28          Nine 11 for example,

Speaker 1:          45:32          a moral law that refused to allow the statesman to protect the community in times of crisis would not be a principle of natural, right? It would be a suicide note.

Speaker 2:          45:46          Okay?

Speaker 1:          45:47          To considerable degree, Aristotle, Aristotle, helion standards of natural right reside in the specific decisions, the concrete decisions of the ablest states. These cannot be determined in advance, but must be allowed to emerge in response to new and again, different in unforeseen situations. What does naturally right, what is it right? By nature in peacetime will not be the same. It is what is naturally right or right by nature in times of war,

Speaker 2:          46:20          okay?

Speaker 1:          46:21          What is right in normal situations will not be the same as what is right in states of emergency. The Statesman in the areas to telian sense is the one who seeks to return as quickly and efficiently as possible to the normal situation. And this is what distinguishes Aristotle from Machiavelli and all those later thinkers who take their bearings from Machiavelli. I'm thinking of thinkers like hubs like Carl Schmitt and Max Weber's in the 20th century. All of these thinkers take their bearings from the extreme situation, situations of civil war, of social collapse, of national crisis.

Speaker 1:          47:05          The Aristotelian statesmen will not be unduly affected by the occasional need to depart from the norm. Whether this means just to spend in the case and to take an American case. Uh, the suspension of Habeas Corpus is Abraham Lincoln did in the, uh, during the civil war or the regrettable need to engage in domestic espionage. But in any case, the Aristotelian statesmen goal will be the restoration of the conditions of constitutional government and rule of law as quickly and again as efficiently as possible. Uh, uh, net, uh, grim note, uh, I think, uh, I let you go and we will, uh, conclude Aristotle next time.
