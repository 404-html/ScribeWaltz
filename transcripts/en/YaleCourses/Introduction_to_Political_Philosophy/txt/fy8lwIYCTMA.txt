Speaker 1:          00:01          I was a, I was, I was, I've always been told that, uh, any serious introduction to political philosophy has to start with a big piece of Plato. All right? So we've, we've made some effort to do that. Uh, but now also we have to move on. So we moved to Plato's son is adopted son in a manner of speaking Aristotle. Uh, there's a story about the life of Aristotle. Uh, it goes something like this. Aristotle was born, he spent his life thinking and then he died. Uh, there's obviously more to his life than that. Uh, but to some degree, this captures some of the way in which Aristotle has been perceived over the centuries. That is to say the ultimate philosopher.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Aristotle was born in the year three 84, uh, 15 years after the trial of Socrates, who was born in the northern part of Greece in a city called Sta Guiro, which is part of what is now called Macedonia. It was called that then. And when he was about your age, when he was 17 or thereabouts, maybe slightly younger than many of you. Uh, he was sent by his father to do what you are doing. He was sent by his father to go to college. Uh, he was sent to Athens to study at the academy. The first university spoke about established by, by Plato. But unlike most of you, Aristotle did not spend four years at the platonic academy. He remained attached to it for the next 20, uh, until the death of Plato and after the death of Plato. Uh, perhaps because of the choice of successors to the academy, Aristotle left Athens, uh, first to re first for Asia minor and then to return to his home in Macedonia where he had been summoned by King Philip to establish a school for the children, uh, of the Macedonian ruling class. And it was here that Aristotle met and taught Phillip's son, right? Who, who was Phillips of Macedonia, his son Alexander. You all remember the recent movie of a year or two ago about Troy with Collin Farrel about Alexander who played Aristotle in that film. Do you remember Anthony Hopkins? Actual excellent. He was, he was a, was it Anthony Hopkins?

Speaker 1:          03:04          I have in my notes here. It was Christopher Palmer.

Speaker 2:          03:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:08          I have to check. I'll have to Google that when I go home, but maybe it may be a ride. Well, I think I have a feeling it wasn't Anthony Hopkins. You're right. Whoever it was an excellent, Aristotle didn't have a large enough part in the film. In any case, Aristotle returned to Athens later on in established a school of his own, uh, arrival to the Platonic Academy who did that? He called the lyceum and there is a story that near the end of his life, Aristotle was himself brought up on capital charges as with Socrates due to another wave of hostility to philosophy, but rather unlike Socrates rather than staying to drink the hemlock, Aristotle left Athens and Rome was reported to have said he did not wish to see the Athenians sin against philosophy for a second time. I'll go back to that story in a minute because I think it's very revealing about Aristotle, but in any way, this story helps to underscore some I think important differences between Plato and Aristotle. At one level you might say there is an important difference in style that you will see almost immediately unlike his intellectual godfathers, Socrates who wrote nothing but converse endlessly and unlike his own teacher, Plato who wrote imitations of this endless Socratic conversations. Aristotle wrote disciplined and thematic treatises on virtually every topic from biology to ethics to metaphysics to literary criticism and politics.

Speaker 1:          04:52          One can assume safely that Aristotle would have received tenure in any number of departments at Yale. Where is Socrates could not have applied to have been a teaching assistant

Speaker 1:          05:07          and these differences conceal others for Plato would same. The study of politics was always bound up with deeply philosophical and speculative questions, questions of metaphysics, questions of the structure of the cosmos, what is the soul? What is, what is, what is the soul about? Aristotle appears from the beginning to look more like what we would think of as a political scientist. He collected constitutions 158 of them all from throughout the ancient world and was the first to give some kind of conceptual rigor to the vocabulary of political life. Above all, Aristotle's works like the politics and the Nicomachean ethics were explicitly intended as works of political instruction, political education. They seem to be designed to to recruit philosophers and potential philosophers and to shape and educate citizens and future statesmen. His work seem less theoretical in a sense of constructing abstract models of political life. Then advice giving in the sense of serving as a sort of civic minded arbiter of public disputes. Unlike Socrates who famously in his image in book seven of the Republic compared political life to a cave and unlikely apology or Socrates tells his fellow citizens that their lives, because unexamined are not worth living. Aristotle takes seriously the dignity of the city and showed the way that philosophy might be useful to citizens and statement.

Speaker 1:          07:03          Yet for all of this, one might say there is still a profound enigma surrounding Aristotle's political works. To put it simply, one could simply ask, what were the politics of Aristotle's politics?

Speaker 1:          07:26          What were Aristotle's own political beliefs? Aristotle lived at the virtual cusp of the, uh, world of the autonomous city, state of the Greek Polis. Within his own lifetime. Aristotle would see Athens, Sparta, and the other great cities of Greece swallowed up by the Great Macedonian Empire to the north. What we think of as the golden age of Greece was, was virtually at an end, uh, during the lifetime of Aristotle. Other Greek thinkers of his time, notably a man named Demosthenes knees wrote a series of speeches called Philippics, uh, Anti Phillip, uh, to the north to warn his contemporaries about the dangers posed to Athens from, uh, the imperial ambitions, uh, of Mastodon. But Philips warnings came too late. Uh, and again, the autonomous Greek Polis, Plato and Glaucon at a, a mantis and others would have known came to an end. What did Aristotle think of these changes? What did he think was going on? He is silent.

Speaker 1:          08:49          Aristotle, extreme reluctance. His hesitance just to the issues of his time are perhaps the result of his foreignness to Athens. He was not an Athenian and therefore he lacked the protection of Athenian citizenship. At the same time you might think his reticence, his reluctance to speak in his own voice may have also been a response to the fate of Socrates and the politically endangered situation of philosophy. It for a man is notoriously secretive and reluctant is Aristotle. His works acquired over the centuries virtual canonical status. He became an authority really one could say the authority on virtually everything for Thomas Aquinas who wrote in the 13th century. Aristotle was referred to by Aquinas simply as the philosopher was no reason even to say his name. He was simply the philosopher and for uh, the Great Jewish medieval philosopher, Moses Maimonides. Aristotle was called by him, the master of those who know. Think of that, the master of those who know for centuries Aristotle's authority seem to go virtually unchallenged,

Speaker 2:          10:38          right? You with me? Yet

Speaker 1:          10:44          the authority of Aristotle obviously no longer has quite the power that it once did. The attack began. Not all that long ago really only is late as the 17th century in a man who we will re later this semester named Thomas Hobbs was one who led the pack, led the charge in the 46 chapter of Leviathan chapter, we will relator Hobbs road. I believe that scares anything can be more repugnant to government then much of what Aristotle has said in his politics, nor more ignorantly then a great part of his ethics.

Speaker 2:          11:30          Think of that.

Speaker 1:          11:32          Nothing more repugnant to government then what Hobbs wrote in his, I mean that Aristotle wrote in his politics naturally, all thinkers to some degree have read Aristotle through their own lenses. Aquinas read Aristotle is a defender of monarchy and Dante in his book, the Monarchia on monarchy. So Aristotle was giving credence to the idea of a universal monarchy under the leadership of a Christian Prince, but Hobbs, sorry, Aristotle, quite differently. For Hobbs, Aristotle taught the dangerous doctrine of Republican government that was seen to be practice, particularly during the Cromwellian period in England during the civil war. Aristotle's doctrine that man is a political animal. Hobbes believed could only result result in did result. In fact, in regicide the murder of kings, and there are certainly echoes of this reading of Aristotle as a teacher of participatory Republican government in the later writings of democratic thinkers from Tocqueville to Hannah Arent. Anyway, this return just to the enigma of Aristotle who was this strange and elusive man who's writing seem to have been enlisted boats for the support of monarchy and for republics, even for a universal monarchy and smaller participatory democratic kind of government. Who was this man and how to understand his writings? Well, the best place to start is of course with his views stated in the opening pages of the politics and the naturalness of the city.

Speaker 1:          13:28          His claim, that man is by nature of the political animal,

Speaker 2:          13:34          right?

Speaker 1:          13:35          It's his famous claim. What does that mean? We are the political animal.

Speaker 1:          13:48          Aristotle states his reasons succinctly, maybe to succinctly on the third page of the politics where he remarks that every city or every policy exists by nature and he goes on to infer from this. That man is what he calls the Zohan. Politik. Yeah, the political animal. The Polis animal and his reasoning here brief as it is, is worth following. Let me just quote him, that man, he's Tez is much more a political animal than any kind of B or herd. Animal is clear. Why is it clear for we assert, he says, nature does nothing in vain and man alone among the animals has speech

Speaker 1:          14:45          are other species he notes may have voice, may have and be able to distinguish pleasure and pain. Speech logos is, he is his word for it. Man has logos, reason or speech. Word can mean either. It's more than the ability simply to distinguish pleasure and pain he goes on, but logos he's writes serves to reveal the advantageous and the harmful and hence he writes the just and the unjust for it is peculiar to man is compared to other animals that he alone has a perception of good and bad, just and unjust and other things. In other words, he seems to be saying that it is speech or reason logos that is able to both distinguish and create certain moral categories, certain important moral categories that we live by. The advantageous, the harmful. The just and unjust in things of this sort that constitute as he says, a family and to Paula, but that's Aristotle in what sense?

Speaker 1:          15:56          We could ask ourselves, and I think you probably will be asking in your sections, in what sense is the city by nature and in what sense are we political animals by nature? Aristotle appears to give two different accounts in the opening pages of the book that you might pay attention to. In the literal opening. He gives what looks like a kind of natural history of the Polis. He seems there to be a kind of anthropologist writing us a natural history. The Polis is natural in the sense that it is grown out of smaller and lesser forms of Human Association. First comes the family, then an association of families in a tribe, then an associate, a further association in a village, and then you might say an association of villages that create a Polish or a city. The Polis is natural in the sense that it is an outgrowth, the most developed form of of Human Association in the way that one used to see in natural history museums.

Speaker 1:          17:09          These kind of a biological, you know, charts of human development from, you know, these uh, you know, lesser forms of a life all the way up to civilization in some way. But there is, and that is part of Aristotle's argument, but there was this a second sense for him and in some ways more important sense in which he says the Polis is by nature. It has natural, the city has natural in that it allows human beings to achieve and perfect what he calls there tell us that is to see their end, their purpose. We are political animals. He says because participation in the life of the city is necessary for the achievement of human excellence, for the achievement of our wellbeing. A person who is without a city, he says, who is our Polis without a city must either be a beast or a God that is to say below humanity or above it. Our political nature is our essential characteristic because only by participating in political life do we achieve, can we acquire the excellence's or the virtues as he says that our ma that make us what we are that fulfill our two loss or fulfill our our perfection.

Speaker 1:          18:37          So when Aristotle says that man is a political animal by nature, he is, he is doing more than simply asserting just a truism or just some, some platitude. I mean in many ways he is advancing a philosophic postulate of great scope and power. Although the full development of the thesis is only left deeply embedded, it doesn't fully develop it in this work or in insane isn't saying that man is political by nature. Note that he is not saying, although he has sometimes taken to be saying this, that he is not saying that there was some kind of biologically implanted desire or impulse that we have or share that leads us to engage in political life. That is to say we do not. He wants to say engage in politics to say it's natural for us to do so is not to say we engage in political life spontaneously and avidly as you might say, spiders, spin webs or ants build and hills.

Speaker 1:          19:51          He is not a kind of socio biologist of politics although he sometimes appears this way when he says that man is a political animal in some ways to the contrary he says, man is political because not because we have some biological impulse or instinct that drives us to participate in politics, but he says because we are possessed of the power of speech. It is speech that makes us political speech or reason in many ways far from determining our behavior in some kind of a, again in some kind of deterministic biological sense, speech or reason gives us a kind of freedom latitude in area of discretion in our behavior, not available to other species. It is a reason or speech, not instinct that makes us political, but then the question is for Aristotle, the question he poses for us is what is the connection between logos? The capacity for speech or rationality into politics, how are these two combined?

Speaker 2:          21:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:03          Why does one lead to or entailed the other? Uh, and in many ways he's not making a causal claim so much. He's not saying that it is because we are rational creatures possessed of the power of speech that causes us to engage in politics. He's saying more, he has more of an argument of the kind that one of the, this attribute of logos actually entails. Uh, political life logos. He makes this argument I think because logos entails to fundamentally human attributes. The power to know first the power to know. You could say the power to know is our ability to recognize by sight members of the same polis or city.

Speaker 1:          21:58          It is above all speech. That in a way ties us to others of our kind that we share, not just the capacity for language in a way a linguist a linguist might assert, but that we share a certain common moral language and it is this sharing of certain common conceptions of what the just and unjust that make a city. And it is that capacity to know. And to recognize others who share this language with us. That is the first sense in which logos entails politics but reason entails or logos entails more than uh, this capacity. It also entails for Aristotle, interestingly, the power of love.

Speaker 2:          22:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:48          We love those with whom we are most intimately related and who are most immediately present and invisible to us. In many ways, Aristotle believes our social and political nature is not the result of calculation as we will see in Hobbes, Locke and other social contract theorists, but such things as love, affection, friendship and sympathy or the grounds of political life and are rooted in our logos. It his speech or his speech that allows a sharing in these qualities that make us fully human.

Speaker 2:          23:32          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          23:33          but to say, of course that man is political by nature is not just to say that we become fully human by participating with others in a city. It means more than this. The form of association that leads to our perfection is net is necessarily something particular Ristick. The city is always a particular city. It is always this or that particular city. The Polis is Aristotle as well as Plato clearly understand is a small society what could be called today a closed society, a society that leads to our perfection that leads us to complete and perfect our t loss must be held together by bonds of trust, right? A friendship of Camaraderie as society based simply on the mutual calculation of interests could not be a real political society for Aristotle. We cannot trust our people. Aristotle seems to say trust can only be extended to a fairly small circle of friends and fellow citizens.

Speaker 1:          24:54          Only a small city, small enough to begin to be governed by relations of trust can be political in Aristotle's sense of the term, the alternative to the city. The empire can only be ruled despotically. There can be no relations of trust in a large imperial despotism. So what follows in one sense that what Aristotle says that man is by nature a political animal and the city is by nature. The city can never be a universal state. It can never be something that incorporates all of humankind. It can never be a kind of cosmopolitans, a world state or even a League of states or nations. Uh, the universal state, uh, will never allow for or does not allow for the kind of self perfection that is small, self-governing Polis. We'll have the city is Aristotle understands, will always exist in a world with others, cities or other states based on different principles that might be hostile to one's own. That is to say not even the best city on areas Aristotle's account can afford to be without a foreign policy, a good citizen of a democracy will not be the good citizen of another kind of regime. Partisanship and loyalty to one's own way of life are required by a healthy city. To put the argument in terms that Paula Marcus from Plato's republic would have known, friend and enemy are this natural and ineradicable categories of political life.

Speaker 1:          26:44          Just as we cannot be friends with our persons. So the city cannot be friends with or other cities or the state with all other states, war and the virtues necessary for war are, is natural to the city is are the virtues of friendship. Trust and camaraderie. There are also a necessary,

Speaker 2:          27:10          yeah,

Speaker 1:          27:11          note that in the opening pages of the book. Okay. Aristotle doesn't say anything yet about what kind of city or regime is best. All he tells us is that we are the Polis animal by nature and that to achieve our ends it will be necessary to live in a polos. But what kind of Polis, how should it be governed by the one, the few, the many or some combination of these three categories. At this point we know only the most general features of what a policy is. It must be small enough to be governed by a common language of justice. It is not enough merely to speak the same words, but in a sense citizens must have certain common experiences, certain common memory and experience that shape a city and the people, the large polyglot, multi ethnic communities of today would not be for an Aristotle's account, allow for sufficient mutual trust and friendship to count as a healthy political community. So Aristotle seems to be offering, in some respects, a kind of criticism of the kind of states with which we are our most familiar. Think. Think about that. When you have your sections or when you talk about this text with your friends, what is Aristotle saying about us?

Speaker 1:          28:47          The citizens of such a city can only reach their t Lois to perfection through participating in the offices in the ruling offices of a city, and again, a large cosmopolitan state may allow each individual the freedom to live as he or she likes. But this is not the freedom. This is not freedom as Aristotle understands it. Freedom only comes to the exercise of political responsibility, which means responsibility for and oversight of one's fellow citizens and the common good. It follows for him that freedom does not mean living as we like, but freedom is informed by a certain sense of restraint in awareness that not all things are permitted, that the good society will be one that promotes a sense of moderation, restraint and self control. Self governance is Eddie. Amanda says that are inseparable from the experience of freedom.

Speaker 1:          29:58          So in many ways, Aristotle, their offers as does Plato, a certain kind of critique of the modern or even the ancient democratic theory of freedom, which is living, living as one bikes. So you can see these opening pages of the book dense, uh, argument. Being condensed in a very deep ways. Carry a great deal of freight is a lot in there. Uh, that needs to be unpacked. And I've only tried to do a little of that, a little of that here with you today to go over sort of what Aristotle, uh, is suggesting in this idea of man, the Polis animal. But whatever we may think about this view, whether we like it or don't like it or whatever your view might be, we must also confront another famous, more like infamous doctrine. It is also very much a part of book one. I refer to his arguments for the naturalness of slavery. Aristotle tells us that slavery is natural. The naturalness of slavery is said to follow from the belief that inequality, inequality is the basic rule between human beings. Aristotle and Thomas Jefferson seem to disagree over the basic fact of human experience, whether it's a quality or inequality,

Speaker 1:          31:45          if this is true, Aristotle's politics seems to be, seems to stand condemned. Is the most anti democratic book ever written?

Speaker 2:          31:55          Is that true?

Speaker 1:          31:57          Aristotle's claim about naturalness seems to require, as he told us, slavery the category you'll distinction of humanity into masters and slaves. How to understand that. Again, Aristotle's argument is deeply compact and will be easily misunderstood if you only read it once. It will just as likely be misunderstood if you read it three, four, five or 10 times. If you are not attentive

Speaker 2:          32:31          to what he's saying, miss learning to be closely. What was Aristotle saying

Speaker 1:          32:42          in the first place? It's important that we avoid, I think two equally, uh, unhelpful ways of responding to this.

Speaker 1:          32:55          The first which one finds among many modern day commentator as many kind of neo Eris to [inaudible] we might call them. It's just simply avert our eyes from the harsh, uh, unappealing aspects of Aristotle's thought and proceed as if he never actually said or meant such things. We need to avoid the temptation in many ways, understandable is it might be to airbrush or sanitized Aristotle to make him seem more politically correct for modern readers. And yet we should also avoid the second equally powerful temptation, which is to reject Aristotle out of hand because his views do not correspond with our own question is what did Aristotle mean by slavery? What did he think was who or what did he think was the slave by nature? Until we understand what he meant, we have no reason to either accept or reject his argument. The first point worth noting about this is it Aristotle did not simply assume slavery was natural because it was practiced virtually everywhere in the ancient world. You will notice, did he frames his analysis in the form of the debate?

Speaker 2:          34:23          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          34:24          he says the outset of his argument. There are, there are some he says indicating this is an opinion held by many people. There are some who believe that slavery is natural because ruling and being ruled is it pervasive distinction that one sees all societies, uh, practice. But he says others, others believed that the distinction between net master and slave is not natural, but it's based on force or coercion. Even in Aristotle's time it appears slavery was a controversial, uh, institution and elicited very different kinds of opinions and responses. And here is one of those moments when Aristotle, as I indicated earlier, seems most maddeningly openminded. He's willing to entertain arguments both for both, both for and against the debate. Aristotle agrees with those who deny that slavery is justified by war or conquest wars. He remarks are not always just so those who are captured in war cannot be assumed to be justly or naturally enslaved.

Speaker 1:          35:40          Similarly, he denies that slavery is always or only appropriate for non Greeks. There are no, he is saying racial or ethnic characteristics that distinguish the natural slave from the natural master and in a stunning admission, he says, listen to this, that while nature may intend to distinguish the free man from the slave, he says the opposite often results. Nature often misses the mark. He says, now we seem to be completely confused if slavery is natural and if nature intends to distinguish the slave from the unfree for the free from the unfree, how can nature missed the mark? How can the opposite often result? I mentioned this because such complications should alert the careful reader, right? We're trying to read carefully what does Aristotle doing and making this same so complicated. At the same time, Aristotle agrees with those who defend the thesis of natural slavery and his defense seems to run something like this.

Speaker 1:          37:05          Slavery is natural because we cannot rule ourselves without the restraint of the passions. Self rule means self restraint. Restraint or self control is necessary for freedom or self government. And what is true, he seems to suggest a about the restraint over one's passions and desires is true of restraint and control over others. Just as he appears to be saying there is a kind of hierarchy within the soul restraint of the passion. So does that psychological hierarchy translate itself into a kind of social hierarchy, uh, between different kinds of people? The natural hierarchy then seems to be a sort of hierarchy of intelligence of, or at least a hierarchy of the rational. But how did this come to be? Aristotle asks, how is it that some people came to acquire this capacity for rational self control that is necessary for freedom and others seem to lack it? How did that come to be? Is this hierarchy again a genetic quality? Is it something we're born with? Is it something that is implanted in us by nature in that sense? Or is that distinction something that is created by nurture and education? What we would call today may be socialization. And if the ladder, if this hierarchy of intelligence or this hierarchy of the rational,

Speaker 2:          38:46          uh,

Speaker 1:          38:47          is a result of upbringing, then how can slavery be defended? Is Natural. There's an Aristotle calm man, the rational animal, the being with logo, suggesting that all human beings have a desire for knowledge and the desire to cultivate their minds and live as free persons. Isn't there a kind of egalitarianism, so to speak, built in to the conception of rational animal and political animal? Uh, he begins his metaphysics, his great book, the metaphysics with the famous opening statement. All men have a desire to know if we all have a desire to know, doesn't this connote something universal that all should be free, that all should participate in ruling in being ruled as citizens of a city. Yet at the same time, Aristotle seems to regard education is the preserve of the field to kind of discipline and self restraint necessary for an educated mind,

Speaker 2:          39:58          uh,

Speaker 1:          39:59          appears for him to be unequally divided among human beings. It follows, I think that the regime according to nature, it is to say the best regime would be what we might think of as an aristocracy of, of the educated an aristocracy of education and training in Aristocratic Republic of some sort that governs. We're an educated elite governance for the good of all Aristotle's republic. Uh, and I use that term to remind you of Plato as well, but Aristotle's republic is devoted to cultivating a high level of citizen virtue where this means those qualities of mind and heart necessary for self government. These qualities he believes are the preserve of the few of a minority, of a minority capable of sharing in the administration of justice and in the offices of a city. It seems to be a very elite teaching.

Speaker 2:          41:15          Would you agree

Speaker 1:          41:17          and an appealing to us perhaps for that reason? Very contrary to our intuitions and the way we have been brought up.

Speaker 2:          41:28          Yes. Yeah. You agree with me, but

Speaker 1:          41:36          before we dismiss Aristotle's account is insufferably in a Galitary Ian in elitist, we have to ask a difficult question, not just of Aristotle, but more importantly of ourselves. What else is Yale but in elite institution intended to educate morally and intellectually potential members of a leadership class? Think about that. Can anyone get into Gail? Do we have an open admissions policy for all who want to come here? Hardly. Does it not require those qualities of self control, discipline and restraint necessary to achieve success here? I will leave aside for the moment. What happens on Friday and Saturday nights? Is it any coincidence that graduates from this university in a handful of others, not unlike it, find themselves in high positions of government, of business, of law, and the academy. Is it unfair or unreasonable to describe this class is Aristotle might as a natural aristocracy. So I leave you with this question to think about before we reject Aristotle is an anti democratic elitist. Take a look at yourselves. So are you, or you wouldn't be sitting here today. Think about that and I'll see you next week.
