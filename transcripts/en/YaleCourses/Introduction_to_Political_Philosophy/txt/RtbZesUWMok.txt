Speaker 1:          00:01          Last time, I believe I said I wanted to discuss three features that Tocqueville regarded as central to American democracy that is not just study. They were central to the democratic experience. Uh, but they are central features of the American Democrat Democratic experience. And to what degree these can be or could possibly be translated to other contexts in other emerging democracies remains very much an open question. But of these three features, uh, the first, uh, talked a little bit about on Monday is the importance of local government, uh, the township as it's translated in, in, in this, in this edition. What Tocqueville cause the commune that community, community, Spirit, local government, um, in some way connected to what he calls later in the book, uh, the spirit of the city using the city in the here and the context of the ancient sense of Polis lists breed the city, that spirit of a kind of Polish like character in these small, New England townships, very important.

Speaker 1:          01:19          Uh, Tocqueville believes, uh, for the, uh, uh, sustaining a democratic country in a democratic society. But the second and probably the aspect of Tocqueville's account of democratic, uh, America that has received the most attention at least recently, uh, is, uh, the aspect of what he calls throughout the Book Civil Association Civic Association. It is these, uh, what one might think of as intermediary groups, voluntary groups, civic organizations of all kinds that have, uh, that that Tocqueville is, is immensely impressed with and which he turns into one of the central pillars of the democratic experience. He writes that in democratic countries, uh, one of the most famous sentences, uh, from the book in democratic countries, the Science of association he says is the Mother's science. The progress of all the others depends on the progress of that one. And it is through uniting and joining together in common endeavors. He believes that people develop a taste for liberty.

Speaker 1:          02:39          It taste for freedom in America. If I can just quote him again. In America, I encountered all sorts of associations of which I confess I had no idea. And I often admired the infinite art with which the inhabitants of the United States managed to fix a common goal to the efforts of many men to get them to advance, freely struck by the immense variety and multiplicity and sheer number of these various kinds of civic association. And it doesn't, it is important to see perhaps this is one area in which, uh, Tocqueville's teams to most clearly depart from Roussel, at least the root cell of this social contract. After having said last time that his account of local democracy township democracy owes so much to Russo's account of the general will. But remember that Rousseau in the social contract, he did invade against warned against what he called partial associations.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Uh, partial associations like interest groups of various kinds and have the tendency to frustrate a, the general will that stand as it were between the individual and the general will. But Tocqueville, on the other hand regards these kinds of voluntary associations, associations of all sorts. It's precisely the place where we learn habits of initiative. A cooperation and responsibility with others. By taking care of our own interests or the interests of our association. We learn to take care of the interests of others. Sentiments and ideas renew themselves. Tocqueville writes, the heart is enlarged and the human mind is developed. So he puts, you can see from a passage like that how much weight he puts on these civic associations. The heart is enlarged, the mind is developed. It is through these associations, PTA, churches, synagogues and other civil bodies and association that institutions are formed that can both resist in its way the power of centralized authority, central government.

Speaker 1:          04:58          But they are also the, is it where the locus, the seed bed where citizens learn to become demo, where we learn to become democratic citizens. It's very much important for Tocqueville that these associations, uh, which the absence of which he felt very acutely in France, uh, which had already become a highly centralized, uh, society. Uh, it was these, uh, these, these intermediary voluntary associations that stand between the individual and, and central authority, the authority of the national government, which, which is what makes them so important for him. And this argument about the importance of civic association. I say it has become a, in a way the most talked about past edge or a part of the book in recent years. This is due in large part to the influence of political scientist Robert Putnam. Uh, a man who teaches at another university, uh, called, uh, called a book called Bowling alone.

Speaker 1:          06:05          You've probably maybe heard of that and hear Putnam speaks about what he calls human capital. Uh, what Tocqueville, uh, in, uh, in less obviously science, less social scientific jargon because habits of the heart mores habits of the heart, mind and heart. But Putnam argues that it is this social capital that is developed through civic association and its chief example as the title of the book in the article from which it draws, suggests it said the bowling league, it's a kind of model of civic association and particularly he is concerned with the decline of these associations in contemporary American life. Hence the title of the Book Bowling alone. The fact that Tocqueville himself describes these civic associations is the product of art suggest that that is to say that they are not natural. They are not, uh, somehow uh, uh, the result of um, uh, some kind of instinctual behavior on us.

Speaker 1:          07:10          They are joining with others in voluntary associations is a learned activity. Uh, it is something that requires a certain kind of culture and that end is a learned activity. It is something also it is an artist, his skill, it is a craft that can also be lost. And his argument is that more and more people are so to speak, choosing to bowl, bowl alone, uh, something that shows an alarming tendency towards isolation and the subsequent kind of a depletion or most of our civic capacities. Uh, the question is have our uh, taking Tocqueville to the prison, have our capacities for joining with others being eroded by the forces of modern politics and technology are in fact we becoming more and more a nation of solid, solitary and, and couch potatoes. Jude, can I get you here for just a minute? These are some of the serious questions and there is a big literature, uh, that has grown up around it.

Speaker 1:          08:12          And some of this literature, uh, finds Putnam's, uh, conclusions to be overdrawn, uh, that he exaggerates the influence of these, uh, associations did or the decline of these associations. Uh, I'll tell you this, when these associations, and in fact, uh, our civic state is not as bad off as he suggests, but what I want to do suggest today, and this is where I'm going to show a film and June is going to help me just a couple of clips, is that there is a serious question, I think in my mind, whether bowling leagues are a proper model for Democratic Association, uh, now one can say and using the title bowling alone that Putnam is just speaking metaphorically, that, uh, he's not really doesn't mean bowling leagues and because you use it using it as a metaphor, but let's take him at his word and let's find out a, if bowling leagues are in fact the ideal transmitter, uh, for democratic mores and values.

Speaker 1:          09:14          And I want to take an example from a movie that I have, which I'm very fond by the Cohen brothers called the big Lebowski, which is a movie about a bowling league, or at least three gentlemen who take their bowling in their bowling league very seriously. Uh, the three of them are the dude who is a stone Hippie, uh, Walter, who's kind of a whacked out Vietnam vet and Danny who's a last wave and they are very, very concerned with getting in to the finals, into the bone bowling tournament. And in their way stands a man named Hayes who's Cantana who it happens also to be a sex offender. And we're going to show, I want to show a couple of clips from this movie and I should warn you that there is some very bad language being used here. So if you think that is going to be offensive to you, you should leave. Uh, we won't take more than about four, four minutes or so. And we're going to show a couple of clips about the ethos of men bowling, do civic association, the Eith, the democratic ethos of Bowling Leagues. And I would assume three ideal democratic citizens.

Speaker 1:          10:33          Well, I, I did that as a little bit of a joke at Professor Putnam's expense maybe, but, uh, you know, and I also really liked the movie and it's also really hard to follow something like that too, I have to say. But, um, uh, obviously it seems, it goes to show that civic association alone is not enough, uh, to, uh, create a democratic citizens again, otherwise smokey and the dude and Walter would be, uh, you know, perfect example of democratic citizens. Tocqueville focuses on a third and other, uh, leg of the stool of democratic life and that that is what he calls the spirit of religion central again, as the third and I, and in in many ways very important prop of the American democratic experience and my Ra on my arrival in the United States, he observes, it was the religious aspect of the country that struck my eye first.

Speaker 1:          11:39          Very impressed with that. And like other European visitors to the United States both then as well as now it's Tocqueville was deeply struck with how democracy and religion walk seemed to walk hand in hand with each other. Precisely the opposite of what has occurred in Europe, where religion in democracy or religion inequality, we're long on a collision course. What made, uh, the American, uh, encounter with democratic life? A unique, that is one of Tocqueville's big questions. In the first instance you could say, uh, or as Tocqueville notes that American America is primarily a puritan democracy. I see the whole destiny of America contained in the first puritan who land on its shore landed on its shores. He says like the whole human race in the first man. Uh, our experience was determined in, in crucial ways by those are the, by early puritanism. Uh, America was created by people with strong religious beliefs and habits who brought to the new world a suspicion of government and a strong desire of independence.

Speaker 1:          12:54          And this has set, this has been the foundation of the separation of church and state that has done so much both for religious and political liberty. And toke though drew from this two very important consequences, I think, uh, about religious life in America. Uh, the first, uh, is that the thesis has propounded by the great philosophers of the enlightenment of the 18th century and still advanced in many, uh, you might say enlightened quarters today, uh, that religion will disappear, uh, as with the advance of modernity. That is modernity, advances, uh, religious life will disappear I suppose in the 20th Century, Mocks Vapor, uh, gave, uh, voice, uh, most prominently to that point of view that would be a process of secularization with maternity. And it sort of gradual withering away, uh, of religious belief. Tocqueville shows that to be demonstrably false, uh, that religion will not simply disappear, uh, as modernity, uh, move moves forward and that the enlightenment and it's contemporary heirs, theorists of development and modernization and so on have been altogether wrong about their confident predictions about the decline and withering away of religious faith.

Speaker 1:          14:20          And secondly, uh, Tocqueville takes it to be a terrible mistake to try to eliminate religion or just secularized society altogether. This is in fact, probably a more controversial, uh, a very controversial claim. It was his belief, and again, perhaps here he's influenced by Roussell and the chapter on the civil civil religion at the end of the social contract that free societies rest on public morality and morality cannot be effective without religion. It may be true that individuals can derive moral guidance from reason alone, but society's can't. Uh, and the danger of attempting to eliminate religion from public life is that the need or desire to believe will therefore be transferred to other and far more dangerous outlets. Despotism he says, can do without faith, but freedom cannot, uh, very arresting sentence. Despotism can do without faith but reason. But, but freedom cannot. Religion is more necessary in a republic and in a democratic country than any other.

Speaker 1:          15:34          He says, but why is religion necessary to a republic? Why does democracy require religion? And here, Tocqueville gives a variety of answers. One persistent theme running throughout his book as a whole is that only religion can resist the tendency toward materialism and to kind of low self interest that he believes is intrinsic to democratic ages. And societies. The principal business of religion, he frequently, uh, rights, uh, is to purify as to regulate, is to restrain the kind of ardent desire for a wellbeing and particularly material wellbeing that becomes particularly prominent during ages of equality. It's one, one reason, but secondly, or an addition, Tocqueville operates, uh, I find it with a very interesting, uh, I might even call it a metaphysic of faith, uh, that regard to religious belief as, as a necessary component for human action. Uh, when religion is destroyed in a people, this is Tocqueville.

Speaker 1:          16:47          When religion is destroyed in a people doubt, takes hold of the higher portion of the intellect and half paralyzes all the others. Uh, when, uh, religion is destroyed, doubt takes over and it had, it has a kind of paralyzing effect on the will and our capacity for action. And this paralysis of the will, this inability to act as a condition that later writers would choose to call nihilism. Faith is a necessary component for our belief that we are free agents and not simply the play thing of blind forces and random causes. Uh, so to speak, our beliefs about freedom. And the dignity of the individual are inseparable for him from religious faith and it is light. It is unlikely that these beliefs about the dignity of the individual, uh, can survive without religion. Uh, just to take a contemporary example of that, think about the debates.

Speaker 1:          17:53          We have had a over such things as cloning and uh, the sense that many people have that, uh, the dignity of the individual, which is often connected with, uh, a kind of religious belief, uh, sanctity of life. The dignity of the individual is, is somehow deeply violated by these advances of, of sort of scientific technology. Uh, that these are, that religion remains a crucial prop for our beliefs about, uh, human, human dignity. No more powerful challenge to the enlightenment's faith in science and scientific progress, uh, is can be found then in Tocqueville. And one, one final issue remains. I would say Tocqueville often writes, and I would say this is the dominant tone of his writing on religion. He often writes is if religion is only valuable or valuable primarily for this social function it serves. Uh, this is certainly consistent with lots of things he says about religion.

Speaker 1:          19:03          He's only concerned about religion for its social and political consequences rather than from the deeper truths of religious belief. I view religion. He says only from a purely human point of view. He says he's only looking for its effect on society. But I would ask how accurate is that statement or does it describe a or characterize all of Tocqueville's views about religion? I think not a, let me just say why for a minute. I think that sort of sociological or functionalist reading of a religion that he's interested only in it only for its social effect is only part of Tocqueville's very complex attitude towards the subject. Uh, maybe you'll have a chance to talk about this in your section. Maybe you'll have an opportunity to write about it at some other time. But remember that Tocqueville was not only a student of Roussel, as he said in that letter to Louis De [inaudible] that I mentioned last time, his other two great sources of inspiration or a Monte scare and a 17th century French philosopher named Blaise Pascal.

Speaker 1:          20:13          A Pascal was a religious philosopher who more than any other, uh, emphasize the emptiness of knowledge without faith, a man may be the rational animal, uh, but reason is somehow unable to plum or reason is unable to, to grasp the unfathomable depths of the universe. In one of his most famous statements, Pascal said a vapor, he says, a vapor, a drop of water is enough to kill him. Speaking of, speaking of here of us human humans, a drop of water is enough to kill us. Man is a read or read, the weakest in nature. But he is a thinking read.

Speaker 1:          21:00          We are, we are weak. We are, we, we, we think, but, but we are. We are. It is our weakness. It is our dependence, a sense of dependence that that struck Pascal and Tocqueville. You can find this in many, several passages throughout the democracy. Talk though I think discovered in Pascal, a sense of kind of existential emptiness and the incompleteness of life that cannot be explained in terms of reason alone. There was also, he felt something deeply hubristic uh, about, uh, the way in which a conditions of equality, uh, foster, uh, this idea of, of, of, of, of, of rational self sufficiency Tocqueville's purpose in many ways was to limit reason to make room for faith. And this is one of my favorite passages. Let me just read it or sentenced her to the short space of 60 years. He writes almost as an aside, the short space of 60 years, we'll never confine the whole imagination of man. The incomplete joys of this world will never suffice for his heart.

Speaker 1:          22:14          Incomplete joys of this world will never suffice for his heart. In other words, there is something we desire, but beyond the here and now that only faith can supply the sole exhibits a kind of longing and desire for eternity and to kind of discussed with the world and the limits of physical existence. Religion he goes on is only a particular form of hope. And it is as natural to the human heart is hope itself only by a kind of aberration of the intellect and with the aid of a sort of moral violence exercised on their own nature. Do men stray from religious belief and invincible inclination leads them back to religion? Disbelief is an accident. Faith alone is the permanent state of humanity. Uh, if anyone's interested, that's on page two 84, but no one can possibly read that section and come away from Tocqueville by thinking he had a, had only a kind of functionalist sociological view of religion, concern with its effects on human behavior and society, uh, disbelief as an accident.

Speaker 1:          23:30          Faith is the permanent condition of humanity and only to a kind of moral violence through the moral violence. Uh, Ken, uh, religious faith be, uh, be eliminated. I think these passages show a much deeper, almost metaphysical dimension to Tocqueville start, uh, shows him to be a thinker like Plato in many ways of enormous psychological depth and subtlety, uh, and, and insight. But these are the three features or three of the future. I think the three central features that, uh, remain for him, crucial to democracy, uh, local government, civil association in what he calls the spirit of religion and yet obviously or is not well, uh, or as far from being well, uh, too often, way too often we read, uh, democracy in America is if it were simply a celebration of the democratic experience in America. It is not a, and Tocqueville, uh, among other things is deeply worried about the potential.

Speaker 1:          24:46          Mentioned briefly about this last time, uh, the, the, the potential of democratic tyranny. Uh, why is there a belief or why, why would one believe, uh, that, that, that, that, that democratic government, uh, alone will eliminate various forms of arbitrary rule in tyrannical government. In fact, it might create new forms of tyranny, democratic tyranny of which previous societies had been, uh, perhaps unaware. This is an issue that he treats twice in two important parts, uh, in, in, in his work, one in volume one, the other, in volume two. I'm only going to, I'm going to talk for a little bit today about, uh, his account of tyranny of the majority and volume wine. And I'm going to save a part of the other rest of the discussion for next week when he talks about what he calls democratic despotism and the second part of democracy in America and volume one, he treats the, what he calls the tyranny of the majority, largely in terms you might say, that are derived or inherited from Aristotle.

Speaker 1:          25:57          And even the authors of the federalist papers you remember in Aristotle's politics, uh, Aristotle associated democracy with the rule of the many rule of the many for all kinds of peer purposes, generally means rule of the poor, uh, and rule of the poor for their own interest. The danger with democracy for Aristotle was it did, it still represented a, the tyranny of one class a of society over the society of a whole, the largest class ruling, uh, in its interests over the minority democracy for the ancients was always a form of class struggle between the rich and the poor. And that was in many respects, the way in which democracy came to be viewed even by the federalist authors who came up with their own solution to the problem of democracy or what they called a Republican government. The problem of Republican government was this problem of you might say majority faction and their answer to the problem of majority faction was in Madison's term to enlarge the orbit of government to make, make societies and polities much larger in order not to try to eliminate faction, but to increase them.

Speaker 1:          27:13          Uh, by increasing the number of factions you decrease the possibility that any one of them will be able to represent or exercise a kind of permanent majority, uh, control, a kind of permanent, a tyranny of the majority. The greater the number of factions, the less likelihood that any one of them will be able to exercise despotic power over national politics. And this is a question that Tocqueville returns to or turns two in that very important chapter from book one called the omnipotence of the majority in the United States into f and its effects, which is in many respects a response or a re provides his reading and critique of the classical or traditional theory of democratic tyranny. The U s constitution, he talks about his enshrined, the majority, and it's opening preamble. We the people it has enshrined the majority, even as it has sought to limit the powers of the people. And although Tocqueville devotes a great deal of attention in volume one, we're not really reading these sections. I don't think they're all that important for our purposes. He spends a great deal of attention simply sort of describing, uh, the, the, the makeup of the federal constitution, the structure of the houses of governments. So on one has to say he is far less impressed than Madison or the federalist authors were that the problem of majority faction has been solved in, in America.

Speaker 1:          28:51          Again, the federalist authors following lock and Montesquieu believed all that was unnecessary or was separation of powers, a system of representation, a system of checks and balances that this could serve as an effective check on majority rule. But Tocqueville was less certain of that. It was less certain that these, as it were, institutional devices alone could check what he calls the empire of the majority, the empire of the majority, a term that he uses, that he clearly has kind of theological connotations denoting a kind of divine omnipotence, that the people have come to be the ultimate or final authority. And rather than regarding, as it were, the people in Madisonian terms, simply as a kind of ongoing shifting coalition of interests, Tocqueville regarded the majority in democratic societies as the power of the majority is unlimited, is unlimited and unstoppable legal guarantees of minority rights, he thought were unlikely to be effective, uh, in the face of mobilized public opinion.

Speaker 1:          30:05          Why does Tocqueville believe that or what, what, uh, what led him to express such skepticism about, uh, even American democracy's inability to check? Uh, the prospect of democratic tyranny in part I think talks to us answer was that majority tyranny was inseparable from the threats of revolutionary violence and particularly charismatic demagogues in military leaders like Napoleon in France. Uh, and, uh, and America's a counterpart to Napoleon Andrew Jackson, uh, Napoleon, uh, was in France, the man capable of mobilizing a, the masters into fits of patriotic zeal and to carry on a war. And Jacksonian ism for him was simply, uh, looked like sort of the, uh, an American fault farm of Bonaparte partism a military commander writing to political power on the wings of popular support more than anything else. Tocqueville, feared militarism combined with a kind of unlimited patriotic fervor. And it is in these respects, you can begin to see, uh, some of the less, the less ennobling features, uh, of the democratic experience and the more ominous possibilities of democratic rule.

Speaker 1:          31:29          The power of the majority says, makes itself feared, especially to the dominance of the legislature. He believed, uh, we could talk about whether this belief is still valid or true. He believed that the most, again, that democracy tends towards a kind of legislative dominance of the legislatures were the people's voice makes it's, it's will most clearly known. And by having short elections are short, short cycles every two years, uh, in the House of Representatives, it was a way of making sure that the legislature's, the house, the houses, uh, are, are, are, are very close to public opinion and public control. And he sees this, uh, these, these, this is a dangerous thing. This kind of legislative dominance, uh, that he sees is one farm, uh, in the way in which the tyranny of the majority expresses itself. But the most important and the most memorable aspects of tyranny of the majority have less to do with these, um, institutional, uh, institutional, uh, forms you might say. Then it has to do with, uh, the way in which the empire, again, I'll use his term, the empire of the majority makes itself felt in the realm of thought and opinion. Uh, the influence of the majority over-thought.

Speaker 2:          33:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          33:00          In an always startling passage from the book, Tocqueville remarks. I know of no other country, we're in general less independence of mind in genuine freedom of discussion rain than in America, have no country where there was less independence of mind and freedom of discussion.

Speaker 1:          33:24          He is, I suspect overstating the case. But, uh, his argument here is that the dangers to freedom of thought in a democracy do not come from the threat of an inquisition. They do not come from a something like that, but they are exercised in more subtle forms of exclusion and ostracism. Tocqueville is perhaps in that passage, one of the first and most perceptive analysts of what today might be called the power of political correctness to control and to eliminate certain kinds of ideas and opinions from being thought it is the fear of ostracism. In some sense, the fear of being socially ostracized, that, uh, the majority to through which the majority exercises it's control and talk. Those statement here, uh, is of course the persecution can take many forms, uh, under a democratic, uh, people, uh, from the cruelest, uh, to the most mild. Uh, he gives various examples of the crueler forms of the way in which the majority has expressed itself itself.

Speaker 1:          34:41          In a lengthy footnote to the book, uh, for example, he, in this, in, in some of this these parts he talks about, uh, he gives two examples. One in which, uh, during the war of 1812, he says there were, uh, there were some antiwar journalists in Baltimore. Maybe you read that passage who were, uh, who were taken out, uh, their, their, their, their newspaper pressed was burned down. And, uh, and they were, I think they were hung. He says, this is the way in which kind of Ma that mob mentality took over. And he also uses the example of the way in which black voters in the state of Pennsylvania and in petite focuses on this particularly have been disenfranchised. And he mentions Pennsylvania in particular because Pennsylvania is a Quaker state. Uh, that is to say a state where we're, one would've thought liberal opinion towards questions of racial justice would, would have been most advanced.

Speaker 1:          35:40          And even there, he says, uh, the majority, uh, constrain, uh, uh, African American voters from a free blacks from voting. So these are ways in which, uh, again, some, some, some overt and cruel and persecute persecutory others milder and in through the form of ostracism that he wants to say that, uh, that the, that the democratic, uh, sovereignty can exercise itself, chains and executions or the course instruments. He writes that tyranny formerly employed. But in our day, civilization has perfected despotism itself, which seemed to have nothing more to learn. We have deaf perfected despotism. He says under the absolute government of one man, despotism struck crudely at the body. So to reach the soul, no doubt, thinking about the inquisition and things like this in Spain and in parts of Catholic Europe, and he writes in the soul, escaping from those blows rose gloriously above it, but he goes in democratic republics, tyranny does not proceed in this way.

Speaker 1:          36:51          It leaves the body alone and goes directly for the soul. Well, there's a wealth of, of commentary. Uh, you might, uh, think about when you, when you, when you read that, when you read that passage, that's an implied there. Um, Oh God, the terms moving so quickly, so much more. So those are the three f. Uh, so that's, that, that for Tocqueville is the, is the, is one of the other sides of, uh, of, of the democratic experience. And I, again, I want to return to a piece of that on Wednesday, next week rather Monday, because I think you will see in volume to Tocqueville has something of a change of heart. He doesn't become more optimistic. In fact, he becomes far more pessimistic about this, but there's certainly a change of tone, uh, in what Tocqueville has to say about the potentiality of, of, uh, of, of majority tyranny. Well, we had so much fun watching the movie. Uh, I didn't get a chance to, there's, there's a little more I wanted to say, but it seems like a good note to break on a, I try to finish whatever I can with Tocqueville on Monday and Wednesday and going, go try to wrap things up and tell you, uh, what you should be thinking about. So, uh, anyway, uh, enjoy yourselves and I'll see you next week.
