Speaker 1:          00:02          There's so much to say and so little time do they want to talk about the general will, who his most important contribution to political science. And I will also want to talk about the legacies of Rousseau in what he, uh, what he's meant for the world, uh, that he, he, he did so much to shape.

Speaker 2:          00:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37          But I want to start first with the general will, which is his answer to the problems of civilization or the political problem. Uh, of the second discourse that we talked about last week, the problems of inequality, the problem of Mr Pro, the problem of our general discontent social contract is his answer to the problem of natural freedom. Uh, this is so in a way because for Russo nature, he tells us, provides no standards or guidelines for determining who should rule.

Speaker 2:          01:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Unlike Aristotle, man is notch here, a political animal. And notice that when Russo speaks of the social contract in the general will, is the foundation of all legitimate authority. He means literally that all standards of justice and right have their origins in the will in this unique human property of the will or free agency. It is this liberation of the will from all transcendent sources or standards, whether those be found in nature, in custom, in revelation, in any other source. Uh, the, the liberation of the will from all of these sources. That is the true is at war center of gravity, of Rousseau's philosophy. It is a world that begins to emphasize the primacy and the priority of the will. A moral point of view that I want to indicate a little later finds it's a, in many ways it's a very powerful expression and the philosophy of a manual Kant, but given Russo's, let's call it libertarian conception of human nature.

Speaker 1:          02:41          Uh, his description of the actual mechanism of this social contract may come as something of a surprise to us. The problem to which the formula of the general will is the answer is stated succinctly. Rousseau in book one, chapter six of the social contract, find a form of association. He writes, which defends in, protects with all the common force. The person and goods of each associates and by means of which each one, while uniting with all obeys only himself and remains as free as before this, he calls the fundamental problem for which the social contract is the solution. That statement famous statement book one, Chapter Six really contains two parts that that merit close attention. The first part says

Speaker 2:          03:44          for me, Oh, okay.

Speaker 1:          03:48          I thought it was, I thought it was for me. The first part of that clause, uh,

Speaker 1:          03:55          so is that the aim of the contract is to protect and defend with the common force, the goods and person of each member. Uh, so far think of that this is entirely consistent with locks claim or even Hobbs is claim that society that the purpose of society is to protect the security or the life, liberty and estate of each of its members and get Rousseau adds to this Lockian or liberal clause. Uh, you might say a second, uh, and more distinctly Russolo sewing claim, namely that the contract must ensure not only the conditions for mutual protection and the preservation of law of self and property, but rather awesome or also the, in uniting with one another. He says each person obeys only himself and then he says, remains as free as they were before. But how is this possible? We want to know, uh, isn't the essence of this social contract that we give up some part of our natural freedom, uh, to guarantee mutual peace and security.

Speaker 1:          05:09          How can we, how can we remain as free as we were before? Uh, and his, he says, obey only out I hit the, that the participant obey only himself. That is the paradox in many ways. Or the fundamental problem is he calls it to which his contract is a solution and Rousseau provides an answer as follows. He says, properly understood. These clauses are all reducible to one. Namely, he says, the total alienation of each associate together with all of his rights to the entire community, the total alienation of each associates with all of his rights to the entire community. And those two phrases, total alienation and entire community, uh, are obviously central here, uh, in the first place or persons must give themselves entirely over to the social contract to, to ensure that the terms of the agreement are equal for all. The total alienation clause, uh, as it were, is Russo's manner of ensuring that the terms of the contract are the same for everyone.

Speaker 1:          06:24          But secondly, when we alienate ourselves, it is crucial. He says that this be done or given to the entire community for only then he wants to argue is the individual beholden not to any private will or any private association or to some other person, but to the general will the will of the entire community. The social contract is the foundation of the general will, which is for Roussel the only legitimate sovereign, not kings, not parliaments, not representative assemblies, not presidents, but the general will of the entire community is the only general sovereign, the doctrine of the famous doctrine of what we call the sovereignty of the people or popular sovereignty.

Speaker 2:          07:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:14          Since everyone combines to make up this will, uh, when we give ourselves over to it entirely, he wants to argue, we do nothing more than obey ourselves. The sovereign, in other words is not some distinct third party that is created by the contract, but rather the sovereign is simply the people as a whole acting in its collective capacity. The people in their collective capacity.

Speaker 2:          07:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:44          No, you might suggest that there is something deeply amiss here. That is to say from a highly individualistic set of premises where each person is concerned only in the state of nature or in the pre contract tradition, only with the protection of their lives, persons and property. Rousseau seems to be leading us to a highly regimented and collectivized a conclusion where the individual has given over virtually his or her entire being to the will of the community. In what way does this render us as free as we were before? In what way do we remain a free and obey only ourselves? That seems to be a the problem. Does this, does Russo's formula for the general will of recipe or a formula for freedom or is it a recipe for the tyranny of the majority of the type later analyzed by Tocqueville that we'll be seeing, uh, after, after the break,

Speaker 1:          08:52          Russo wants to say, paradoxically only this total alienation. Do we remain free? Why is this, why, why is this? Because he wants to argue. No one is dependent upon the will of another. The people established through their act a new kind of sovereign. The general will, which he says is not strictly speaking the sum total, the additive total, uh, of the individual wills or the individual parts, but is more like the general interest or the rational will if you want to use that kind of content formulation. The rational will have a community. Since we all contribute to the shaping of this general will. When we obey its laws, we do. He wants to say no more than obey ourselves. And Russo describes this new kind of freedom that we achieve under the general will. Uh, he wants to say that this brings about in some ways a radical transformation of human nature in itself.

Speaker 1:          10:03          The freedom of the citizen under the general will is not the freedom of the state of nature. It's not the freedom to do anything we like anything that our will and power allows us to do. But it is a new kind of freedom that he calls moral freedom, a freedom to do what the law commands, the passage from the state of nature. He writes to the civil state. The passage from this state of nature to the civil state produces a remarkable change in man for its substitutes, justice for instinct in his behavior and gives his actions a moral quality that they previously lacked. And Roussel continues that statement as follows. What man loses through the social contract is his natural liberty and an unmitigated right to everything that tempts him. And he can acquire what he gains his civil liberty and proprietary ownership of all he possesses.

Speaker 1:          11:04          But, and here I think is the crucial argument or the crucial clause, but he writes to the proceeding acquisitions. That is to say civil liberty, uh, could be added the acquisition of moral liberty, which alone he says makes man truly the master of himself for to be driven by appetite alone is slavery and obedience to the law one has prescribed for oneself is freedom. That has a remarkable statement. Obedience to the law that one prescribes for oneself is freedom. That is moral liberty, which is only created and possible through the social contract. And the implications of this, the moral and political implications of that statement, uh, are need is here in many ways. Reus where Roussel departs most powerfully, most dramatically from his early modern predecessors. Consider the following, uh, for Hobbes and Locke. Liberty meant, uh, that sphere of human conduct, which is unregulated by the law.

Speaker 1:          12:13          Remember Chapter 21 of Leviathan we're Hobbes says where the law is silent preacher, mid hid in his term where the law is silent, the citizen is free to do whatever he or she chooses to do. Freedom begins so to speak where the law is silent. But for Rousseau law is the very beginning, uh, of our freedom where the law is silent. We may have a kind of natural freedom, but our moral freedom, uh, we are free to the extent that we are participants in the laws that we in turn obey. Freedom means acting in conformity with self imposed law, a radically different understanding of what freedom consists and it seems underlying that difference between one could say Hobbes and Locke on the one side and Russo on the other is a difference between two very different conceptions of liberty. One might call them liberal and Republican.

Speaker 1:          13:19          Uh, respectively. Small r Republican of course democratic even if you like for liberals. Uh, following in the tradition of Hobbes and Locke, again, freedom has always meant a sphere of privacy with the law does not intrude or where other people do not intrude. This, this is why the separation of the public and the private sphere has always been so sacred to liberals because only in the private sphere, only in that area of civil society, uh, where the state does not intrude is the individual really and truly free. But for the Republican theory of liberty, of which you so is the most powerful, uh, modern, uh, exponent. This separation of pro public and private is only an exercise in what might be thought of his private selfishness. The task is rather to create a community where the individual in the public interest are not in conflict with one another with the individual, does not think of him or herself as a being a part from the social body.

Speaker 1:          14:29          This is the freedom of the citizen for Russo who takes an active role in the determination of the laws of one's own community. Uh, Russo's purpose in saying this and then writing, this seems to be to bring back to life a concept that he believes has been dormant, had laid dormant for centuries, and that concept is the citizen. The last people who really knew what a citizen meant. He says, we're the Romans in an a footnote again to book one, Chapter Six, he indicates what? That the how to what degree the true meaning of citizen has been lost on modern subjects. Most modern men, he writes, mistake a town for a city and a bourgeois for a citizen. Think of that most mistake of bourgeois for a citizen. The modern world furnishes almost no examples of what a citizen is. And this is why it is necessary for Russo to return to the histories of antiquity, especially Rome and Sparta, to find models of citizenship only in these societies has, can one find the spirit of self sacrifice and devotion to the common good, a kind of patriotic devotion upon which citizen ship is founded.

Speaker 1:          15:59          If I could take perhaps Russo's most memorable example of the true citizen, it comes from an example, he lifts from the Roman Ryder Plutarch, uh, that he uses in the opening pages of his book, the meal, which I hope you will have a chance to read at some other time. And here he tells an unforgettable story for anybody who ever reads a meal. A Spartan woman, he writes, had five sons in the army and was awaiting news of the battle. It five sons in the army and was awaiting news of the battle. A helot slave arrives trembling. She asks him for news, you're five sons were killed. The hell at replies based slave. Did I ask you this? We won the victory. He says, the mother runs to the temple and gives thanks to the gods here for Russo is the ancient citizen an example that is both terrible and sublime, which of course he wants it to be, intends it to be.

Speaker 1:          17:08          There is the example of what the true citizen is. The question when you consider this possibility is weather Russo's idea of the freedom of the citizen freedom to live under self imposed law leads to a higher form of nobility, high higher than the kind of low minded pursuit of one self interest as Roussel wants. He wants to dignify politics again by leading to a higher form of nobility, or does it result in a new kind of despotism, the despotism of law, the despotism of obedience to the general will and of course, underlying that sinister a reading of Rousseau's, uh, of Russo is the famous or maybe infamous statement that not only that the general will is the source of freedom, but that anyone who obeys, who refuses to obey the general will, may be in his famous formulation, may be forced to be free. That anyone who disobeys it, uh, in being chastised or being, uh, can be as you were forced to be free, uh, recall that this is a conception of freedom, which again, is almost the opposite of that, of what we might call the liberal tradition.

Speaker 1:          18:36          A view, which in a, in a, in a gigantic, slightly paradoxical way, was given a very powerful formula formulation by hubs. I want to read a passage that I read a couple of weeks ago from Hobbs, which I think stands as a striking contrast to dat of Rousseau's. Uh, in chapter again in chapter 21 of Leviathan Hobbs Rights, the Athenians and the Romans were free. That is they were free Commonweal's. Not that any particular men had liberty to resist their own representatives, but their representatives had the liberty to resist or invade other people. Hobbes clearly says that the ancient freedom was the freedom of the cult of the collective. It wasn't the freedom of the individual, the freedom of the authorities as he says, to resist or invade other people. There is written and the tourists of the city of Luca remember that in the great characters at this day, the word Libertas, and yet he goes on to say, no man convince, infer that a particular man has more liberty or immunity from service to the Commonwealth there than in Constantinople.

Speaker 1:          19:50          That is to say freedom for hubs consists of as he puts it, immunity from service, immunity from service. And for this reason, there is no reason to believe that anyone is free or in the Republican city have Luca, which has Libertas on the wall. Then in Constantinople that seems to already a hundred or so years before Rousseau suggests a powerful alternative to their view. His view of freedom to Hobbs is point like Rousseau's is extreme. Uh, and that in many ways is the power of these two views. Uh, Hobbes is view as freedom is immunity from service. Uh, Russo's view is that freedom consists, you might say only in service. Our freedom starts where, where the law begins. And again, at the basis of this or radically different views of the role of participant political participation in lawmaking for Russo. Again, laws are legitimate only if everyone has a direct share in making them.

Speaker 1:          21:03          It doesn't mean we all agree with the outcome, but only if we have a some kind of share or voice in making them for hubs for lock, for the authors of the federalist papers. On the other hand, the direct involvement of the citizen in lawmaking is clearly a subordinate or a secondary good legislation is better handled by persons chosen from the electorate who are so to speak, the agents or representatives of the people. This was what the federalist authors argued was the great advance of modern political science, the doctrine of representation. What is far more important for the federalist authors as well as for lock hubs and that tradition is that law is be generally known that they be applied by impartial judges rather than they be the direct expression of the general will. Uh, in many ways underlying the, again, liberal conception of law is a certain distrust of the collective wisdom or the collective sovereignty of the people. Uh, it is too cumbersome in many ways and also too dangerous a mechanism to call people together to decide on matters over public concern. This is better left according to this tradition, to representatives. Russo obviously could not disagree more.

Speaker 2:          22:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:32          One could say that Rousseau makes who ROIC and unreasonable assumptions about human nature. Why do we want to gather together constantly or often to decide to deliberate and to debate over questions of public concern? Most people, it's hard enough just to get most people as we know, to go out to vote. Why do we want to engage in endless debate? Uh, something like, you know, uh, college, uh, uh, council, uh, meeting, trying to discuss, uh, what to do, uh, whether to buy or not a new set of dumbbells for the weightroom. You know, this is a debate that will go on for hours and hours and May, maybe even weeks. Don't people simply want to be left alone. Why do you, uh, why, uh, it Russo's again, he seems in some way to make a unreasonable assumptions about human nature and our capacity to, uh, to d to engage in debate.

Speaker 1:          23:33          But Russo will tell you he is not being idealistic at all. He is starting from the assumption of men as they are. He says, unless everyone who wants to say is engaged in the process of legislation, there is no way for you to know that the laws will be an expression of your will rather than simply the private will or corporate will have some, uh, individual or intermediary body. You will find yourself in a condition of dependence and slavery and the will of others. And what is really an issue, uh, for Russo is a freedom from dependence on some faction, some interest or some association that we have come to call today. Interest groups in some way. Russo's appeal is not to our altruism, uh, but rather to our selfishness in some way our desire, our private or selfish desire to preserve our freedom and, and resist the willful domination of others, uh, upon it.

Speaker 1:          24:43          So, um, so far this all in many ways is very abstract and Roussel deliberately sets out his, uh, plan for the general will in the lane in a, in a highly abstract and semi semi technical language. But he turns to questions, particularly in books three about how is the general will actually applied. How does it, uh, how does it, how is it applied? And here, Rousseau is far more specific, uh, sociologically and so on about the conditions under which the general will, uh, or a general will, can come about in the first place. The general will can only operate in small states, much like the size of an ancient republic in one place. When particularly notable place in the social contract, he says only the island country of Corsica is today a place where the general will might be established. The modern nation state, uh, as we have come to think of it as far to diff, large and diffuse a to determine the general will such a, such a state touch.

Speaker 1:          26:01          Large states will necessarily, uh, entailed considerable degrees of social inequality, of wealth, of status. And with such inequality, such inequalities, there can be no general will. And finally, or in addition, uh, as such a state where the general will is operative would be one that would have to in some sense is shoe, uh, that temptations of commerce and luxury, uh, for these bring with them. Uh, again, uh, large scale, uh, inequalities. His ideal city seems to be a kind of agrarian democracy, a small scale, a agrarian society. Uh, and yet at the same time we might get the impression that, uh, only a direct democracy, uh, would satisfy Russo's requirement's for a general the general will. And yet we find out this is not quite the case. Uh, in book three which I helped you will look at with some care, uh, he shows surprising flexibility, uh, about the forms of government that may be appropriate to different physical, uh, and geogrid in different climates and different topographies and so on.

Speaker 1:          27:22          In the chapter on democracy, he remarks even where there a people of God's, it would govern itself democratically and then he adds so perfect. A government is not suited to men. So he is skeptical about the possibility of a direct democracy. And by that he means a democracy. Not only were the people legislate, bring, create law, but where they are in charge also with the administration of law as well, the execution or enforcement of the law, he is very skeptical about that kind of democracies. Again, democracies are only possible under very, very special, unique circumstances. Otherwise, aristocracy monarchy, some kind of even mixed government, uh, is possible or even desirable. He insists and the separation of powers for much the same reasons that one finds in lock, the people who make the law should not be charged with responsible for executing and enforcing them. And throughout this part of the book, Russo seems to be in dialogue with an unnamed rival when he'd sometimes simply refers to as a famous author.

Speaker 1:          28:40          That author is of course Montesquieu. The, the, the author of the spirit of the law is, uh, that came out in 1755. And Montesquieu was of course, famous for arguing at different forms of government must be tailored to different climates, different geographies, different circumstances in many ways. In book three, Russo seems to indicate or to introduce, uh, a very, very, almost unroof civilian, uh, emphasis and prudence, moderation, flexibility, uh, that that seems at odds with the dogmatic claims of the first two books with its emphasis upon the absolute inviolability of sovereignty. But most important for Roussel, it is important that legislative authority in whatever kind of constitution and under whatever kind of government, that legislative authority is only is always held by the people in their collective capacity. This is why in a very powerful chapter, book three Chapter 15 Rousseau rejects all together the legitimacy of representative government.

Speaker 1:          29:55          That passage or that chapter could be taken already, is a kind of repudiation, not just of lock, Locke's theory of the representative, but also, you know, 20 years or so before the fact of the federalist argument for representation sovereignty, he says, can never be delegated to sovereignty, can never be, uh, represented. It can only be expressed. The general will can never be delegated to some, to someone else. If you do that, if you delegate the Authority for making law, you are, he wants to say on the first step down the road to tyranny because you give someone else some partial body or association, the power to make law over you. Oh, the law making function can only legitimately be jailed by the people themselves. Uh, I'm going to skip over a bunch of stuff that has to do very interestingly. I hope you can discuss it in your sections, perhaps with Rousseau's account of the legislator, the extraordinary individual who was responsible at the beginnings of regimes for shaping the general, for molding a people and for as it were, giving the general will a kind of shape and distinctive direction.

Speaker 1:          31:19          And I'm also going to skip, uh, for our purposes the very interesting and discussion of civil theology, which occupies the theme, the very last chapter of the book book for Chapter Eight where Russo talks about the way in which, uh, a civil religion must be tailored to, uh, bring about love and obedience to the general will. Uh, it was that chapter, I should say, that more than anything else led to, uh, the books being burned, uh, and band, uh, in Geneva and in other places and for its powerful attack on Christianity in that, in that chapter, uh, I'm going to pass over that with the time being, to look at the legacies of Rousseau and to talk about what, and I just deliberately use that word in the plural, the legacies of Roussel because there is virtually no part of modern life, uh, political, cultural, intellectual, moral, uh, with that does not in some sense bear the stamp or fingerprints of Jacques Rousseau Russo's description of the legislator as a kind of political founder, uh, creating, creating a people was for many, uh, in many ways.

Speaker 1:          32:40          Uh, the, uh, the, the, uh, closely, closely connected with the French revolution and particularly the claim of the revolutionaries to create a new nation, a new people, a new, a new sovereign, a new popular sovereign and France. Consider the following words of the famous revolutionary rubs. Pierre in his homage are Russo, a written in 1791 divine man. This is Rob's PR divine man. You taught my s you, you, you taught me to know myself while I was still young. You made me appreciate the dignity of my nature and reflect upon the great principles of the social order. The old edifice is crumbling. The Portico of the new edifice is rising up upon its ruins. And thanks to you, I have brought my stone to it, received my homage. As weak as it is, it must please you. I wish to follow your venerable footsteps. Happy if in the perilous career that an unprecedented revolution just opened up before us, I remained constantly faithful to the inspirations that I found in your text.

Speaker 1:          33:51          It can be no. People might tell you that the writings of Rousseau had no influence on the French revolution that the French revolution was brought about by bread crises and economic problems. And so on. Absolute Baloney. Uh, the, the, the writings of Rousseau, uh, had this powerful influence on the idea of creating a new people and a new nation. And yet, despite a, what appears to be a utopian and impractical and his politics, again, Russo had a profound influence on the politics of his era. He was approached during his lifetime, uh, to write constitutions for Poland and, and for Corsica. And of course, that was the island where a generation later, a man named Napoleon Bonaparte, uh, was, uh, born who attempted to, you might say in a, in some way extend route sows teaching not just a France, but to all of Europe, uh, at the point of a gun to bring democracy to all of Europe at the point of a gun.

Speaker 1:          34:58          Does that sound familiar at all in any way related to events going on now? Uh, we're, we're, we have a new kind of Bonaparte has perhaps, um, in many ways, although Russo's attack on representative government would seem to put him strongly at odds with the American constitution, uh, his glorification of the rural republic based on equality, moral simplicity, skepticism of commerce and luxury. This was to be re echoed in the writings of Jefferson, uh, with his ideal of a nation of small yeoman farmers. And certainly any reader of Tocqueville's d depiction in celebration of the independent townships of New England, uh, Tocqueville's account of this was directly dependent on, uh, his reading of Rousseau, the small scale experiment in direct democracy. That Tocqueville saw was a real world example of a kind of politics governed by the general will. And when you read those early chapters from Tocqueville's democracy in America about the New England township, you will very much see Tocqueville looking at America, do the lenses that were in some ways crafted or shaped by, uh, Rousseau.

Speaker 1:          36:17          Uh, and that influence was palpable on a whole host of later, uh, 19th century writers, uh, like toss die. Uh, for instance, who celebration of Russian peasant life was, uh, inspired by Rousseau in to Tolstoy, Rousseau influenced, uh, the establishment of the year Israeli kibbutz movement that was also founded by Russian Jews who had been influenced by toll. So you have a sort of self reinforcing cycle, uh, have influenced these, you might say small rural socialistic experiments and communal living, uh, exhibit the same kind of equality, self-government devotion to the common good that Roussel helped people imagine. Might be possible. And yet Russo's influence was not limited to politics. If he was a divine man, as Robespierre called him, he was no less so to Emmanuel Kant who claimed that it was his reading of Rousseau, uh, that led him to learn respect for the dignity and the rights of man.

Speaker 1:          37:23          Uh, that's what roots, that's what concept he called Russo, the Newton of the moral universe. Uh, Kahn's entire philosophy. And I hope you also have a chance to read cons, critique of practical reason in some later philosophy course. Concent. Tire moral philosophy is a kind of deepened in radicalized Roussel organism where what Russo called the general will is transmuted into what Kant calls the rational will and the categorical imperative. And it was not the least of Rousseau's a legacies that after his death, he became a hero both to, to, to the revolution, uh, and to the counterrevolution both to a revival of Roman style republicanism as well as to romanticism. Or if I couldn't use the words of a great Russo, Ian, a Jane Austin, he became both an advocate of sense and sensibility. Uh, Emerson Thoreau, uh, American transcendentalism with its worship of nature and it's protests against the kind of deadening and corrupting influence of society.

Speaker 1:          38:33          All of these people were the direct areas of Rousseau, Rousseau, his last work, uh, a book called the reveries of a solitary walker set the stage for later American classics like Walden Pond and generations of nature. Writers that have come after it and imitated it only by turning away from the noise and buisiness of society can one return to what proceeds society to the feeling of existence, to the feeling of or sweetness a of mere existence to the sentiment of existence. The something is swatch as Russo caused at the sentiment of the self, there is a kind of union that he celebrates with nature that puts the solitary, this Tyler Terry Walker, uh, either above humanity or below it. That type of man, a four shadowed by Rousseau. The solitary is no longer a philosopher in any sense that we would understand it, but might be better understood as an artist or a visionary.

Speaker 1:          39:40          Uh, he can claim a privileged place in society because such a person regards him or herself as the conscience of that society. His claim to privilege is based on a heightened moral sensitivity, uh, read it in his wisdom or is, uh, rationality. And it is this kind of radical individualism, the radical detachment of the solitary from the interests of society, uh, that is perhaps Russo's deepest and most enduring legacy, uh, for, for us today. So on that note, I wish you a good break. Uh, I hope you have a lot of Turkey to eight, and you come back well rested.
