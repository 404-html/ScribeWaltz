Speaker 1:          00:01          Uh, last time, uh, I ended by talking about, about Machiavelli, uh, as a both a revolutionary in many ways and a reformer of the moral vocabulary about virtue and vice good and evil. Machiavelli seeks to replace, to transfer to transpose and older vocabulary associated both with Plato in certainly most, perhaps more importantly with biblical sources, wants to transform all together the language of virtue to give it a new kind of meaning to change it from either platonic or Christian, other worldliness to a greater sense of worldly power. Virtual is for him or to use his term. Again, veer too is related with manliness, with force, with power. Uh, he tells us in chapter 25 of the, of the prints, uh, the ethic of the prints must be one of audacity and even more audacity and that famous, uh, and, and, and very [inaudible] image. He uses fortunate as a woman and you must know how the prince must know how to conquer.

Speaker 1:          01:26          The woman must be used through policies of force brutality or Udacity. Uh, this is the language of Machiavelli. Virtual, uh, is associated with the quest for worldly glory, with ambition, with the desire to um, uh, achieve success. And that's what I want to talk about at greater length. Today I want to talk about what in a political and philosophical literature about this is called the problem of dirty hands. If you want to join the political game, you must be prepared to get your hands dirty. And what Machiavelli means by that, how he, uh, comes to, comes to this problem in order, he argues to affect a transformation of European morality. It is, you know, their words to teach the prince as he says in Chapter 15, how not to be good, you have to go to the source of the morality. You have to go to this source of morality to effect the maxims, to affect the standards that govern our lives.

Speaker 1:          02:46          It is necessary to go to the source of those standards and those maxims. And that can only be found in religion. Oddly, it seems in some ways religion does not seem to be a major theme of the Prince, uh, in a, in a memorable passage. God bless you. In a memorable passage from chapter 18, Machiavelli advises the prince always to cultivate the appearance of religion. The prints he writes should appear all mercy or faith, all honesty, all humanity in all religion. He writes, adding nothing is more necessary to appear to have this last quality. Uh, the point is clear the appearance of religion, but by which you clearly means Christianity is good. Why are the actual practice of it is harmful? Think about the way in which that transforms, uh, what Plato says about justice. Uh, in his answer to Glau Conan book, two of the, of the republic where, or Thrasymachus where they both say it is more important is, is it not more important to have the appearance of being just then, then the reality of it.

Speaker 1:          04:01          And here you see Machiavelli in a way, adding his voice to that chorus. It is much better to have the appearance than the reality of religion. But in order to understand or to discover the core of Machiavelli's teachings about religion, I have to make a slight detour away from the prints and to his discourses unliving and in maybe the most important chapter of that book, book two chapter two called concerning the kinds of people the Romans had to fight and how obstinately they defended their freedom. Long title for a chapter to be sure. But here Machiavelli developed a powerful contrast between two opposed in mutually incompatible moral codes, the Christian and the Pagan.

Speaker 1:          04:54          If one asks oneself, Machiavelli writes, if one asks oneself how it came about, that people have old people of old and older in the ancient world were more fond of liberty than we are today. I think the answer he says is due to the same cars that makes men today less bold than they used to be. Less bold. And this is due, I think, to the difference between our education and that of bygone days. So what precisely is the difference that Machiavelli refers to here between our education and the education of bygone days that makes people, or that made people in the ancient world more fond of liberty as he says, then those of our contemporaries are Machiavelli's contemporaries. Machiavelli's emphasis here on education, particularly moral and religious education is the key difference between the ancient times and his own. These two different ages. He believes advanced two very different systems of moral and religious education.

Speaker 1:          06:06          One based on Pagan worldliness and the other based on Christian innocence. And it is that conflict as it were between what we might call worldliness and innocence. That is the car, uh, of Machiavelli's a moral code. Let me quote, Machiavelli is passage from the discourses at some length because I think it's very revealing our religion. He writes obviously thinking of the Catholic Christianity of his time, our religion. He writes, his glorified, humble and contemplative men, monks, priests, uh, you know, humble and contemplative men rather than men of action. It is assigned as man's highest good humility, abnegation and contempt for mundane things. Whereas the other that is to say be ancient moral code. Whereas the other identified it with magnanimity bodily strength in everything that conduces to make men very bold. And if our religion he says demands that in you there'd be strength. What it asks for is the strength to suffer rather than to do bold things. In other words, he says Christian strength, the strength of the Christian is the strength to suffer thinking of Jesus on the cross rather than to as he puts it, do bold things.

Speaker 1:          07:39          And it is not for Machiavelli simply the existence of these two different moralities that is at stake by softening morals. He believes by making us gentler, uh, Christianity has had some deeply perverse effects upon politics. So he claims this pattern of life. Machiavelli continues, appears to have made the world week and to have handed it over to the prey of the wicked. This pattern of life, this pattern of education, moral education introduced by the Bible and Scripture and Christianity has made the world week. In other words, by teaching humility, self abnegation, purity of heart. Christianity has made it difficult to develop qualities necessary. For the defense of political liberty. Christianity has made the world week or if you want to use his, again, highly charged word for that, it has made the world. If Feminine Machiavelli would no doubt be taken up against some board of offense today for using such a term, but that's his language. What can I say? This is why he concludes there are fewer republics today then in the time of the ancients because we do not have the same love of freedom that they did.

Speaker 1:          09:11          Now, Machiavelli's explicit, explicit referencing of the ancient civil religions, the ancient Civ off theology is it direct, is a direct tribute to the role of Numa Numa and Uma pneuma in Libby's famous history of the Roman republic, Justin, who was an authority on this text, can tell you more about it if you like, but in the opening books of Livy, he tells the story of how Rome was founded by Romulus who had murdered his brother Remez. But after this it required a second founding and the second founding was the work of a man named Numa who live. He writes, determined that Rome, which had originally been established through force of arms, should be reestablished through justice laws and proper observances. In other words, religion, in order to complete the founding of the city, it was necessary to establish it's God's and ensure proper respect for the law. PNEUMO was, uh, the bringer of the, uh, of the Roman, uh, legal codes, respecting religion, proper observances and the like. So, but Machiavelli, Machiavelli uses living and live in, in the story about Rome's second founding to bring home an important lesson about the utility of religion. Religion. He tells the reader is not to be evaluated by its truth content, but for its consequences for society.

Speaker 1:          10:56          But the story of Numa or his use of that story tells us more, more than just a lesson about cause social utility of religion. At the time of the founding of Rome, Machiavelli writes, religion was necessary to temper and control the warlike character, uh, of the Romans. Um, religion had had to bring a softening effect upon, again, the violent and, and be steel character of the, of the early Romans. But for us today, Machiavelli writes, religion has to serve the opposite purpose. It must instill something of a fighting spirit into people who have lost their instinct to resist encroachments on their liberty. I mean, in many ways, this is the deeper meaning a of Machiavelli's one's own arms. Uh, he uses in a, in a variety of passages, the formula that had good republic depends upon one's own arms and laws. And in a deeper sense, this idea of one's own arms means developing the capacities to resist encroachments on your freedom.

Speaker 1:          12:15          The prince, in other words, test to use religion to encourage his subjects to rely upon their own arms rather than on divine promises. And that again, is that teaching of his retelling of the story of David and Goliath, the biblical story of David and Goliath. And chapter 13 of the prints, you remember how Machiavelli retails and also rewrites that story. He tells, he writes the story saying that David went armed, uh, went, went into battle with Goliath armed only he says with a sling and a knife, a knife. Those of you who know the story checked against the biblical account of the story, knows that David only went into battle against Goliath. Armed with Saul's armor and his sling, Machiavelli gives him a knife. Where did this come from? Why does he add this? His subtle alteration of the biblical story.

Speaker 2:          13:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:26          It's hugely revealing. Its moral seems to be trust in God's promises. Yes, but bring a knife just in case. It's like the old joke. You know about the fighter who went into the ring before going into the ring and uh, yes, the priest to pray for him. He said, I'll pray for her, but if he can punch it, it'll help in the smallest respect. That's, that's Machiavelli Machiavelli's sense that his own country was deeply deficient in these martial virtues, a necessary to reassert greatness. And this was a theme of a lengthy poem he wrote. Yes. You'd surprised. Yes. Machiavelli wrote poetry and plays play. The men Dragila still performed. But he wrote an interesting poem, a lengthy poem called Ambit Siyani ambition, something like platonic, most, which lamented his countrymen. Countrymen's lack of civic spirit. And there need to be reeducated and the art of war. I only want to read a small section to you from that poem. If you attempted

Speaker 2:          14:52          to accuse nature, if Italy so wary in wounded, does not produce hard and bellicose people, this I say is not sufficient to erase our cowardice for education can supplement where nature is deficient. Stern education made Italy bloom in ancient days and made her rise and conquer the entire world and for herself make room. But now she lives if tears can be called life beneath the ruins and unhappy fate that she has reaped from her long lack of strife. Okay,

Speaker 1:          15:33          but now she lives if tears can be called life beneath the ruins and unhappy faith that she has reaped from her long lack of strife. And just from this little section of the poem, you can see that the theme of a new kind of education and only that can remedy nature's defects that Mackie, Ms Machiavelli calls them. It is this lack of strife, this long lack of strife that makes people weak. People are weakened by prolonged piece and they are made strong, fierce, and independent through war, only by hardening themselves. He says, well, it'd be possible for Italy as he puts it to rise and conquer the entire world in ancient days again, and made her rise and conquer the entire world and for herself make room. His point seems to be this. If you want liberty, you have to know how not to be good. At least as Christianity has defined goodness, the Christian virtue of humility, turning the other cheek, forgiveness of sins must be rejected if you want to do good as opposed to just being good, you have to learn. In other words, how to get your hands dirty. Between the innocence of the Christian and the worldliness of Machiavelli's new morality, there can be no reconciliation. These are just two incompatible moral positions that Machiavelli states, but he goes further than this.

Speaker 1:          17:16          The safety and security enjoyed by the innocent, enjoyed by the innocence, our freedom to live blameless lives and to have untroubled sleep depends upon the princess clear eyed and even ruthless use of power. The true statesman, the true prints for Machiavelli must be prepared to mix a love of the common good, a love of his own people with a streak of cruelty that is often regarded as essential for a great ruler in general. In another part of knowing how not to be good, knowing when and how to use cruelty or what Machiavelli telling me calls cruelty, well-used. It's well used. It's a virtue.

Speaker 1:          18:10          This is simply another example of how moral goodness grows out of an even requires a context of moral evil. Machiavelli's advice to you is clear. If you cannot accept the responsibilities of political life, if you cannot afford to get your hands dirty, if you cannot accept the harsh necessities that may require cruelty, deceit, and even murder, then get out of the way, and this is not for you. Don't seem to impose, don't seek to impose your own high minded innocence, sometimes called justice, your own highminded innocence. On the requirements of state craft because it will only lead to ruin in the modern era. The presidency of Jimmy Carter, for example, uh, it's usually taken as exhibit a of the confusion between Christian humanitarianism and the necessities of raising reason of state. You can't do the tough thing if you can't do the harsh thing. Machiavelli says, then stay out of politics

Speaker 1:          19:31          and don't attempt to impose your high minded morality on the state. In, as I said at the beginning in the philosophical literature, this has become known as the problem with dirty hands. So named after a famous play written by the French philosopher John Paul Sartre, the problem of dirty hands refers to the conflict of duties. Again, conflict of moralities between the harsh requirements of politics and the equally demanding desire for moral purity to keep the world at a distance. Machiavelli doesn't deny that there is something deeply admirable about the desire to remain morally pure, morally decent, morally innocent, but he just wants to say this is a very different morality from the morality of politics. In Sartre's play. Uh, the action takes place in a fictional eastern European country during World War II. Probably something like Yugoslavia were a communist resistance fighter. Reproaches an idealistic young recruit to the resistance who is resisting is barking at the order to carry out a political assassination. Why did you join us? The communist resistance fighter asks purity as an idea for the Yogi or the monk. Do you think anyone can govern innocently.

Speaker 2:          21:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:04          Do you think anyone can govern innocently? The phrase taken of course, from San juiced, the, the one of the leaders of the Jacobin reign of terror in the French level during the French revolution. What do you think, what do you think politics is? You know, a game of moral purity. The same kind of conflict, uh, is really very much at the car, uh, of the great political fiction, uh, of John Le Carre. Uh, the great, uh, you know, novelist of the, of the Cold War and the, and so on and in, in, in his great, uh, one of his early political thrillers, a book called the spy who came in from the cold. He depicts, they're a British agent who was working undercover, uh, and who at the same time as carrying on a love affair with an idealistic young English librarian who has joined the Communist Party, in this case a sh she, the communist is the, is the idealistic one.

Speaker 1:          22:04          She's joined the party because it will, she believes it will aid the cause of nuclear disarmament and we'll bring international peace. And when Lima's the spy a reveals to her that he is a spy, he tells her his view of what politics is really the nature of politics. There's only one law in the game. Uh, Lima says the expediency of temporary alliances, the expediency of temporary alliances. Who Do you think spies are? Priests. Saints. Martyrs. There's squall, a little men, fools, queers, sadists, drunkards, people who play cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten lives. You think they sit like monks weighing up right and wrong.

Speaker 1:          22:50          So both of these cases, the Satya case, the John Le Carre case in a way, uh, are interesting, but they're also sort of cases of what I think of his full machiavellianism, uh, kind of foam intellectuals engaging in tough talk, uh, to show that they have really lost their innocence, which is the sort of, you know, intellectual, uh, equivalent of, of, of losing your virginity. You know, showing you're not, you're not really innocent about the world. Machiavelli, of course, likes to play that game and it suggests that the world is divided between the weak and the strong between the realists who see things the way they are and the idealists who require the comfort of moral illusions. Uh, yes, Machiavelli's sometimes seems to corroborate this point of view. Does he not say that armed profits always win? The unarmed profits lose? Did he not? Right. Did he, did he not say that he wrote to reveal the effectual truth of things and not just what people have imagined the case to be? Yet it seems inconceivable that Machiavelli wrote an entire book simply to prove the obvious. That is to say that the strong will always crush the week and that politics is left to those who leave their scruples, uh, at the door.

Speaker 2:          24:16          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:17          The question is, was Machiavellian, was Machiavelli really that kind of Machiavellian? Was Machiavelli a Machiavellian?

Speaker 2:          24:27          Let's, let's see.

Speaker 1:          24:35          What kind of government did Machiavelli think best as he indicates at the beginning of the prince, there are two kinds of regimes. There are principalities and republics, but each of these regimes he says is based on certain contrasting dispositions or what he calls humors, humors. You, Maury humors in every society he writes, this is chapter nine of the prints in every society to diverse humors are found from which this arise that the people desire neither to be commanded nor oppressed by the great and the great desire to command and oppress the people. These are the two great political, psychological dispositions, the popular desire not to be oppressed and the disposition of what he calls the great uh, to command and oppress. Machiavelli uses these two psychological and even in some ways cuase I medical terms humors to designate two classes of people on which every society is based.

Speaker 1:          25:47          His theory of the humors in chapter nine seems in some ways to be rep reminiscent of Plato's account of the three classes of the soul or the three parts of the soul with one vivid exception. Each class of the city he says, is bound or determined by a humor, but neither humor is anchored in reason or rationality. Every state is divided into two classes expressing these two qualities, these two psychological qualities, the Grandy, the rich and powerful, who wished to dominate and the popular, the common people who wish merely to be left alone, who wish neither to be route to rule nor be ruled. Now, one might expect that the author of a book entitled the prints would favor the great, would favor the grand [inaudible]. Those who desire to rule our, these are not these aristocratic goals of honor and glory. Precisely what Machiavelli seems to be advocating,

Speaker 2:          26:51          okay.

Speaker 1:          26:51          Yet in many ways, Machiavelli proceeds to deprecate the virtues of the nobility.

Speaker 2:          26:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:59          Perhaps to our surprise, the ends of the people, the ends, the purposes of the people is more decent than that of the great since the great one to oppress and the people want not to be oppressed. He says

Speaker 1:          27:17          his advice is that the prince should seek to build his power base on the people rather than on the nobles because of their ambition for power. The nobles will always be a threat to the prince and an interesting reversal of the platonic and Aristotelian conception of politics. It is the nobles here who are said to be the more fickle and unpredictable, while the people are more constant and reliable. Remember in the platonic and Aristotelian view of politics, the democracy that rule of the people, the Deimos was always criticized for it being fickle and unstable and subject to whim and passion and so on. Here in Machiavelli tells us to just the great who are subject to this kind of inconstancy and the people are more reliable. The worst, the worst he writes to the prince can accept, expect from a hostile people is to be abandoned by them. But from the great, when they are hostile, he must fear not only being abandoned, but also that they may move against him.

Speaker 2:          28:27          The pop, the

Speaker 1:          28:30          Grandy are more dangerous and fickle. So the main business of government consists and knowing how to control the elites because they are always a potential source of conflict and ambition. The prince must know how to chase in the ambition to humble the pride as it were of the great and powerful. And this we will see, uh, as early as Wednesday becomes a major theme in the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes, humbling or chastening the pride of the few. The rule of the prints are sovereign requires the ability to control the ambition and to do so through selective policies of executions of public accusations and political trials. Remember the example that we read, uh, at the end of class on Friday, I believe from chapter seven, the example of Cesare Borgia and Ramiro d Marco, and how his execution, his bloody execution left the people. Machiavelli says stupefied and satisfied here is a perfect example of how to control the ambitions of the nobles into when the people, uh, to your side.

Speaker 1:          29:55          So Machiavelli's Prince Wa, well, not exactly a Democrat, uh, recognizes the essential decency of the people and the need to keep their faith. And by decency he seems to mean their absence of ambition, the absence of the desire to dominate and control. But this kind of decency is not the same as goodness. For there is also a tendency on the part of the people to descend into what Machiavelli calls idleness or license. The desire not to oppress others may be decent, but at the same time that people have to be taught or educated how to defend their liberty. 1500 years of Christianity, he says, have left people weak, have left the people week without their capacities to exercise political responsibility and the resources to defend themselves from attack. So just as princess must know how to control the ambitions of the multitude, uh, how to control the ambitions of the nobles. Excuse me. They, the prince is must know how to strengthen the desires of the common people.

Speaker 1:          31:09          Some readers of the prints, even some very astute readers of the prince has thought that Machiavelli's work is really, or Machiavelli's prince is really a kind of Democrat in disguise and that the prince is intended precisely to alert the people to the dangers of a use of a user pay. Terry prints, this is for example what the great 17th century political philosopher Spinoza believed about Machiavelli in his book called the political simply called the political treatise Spinosa road. Machiavelli wished to show how how careful of people should be before interesting its welfare to a single prince. I am led. Spinosa continues to this opinion concerning that most far seeing man because it is known that he was favorable to liberty, that spinosa on machiavellian because it was favor he was favorable to liberty and that the book he says, it's kind of a satire on princely rule or if you don't believe Spinosa, if you don't believe his authority is sufficient, consider someone who you'll be reading in a couple of weeks. John, Jack Roussel from this social contract, Machiavelli was an honorable man and a good citizen. Rousseau says, an honorable man and a good citizen who being attached to the house of medicine. [inaudible] was forced during the oppression of his homeland, disguise his love of freedom so that the prince was written in a way that disguise the real teaching of the book, which is the love of, of freedom and presumably the freedom of the people. Something of the type that Rousseau himself spoke about.

Speaker 1:          33:01          Maybe these comments go too far. I mean, maybe they are exaggerations and I, I think to some degree they are. But it's revealing at both of these very serious readers of Machiavelli took him to be an apostle of freedom. Spinosa taking him, taking his book to be a warning to the people about the dangers of princely rule. Roussel believing that he had deliberately disguised his love of freedom because he had to appeal to the tyrannical nature of the, of the Medici family. In either case, they regard him as surreptitiously taking the side of the people against the nobles.

Speaker 1:          33:46          In any case, whatever one makes up those examples. Uh, Machiavelli seems to be challenging important aspects of the classical conceptions that we've been talking about up to this point in the classical republic for the ancient republic of Plato and Aristotle. This repo, this, these republics were ruled by Nobilities, uh, gentlemen possessed of wealth and leisure who were therefore capable of forming sound political judgment. Who will dominate well, in Machiavelli's state, it is the people who are going to be the dominant social and political power. Machiavelli wants to redirect power to some degree away from the nobles and toward the people. One wants to know why. Why does he want to do that in the first place? He judges the people to be more reliable as he tells us. Then the great once the people have been taught to value their liberty, have learned to oppose encroachments on their freedom to be fierce in vigilant. Watch dogs read it in humble and subservient underlings, they will serve as a reliable basis for the greatness and power of a state. With the people on his side, the prince is more likely to achieve his goals of a robust civil life for his people and eternal glory for himself.

Speaker 1:          35:17          And does. Machiavelli likes to say the prince must know how to adapt to the times. What is true for princes is no less true for advisors to princes like Machiavelli himself. One must know the times and character of a people and the ancient republic. It may have been necessary to find restraints on the pat to defined and imposed restraints and the passions of the Deimos. But in the modern world he says, we're republics of become a thing of the past. The people need to be taught how to value their liberty above all else, the most excellent princes of the past were those like Moses. He tells us who brought tables of law and prepared people for self government. It is fitting and proper that the prince concludes the last chapter. Chapter 26 concludes with a patriotic call to his countrymen to emancipate themselves and liberate Italy from foreign invaders. So what did Machiavelli achieve? What were his actual accomplishments? Did he accomplish all he set out to do, to rewrite or to write a new moral code for political life to found a new political continent as he speaks about just fine to found new modes and orders a along the lines of Columbus. Did he achieve this one? First of all, one should not and cannot underestimate his unprecedented break with both classical and biblical antiquity

Speaker 1:          37:02          more than anyone else before him and perhaps more than anyone else since he sought to liberate politics from ecclesiastical control. The new prints is we've seen must know how to use religion, but, but needs to learn how not to be used by religion. Must not become a dupe of the religious. He must know how to use religious passions and sentiments, but not be used by them. Politics must become a purely worldly affair. It should not be limited or constrained by any transcendent standards or moral laws that do not derive from politics itself. Why there a law of God or some kind of transcendent moral order or code? Machiavelli's warning, we might say today to the religious right? Yeah. Res Critique of the religious right cannot be, cannot make politics conform to a transcendent moral law. But not only did Machiavelli bring a new worldliness to politics, he also introduced a new kind of populism. You might say, Plato and Aristotle imagined aristocratic republics that would invest power in an aristocracy of education and virtue.

Speaker 1:          38:33          Machiavelli deliberately seeks to enlist the power of the people, uh, grants the grant against aristocracies of education in virtue, he is a kind of pro Democrat almost who sought to recreate not through accident and chance, but to planning and design a new kind of republic. In the modern world, there are public that Machiavelli imagined and it's interesting while he tells us he's only going to the effectual truth of things and not the imagination of it. Nevertheless, and Machiavelli does himself imagine a new kind of regime, a new kind of republic in the modern world that would not be a city at peace, but would be a city at war. It would be armed and expansive. Machiavelli's republic feeds on conflict and war and conquest. It is aggressive and imperialistic, does it sound familiar? Is it us?

Speaker 1:          39:43          In fact, if you look at a brilliant article, I think in this week's new republic by Robert Kagan called Cowboy nation, Kagan demonstrates, I think with a great deal of conviction that the American republic from its onset has been expansive, aggressive imperialistic family conquest of the territory's, the expropriation of the native Americans, the acquisition of Louisiana, wars of liberation against Mexico and Spain, and so on, well into the, into the 20th and now the 21st century in aggressive, expansive imperialistic republic that he says has been our history and what it should say. What it doesn't quite say, I think is that this, it has been this history, not because it is American, but because it is a republic because of its regime type. It's regime character. That kind of behavior seems perhaps to be built in to the natures of republic. It was Machiavelli's admiration for the politics with someone once called the lupine politics, though wolf like politics of, of Republican, wrong, that led him to understand that all social and moral goods, uh, have been established by morally questionable means. Have we become or have we always been Machiavelli's republic? Machiavelli's desire. Think about that. When you're in your sections are writing your papers and you will get those paper topics on by the way. And finally, Machiavelli is the author of the new,

Speaker 1:          41:41          a moral realism by whatever means necessary, I think is his motto or should be his model by whatever means necessary. And I believe he claims to be merely stating out loud, merely stating, allowed what all writers have known all along. Bless you. It is necessary.
