Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. Good morning. We're going to, I'm going to show another movie today, but no, not tell a little bit later in the class. We'll get it. We'll get it. We'll get there. Don't worry. It doesn't, it doesn't fit until, until the, the last part of the, of the class. Uh, but today I want to talk about sovereignty. Uh, there are two great concepts that come out of hubs that you have to remember. One is the state of nature and the other is sovereignty. Uh, I spoke a bit about the first one, uh, yesterday or Monday rather. Today I want to talk about Hobbs. This theory of the sovereign, the sovereign state. Uh, the creation of the sovereign Hobbs refers to the sovereign is a mortal God is his answer to the problems of the state of nature, the state, the condition of life being solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.

Speaker 1:          01:02          And it is only the creation of the sovereign for Hobbes and Dowd or possessed with absolute power that is sufficient to put an end to the condition of perpetual uncertainty, anxiety and unrest. That is the case of the natural condition. Let me talk for a while about some of the formal features of, of Hobbs is sovereign power of the hobby and state. And the first place, what I want to impress upon you is that the sovereign is four hubs less a person then it is or he is an office. Uh, the sovereign is described by Hobbs is an artificial person by which he means the sovereign is the creation of the contract or the covenant. Uh, that brought this office into being. The sovereign does not exist by nature, but rather hubs tells us again, the sovereignty is the product of art or science. He's the CO product, the creation of the people or of what we might call and Jeffersonian language.

Speaker 1:          02:14          He is a product of the consent of the governed, the sovereign, and again, this is crucial is for hubs. The representative of the people. He is the sovereign representative. It is the people who endow the sovereign with the authority to represent them on their behalf. Uh, in a net respect, Hobbs is sovereign, has many of the features or characteristics that we come to associate with what we call modern executive power. Or Executive Authority when Louis, the 14th of France famously said, lay Todd saying why I am the state. He was expressing a peculiarly pre modern in that way, conception of the stake. That is to say he regarded the state as in some ways his personal property. I am the state, I am the state [inaudible] but this is very different from Hobbs is sovereign. The s the state for Hobbes is not the possession of the sovereign.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Rather the sovereign does not own the state. He is appointed or authorized to secure for the people. Uh, the, in many ways limited ends of peace and security. He has much the same function and to some degree, much of the same personality, uh, is what we would call a modern day CEO. That is to say there is a kind of anonymity in impersonality about the sovereign. I mean who, I mean, unless you're in the, you know, Yale Entrepreneurial Society who, who can name the CEOs of many companies and the answers, you probably can't, they are for the most part, relatively anonymous, uh, individuals and less, you know, they get into trouble like Ken lay or someone like that or do something amazing like Bill Gates for the most part. They are rather impersonal, uh, and, and anonymous. And that is in many ways the characteristic of hubs is sovereign hubs, is theory of the sovereign, interestingly, contains within itself elements of both secular absolutism and in some ways modern liberalism.

Speaker 1:          04:37          And it is the tension between these two that I want to bring out, uh, in, in my discussion here. The power of the sovereign hubs continually insist, must be unlimited. Yet at the same time he's tells us that the sovereign is the creation of the people whom he represents or it represents. Uh, although Hobbs is widely taken to be a defender of monarchical absolutism, you will note in your readings that he displays a kind of studied neutrality, uh, over actually what form does sovereign should take. A, he only insists that sovereign power remain absolute and undivided, whether it belongs to a single person, a few, uh, or the many. And among the powers that the sovereign, uh, he insists must control, uh, are for example, laws concerning property, the right, uh, of declaring war and peace, what what we would call foreign policy, uh, rules of justice, uh, concerning life and death, which is to say criminal law. And of course the right to determine what books and ideas are permissible. That is to say, uh, the right, uh, of censorship. In a sense. The core of Hobbes is theory of sovereignty can be boiled down to the statement that the sovereign and only the sovereign is this source of law.

Speaker 1:          06:16          The law is what the sovereign says it is. Does that sound in any way familiar from what we have read this term?

Speaker 2:          06:26          Any anyone sound familiar? [inaudible] do you remember that name?

Speaker 1:          06:34          Book One of the Republic Justice is what this stronger say it is. Hobbs tells us that the law is what the sovereign commands. This is sometimes known as the doctrine of legal positivism, which is to say that law is the command of the sovereign. I sort of command theory of law. And again, that seems to point back to a Thrasymachus his point of view, uh, in the first book of the Republic there is for Hobbes. As for Thrasymachus, no higher court of Appeal, then the will or the word of the sovereign, no transcendent law, no divine law and no source of authority outside sovereign command sovereign is appointed four hubs to be much like an umpire, uh, in a baseball or a football game. Just set the rules of the game. But the Hobbsy and sovereign, uh, unlike umpires are not just the enforcers of the rules or the interpreters of the rules. That sovereign is also the creator, the shaper and maker, uh, of the rules and Hobbes draws from this, the startling a conclusion in many ways, the infamous conclusion that the sovereign can never act unjustly.

Speaker 1:          08:00          Sovereign can never act unjustly. Why? Because the sovereign is the source of law and this the source. If the sovereign is the source of the rules of justice, therefore, hubs concludes he can never act unjustly. And he supports this example by a deeply perverse and uh, amusing. I have to say, reading from a biblical story. Do you remember this? He, he refers to the story of David and Uriah. Everybody will remember that story from Sunday school or Hebrew school or whatever. Does anyone remember that David was the king at that time? He was the king of Israel and he coveted Uriah as wife Bathsheba. He wanted to sleep with Beth Sheba. So what did he do? He had Uriah killed so he could, he could sleep with her. And Hobbes reasons this story that while David's action may have sinned against God, he did no injustice to Uriah.

Speaker 1:          09:05          Imagine that. I think Uriah might've had a different point of view about this. Uh, he did no injustice to Uriah because as the lawful sovereign, he could do any, not just anything he liked, but whatever he did was the Wa was set by the, by the rules of the law. And when Hobbs tells that story, which he, which he mentions a couple of times in the book, one can only imagine. He must've had a kind of wry grin on his face when, when, when he, when he wrote, when he, when he wrote that out. In fact, next semester I'm teaching an entire course devoted to Hobbs as critique of religion, uh, in which this will, among other things figure prominently, uh, but Hobbs is teaching about law is in some ways less draconian then then it might at first appear, he makes clear that law is what the sovereign says it is.

Speaker 1:          10:00          There can be no such thing as an unjust law. He infers again, because the sovereign is the source of all justice, but he does distinguish, he tells us between adjust law into good law, all laws are by definition just he tells us, but it doesn't follow that. All laws are by definition good a good law. He says chapter 30 is that which is needful for the good of the people. A good law is needful for the good of the people. But then he, but then one asks, what are the criteria by which we determine the good of the people? How was this determined? And Hobbes makes clear that the sovereign is not invested, uh, with the authority to exercise a kind of absolute control over everything that people do. The, the purpose of law Hobbes tells us is not so much to control, but to facilitate.

Speaker 1:          10:59          Consider just the following passage from chapter 30 section 21 Hobbes rights for the use of laws which are but rules authorized, he says, is not to bind to the people from all bow voluntary actions. It is not to bind them from voluntary actions, but to direct and keep them in such motion as not to hurt themselves by their own impetuous desires, rationalists or indiscretion as hedges are set not to stop travelers, but to keep them on their way. This is the force or purpose of law to, to set rules, to keep people as he puts it on their way. Uh, a law that is intended simply to constrain and control for its own sake. Hobbes says cannot be a good law. The purpose of a good law is to facilitate human agency in some ways. And I think again, that too is central to Hobbs is theory of the sovereign.

Speaker 1:          12:00          It's purpose is to facilitate not simply to control, uh, and inhibit. But the power to control or the power of law for Hobbs also very much applies. And here is one of his most, uh, um, controversial doctrines. It must certainly apply to matters of opinion to what, to what we would call today first amendment issues. Uh, this is something that Hobbes insists upon for the actions of men. He says, proceed from their opinions, actions proceed from opinions and in the end, in the weld governing of opinions consistent the weld governing of men's actions. So if we are, if we are going to govern or regulate human behavior, we have to begin by regulating opinion. And it follows from this. Hobbes believes that the sovereign has the right to decide what opinions, what books, what ideas are conducive to peace and which ones aim simply to stir up war and discontent in these comments of hubs about the sovereigns power to control opinions are directed at two principal institutions, the church. And guess what the other one is

Speaker 1:          13:25          the university. Both of these for Hobbs, he considers to be locusts. The focus of s or centers of seditious opinion, uh, that required to remain under sovereign control by the churches. Uh, Hobbs is speaking of the reformed church, but in particular he is concerned with those radical Puritan sect of the type that later or can't came and founded a America these radical sects that elevate matters of conscience and private belief over and above the law. That is to say arrogating to themselves, to the rights of conscience in the private belief, the powers to judge the sovereign. It was these dissenting Protestants. It was these dissenting sects formed the rank and file of Cromwells armies. Uh, during the civil war in England. They formed the rank and file of the Republican armies in England, uh, against the rule of the king. And Hobbes tells us he would banish all doctrines that profess to make the individual or the sect.

Speaker 1:          14:40          More importantly, in some ways, the sect, the judge of the sovereign, it is only in the state of nature. He tells us that individuals have the right to determine Justin unjust, right and wrong for themselves. Once we entered society, once we engage or, or conclude the social compact, we transfer our power to do this to the sovereign, to determine, uh, these matters for us. And just as important as the, as the radical churches in the ref, in the reforms. Sex, uh, is four hubs of the university and its curriculum in particular hubs is Fox, the universities for teaching what? For teaching the radical doctrines of [inaudible] it in the 17th century. Aristotle in this period was the source of modern Republican ideas. Ideas about self-government, ideas about direct in some ways what we might call direct democracy or participatory democracy. People who believe that the only legitimate form of government is one where Aristotle says citizens take turns ruling and being ruled in turn, it was above all the influence of the classics, the, the, the, the Aristotle and Cicero in particular that hubs regards as an important cause for the recent civil war.

Speaker 1:          16:10          And the regicide of Charles, the first considered the following passage that he writes as to rebellion against monarchy. One of the most frequent causes is the reading of the books of policy in history of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Reading of those books, uh, leads people to rebel against monarchy for which young men like yourself, he says, or what young women to for which young men and all others that are unprovoked guided by the antidote of solid reason, uh, who are susceptible. That is to reading these stories and reading these books receive a strong and delightful impression of the great exploits of war.

Speaker 3:          16:54          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:55          From reading of such books, Hobbs continues. Men have undertaken to kill their kings because the Greek and Latin writers in their books and discourses of policy make it lawful and laudable for any man to do so provided before he do it, he called him a tyrant.

Speaker 3:          17:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:15          Ah, that's what you learn. Hobbes believes from, from the reading of Aristotle and the Greeks enrollments regicide, uh, that the only legitimate form of government is a republic and that it is a lawful and even is your duty to kill your king. Uh, of course, before doing so, he says you must call him first a tyrant. Uh, it's a wonderful passage and this is so interesting, I think not only because of its humor and Hobbes is in many ways characteristic exaggerations, but because he shows, it shows how much emphasis Hobbs puts on the reform of opinion, the reform of ideas in many ways like Machiavelli, unlike Plato to before him, hubs regards himself as an educator of princes, an educator of in a transformer, a reformer of ideas. There was a kind of internal irony here I think because hubs sometimes writes as if, as we've seen as if human beings are nothing more than complex machines that mechanically obey the laws of attraction and repulsion. But he also obviously writes that we are beings with will and purpose who are uniquely guided by opinions, ideas and doctrines. And it is in many ways the first business of the sovereign to act as a moral reformer of ideas.

Speaker 1:          18:44          Hubs realizes this is a difficult and uphill task that he has set for himself. And in a rare moment of, of sort of personal self reflection or self reference, he notes, uh, somewhat, uh, drolly that the novelty of his ideas, uh, will make it difficult for them to find an audience. Uh, I am at the point of believing, he says this might, that my labor will be as useless is the Commonwealth of Plato.

Speaker 3:          19:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:18          He says in a moment of sort of uncharacteristic despair will be as useless as the Commonwealth of Plato. For Plato, he says also is of the opinion that it is impossible for the disorders of the state ever to be taken away till sovereigns be philosophers. And while in many ways initially despairing of the possibility of finding a sort of friendly reception or audience for his work hubs then goes on in a, in a more optimistic note to observe that his book is considerably simpler and easier to read than Plato's.

Speaker 3:          19:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:57          Can you might have a discussion about that over which witches? The easier one. But Hobbes believes it is simpler and easier and therefore more likely to catch the ear of a sympathetic prince. I recover some hope. He says, I recover some hope that one time or other, this writing of mine may fall into the hands of a sovereign who will consider it for himself for it is short. And I think Claire,

Speaker 1:          20:24          well, we might question that he says it's a short book and I think clear. He writes, well, it's complex and long, but nevertheless, uh, perhaps hoping that his advertising it in this way will gain the ear of a sovereign and that without the help, he continues of any interested or envious interpreter. And by the exercise of entire in protecting the public teaching of it, convert this truth of speculation into the utility of practice. The very end of chapter 31, uh, we'll convert this truth of speculation into the utility of practice. So Hobbes clearly believes he or thinks that this will be a useful book for a sovereign to read and hope, hoping it will gain the ear of a sympathetic, a sovereign or potential sovereign.

Speaker 1:          21:22          Uh, Hobbes may I think, overestimate a, or maybe I really should say underestimate the difficulty of the book. Uh, but he returns to this again at the very end of Leviathan, the universities, he says that where he talks again a little bit about the audience for the book. The universities he says are the fountains of civil and moral doctrine, the universities or the fountains of civil and moral doctrines and have the obligation to, to teach the correct doctrine of rights and duties. And this means for Hobbes. First of all, adopting his book is the authoritative teaching on moral and political doctrine in the universities. This should be the required textbook of political science, of political teaching in the universities to replace the older textbook, I. E. Aristotle's politics. Therefore, he says, I think it may be profitably printed and more profitably taught in the universities. He confidently, uh, asserts the ideal audience for the book.

Speaker 1:          22:29          He says, should be the preachers, the Gentry, the lawyers. Men have affairs who drawing such water as they find from the book can use it. He says to sprinkle the same, both from the pulpit and from their conversation upon the people. This is how he sees it. That it should be taught from the pulpit. It should be taught from the universities and from this conversation will be sprinkled upon the people hubs is hope like that of all the great political philosophers was to be a kind of legislator for mankind. This again is a book with, with epic, epic ambition.

Speaker 3:          23:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:15          Let me mention, uh, I've emphasized that in many ways the absolutist and authoritarian side of Hobbs is teaching. Let me talk about something that might sound oxymoronic. Let me call it for the moment. Hobbsy and liberalism hubs enjoys describing the sovereign in the most absolute and extreme term. Sovereign is to have supreme command over life and death, war and peace. What is to be taught and

Speaker 3:          23:46          yeah.

Speaker 1:          23:46          And yet in many ways that's the hubs again, sovereign aims to allow for ample room for individual liberty. And even he even set some limits, uh, under legitimate use of sovereign power for all of his tough talk. Uh, Hobbes takes justice and the rule of law very seriously, uh, far more seriously than for example, does. Machiavelli, that's it. One time in the book or one point, he maintains that a person cannot be made to accuse themselves without the assurance of pardon. You can't be forced to accuse yourself what we would call the fifth amendment. You cannot be forced to accuse yourself. Similarly, he says, a wife or a parent cannot be coerced to accuse a loved one and an a similar point. He maintains that punishment can never be used as an instrument of revenge, but only for what he calls the correction or what we would call the rehabilitation, uh, of the, of the offender.

Speaker 1:          24:50          Add to the above. Hobbes is repeated insistence that lost serve as an instrument for achieving social equality. In a chapter called of the office of the sovereign representative, Hobbes argues that justice be equally administered to all classes of people rich as well as poor. The equal application of justice. He maintains further, the titles of nobility are a value, uh, only, uh, for the benefits they confer on those of lesser rank or they're not useful at all. Equal justice. He tells us requires equal taxation policy and he seems to be proposing a kind of consumption tax so that the, the rich who consume more, we'll have to pay their fair share when he argues that indigent citizens who are unable to provide for themselves should not be forced to rely simply upon the private charity of individuals, but should be maintained at public expense. He seems in this way to anticipate what we might think of as the modern welfare state that, uh, that, uh, public, uh, assistance be provided and the poor are not simply depend on the private goodwill, uh, of, of their others.

Speaker 3:          26:16          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:17          But most importantly, I think is to go back to the individual. The importance given to the individual in Hobbs is philosophy. Hobbes derives the very power of the sovereign from the natural right of each individual to do as they like in the state of nature. And it follows, I think, uh, that the purpose of the sovereign is really to safeguard the natural right of each individual, but to regulate this right. Uh, so that it becomes consistent with the right of others. And not simply, again, a kind of open war against all of all against all. What is significant about this I think is the priority that Hobbes gives to rights over duties. This in many ways arguably makes him the founding father, or maybe we should say godfather of modern liberalism, the, the importance given to rights over duties of the individual over in many ways the collective or common good.

Speaker 1:          27:22          And I think this is expressed in Hobbs is novel. Uh, and in many ways altogether unprecedented teaching about liberty in chapter 21 very famous and important chapter. And here he distinguishes the liberty of the, what he calls the liberty of the ancients or what, what he doesn't exactly call, but I'll call the liberty of the ancients and the liberty of the moderns. The ancients, he believes operated with a defective understanding of human freedom. For the ancients, liberty meant, uh, living in a self governing republic liver living in a republic in which everyone again took some share in the ruling offices. Liberty. In other words, for the ancients was not just a property of the individual. It was an attribute of the regime of which one, uh, of which one was a member. The Athenians and the Romans, he says, we're free. That is they were free.

Speaker 1:          28:24          Commonweal's. Not that any particular man had the liberty to resist his own representative, but that his representative had the liberty to resist or invade other people. In other words, liberty for the ancients was a collective good. The, the liberty, as he says, to resist or invade other people. It was a property of the Commonwealth, not of the individuals who who inhabited it, but that sense of collective liberty. Uh, the freedom to resist or invade is not an, is in fact even opposed to the modern idea of liberty that Hobbs proposes. And by Liberty Hobbs means it's something that sounds very familiar to us. Liberty means the absence of constraints or impediments to action. We are free to the extent that we can act in an unimpeded manner. And it follows from him that political, political liberty means the freedom to act where the law is silent as he says.

Speaker 1:          29:26          Think of that, that where the law is silent, we have the freedom to do or not to do as we choose. Very important to the way we think of liberty today in a modern, now you might say liberal democracy, Hobbes is sovereign, is more likely to allow citizens as zone of private liberty where they are free to act as they choose. Then in the classical republic where there is a kind of coerced participation, uh, in collective affairs or in political deliberation and Hobbes here takes a dig at the defenders of the view in his own day that only the citizens of a republic can be free.

Speaker 3:          30:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:10          There is written, he says, and the tourists of the city of Luca and anybody, let me just ask before I continue this passage. Anybody here in Pearson College? So you know, you all know that the dean, Mr Amerigo, yeah, you're doing, your dean is from the city of Lucca. Ask him if this is true. Uh, when you see them there is written and the tourists of the city of Lucca in great characters, meaning great letters at this day. The word Libertas Libertas has written on the walls of the tourists of the city of Luca is find out if that's still true yet. No Man Hubs Can, continues convince, infer consents in furthered a particular man has more liberty or immunity from the service of the Commonwealth there then in Constantinople, the city of the Caliphs, the caliphate living in a republic alone doesn't guarantee you more freedom. He says freedom in that interesting passage. Freedom here requires as he puts it, immunity, immunity from service. A regime is to be judged for Hobbes on how much private liberty, how much immunity it grants each of its citizens and idea of individual liberty in many ways unknown and unprecedented in the, in the modern world. And in this respect, one can say that Hobbs has some connection to the creation of what we think of as the modern liberal state with its conception of private freedom, as immunity from forced co forced participation or forced, uh, uh, uh, participation in, in politics,

Speaker 1:          32:02          very different from the ancients. So what does this all mean?

Speaker 3:          32:07          Uh,

Speaker 1:          32:10          let me talk about what Hobbs has to say for us today. We who have in many ways become hubs as children hubs gives us the definitive language of the modern state, yet he remains in many ways, is contested for us as he was in his own time.

Speaker 1:          32:33          For many today, Hobbs is conception of the Leviathan state is synonymous with anti-liberal absolutism. And yet for others, he opened the door to John Locke and the liberal theory of government. He talked the priority of rights over duties and he argued that the sovereign should serve the lowly interest or the lowly ends of providing peace and security, leaving it to individuals to determine for themselves how best to live their lives. Nonetheless, the liberty that subjects, the subjects in joy in Hobbs is plan falls in that area. That the simply that he says the sovereign omit to regulate hubs does not craze vigilance in defense of liberty. And he denounces all efforts to resist the government. It best one could say Hobbes is a kind of part time liberal at best,

Speaker 1:          33:34          but Hobbs is best when he is providing us with the, in many ways the moral and psychological language in which we think about government and the state. The state is a product of a psychological struggle between the contending passions of pride and fear. Fear you remember, is associated with the desire for security order, rationality and peace. Pride is connected with the love of glory, honor, recognition and ambition. All the goods of civilization hubs tells us stem from our ability to control pride. The very title of the book comes from this wonderful biblical passage from Joe where Leviathan is described as king of the children of pride. And the 19 laws of nature that hubs, uh, IX develops in his book. Uh, really are there simply to enumerate or instruct us about the virtues of socio ability and civility, uh, especially directed against the sin of pride or Hubris. So the modern state is, we know it and still have it in many ways, grew out of the hubs, Ian Desire for security and the fear of death that can only be achieved at the expense of the desire for honor and glory. The Hobbsy and state was intended to secure the conditions of life, uh, even a highly civilized and cultivated life, but one calculated in terms of self interest and risk avoidance

Speaker 1:          35:22          hubs wants us to be fearful and to avoid dangerous courses of action that are, are, are inflamed by beliefs and honor, ambition and the like. The Hobbsy and fearful man is not likely to become someone who risks life for liberty for honor or for a cause is more likely to be someone who plays by the rules, avoids dangers and bets on the shore thing. The Hobbs and citizen is not likely to be a risk taker like a George Washington or Andrew Carnegie is more likely to think like an actuary or a CPA or an insurance agent. Always calculating the odds and finding ways to cover the damages. Later, political theorists like John Jacques Rousseau in Nicha would even develop a word for Hobbsy and man, they would call him somewhat contemptuously, the bourgeois.

Speaker 1:          36:37          But nevertheless, Hobbs was remarkably successful in converting us to his point of view, the type of individual he tried to create, careful self interested, risk averse. This is become the dominant ethos of our civilization has has it not. We even have entire disciplines like economics and psychology and I dare even say modern political science that reinforce this view of human nature. We have all become, whether we choose to admit it or not, Hobbes, eons. And yet at the same time, and here is the paradox, I think even a HUBZone and society cannot entirely exist without some individuals who are willing to risk life and limb, uh, either for the sake of honor, for self respect, or even just from the sheer joy that comes from risk itself. Remember my example on Monday of Ralph Esposito? Why do people become firemen, policemen, soldiers, freedom fighters, all activities that cannot be explained in terms of self interest alone will not even a Hobbsy in society, again, require fire departments.

Speaker 1:          37:59          And where will people come from that if they all follow that? The psychology of fear and self interest that Hobbes wants to instill in US Hobbes regards to these passions. What Plato called by the word fool most played up, Hobbes regarded these passions in many ways is barbaric, uncivilized and warlike. And to some degree he would, he was right even though, but even the HUBZone and state Hobbes admits himself the hubs and state lives in the midst of a HUBZone and world. That is to say the world of international relations is four hubs. The simply the state of nature writ large, the hubs and, and state will always exist in a world of hostile other states, unregulated by some kind of higher loss state stand to one another on the world stage as individuals do in the condition of nature. That is to say potential enemies with no higher authority by which to adjudicate their conflicts.

Speaker 1:          39:06          And in such a world, even a sovereign state will be endangered either from other states or from groups and individuals devoted to terror and destruction. Uh, think of September 11th, 2001, uh, this is a problem that profound political scientist by the name of Prs Nair, uh, a French student of Internet international politics has described as the dialectic of the bourgeois and the barbarian. A struggle that is to say between the modern Hobbsy in state with its largely pacified and satisfied citizen bodies and those pre modern states or maybe in some ways even postmodern states that are prepared to use the instruments of violence, terror and suicide bombings to achieve their goals. Uh, Hobbsy in state, paradoxically still requires from its citizens, uh, men and women prepared to fight to risk everything in the defense of their way of life. But the hubs, Ian, the point, the paradox being that the hubs, the and bourgeois cannot entirely dispense with the barbarian, uh, even in its own mist mist. Can Hobbs explain this paradox? He seems to avoided this problem has been brought out, I think brilliantly. Uh, in a recent book by a man named James Bowman, uh, a book called honor a history, he wrote a history of honor.

Speaker 1:          40:46          And here he points out that while affairs of honor is they are quaintly called have largely disappeared from advanced societies. That honors still remains a consuming passion in many parts of the world today, including for him. Most importantly, the Middle East honor in most societies is thought to be not merely a personal quality like something like medieval chivalry, but is above all group honor. The honor that surrounds the family, the extended clan or the religious sect and assault on one is an assault on all. This helps us to explain for instance, why in so many, uh, the concept of saving face is so important, even if to most modern Americans, it seems relatively trivial. Uh, in one reason Boehm and believes this is that we, that we have such a difficult time in understanding other peoples and other cultures is that the very idea of defending one's honor has largely been devalued.

Speaker 1:          41:57          Uh, in the modern west, uh, we tend to look at human behavior as a matter of providing rational incentives for human action. Why most people in fact are driven by a need for esteem and the desire to avoid humiliation. I remember, for example, during the Vietnam War when Richard Nixon spoke about, uh, achieving peace with honor, uh, and this was largely marked as a kind of ludicrous, uh, idea, honor to so many of us sounds quaint, like an honor code or the boy scouts a code or something like that, or something primitive, some kind of primitive ethic, uh, which we therefore don't really understand. Uh, we don't often see that it was in large parts. Hubs is efforts to discredit this kind of war. Your virtue, this kind of virtue of honor. Uh, that is so a part, so much a part of cultures, uh, that is, is also responsible for our current blindness.

Speaker 1:          43:06          And that brings me to my final point about our hubs and civilization that conceals from us a very uncomfortable truth, peace, the peace, security and safety, what we might call our bourgeois freedoms that we enjoy. Rest on the fact, on the uncomfortable fact that there are people still people who are willing to risk their lives for the sake of higher goals like honor or duty. Is that irrational for them to do so? Hubs would believe it is. I think he would say yes. It doesn't make sense from a purely Hobbsy and point of view that encourage us. It encourages us to think like rational actors interested mainly in safety and beating the odds. Hubs in many ways finds himself in the position of the young military lawyer played in the following movie clip. I'm going to show you, okay, this is the point made the point is made then I will not even provide any further commentary on what I know. I only apologized it for some reason I couldn't get the picture.
