Speaker 1:          00:01          Uh, well, good, good. It's, it's so nice to see you again on this gorgeous, gorgeous autumn day. And we had a wonderful, wonderful weekend. Didn't win. Yes, we did. Uh, okay. Today I want us to begin. We move ahead. We're moving ahead. Today we begin with Mr John Locke. Put the next three classes, Mr. Lock. It is hard to believe that a little book like this in this not terribly distinguished addition mind you, but nevertheless in this edition of just pissed over a hundred pages, did a book of this length could have such world shaping effects. If anyone would ever doubt the importance of ideas, political ideas in history. Uh, I would only say to you to consult the history and the influence of John Locke. A remarkable, uh, I want to talk today a little bit about Mr Locke. John Locke is for our purposes today. I mean, there are many reasons why one would read him in, in, in different kinds of classes.

Speaker 1:          01:30          But for our purposes, uh, John Locke gives the modern state, uh, the expression that is most familiar to us. Uh, his writings seem to have been so completely absorbed and adopted by Thomas Jefferson when he wrote the declaration of independence. That lock seems to have become virtually a, a kind of honorary, a founding father, as it were of, of America. Uh, among other things, uh, John Locke advocates, the natural liberty and equality of human beings are natural rights to such things as life, liberty, and what he calls estate or property. Uh, the idea that government, at least legitimate government is government by consent. Uh, that legitimate government is necessarily limited, uh, in, uh, limited government constituted by a separation of powers. And that when governments become repressive or that when governments become abusive of natural rights, uh, that the people have a right to revolution. Uh, in addition to this, John Locke, a, it was a famous, uh, advocate of religious toleration. Uh, his name is forever linked with our ideas today of what we might call liberal or, or constitutional democracy. He gives the modern constitutional state. It's, again, it's definitive and in many ways, most familiar expression.

Speaker 1:          03:16          Yeah, lock did not arise. X Nilo is nor did anyone. Locke's writings come from some somewhere and from some source. They were prepared in many ways in part by Machiavelli who had died approximately a century before locks, birth, but more importantly by another English writer or by an English writer with whom we have spent some time. Namely Mr. Hobbs. Thomas Hobbes, Hobbes Tuck, Machiavelli's idea of the prince and in effect turned it into a theory or doctrine of sovereignty. The Hobbs, he in sovereign, is it the basis of our, of our idea? Is it impersonal or what we might call representative government? Uh, he transforms princely rule. Hobbes does into an office into, uh, an, uh, an an office call. The sovereign and this office is for Hobbes. The creation of a social contract or covenant is he calls it responsible to the agents or persons who have created the contract.

Speaker 1:          04:34          Hobbes had taught that the sovereign is representative of the people who create his office in order to ensure peace, justice, and order. Without the power of the sovereign, we would find ourselves in a condition of nature, a state of nature term coined by hubs to indicate a world without civil authority or at least with only week civil authority, unable to enforce common rules and laws. Hobbs gave voice to the doctrine of secular absolutism, one that invests the sovereign with absolute power to do whatever is necessary to ensure again, the rule of law, justice and political stability. And out of these rather harsh, uh, and formidable premises, uh, lock created, uh, a different, uh, what we wouldn't meet think of is a more liberal constitutional theory of the state.

Speaker 2:          05:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:38          Why? Being still in many ways very dependent on the premises that that hubs again, modifying Machiavelli had, had undertaken lock, set out a process of domestication.

Speaker 1:          05:56          He set out, he set out to tame or to domesticate Hobbes is fierce or harsh theory of absolute government, which had found few defenders in his own day, uh, locks. Most important book political, at least his most important work of political theory of political philosophy is his two treatises of civil government, of which we are only reading the second the book we have before us is called this often simply referred to as the second treatise. But you will probably have suspected, I think that the second treatise was proceeded by a first treat us. The first treatise is much longer than the second treatise and it was an elaborate and painstaking one could almost say deconstruction of the theory of the divine right of kings, which in his era, uh, had received a expression by a man named Robert filmer whose name appears. I think occasionally in the second treatise filmer had written a book called Patriarchy.

Speaker 1:          07:13          And the Patriarchy had argued that, uh, all political authority derives from the grant of authority that God had given to Adam. And therefore that all legitimate authority has divine right behind it. Locks first treatise is a very important, but also I have to say extremely tedious work and you should be grateful that I am not assigning it to, but it's at a very interesting book in its own right of, of in many ways biblical criticism and exposition. But it's only in the second treatise, uh, that locks set out to, uh, set out his own positive theory of government. Is it worth this book was written. Uh, we now believe shortly before the famous wig revolution of 1,688 and in a lock sets out his theory of a parliamentary supremacy rule of law and constitutional government lock was, I mean, to put it maybe slightly oddly lock was in his day to some degree, what Aristotle was to his, the second treatise is intended as a practical book. Uh, it was a book addressed not so much to the philosophers of his age, but to Englishman written to them in the everyday language of their time.

Speaker 1:          08:53          Uh, he wrote to capture in a way the common sense of his time. Uh, although this is not to say lock was not at the same time a deeply controversy, we'll figure lock had the ability and it's a very, uh, desirable ability to take in many ways radical or even revolutionary ideas and express them in a kind of language that makes people believe that this is what they had thought all along. And that is to some degree the genius of the second treatise. Uh, in many ways that is it easier for easier for us because locks language has become, for us the kind of, I would almost take common sense or shorthand language for the way we think about politics. And it was again, his, a mark of his genius to be able to create that language and give it a stamp that seemed to make people believe that this is what they had simply been thinking all along.

Speaker 1:          09:58          Lock was himself a deeply political man, but he was also at the same time as I've just been hinting, perhaps a very reticent one. Uh, he lived in a period of intense, uh, religious and political conflict. Uh, he was just a boy, a school in school. When a King Charles the first, uh, was executed and he was an adult. When another King James the second, uh, was overthrown and forced into exile, a lock lived. I mean, he was a container, a younger contemporary of Hobbs, but he lived in a period of immense civil conflict and war lock spent many years at Oxford where he was both a student and a fellow and he was suspected, uh, throughout much of his time there of harboring a radical political sympathies, but he was so cautious and careful and expressing them. They, after many years, even those closest to him, uh, we're unclear as to what his opinions were. The master of locks own residential college at Oxford Bailey all college described Mr Lock as the master of tasks. Aternity.

Speaker 2:          11:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:18          Um, master of tasked Aternity because he could not discover, uh, through questioning and so on. Locks, locks, opinions on religious and political matters.

Speaker 1:          11:31          Just think of that. There used to be a very wonderful bust of, of lock, uh, in the, in the lobby of the British arts centre. And I used to recommend to students when they were down in that part of campus to stop in and look at his look at his face because as with Machiavelli or there's the face is very revealing. A, and I used to ask people to see, do you, do you detect in here the sense of tat, the master of tasks to eternity? That was so, uh, that is that his college master ahead and disgust lock, uh, was a private secretary in a physician to a man named Anthony Ashley Cooper. Uh, later, uh, known as large Shaftsbury. Uh, Shaftsbury had a circle, the Shaftsbury circle of, of political followers who were opponents of the monarchy and who were forced into exile in 1683 lock followed them into exile.

Speaker 1:          12:38          He spent several years in Holland, uh, in 1683 before returning to England again shortly before the wid revolution where his book, uh, the second treatise was published and where he lived until his death in 1704, just two years ago. In fact, Yale at the Beinecke library held a major conference, uh, in commemoration of the 300th anniversary of the death of Mr Lock. So those are a few things about his contributions and his context. I want to begin today, uh, the substantive part of this talk by focusing on the theme that in many ways forms the central core of locks, a political doctrine, his theory of natural law. This is a term that has come up from time to time. There is no modern thinker, uh, that I'm aware of who makes a natural law, is important to his doctrine. Uh, as does lock. The best way to observe the working or to reconstruct the working of natural law is to follow a procedure that we have seen before. To think about what is the condition of nature, the state of nature, where we can see the natural law in its operative form. The state of nature before lock in many ways as for Hobbs is not a condition of ruling and being ruled as it is for Aristotle. The state of nature is not a political condition. Lock describes the state of nature is a condition of perfect freedom.

Speaker 1:          14:31          Well, Aristotle said that we were by nature, members of a family, a Polis, a moral community of some kind, bound by ties of civic or family obligation lock understands by the state of nature a condition without civil authority or civil obligations. The state of nature is not for him and historical condition, although he does, uh, occasionally, uh, right referred to uh, the vast tracts of North America as, uh, suggesting, uh, W I a condition of nature, but the state of nature is a kind of thought experiment. What is human nature like? Uh, in the absence of authority,

Speaker 1:          15:24          the state of nature, Locke suggests to us is not in a moral condition as it was for Hobbes. It is not simply a condition of war of all against all the state of nature. He tells us, isn't in fact a moral condition. It is governed by a moral law or a natural law that dictates piece and socio ability. There is a moral law of nature that determines that no one should harm another person in their life, liberty or possessions. This law, this natural law lock affirms Willis Willis, the piece in preservation of all mankind. So the natural condition for Loc is a moral state, one in which a natural law again dictates the peace, peace into preservation. It is not a war of all against all locks. Natural law in some ways seems like a very traditional form of moral law. Familiar to readers of his time.

Speaker 1:          16:31          Readers who would have been familiar with the natural law tradition. Going back to Cicero, uh, the Roman stoics, Saint Thomas Aquinas, and in Locke's own day, uh, an important, uh, Anglican, a divine by the name of Richard Hooker. Locke's theory of moral law or natural law sounds comforting and traditional. And to some degree it is. All civil authority has its foundation. In a law of reason that is knowable by virtue of our rational capacities alone. The law of nature declares according to Locke, that we are all in his famous war term, the workmanship of one omnipotent in infinitely wise maker and his product of divine workmanship. We are never to harm anyone in their lives. Liberties or possessions lock again seems to effortlessly weave together the stoic tradition of natural law with these Christian ideas of divine workmanship into one seamless hole. You can see the way in which locks rhetoric here and his writing brings, brings together a different strands of the philosophical and theological tradition. Weaving them together in a kind of, uh, effortless, whole, almost.

Speaker 1:          17:59          Do not be simply seduced by this because even within, why do I say that? Because even within the same paragraphs, locks natural law, the law that again, mandates or dictates piece and preservation of all mankind turns into a right of self preservation from the beginning. You have to say, it is not altogether clear even whether the natural law is a theory of moral duty duties that we have to preserve, uh, others duties and obligations. Or is it, or whether it is a theory of natural rights that mandates that the highest priority be given to individual self preservation and whatever is necessary to achieve the preservation of the individual. The state of nature is a condition without civil authority. The law of nature, in other words, has no person or office to oversee, uh, it's enforcement or its application. So the state of nature that he wants describes our early describes in the book as a condition of peace and mutual distrust.

Speaker 1:          19:15          Quickly degenerate, sinned, do a condition of civil war or of war where every individual serves as the judge, jury, and executioner of the natural law, the state of nature quickly becomes quickly, becomes a hobby and condition, uh, of essentially every man for himself. Consider the following passage in section 11 of the second treatise, the damn unified person, uh, lock rights. Someone who has been mistreated in the condition of nature, the damn defied person who's been injured or mistreated has this power of appropriating to himself the goods or services of the, of the offender by the right of self preservation as every man has a power to punish the crime to prevent it being committed. Again by the right he has of preserving all mankind in doing all reasonable things he can in order to that end. In other words, uh, if you feel, or if you have been wronged or feel you have been wronged in the individual, in the state of nature, you have according to the natural law of for Locke, the right to as he puts it appropriate to yourself, the goods or services of the offender. And you have that too to take from them, uh, their, their goods, their property, their services in some way, uh, whatever you feel, uh, appropriate. Uh, as again, the person who has suffered some kind of wrong, uh, every person becomes, is it worth judge and executioner of the law of nature, the fundamental law of nature. Locke says, here is the right of self preservation in this states that each person is empowered to do again, whatever is in his power to preserve him or herself. Again, consider the following in section 16

Speaker 1:          21:15          and one may destroy a man who makes war upon him, may destroy another who makes war upon you or has discovered an enmity to his being for the same reason that he may kill a wolf or a lion because such men are not under the ties of the common law of reason. They have no other rule, but that of force and violence. So also they may be treated as beasts of prey, those dangerous or noxious creatures that we'll be sure to destroy him whenever he falls into their power.

Speaker 1:          21:50          Listen to that language. Uh, from an original moral condition where we are under a natural law, not to harm others. Uh, a law to preserve and protect the wellbeing of others of our kind. We have become like lions and wolves to each other, beasts of prey and other noxious creatures. What is the state of nature? But Eh, in, in the words of Dorothy, Gale Lions, tigers and bears, oh my, uh, this is what we are to one another. This is what I've come to think of his locks, Beastie airy. And in fact, the second treatise is rife with language of comparing human beings to and our behavior to animals. He speaks about lions and wolves elsewhere. He speaks about polecats and skunks and foxes and all this. How, if, if in fact we are all beings as he says, created under a natural law week. We seem to quickly degenerate into, into be almost be steel, uh, behavior, beasts of prey, far from being cooperative and peace, peace seeking creatures. Uh, the very freedom that such beings as ourselves enjoy in the state of nature leads us to abuse that freedom and in turn requires, or is it the basis of the need for civil government.

Speaker 2:          23:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:25          However, in the meantime, the question that any reader of the second treatise has to ask of themselves, and I hope you put this forward in your, in your sections to one another, is whether the natural condition is lock, understands it is one overseen by a moral law of justifying or sanctifying peace and security, or whether Hobbes is, uh, excuse me, lock state of nature is simply a thinly veiled description, a thinly papered over description of the Hobbs Ian War of all against all was lock, uh, simply hubs in some way in sheep's clothing.

Speaker 1:          24:14          You remember his famous test? Aternity lock seems to be speaking to very different languages. In other words, one of traditional natural law that holds out duties to others, uh, as primary and the other in some ways a modern hubs and conception of natural rights that maintains the priority, uh, of right and each individual's right to self preservation is lock. In other words, uh, and this is perhaps more of an historical than a theoretical question, is lock a member of the ancient in some ways sis Aronian and Tom Mystic tradition of natural law or a modern hubs. Ian, do his politics derived from a theological conception of divine workmanship or an ultimately you might say naturalistic, a conception or account of the human passions and the struggle for survival. Do his priorities go to duties or two rights or is lock simply confused? Is he confusing two different languages or is he being intentionally ambiguous in his account?

Speaker 1:          25:29          A recent book, uh, by a well known scholar, uh, of lock, uh, his argued I think quite powerfully in some ways. The, the idea that locks idea of equality, uh, in the state of nature, uh, specifically relies upon a certain kind of Christian theological context of argument locks statement in paragraph four of the second treatise, uh, his statement that, uh, there being nothing more evident than it creatures of the same species and rank promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature should also be equal to one and other. That walks statement that creatures of the same species and rank should be equal to one another. This is said to rely upon and dependent upon a very specific religious argument, what it means to belong to a species and why belonging to the same species confers a special rank or dignity, uh, on each of its members only makes sense according to this recent interpretation if you believe or if it is believed that the species in question has this moral relation to God. The question I think

Speaker 1:          26:50          is whether locks, idea of equality in the state of nature or his idea of the moral law in the state of nature relies upon this belief or whether it can be inferred from such things as uh, the basic principles of freedom. Whether this can be inferred as it were from purely a non theological naturalistic premises or grounds lock to be short is silent in the second treatise about the theological foundations of his position, there are no discussions of important theological figures such as Jesus or Saint Paul or the New Testament, at least in the second treatise. He discusses these issues at length elsewhere. These may be in some way thought of as background considerations. But the question remains, I think for us, whether these are deeply embedded in Locke's arguments about divine workmanship, uh, or whether or not that language of divine workmanship simply serves as a kind of window dressing, again, for a purely secular, naturalistic theory, uh, of, of, of, of, uh, of human nature and political authority.

Speaker 1:          28:18          Very important issue. Uh, I think in, in coming to understand lock and indirectly, uh, very important for how we come to think of the American regime. Because I'll just say simply as a kind of footnote to what I've been saying, uh, if lock, uh, is thought of in some ways as his doctrine, as being in some ways at the, uh, founding principles of the American regime declaration of independence, most notably, it becomes very important. Uh, it becomes part of a contemporary public argument. Whether those foundations, uh, oh, their authority to some kind of theological doctrine, uh, as Jefferson costs it. In the opening of the declaration, the laws of nature and nature's God seems in some way to have a kind of locking and overtones to it. Does do our founding doc documents imply a theology of some kind, the laws of nature and nature's God, or are those principles, again, purely of a naturalistic, secular kind that can do without theology altogether?

Speaker 1:          29:33          Uh, that, that, that is an argument, um, uh, a kind of scholarly and academic argument to be sure, but it spills over, uh, into, uh, many of our public debates over the role or place of religion in public life. Whenever we talk about issues of the appropriateness of a, of school issues like school prayer or the, should the 10 commandments be, uh, publicly displayed in, uh, in, in courthouses or another in other public places? Or if you want to take another famous Jeffersonian, uh, position, is there a kind of absolute firewall, a wall of separation between religion and, and, and to this state, these issues, uh, that we very much a work work on today and think about are, you can see deeply embedded in how we think about Locke and those opening sections of the second treatise dealing with natural law in the state of nature. So you can see again how these ideas penetrate deeply into the marrow of our public or political culture. Are we so different? Have we become so different? Uh, we'll people living 300 years from now think of us as so different and our public debates so different from those that animated the public issues in the time of, of John Locke. Maybe not. Maybe we aren't that different. So, okay. Enough for contemporary, let me go, go back to Mr. Lock. Uh,

Speaker 1:          31:27          the core of Locke's theory of natural law in the state of nature.

Speaker 2:          31:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:36          Is arguably lodged in his account of property.

Speaker 2:          31:42          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          31:42          Chapter five of the second treatise.

Speaker 2:          31:45          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          31:47          If you remember anything about lock after this class, remember chapter five, it is by all accounts, maybe chapter 19 as well, the theory of revolution, but chapter five kind of property, certainly in many ways, one of the most characteristic doctrines of Lockian political thought.

Speaker 2:          32:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:12          Locke's view of human nature is that we are very much the property acquiring animal. Aristotle had said we were political by nature. Locke says we are property acquiring beings, our claims to property derived from our work.

Speaker 2:          32:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:35          The fact that we have expended our labor, our work, something gives us a title to it. Labor confers value and is the source of all the values. The state of nature is a condition he tells us of communal ownership with Karl. Marx would have called primitive communism. The state of nature is given to all men and common Locke says it only becomes parts only of it become private property. Only when we add our labor to something, let me read a famous formula in sections 20 from sections 27 and 28 every man Locke says his property in his person. This nobody has any right to but himself. We all in other words have a certain Ph. We come into the world with a certain private property property in our person. No one else has a right to that. The Labor of his body block continues and the work of his hands we may say are properly his fur for labor being the unquestionable property of the laborer. No Man, but he can have a right to what is once joined to at least where there is enough as good left and common for others. That Labor Locke says puts a distinction between him and the common that added something to them more than nature. The common mother of all had done and so they become his private. Right?

Speaker 1:          34:14          So we have moved here in this one paragraph from the state of nature, which he says is common to all, to a condition of rudimentary private property, which we have in our body. Our person, which he says also includes, uh, the Labor of the body and the work of the hands, how we expand our activity, that Labor, he says, which puts something between us and the common becomes the source of ownership of things around us. And that ownership then in turn becomes a right. So they become, he concludes there, his private right. Uh, the source of a right to property. The natural law as hot as lock, uh, seems to be saying, dictates a right to private property and it is to secure that right that governments are ultimately established in a striking formulation. Lock tells us that the world was created in order to be cultivated and improved.

Speaker 1:          35:30          Those who work to improve and develop nature, who add to nature through the labor of their body and work of their hands, those who develop an improved nature or the true benefactors of humanity, of, of human kindness. God gave the world two men in common. He says, section 34, God gave the world two men in common, but since he gave it to them for their benefit and the greatest conveniences of life that they were capable to draw from it, he writes, the world was given for our convenience. It says to be drawn from it cannot be supposed. He meant it should always remain common and uncultivated and then he adds, he gave it to the use of the industrious and the rational and not to the fancy or covetousness of the quarrelsome and contentious God gave the world for our improvement of it. And therefore he gave it to the industrious.

Speaker 1:          36:36          And the rational lock seems to suggest in that very phrase that the state will be a commercial state, that the Lockian republic or the Lockian state will be a commercial republic. Think of that ancient political theory, Plato, Aristotle regarded commerce, regarded a property is in many ways subordinate to the life of the citizen. Plato would have instituted a kind of communism of property, uh, among the guardians of his calypso. Aristotle regarded the necessity thought, thought of the necessity of private property, but simply as a means to allow a few those citizens to engage in political life. Economy, uh, you might say, was always subordinate to the polity. Lock turns this doctrine, this ancient and medieval doctrine is well on its head. In many ways. The world belongs to the industrious and the rational. Those who through their own efforts, through their labor and work increase and enhance, uh, the plenty of all, it is only a relatively short step from John Locke to Adam Smith in that respect.

Speaker 1:          38:02          The great author of the wealth of nations, again about a century after, just under a century after Locke's second treatise for lock. And let me just go on a little more about this. There are no natural limits to property acquisition and this is in a way the essential point, the introduction of money or coinage into the state of nature issue. I'm not going to talk much about here, but that becomes an important moment in his chapter five in his account of the state of nature. The introduction, the introduction of money makes unlimited capital accumulation, not only possible, but even a kind of moral duty. It becomes our duty to enhance and work upon the raw materials of the natural world around us. By enriching ourselves. We unintentionally, uh, work for the benefit of others. Consider the following remarkable sentence, a king of a large and fruitful territory in America.

Speaker 1:          39:09          He says, feeds lodges and is clad worse than a day laborer in England. Uh, because of course our work, Locke thinks has, has enhanced that the plenty of all in some way, the creation of a general planted of a general planty the Commonwealth. And think of the way in which the revealing use of that term Commonwealth, uh, con, the wealth of all is do in many ways to the emancipation of labor from the previous kinds of moral and political restrictions imposed upon it by the ancient philosophical as well as religious traditions. Labor becomes four lock the source of all value and our title two common ownership and in a remarkable a rhetorical series of shifts he makes, not nature but rather human labor and acquisition, this source of property and an unlimited material possessions. He begins this chapter, chapter five with the assertion. Think about it, that God hath given the World Two men in common.

Speaker 1:          40:23          Once again suggesting that the original state is one of common ownership. He then suggests that every person is the owner of their own bodies and that one acquires a title two things to Labor that we have mixed with that common world, but what starts as a very, very modest title to the objects that we have worked on it. His example is nothing as simple as something as sort of simple as picking apples from a tree. The act of picking gives us a title too to the apple, that very simple, a rudimentary form of property soon turns into a full scale explanation of the rise of property and a kind of market economy in the state of nature. Labor accounts, he tells us for 10 times the amount of value, uh, that is provided by nature alone. He says it 37 section 37 our labor enhances the value of nature 10 times, but he then goes on to add very quickly.

Speaker 1:          41:33          I have here rated the improved land very low in making its product, but as one to 10 when it is much nearer a hundred to one our labor in advances things a hundred fold. Shortly later in section 43 he has said, he says that the value of anything is improved a thousand fold due to labor. Again, what began is that fairly rudimentary discussion of the origins of private property at the beginning of section five chapter five limited by the extent of our use and spoilage has by the end of that same chapter you might say, morphed into an account of large scale ownership with considerable inequalities of wealth and possession. By the end of chapter five there appears to be almost a direct link between locks, dynamic theory of property and chapter five and James Madison's famous statement in federalist number 10 that is Madison says the protection of different, an unequal faculties of acquiring property is the first object of government. Yeah. It seems to vary. Lockian proposition in the federalist lock gives, in other words to commerce to moneymaking, to Aquas, to acquisitiveness a kind of pride of place and just sort of moral status you might even call it that. It never enjoyed in the ancient and medieval worlds. The new politics of Lockian of the Lockian state will no longer be concerned with glory, honor through most virtue. But locking and politics will be sober, will be pedestrian, it will be hedonistic

Speaker 1:          43:34          without sublimity or joy lock is the author of the doctrine. Did Commerce, softens manners, did it makes us less warlike that it makes us civilized. Something that reaches its a, you might say, highest expression. In the 20th chapter, The 20th book of Monto skews a spirit of the laws. Commerce does not require us for lock to spill blood or risk life. It has solid, reliable, thoroughly middle class. Uh, in some ways, lock is the, again, the great author of the idea that the task of government is to protect not just the rights of property, but the right to acquire and build upon, uh, the property that we already own. Sorry, what to end on this note and begin, uh, on Wednesday talking a little bit about what we might call John Locke and the spirit of capitalism.
