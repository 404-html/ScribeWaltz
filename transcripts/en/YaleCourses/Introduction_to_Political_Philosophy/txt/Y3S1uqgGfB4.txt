Speaker 1:          00:02          Okay, today. What a, what a joy. What a joy. We start hubs and he's one of the great, this is one of the great treats.

Speaker 2:          00:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17          Thomas Hobbs was the author of the first and I believe undoubtedly the greatest work of political theory written in the English language. Uh, he was a master of English style and prose and his work ranks among the very greatest in this or any other language, Leviathan is to pros what Milton's paradise lost is to epic poetry.

Speaker 2:          00:58          Think about that.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Hobbs was in many ways a perfect foil for Machiavelli. He played the part of Dr. Watson to Machiavelli's Sherlock Holmes pubs. In other words, carried out what Machiavelli had helped to make possible. Machiavelli, you remember claimed to have discovered a new continent, new modes and orders. It was Hobbs who helped to make this new content at habitable. Machiavelli, you might say, cleared the brush. He was the Lewis and Clark or the Columbus hubs built the houses and institutions. Hobbes provided us with the definitive language in which even today, we continue to speak about the modern state.

Speaker 1:          02:12          However, uh, and this is what I want to emphasize, uh, throughout our reading of Hobbes, he has always been something of a paradox to his readers. And the one hand you will find Hobbs, uh, the most articulate, articulate defender of political absolutism, uh, Hobson, the Hobson and doctrine of sovereignty over the hubs and sovereign is to have a complete monopoly of power within his given territory. In fact, the famous frontest piece of the book, which is reproduced in your addition, although it's not altogether very clear, it's not a very good reproduction. The famous frontest piece to the original 1651, uh, addition of Leviathan depicts, uh, the Leviathan, uh, depicts the state, uh, the sovereign holding a sword in one hand in the sector in the other and the various institutions of this civilian and churchly ecclesiastical authority on, on each side. The sovereign holds total power over all the institutions of civilian and ecclesiastical life holding sway over a kind of peaceable kingdom add to this, uh, to the doctrine of indivisible sovereign power hubs, hubs, his insistence that the sovereign exercise complete control over the churches, over the university curricula.

Speaker 1:          03:54          And over what books and opinions can be read in taught. He seems to be the perfect model of absolutism and have absolute government. You have to consider also the following. Hobbes insists on the fundamental equality of human beings who he says are endowed with certain natural and inalienable rights. He maintains the state is a product of a covenant or a compact or contract of kind of a sword between individuals and that the sovereign owes his authority to the will or the consent of those he governs. And finally that the sovereign is authorized only to protect the interests of the govern by maintaining civil peace and security. From this point of view, it would seem that Hobbes helps to establish the language of what we might think of is the liberal opposition to absolutism. And this paradox was noted in even in Hobbs his own time. Was he a defender of royalism and the power of the king or was he a defender or an opponent of royalism? I mean in many ways to be sure Hobbs was a product of his time. What else could he be? But Hobbs lived at a time when the modern system of European states, even as we understand them today, was just the beginning to emerge. Three years before the publication of Leviathan, 1651, the signing of the Treaty of Westphalia famous,

Speaker 2:          05:49          uh,

Speaker 1:          05:50          peace treaty brought an end to more than a century of religious war that had been ignited by the Protestant reformation. The treaty of vest failure, um, officially put an end to the 30 years' war. But more than that, it ratified to decisive features that would be given powerful expression by Hobbs. First, the treaty declared that the individual sovereign state would hence forth become the highest level of authority. You might say putting an end once. And for all to the universalist claims of the holy Roman Empire, each state was to be sovereign and to have its own authority. And secondly, that the head of each state would have the right to determine the religion of the state. Again, Dus, putting an end to the claims of a single universalist church. This is what the Treaty of Westphalia, uh, put into practice. And among other things, what Hobbs attempted to express in theory in his book.

Speaker 2:          07:09          Okay,

Speaker 1:          07:09          the autonomy and authority of the sovereign and the sovereign power to establish, uh, what religious doctrine or what even more broadly, what opinions are to be taught and held within a community within a state who was hot. So let me, let me say a word about him. Hobbes was born in 1588, uh, the year that the English naval forces drove back the invasion of the famous Spanish Armada. He grew up in the waning years, the last years of the Elizabethan era, and he was a boy when Shakespeare's most famous plays were first performed hubs. Like many of you, what's a gifted student? And he went to college. His father, who was a local pastor from the south west of England, sent him to Oxford, although he went at the age of 14 and after he graduated, he entered the service of an aristocratic family, the Cavendish family where he became a private tutor to their son.

Speaker 1:          08:30          His first book was a translation of the acidities history of the Peloponnesian war, which he completed in 1629. Who Cities The great historian of the Peloponnesian War, who we've met a mentioned before. When we, when we talked about Plato, a habits was a gifted classical scholar. He spent a amount of time on the European continent, uh, with his young two t Mr Kevin dish. Uh, and while he spent time in Europe, he, he met gala. He met Galileo and Rene Descartes. Um, it was during the 1640s, the period, uh, that initiated the great civil wars, uh, in England, uh, and the execution of the King Charles the first, uh, that hubs left England to live in France. Uh, why the fighting went on. He left England with, uh, many of the, the, uh, the royal families, the aristocratic families who were threatened by the Republican armies, uh, organized by, by Chrom.

Speaker 1:          09:43          Well, and that had executed the king. In fact, the three justices, the three judges who were in charge of the judicial trial of, uh, Charles, the first king, King Charles, the one who lost his head. Uh, those three judges later found a home where in new haven they came to new haven. The three judges judge Whaley, golf and Dixwell cause it sound familiar? Yes. New Haven was in part started by founded by members of the, uh, you might say the Republican opposition, uh, to row two to royalty and to the, uh, to the, to the English king in any way. Hobbs. However, it was deeply distressed by the outbreak of war and you spent a great deal of time reflecting on the causes of war and political disorder. His first treatise, uh, a book called Day Civi or day keyway, depending on how you pronounce it. I'm the citizen, uh, was published in 1642 and it was a kind of draft version of Leviathan that was published almost a decade later.

Speaker 1:          10:57          Again, in 1651 hubs returned to England the same year of the book's publication and spent most of the rest of his long life. A Leviathan was written well into his sixties. He was 63 when it, when it was published. Uh, he spent the rest of his long life working on scientific and political problems. He wrote a history of the English civil wars, uh, called behemoths, which remains a classic of the analysis of the causes of social conflict. And as if this were not enough near the very end of his life, uh, he returned to his classical studies translating all of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. Uh, he died in 1679 at the age of 91 from the various portraits, uh, and descriptions of Hobbs. Uh, we can tell he was a man of considerable charm and I wish the book that we had had his picture, a reproduction of this portrait on it, but I just want to read, uh, one brief passage from his biographer.

Speaker 1:          12:14          A man named John [inaudible] who knew him, uh, who, who, who knew him. It was written during hubs is lifetime. Aubrey wrote about Hobbs. He had a good eye and that of Hazel Color, which was full of life and spirit even to the last, when he was earnest in dis, in discourse. These shown as it were, a bright as if a bright live coal within it. He had two kinds of looks when he laughed, was witty. And in a Mary humor, one could scare see his eyes. And by and by when he was serious and positive, he opened his eyes around. He was six foot high and something better. So it was very, very tall. In the 17th century, he was six foot high and very better. He was. He was, he had read much if one considers his long life, but his contemplation was much more than his reading.

Speaker 1:          13:08          He was want to say that he did it, that if he had read as much as other men, he should have known no more than other men. Uh, so his point was he had read a lot, but what was most important was his, his thinking, if he had red is not as much. He would know his little. Let's do a little sense of hubs, his spirit, his humor, the wry wit that becomes a parent on, on almost every, every page of this book. But you have to be a careful reader. Hubs was deeply controversial, as you might suspect during his lifetime. Leviathan was excoriated by almost every reader of the text to the church men. Uh, he was a godless atheist, uh, to the Republicans. He was tainted with monarchy or monarch ism and to the monarchists, he was a dangerous skeptic. Uh, and free thinker hubs.

Speaker 1:          14:14          Again, along with Machiavelli was one of the great architects of the modern state. And to some degree he even seems to speak. He see, he seems even more characteristically modern than Machiavelli. I mean, considers just some of the following. Machiavelli speaks of the prince while hubs speaks of the sovereign that is a kind of impersonal or in Hobbs is language, artificial power, uh, created out of a contract. Hobbes is method, seems scientific. It seems formal and analytical in contrast to Machiavelli's combination of historical commentary in reflection drawn from personal experience. Well, Hobbs, I, excuse me. While Machiavelli often spoke of the sublime cruelty, uh, of men like Skipio and Hannibal hubs speaks the more pedestrian language, the language of power politics, where the goal is not glory and honor, but self preservation. And Machiavelli's emphasis upon law upon arms, uh, is considerably attenuated by Hobbs, is emphasis on laws. Hubs, in other words, tried to render acceptable, tried to render palatable. What Machiavelli had done by providing a more precise and more legal and institutional framework for the modern state. So let's think a little bit about what it was that Hobbes was attempting to accomplish.

Speaker 3:          16:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:05          Hubs like Machiavelli was an innovator and he was self consciously aware of his innovations, can like Machiavelli who said in the 15th chapter of the prints that he would be the first to examine the effectual truth of things as opposed to the imaginings of them. Hubs wrote that civil science, that's what he called political science. Civil Science was no older than my book day Keyway, modern political science, he said began with his, this book of 1642. What, what did he think of as his novelty? What, what was new? What was revolutionary about or innovative about Hobbs is political science.

Speaker 1:          16:58          Hobbes clearly saw himself in many respects, is founding, uh, political science modeled along that of the early founders of the scientific revolution. Galileo, I've already indicated that Hobbes had met William Harvey, Rene Descartes, a handful of others who were part of what we think of is the modern scientific revolutionaries. Unlike these other revolutionaries who had overthrown a, you might say, the Aristotelian Paradigm in natural science hubs set out to undermine the authority of Aristotle in civil science, in political and moral science. Hobbes set himself up as the Great Anti Aristotle, the great, uh, opposition to Aristotle considered just the following passage from Leviathan with one of my favorite titles from the book, a chapter called of darkness from vein philosophy and fabulous traditions. In that chapter, Chapter 46 hobs writes, there is nothing so absurd that the old philosophers have not, some of them maintained. And I believe that scares anything could be more absurdly said in natural philosophy then that which is now called Aristotle's metaphysics normal repugnant to government then much that he has said in his politics, nor more ignorantly then a great part of his ethics. So there you say Hobbs laying down a challenge. What was it that he claimed to find so absurd, repugnant and ignorant, uh, in Aristotle. Why did he, what did he, what was he trying to and thrown? D dethrone and Aristotle.

Speaker 3:          19:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:07          Hubs is typically concerned, uh, with the foundations of this new science. Getting the building blocks right from the beginning, the opening chapters of Leviathan, which I've only assigned a few, but the opening chapters present a kind of political physics where human beings are reduced to body and the body is further reduced to so much matter and emotion. Human beings can be re reduced to their movable parts, much like a machine. What does life, he asks rhetorically and in the introduction, what is life but emotion of the limbs? What does the heart but a spring or reason but a means of calculating pleasures and pains he sets out to give a deliberately and thoroughly materialistic and non teleological physics of human nature. In fact, a French disciple of Hobbs in the next century, a man named La Tree, uh, wrote a treatise very much following in the lines of Hobbs called Lum machine or literally man a machine. This is the way Hobbs Hobbs is. New Science of politics appears to begin and that new beginning is intended to offer in many ways it comprehensive alternative to Aristotle's physics or Aristotle's politics.

Speaker 1:          20:46          Aristotle argues that all action is goal directed, is goal oriented. All actions aim at preservation or change it, making something better or preventing it from becoming worse. Hubs believed, on the other hand, did the overriding human fact, uh, of the overriding motivation of human behavior is largely negative, not the desire to do good, but the desire to avoid some evil. Aristotle for Hobbes had simply seeing the world through the wrong end of the telescope. For Aristotle, human beings have a goal or a t loss, which is to live a life in community with others for the sake of human flourishing. But for hubs, we enter into society, not in order to fulfill or perfect our rational nature, but rather to avoid the greatest evil, namely death or fear of death at the hands of others. Politics for him is less a matter of prudential decisions of better and worse than it is, you might say, an existential decision of choosing life or death for Hobbs in many ways. As for Machiavelli, uh, it is the extreme situation of life and death of chaos and war. They'd come to serve as the norm for politics in political decision making,

Speaker 1:          22:31          fundamental alternative or challenge to Aristotle. And furthermore,

Speaker 1:          22:39          Hobbs not only criticized you might see the foundations, the motivational and psychological foundations, uh, of Aristotle's theory of politics and human nature. He blamed the influence of Aristotle, uh, for much of this civil conflict of his age. Aristotle who was increasingly being embraced by Civic Republicans in England of his time, uh, had been brought up according to Hobbs on Aristotle's teaching. That man is by nature a political animal. This was again, the thesis of the classical Republican's according to which, uh, we are only fully human or we only become fully human when we are engaged in political life, in ruling ourselves by laws of our own making, which was a doctrine that Hobbes attributes to many of the, uh, teaching, uh, much of the teaching at the university, the universities of his age. And it is precisely this desire to be self governing. You might say to rule directly, you have a direct part in political rule that saw Hobbs is one of the great root causes of civil war. And his answer to Aristotle and the classical Republican's of his age was his famous doctrine of what we might call indirect government or what perhaps would be more familiar to us by the term representative government. The sovereign

Speaker 1:          24:22          is not four hubs. The people or some faction of the people ruling directly in their collective capacity. Uh, the sovereign is four hubs. The artificially reconstructed will of the people in the person of their representative, the sovereign representative act, you might say like a filter for the wills and passions of the people. The sovereign is not the direct expression of my will or your will, but rather an abstraction from my natural desire to rule myself in. In other words, instead of seeking to participate directly in political rule, Hobbes wants us to abstain from politics by agreeing to be ruled by this artificial man is, he calls it this artificial person or representative that he gives the name, the sovereign four by art. He says in the introduction for by art is created that great leviathan called the Commonwealth or the state, which is but an artificial man though of greater stature and strength than the natural for whose protection and defense it was intended to. Sovereign, he says, are Leviathan, this great artificial man. It isn't that the sovereign is something more like what we would call today an office rather than a person is when we speak of the executive as an office. Uh, and it is the, it is simply the person who inhabits the office.

Speaker 2:          26:09          Uh, although

Speaker 1:          26:11          that might be somewhat questionable in some of our recent executive decisions. But for Hobbes, Hobbes creates this office of, of of a political of call call the sovereign. Now there's language in that sentence that I just read from, from the introduction for by art again is created that great leviathan called a Commonwealth or state when hubs uses the term art, there are four. By art is created. That term is deeply revealing of his purpose. Again, for Aristotle, by contrast, art presupposes nature or in other words, nature precedes art. Nature supplies the standards, the materials, the models. For all the later arts, the city being by nature, man by nature, nature provides a standard nature proceeds, art and human artifice or human making. But for Hobbs. Think of this, think of this by contrast are, does not so much inner imitate nature. Rather art can create a new kind of nature and artificial nature and artificial person as it were. Do Art again is created the Great Leviathan.

Speaker 1:          27:44          Do art properly, understood and buy art? Of course. I mean something like human making, human ingenuity, human art, Ful, ness, uh, through art we can begin not just to imitate, but we can transform nature. Make it into something of our own. Choosing art here is not to be understood also is the antithesis of science is when we speak of the arts and the sciences rather. Science a is the highest form of art. Science is the highest kind of human making a science or what Hobbs simply calls by the term name reason is simply the fullest expression of human artfulness reason he stays in chapter five. Reason is not as sense and memory born with us. Reason is not born with us nor gotten by experience, only he says, but is it tainted by industry? First in APP imposing of names. And secondly, by getting a good and orderly method.

Speaker 1:          28:53          I think of those terms, um, reason and again, he uses this synonymously with other terms like science or art is not simply born with us. It is not simply a genetic endowment nor is it simply the product of experience which Hobbs caused by the name prudence, but rather reason. He says, is it chained by industry by uh, by work and it's develop. First he says bite you the imposing imposing of names on things. The correct names aren't things. And second, by getting a good and orderly method of study reason consists in the imposition of a method for the conquest of nature by science hubs tells us he means the knowledge of consequences. And especially he goes on to say when we see how anything comes about upon what causes and by what manner. When like causes come into our power, we can see how to make it produce like effects.

Speaker 1:          30:03          We can see how to make it produce like, like effects a reason. Science art is that is the capacity to transform, transform nature, uh, by making it, imposing on it a method that will produce like effects after similar consequences. There is, in other words, that kind of radically transformative view of reason and knowledge and science, political science, civil science running throughout Hobbs is work. Reason is not about simple observation, but rather it is about making production. Or as he says, making light consequences produce the desired effects. We can have a science of politics. Hobbes believes we can ever civil science because politics is a matter of human making, of human doing, of human goings on. We can know the political world. We can create a science of politics because we make it. It is something constructed by us hubs. This goal here is, is it worth to liberate knowledge to liberate science from subservience or dependence upon nature or by chance, by on Fortuna, by turning science into a tool for remaking nature to fit our needs, to impose our, uh, needs or satisfy our needs through, through our science, art, and especially the political art is a matter of reordering nature, even human nature.

Speaker 1:          31:43          First according to Hobbs, by resolving it into its most elementary units and then by reconstructing it so that it will produce the desired results, much like a physicist, uh, in a laboratory mice, this is Hobbes is answer to Machiavelli's famous call and chapter 25 to master for tuna to master chance or luck fortune. But you might say, hubs goes further than Machiavelli. Machiavelli said in that famous chapter 25 that the prints, if he's lucky, will my master for tuna about half the time, only about 50% of the time, the rest of human action, the rest of state craft will be really left to, to chance luck, contingency circumstances. Uh, Hobbes believes that armed with the proper method, with the proper art or scientific doctrine that we might eventually become the masters and possessors of nature. And I use that term masters in possessors of nature, a term not of Hobbs is making but of day coat from the sixth part of the discourse on method because I think it perfectly expresses Hobbs as aspirations to not only to create a science of politics, but to create a kind of immortal Commonwealth which is based on science and therefore based on the proper civil science and therefore will be impervious to fluctuation, a decay, uh, and war and conflict which all other previous societies have, have experienced.

Speaker 1:          33:24          You can begin to see in other words, in Hobbs is brief introduction to his book as well as the opening chapters. Uh, you can really see the immensely transformative and really revolutionary spirit, uh, underlying, uh, this, this, uh, this amazing, amazing book.

Speaker 2:          33:50          Oh,

Speaker 1:          33:56          so where do we go from here? We turned from methodology and science

Speaker 2:          34:05          to politics. Um,

Speaker 1:          34:12          what is Hobbes is great question. Always important when reading, starting out with a new book, asking yourself what question is the author trying to answer? What is the question? And it's not always easy to ask answer because sometimes they don't always make their deepest or most fundamental questions altogether. Clear. In the case of Leviathan, I would suggest to you, uh, hubs is central. Central question is what makes authority possible. What is the source of authority? And you might say, what renders it legitimate? Maybe the question is what makes legitimate authority possible? Still, this is still a huge question for us when we think about a Cree nation building and building new states, uh, how to create a legitimate authority. Obviously there's a tremendous issue with this in Iraq today is we try, it's people there and here struggle with what, what would, what would constitute a legitimate authority? Perhaps we should airlift, uh, copies of Leviathan to them because that's hubs. That's the issue that Hobbes is fundamentally concerned with. How his, his question goes further. How can individuals

Speaker 1:          35:55          who are biologically autonomous, who judge in see matters very differently from one another who can never be sure whether they trust one another? How can such individuals except a common authority, and again that is not just what constitutes authority, but what makes authority legitimate. That remains not only the fundamental question for Hobbs, but for the entire, at least for the entire social contract tradition that he helped or he he, he helped to establish. You might say, of course, the question what renders authority legitimate is only possible. It was only raised when authority is in question. That is to say when the rules Governing Authority has broken down in times of crisis and that was certainly true in Hobbs is time, a time of civil war and crisis. What? What renders authority legitimate are respectable. And to answer that question, hubs tells a story,

Speaker 3:          37:02          okay.

Speaker 1:          37:02          He tells a story about something he calls the state of nature a term he did not invent, but with which he will his name will always and forever be associated. The idea of the state of nature. The state of nature is not a gift of grace or a state of grace from which we have fallen is in the biblical account of Eden. Uh, nor is this is the state of nature, a political condition as maintained in some sense by Aristotle. When he says the Polis is by nature, the state of nature for hubs, uh, is it condition of conflict and war?

Speaker 3:          37:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          37:48          In by a state of nature, he means or by a state of war, he means a condition where there is no recognized authority in his language to keep us in awe, no authority to awe. Uh, us, uh, such a condition. State of war may mean a condition of open warfare, but, but not necessarily it can signify battle, but hubs says it can also signify the will to contend simply the desire or the will to engage in conflict renders something. Uh, like a state of nature. A state of war can include, in other words, what we might call a Cold War, uh, to hostile, looking at each other across a barrier of some type, not clear or not certain what the other will do. So the state of nature is not necessarily a condition of actual fighting, but what he calls a known disposition to fight. If you are known or believed to be willing to fight, you're in a state of war. It is a condition for hubs of maximum security. Where in his famous formula life is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.

Speaker 3:          39:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:11          Perhaps he should have said, fortunately short. Uh, this is the natural condition, the state of nature, the state of war that Hobbes attributes to, uh, again the fundamental fact of human nature.

Speaker 1:          39:32          Now his claim that the state of nature is the condition that we are naturally did. The state of war rather is a condition that we are naturally in, is to say among other things that nature does not unite us in peace and harmony, in friendship or in solidarity. If nature is a norm, uh, it does not, again mandate or incline us to peace, friendship and solidarity with others. Only human art or science or art. Human contrivance can bring about peace, conflict in war. Our primary piece is derivative. In other words for Hobbs Authority and Relations of authority do not arise naturally among us but are rather again, like civil science itself, the product of contrivance or art. So the question for us remains is it was deeply challenged readers and Hobbes his own time. What makes hubs is story is I'm calling it his story about the state of nature being a condition of what, what makes it plausible, what makes it believable? Uh, as an account of, again, the condition we are naturally in, why should we believe Hobbs is story? Uh, and uh, not, not some other story

Speaker 3:          41:11          from,

Speaker 1:          41:12          no, I just want to say a word about that. Before closing

Speaker 1:          41:18          from one point of view, bleeding Hobbs, his account of the state of nature seems to derive from his physics of motion and rest in the opening chapters of the via and he begins to work. You remember, uh, within an account of human nature, kind of human psychology as product is a product of sense and experience. We are bodies in motion and who cannot help but obey the law or the physics of attraction and repulsion. We are bodies in constant motion. He seems, in other words, to have a kind of materialistic psychology in which human behavior exhibits the same as it were, mechanical tendencies as billiard balls that can be understood as obeying again, geometric or causal processes of cause and effect, right. The state of nature is not seen by him, uh, as an actual historical condition in some ways, although he, he occasionally, uh, we'll refer to what we might think of as anthropological evidence to, um, to support his views in the state of nature.

Speaker 1:          42:33          But the state of nature for him, uh, is rather a kind of thought experiment, uh, after the manner of experimental science. It is a kind of thought experiments consists of taking human beings who are members of families of estates of Kingdoms and so on, dissolving these social relations into their fundamental units, namely the abstract individuals. And then imagining again in the manner of a chemist or a physicist, how these basic units would hypothetically interact with one another. Again, almost like the properties of chemical substances in some ways. How would we behave in this? Again, this, this kind of thought experiment that would be one way of reading or that Hobbes seems to, wants us to think about the state of nature as a, as again, an expert, as, as, as, as a kin to a scientific experiment. Uh, hubs is the, again, the great founder of what we might call the x among others is the experimental method in social and political science.

Speaker 1:          43:44          And there's a reason perhaps a reason for this too, and I'll end just on this note. When Hobbs was a young man, uh, he worked as a private secretary for a short time, a private secretary to uh, another very famous Englishman by the name of Francis Bacon, the great founder of what we think of as the experimental method. Uh, the method of trial and error of experience and experiment. Uh, and it arguably Hobbes was influenced in many ways by, by Bacon's own philosophy of experience. And experiment and Hobbes took Bacon's method in some ways, applying it to politics, tried to imagine, again, the natural condition of human beings and what we are by nature, by UB strapped, by a process of abstraction and abstracting all of the relations and properties that we have acquired over history, through customed to experience stripping those away, like the layers of an onion and putting us almost as it were in an experimental test tube or an under a microscope. Seeing how we would, uh, under those conditions react and behave with one another. I'll leave it at that, although I want to tell, I will start next week by showing how that view of hubs is only at best, partially correct. Uh, so anyway, have a wonderful weekend with your parents here and, uh, I'll see you next week.
