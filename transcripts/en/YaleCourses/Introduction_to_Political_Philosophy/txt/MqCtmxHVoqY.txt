Speaker 1:          00:01          But today we wanted to begin with Mr Lock part too. And I said at the end of class last time, I want to speak a little bit about Locke and let's just call up the spirit of capitalism. And then I want to move into the issue of government by consent. Uh, along with the idea of natural law, uh, perhaps one of locks, uh, clearly central, perhaps most most significant contribution to political philosophy, the doctrine of consent and various problems that I want to, to examine with you today, uh, associated with, with consent and what it means to see, to consent to government, but the first five chapters of this tech and treat us if you take them as a unit. And, and I think they should be, uh, they tell us a story. Block presents us, uh, so to speak with a kind of philosophical anthropology that takes us through the state of nature, the state of war, the creation of private property.

Speaker 1:          01:13          And in the fifth chapter, particularly lock begins, as I mentioned last time with uh, the, you might say the original condition of nature, which forms a kind of primitive communism to the creation of property through the work, uh, of ones, uh, the labor of one's body and the work of one's hands. And by the end of the fifth chapter, we have the creation of really a kind of full scale sophisticated market economy, uh, replete with various, uh, inequalities, perhaps even some larger scale inequality, qualities of wealth and property all within the state of nature. How did this occur and most importantly for lock, what makes this legitimate? Uh, what, what legitimizes this, uh, this, this transition, so to speak, from the original state of nature, governed by nothing more than a law of nature to the emergence of property. And in a way a kind of market economy in many ways, what Locke is doing in the first five chapters of this second treatise is re telling or maybe better rewriting a, the account of human beginnings, uh, that had originally belonged to scripture.

Speaker 1:          02:45          He tells the story, doesn't he? Right of how human beings finding themselves in a condition of nature with no one or no authority to adjudicate their disputes and governed only by a natural law. How they are nevertheless able to create and enjoy the use of property, uh, created and acquired through their labor and work. Man, he tells us in these opening chapters is a property acquiring animal, the inquisitive animal. Uh, even in a state of nature where there is again, nothing but the natural law to govern a human associations and relations with one another. But the problem with the state of nature, a four lock and as to some degree it is four was four hubs as well is it's instability, uh, with no civil authority to umpire disputes, especially disputes over property, the peaceful enjoyment and the further acquisition of property. The fruits of one's labor are continually threatened by war and by conflict. How can we ever be secure in our person or property with no enforcement agency to resolve breaches of the peace, uh, where everybody is so to speak. Again, the judge and jury and executioner of the natural law, the need for government arises out of the real need to resolve conflicts or disputes over property rights.

Speaker 1:          04:28          Uh, in many respects. Uh, right. This sounds like a very familiar idea that government exists for the sake of the protection of property rights. It's sort of a kind of cardinal doctrine of what I suppose we would call today libertarianism. Uh, the philosophy of, of libertarianism. Uh, so important in, in a lot of American thought. Locke is in many ways the first writer of my, uh, familiarity who claims that Ms, these are his words, the great in chief end of men's uniting into Commonweal's is the protection of their property. No one prior to lock a, at least to my knowledge, I think it ever said in quite such a bold and straight forward way that the purpose of politics was the protection of property rights and buy property. Uh, lock doesn't mean simply, uh, uh, uh, objects around us that we have turned into property. But property is, is rooted. Each tells us first and foremost in our persons, in our bodies. We all begin the life with a certain rudimentary property if only in ourselves. Property for him implies more than simply real estate. Uh, but everything that encompasses our lives, liberties and possessions. These are our property, uh, in the original, uh, and in many ways most revealing sense of the term property. That is to say things proper to us. Is this okay?

Speaker 1:          06:16          You with us? Okay. Uh,

Speaker 1:          06:25          but lock continually emphasizes to us the uncertainty of the state of nature because life there he says it's full of fears and continual dangerous that lead us to civil association. But think in a way how different locks account of the transition from the state of nature to the civil state is from Hobbs is in many ways. Again, as I said, lock tries to modify, domesticate, ameliorate hubs is harsh. Teachings hubs had emphasize the absolute fearfulness of the state of nature. The state of nature was for hubs, a kind of state of existential dread, absolute fearfulness for for lock. However, it is a condition continually be set by unease and anxiety. To use the word he often uses inconveniences. Uh, the state of nature is one that consists of continual inconveniences. Uh, it is our unease are restlessness, uh, that is not only a spur to our labor, but is rather the cause of our insecurities that we have, uh, in the state of nature. What is it about lock? What is it about his account? And I don't mean what is it about him in some psychological or personal or biographical sense, but what is it in his writing that leads him to emphasize the restlessness, uneasiness, and you might say perpetually anxious character of human beings in the state, in the state of nature.

Speaker 2:          08:17          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:18          Do we ever hear Plato or Aristotle, uh, discussing the fearful or anxious or restless character of, of, of, of, of human psychology? I think not, uh, was this simply a function of locks? Nervous disposition was the fact that he was simply prone to reticence and a kind of fearfulness in the same way that Hobbes himself said, or there's locks emphasis on the uneasiness of our condition in the natural condition really represent the qualities of a new class. Uh, the new commercial classes, uh, as it were seeking to establish their legitimacy. Locke's second treatise in many respects is, uh, a work of middleclass or as the Marxists would like to say, perhaps the bourgeois, uh, ascendancy when lock writes that he has, he does that the world is intended for the use of the industrious and the rational. Yes. Who was he talking about there? Who are the industrious, uh, and the rational? He is speaking about a new middle class ethos whose title to rule rests not on heredity or on tradition. He is not referring to a customary ruling class, a class whose title to rule comes from its claims to nobility, but it's, but he's referring to people whose title to rule or potential title to rule rests on their capacities for hard work, thrift and opportunity. Uh, as a former student of mine who took this class once said, Locke's second treatise could well be called the capitalist manifesto

Speaker 1:          10:24          or the Anticosti. The anticommunist manifesto may be one put it, but as Locky aneurysm, simply Machiavelli with the human face, put it that way, uh, isn't the rule of the prince. And Machiavelli, uh,

Speaker 1:          10:46          the rule of a new leader, a new, uh, sovereign authority, new authority of some sell, some sense who operates outside the parameters of traditional authority isn't Locky and ism like Machiavelli in some way. Uh, the ethic of the self made man, uh, with all of the insecurities and anxieties, uh, restlessness that being self made, uh, represents, uh, does Lockey aneurysm represent in some ways that the tranquilliser [inaudible] of Machiavelli turning Machiavelli's fierce warlike ethic, uh, the ethic of conquest and domination to in fact the ethic of work. And, and is it where the conquest and domination of, of, of work through, through labor and, and our heart and our hard work is this again, simply machiavellianism with the human face, but in any way, I think, or what I want to suggest is that lock locks, political philosophy gives expression to what the great German sociologist Max Faber.

Speaker 1:          12:03          You, you know him? Yes. Faber, you read him in intro sociology? No. Okay. Well, uh, you will, uh, vapor, uh, his famous book called the Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism in 1904 1904. Great work. Classic work. And in that work, a vapor argued that the capitalist ethic made a high duty, a moral duty, turned it into a moral calling, a religious calling, the duty of limitless accumulation of capital. Uh, and this was in four in Weber's term, the outgrowth of the Puritan and Calvinist movements of the 16th and 17th Century for vapor. It was the Protestant reformation that had taken root in the countries of northern Europe. And particularly with the roots of this capitalistic ethos. First developed and again adapted a wholly new moral attitude to such things is property, property acquisition, and moneymaking. Previously, these things had been deemed to be morally dubious, shunted aside something shameful about this.

Speaker 1:          13:19          You can certainly see this and the classical writings, political philosophy that we did for these early moderns. Uh, capital accumulation became a kind of high calling and moral duty. God gave the world to the rational and the industrious, not he says to the quarrelsome and contentious, not that is to those prideful aristocrats who seek to struggle for domination and power, uh, over over one another. What lock brings into being is again, a wholly new and revolutionary moral attitude towards property and property acquisition. And again, finds its expression, great expression a century later with Adam Smith and of course from Adam Smith, we have the whole world of modern economics. So how many of you are potential economics majors in here? I bet more than one without John Locke, there would be no modern discipline called economics book. Cause he was the one, again, a century before Smith and the rise of the school of political economy who made the first and decisive move, which was to, uh, in many ways make respectable and even more than respectable make turn into a high moral calling and dignity, uh, the, the to the acquisition of property and turned government turning politics into a tool for the protection of property and property rights.

Speaker 1:          15:07          That that is the significance in many ways of what Locke has done. And I want to talk, probably not today, but, uh, next Monday on some of the, uh, in many ways, pros and cons of, of this immense moral transformation regarding property in economics that Locke had helped, has helped to bring into being.

Speaker 1:          15:34          But for the rest of today, what I want to focus on is locks, idea of consent. The idea that the origin of all government, or at least all legitimate, all legitimate government is said to derive from consent. The consent of the governed, an idea that was implicit in some respects in Hobbs is theory of this, of the social, of the covenant that creates the sovereign, but for a wit, but to which lock gives in many ways, much greater pride of place. In chapter eight, a of the second treatise lock gives us there. He provides us with a kind of hypothetical reconstruction, uh, of the origin of society. So Paul's Society, she writes it night, section 95. The only way whereby anyone divest himself of his natural liberty and puts on the bonds of civil society is by agreeing with all others to join and unite in a community for their comfortable, safe, and peaceful living.

Speaker 1:          16:37          Uh, lock tells us there's something about the, that the legitimate ends of society for the, the, the ends that civil society, uh, serves comfortable, safe and peaceful living. And he goes on to affirm that whenever a sufficient number of people, uh, have consented to make a single community, and I quote him again, they are thereby presently incorporated. And to make one body politic, they make one body politic were in the majority, have a right to act and conclude for the rest were in the majority. Have a right to act and conclude for the rest of that short statement. Section 95 of Chapter Eight, uh, seems to make maybe the first and most powerful case for democracy.

Speaker 2:          17:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:34          Uh, on the basis of that statement, a famous Yale professor of at least a couple of generations ago, wrote an extremely important book that made John into a majority rule democrat. He said in that book that locks philosophy provides the faith of the majority rule Democrat largely focusing on sections 95, 96 as sort of the key two locks, political teaching, uh, in the second treatise. Does anybody know the name of that? A man who wrote that book by any chance? Famous Yale political scientist event back, back awhile ago. Nobody. Not Nobody remembers. Wellmark Kendall's book on luck.

Speaker 2:          18:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:24          You know, you know it. Yes. You were shaking your head no you don't. Okay. Whatever. It's not important. Not, not important. I just mentioned it in passing, but consider the, consider the following sentence again also, that seems to add a to this claim for when any number of men by the consent of every individual make a community they have their, by made that community one body with a power to act as one body, which is only by the will and determination of the majority.

Speaker 1:          19:02          Uh, what are we to make of this assertion? And in many ways continued assertion that lock is that in any community we are ruled by the majority, uh, to be sure that idea, what if come as an immense surprise, no doubt to the King of England to learn that his rule was justified by the consent of the governed or if you had done something like cross the English Channel and, and go to, to the France of Louis the 14th of this period, uh, Louis the 14th who famously said lay toss saying why I am the state no doubt would have been very surprised and probably found laughable. The idea that his legitimacy came from the consent of his subjects who had ever thought such a thing that government derives from the consent of the majority is lock in saying that, uh, denying the legitimacy of all government or governments that do not derive from the consent of the majority. Uh, is he on the basis of this truly a kind of majority rule democrat? Does he undercut, for example, something like Aristotle's argument who had seen any number of forms of government is equally a legitimate, uh, in many ways so long as they are moderate and ruled by law, uh, or is lock saying again that there is only one form of government one again, legitimate or just form of government, government by the majority. That's what he appears here to be saying.

Speaker 1:          20:53          And I mentioned this sense appears, uh, lock is a slippery fish. Uh, he's a slippery writer. He has a tendency of take back with one hand what he gives with the other [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          21:14          Yeah. Uh,

Speaker 1:          21:17          the agreement to join to make one community is he calls it however is not the same thing. Exactly. Uh, it's establishing a form of government in many ways choosing to have a government, which is what lock has caught, is talking about here in these relevant sections in 95 and 96. And so I'm choosing to have a government to be one people, uh, so to speak, uh, is in many ways an act prior to electing any particular form of government to rule you. The second treatise in some way, a specifies only that governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed. It does not seem to say very explicitly about what form of government people might wish to consent to. In many ways. The second treatise one wants to say is even rather neutral two forms of government. The only form of government that seems to be absolutely ruled out unlocks account is some kind of absolute monarchy.

Speaker 1:          22:26          We cannot see our rights entirely to another individual, but he seems to be relatively open to whatever it is. People may wish to consent to. The act of consent alone does not create a government. Uh, it is merely an act of forming society. Uh, in many ways. He accepts Pope's famous dictum, Alexander Pope's famous dictum, you know, for farms of government. Let Fools contest what air is best administered is best. In other words, you'll have the best thing that administers government that protects your rights to property and what form it is, whether it's monarchic, aristocratic, uh, Republican or whatever is not as much is not so important. What is important and for Loc about, the only thing that is important is that that form of government received the consent of the governed. And of course, people don't necessarily have to consent to democracy. Uh, if, if lock is democratic in that way is, it is only because, uh, he's democratic.

Speaker 1:          23:34          Uh, in a sense that government derives the authority from, from consent. It does not necessarily have to be democratical, uh, inform, uh, in that respect. But it is this idea of consent and you will no doubt talk about this and your sections. It is this idea of government as being by consent that has so much, uh, insinuated itself. I'm not sure that's the right word, but as so much, uh, formed in many ways the cornerstone of American, uh, uh, the American regime and American political thought in many ways, even more, I would suggest than his doctrine of property and property rights locks, doctrine of consent, uh, is what, uh, captured the imagination of the American founders. Uh, when Jefferson wrote about the ends of government, he said, the ends of government are to protect life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. He seems in some ways he seems to modified locks statement about life, liberty, and to state.

Speaker 1:          24:44          Why did he do that? Uh, we could talk about that. And of course, what is meant by the pursuit of happiness certainly is intended to entail a, among other things, a Pr, the acquisition of property. But Jefferson in some ways sort of elevates lock locks. Language Locky and language does not simply focused on property, but the pursuit of happiness, uh, in many ways, however, construed consistent, uh, with, with the rights of others. But it is locks, language of consent, uh, that the just powers of government derived from consent, uh, that seems to have most, um, inspired, uh, Jefferson and the founders. And through that doctrine, it of course had a huge effect on America's greatest second founder. Uh, Abraham Lincoln.

Speaker 1:          25:41          Consider the following passage from Lincoln. This is Lincoln in 1854 in his first major, uh, speech, first most important speech, sometimes called the Peoria speech where he was already debating a Stephen Douglas, Steven A. Douglas. Uh, it was for the Senate campaign, uh, in, uh, in Illinois appropriate in our time of the year where they were, they were then arguing as they would again, uh, if for the presidential campaign argue over slavery and cure is what Lincoln rights when the White Man governance himself that is self-government. But when he governs himself and also governs another man that is more than self government, that is despotism. Lincoln says, my ancient faith, my ancient faith, no dead thinking about declaration and Jefferson's ideas, my ancient faith teaches me that there can be no moral right with one man making a slave of another. What I do say Lincoln continues here is that no man is good enough to govern another without that others consent.

Speaker 1:          27:01          This he concludes is the leading principal, the sheet anchor of American republicanism. So there is Abraham Lincoln referring to the doctrine of consent by which he says that no man is good enough to govern another without that others consent. Calling this the leading principal or the sheet anchor of American republicanism. That statement as I suggested a moment ago as part of his debate with Douglas over the issue of slavery, and in many ways cut to the car of the meaning of consent. Douglass also in some respects, tried to derive his view, his views from an idea of consent. What Douglas said was, uh, that regarding slavery, he said he didn't care. It was a matter of indifference to him whether people of a particular state or a territory wanted slavery or didn't want it. Uh, whatever they wanted that is to say whatever the majority consented to was all right with him.

Speaker 1:          28:14          Uh, he might prefer it not to be, but again, it was what people consented to what the majority wanted. Uh, that was, uh, the, the, that w that would decide the matter. Uh, Lincoln however, had said that the doctrine of consent is not simply a kind of blank check or a blank check, uh, that the doctrine of consent still implied. A set of moral limits or restraints on what a people might consent to consent was inconsistent with slavery. He said, because again, no one can rule another without that other person's consent. And in many ways that crucial debates, so fundamental to American history in politics grows out of a kind of internal problem within locks, doctrine of consent. Namely that problem is what form of government does it make sense for a majority of people to consent to? Does government, uh, in other words, by consent mean government by whatever the majority wants, a kind of could be a kind of tyranny of the majority.

Speaker 1:          29:29          There's whatever they want or does government by consent in tail against certain limits and restraints on what majorities can do what guarantees, uh, does lock provide? You might ask that government by consent will be informed consent or rational consent. Uh, can people simply consent to anything to be ruled in by any means? This is obviously not an idol or a purely theoretical, uh, questions. Since popular majority's, we know, uh, in the world today, uh, popular majority's can choose, uh, to be miss. They can choose on the basis of whim will or some other kind of arbitrary passion, unless there seems to be some set of moral restraints on what individuals or majority's can consent to. Uh, what is to prevent a majority from acting just as despotically or just as arbitrarily is a king or any absolute power. That is, was the question that Lincoln was raising in his, uh, argument against Douglas and his claims about, about consent. But this question of restraints or limits on what people can consent to raises a

Speaker 2:          30:53          yeah.

Speaker 1:          30:53          Or leads to another question about the doctrine of consent. How is consent conferred?

Speaker 1:          31:03          We are citizens of the oldest democracy in the world, most of us. So I guess, I don't know, maybe not everybody, but most people in this room are citizens of the oldest democracy in the world. Did anyone ask you for your consent? Uh, or may considerably older, but, uh, you know, I have never, uh, did anyone ask for my consent? The idea of giving consent to a form of government implies something active. Uh, an emphatic voice. Uh, but his, anyone since the first generation of founders who ratified the constitution ever been asked or required to give their consent to, it might ask, what is locks answer to this problem? It is, and it is a problem that he is aware of and, and struggles with in that important chapter. His answer turns out to be something quite different from our views about citizenship and who is a citizen. And how was the consent of the citizen conferred on government? In section one 18, he writes, a child is born a subject of no country or government.

Speaker 2:          32:24          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          32:25          In other words, he's saying citizen is not citizenship is not conferred by birth. Uh, this being born in a place does not make you a citizen of it as, as

Speaker 2:          32:36          okay

Speaker 1:          32:36          doctrine that we hold every person. Uh, lock continues, uh, is born free and equal in many ways in this kind of state of nature, under the authority only of their parents. Uh, what government that person may choose to obey is not a matter of birth, but of choice. And again, lock seems to be making some kind of active principle of choice or decision, uh, a principal of citizenship and the conferring of, of consent. And it is only, he says that when a child reaches what he calls the age of discretion, 18 or 21 or something like that, that one is obligated to choose to some sign or mark of agreement to accept the authority to accept the authority of government. Lock is not altogether clear about how such a sign or a mark, uh, is to be given one suspect from what he is saying.

Speaker 1:          33:38          He may be referring to some kind of oath or some kind of pledge or some kind of civil ceremony where one vows or pledges with one's word, with one's word, uh, the acceptance of the form of the state. Nothing can make any man. So lock rights, it is to say an actual citizen of a state. Nothing can make any man so, but his actually entering into it by positive agreement and express promise and compact. He says at one 22, uh, by express promise and compact such an express promise or agreement, uh, leaves one, he says perpetually in indispensably obliged to be and remain unalterably a subject of it that is to the state. So once you give your word or agreement, Locke says you are perpetually and indispensably obligated to that state. That's how seriously locked takes this idea of consent. It's something that can only be entered into at the age of discretion.

Speaker 1:          34:48          It must be given consciously, fully, rationally, presumably in some kind of ceremony. And once given your consent to the form of government remains as he says, perpetual and Perpetual, uh, you are, you are bound unalterably as he puts it. Uh, there's no such thing as taking it back. It shows you how important lock puts on the word or the oath or some, some kind of civil, uh, agreement. One's word is one's bond, uh, to give voice or consent to government is not an act to be entered into lightly. He says or implies. But it is a kind of lifetime commitment and it also shows us how different locks view of the citizen is from ours. In other words, it would seem for Locke, the only people who are full citizens in our country would be people who have given their active consent. And the only people who have given their active consent are people who have undergone what we interestingly caught kind of naturalization process.

Speaker 1:          36:00          Is anyone here, is anyone here a naturalized citizen as we call it? Has anyone ever been to a naturalization process? No. Nobody where, uh, people go to, you know, it's administered by a judge and a, you swear allegiance, uh, to, to the new country. You've presumably, you shed your obligations to your previous country. You swear your allegiance to this one. The only that seems to be the kind of thing lock lock appears to be talking about. And it's interesting that again, the only people in our society and our, in our country who would be full citizens would be uh, uh, w w w net naturalized citizens. Again, birth alone does not confer on you citizenship of any particular of any particular country.

Speaker 1:          36:54          But what does that mean for the rest of us? Those who have not given their active consent, uh, lock is aware that not everyone gives their active consent. That's why he introduces another idea for how consent may be given. He talks about what he calls tacit consent. Uh, there are those maybe who have not sworn allegiance or given a civil oath, but who nevertheless can be said to have given their tacit consent to the form of government and its laws. But how do we give tacit consent? Tacit consent is a strange word because consent implies something active and open. Where tasks set. Think of loc tasks. Aternity tasks that's a, implies something closed or concealed. How is tacit consent, uh, given that's a problem, that lock you can see lock working on to some degree. He says, anyone who simply enjoys the protection of the law, the security of property and person under the law can be said to have given their tacit consent.

Speaker 1:          38:12          Uh, they give it so to speak. X Silencio even there, there's silence. Confers consent. But how do we really know? You could say, how, uh, how do we know that, uh, silence confers tacit consent and silence is not simply silence. Uh, an example I think of, for example, if you go to wedding ceremony or, and I guess in some wedding ceremonies, the, uh, the, uh, justice or the minister, whoever says, you know, whoever, uh, w what is the phrase about, uh, whoever, uh, hold your peace. You know, if anybody has any, uh, any question about this ceremony, speak now or forever, hold your peace. And of course everybody's except in the movies of course. Uh, uh, everybody's always silent. Nobody says it's so their consent, you might say their tacit consent is given. Uh, there's silence from their silence, uh, to that question there, their tacit consent is given.

Speaker 1:          39:14          But again, that's, that would be one way, but a against, how do we know, again, when silence confers tacit consent or silence is simply, is simply that silence. It just, it's an issue that lacks struggles with and to be sure never fully or I think satisfactorily resolved. Maybe you will resolve it. Maybe you will resolve it in your next paper. Uh, if you have the opportunity to write about consent and the difference between the express and tasks, that form of citizenship. And also the question being which lock alludes to but does not fully or, or there's not quite answered. Is there any difference in privileges in civil privileges between citizens who have given their expressed consent? And those who have only been said to tacitly consent to the form of government, does he suggest that one class of citizens has more, has greater rights or more greater responsibilities than the other?

Speaker 1:          40:15          You might look into that question too. Uh, and see if you think Locke suggests any, any differences on that lock to go back. Uh, and just kind of begin to wrap this up for today. Lock does not appear to endorse any particular form of government. And in the second treatise, uh, the task of forming the government, uh, will fall to the decision of the majority. But again, what farm? The majority we'll, we'll decide remains to some degree. Uh, and open a question. What gives lock or Lockie aneurysm? It's distinctive tone. It's distinctive voice, uh, is the claim that whatever kind of government a majority decides upon, it must be one that limits the power of the sovereign. We cannot. Uh, and this I think in this respect, I think luck is far closer to Lincoln and he was just Steven Egg Douglas consent does not simply mean consent to arbitrary rule does not mean consent for this power of the sovereign to do anything.

Speaker 1:          41:30          Lock Locke's theory of constitutional government is a theory of restrained government of constitutional restraints of rule by law. Uh, this is lock gives in many ways, uh, the importance of law and constitutional restraints, what we would today call, I suppose limited government. He gives us far greater expression, far more powerful expression than any of his predecessors. They're certainly not hubs who had attributed absolute power, uh, to government or even to Aristotle who, uh, in many ways to share some resemblances with Loc. But even Aristotle had severe doubts about a rule. Rule of law. Hobbes, Locke is, is absolutely confident, uh, that, uh, limited government, uh, restraints restrains restraints on power. Whether that power be from the one, the few, or the many. Restraints on power is the only kind of government that can be trusted to protect rights. And in one of the few jokes that appears in the second treatise, you might've missed it because lock is a subtle jokester.

Speaker 1:          42:48          He doesn't, he's not like Machiavelli or Plato lock as a very understated jokester. You know, he was an Englishman after all. Uh, he writes in section 93, referring to Hobbs Hobbs, but you'll, you'll also see his, his wonderful animal references he writes in Hobbs is if men quitting the state of nature entered into society, they agreed that all of them, but one should be under the restraint of laws. Thinking about Hobbs is Leviathan, but that he should still retain all the liberty of the state of nature increased with tower in, made licentious by impunity. He goes on to say, this is to think that men are so foolish that they take care to avoid what mischiefs be done to them by polecats and foxes, but our content nay think it safety to be devoured by lions. The love the lion being the uh, being, being the, the, the, the Leviathan Salvin.

Speaker 1:          43:52          Whereas in the Lockian state of nature, human beings are like Paul cats and foxes there noxious creatures, he says, but you know, they're not truly dangerous to you. And when one enters the state of nature, when one leaves the state of nature to enter civil society, one is certainly not doing so to empower a sovereign with Elian like powers over you as he says, uh, uh, who, who would do this? It's better to have some kind of theory of restrained government, government limited government, uh, to, to do this for you. What I want to do, I'm going to end on this note. What I want to do on Monday when I wrap up lock is to continue with his doctrine of limited government because there is, it turns out there is a very important exception to it. There is a kind of escape clause and I would encourage you as you read it to pay particular attempt attention to chapter 14 of the second treatise, his chapter on what he calls prerogative power. That doctrine that has very, very important in grave implications for our politics today. Uh, it's a very important chapter and I want us to continue this and then talk a little bit about the pros and cons of locking in political philosophy.
