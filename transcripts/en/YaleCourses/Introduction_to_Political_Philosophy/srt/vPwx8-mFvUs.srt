1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,070
There's so much to say and so little time

2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,930
do they want to talk
about the general will,

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,600
who his most important
contribution to political science.

4
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,210
And I will also want to talk about
the legacies of Rousseau in what he,

5
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:29,720
uh,

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,150
what he's meant for the world,

7
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,170
uh,

8
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:33,640
that he,

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:33,990
he,

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,390
he did so much to shape.

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,483
Okay.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,800
But I want to start first
with the general will,

13
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:44,830
which is his answer to the problems of
civilization or the political problem.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:45,930
Uh,

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,830
of the second discourse that
we talked about last week,

16
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:50,630
the problems of inequality,

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,690
the problem of Mr Pro,

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,270
the problem of our general discontent

19
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:05,050
social contract is his answer to
the problem of natural freedom.

20
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:08,690
Uh,

21
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,990
this is so in a way
because for Russo nature,

22
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:13,671
he tells us,

23
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:18,671
provides no standards or guidelines
for determining who should rule.

24
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:20,650
Okay.

25
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,670
Unlike Aristotle,

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,200
man is notch here,

27
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:24,310
a political animal.

28
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,980
And notice that when Russo speaks of
the social contract in the general will,

29
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:33,190
is the foundation of all
legitimate authority.

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,420
He means literally that all standards of
justice and right have their origins in

31
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:47,191
the will in this unique human
property of the will or free agency.

32
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,790
It is this liberation of the will from
all transcendent sources or standards,

33
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,900
whether those be found in nature,

34
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,550
in custom,

35
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,600
in revelation,

36
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,700
in any other source.

37
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,590
Uh,

38
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:04,960
the,

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,320
the liberation of the will
from all of these sources.

40
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,650
That is the true is at
war center of gravity,

41
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,930
of Rousseau's philosophy.

42
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,330
It is a world that begins to emphasize
the primacy and the priority of the will.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
A moral point of view that I want to
indicate a little later finds it's a,

44
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:33,691
in many ways it's a very powerful
expression and the philosophy of a manual

45
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:35,014
Kant,

46
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,780
but given Russo's,

47
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,500
let's call it libertarian
conception of human nature.

48
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,190
Uh,

49
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,190
his description of the actual mechanism
of this social contract may come as

50
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:49,870
something of a surprise to us.

51
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,980
The problem to which the formula of the
general will is the answer is stated

52
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,110
succinctly.

53
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,000
Rousseau in book one,

54
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:03,640
chapter six of the social contract,

55
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,560
find a form of association.

56
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,394
He writes,

57
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,510
which defends in,

58
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,640
protects with all the common force.

59
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:14,230
The person and goods of each associates
and by means of which each one,

60
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:19,231
while uniting with all obeys only himself
and remains as free as before this,

61
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:26,221
he calls the fundamental problem for
which the social contract is the solution.

62
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,420
That statement famous statement book one,

63
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:36,421
Chapter Six really contains two parts
that that merit close attention.

64
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,910
The first part says

65
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,643
for me,

66
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,440
Oh,

67
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,273
okay.

68
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,523
I thought it was,

69
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,453
I thought it was for me.

70
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,430
The first part of that clause,

71
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,703
uh,

72
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,880
so is that the aim of the contract is
to protect and defend with the common

73
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:01,981
force,

74
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:04,340
the goods and person of each member.

75
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,660
Uh,

76
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,660
so far think of that this is entirely
consistent with locks claim or even Hobbs

77
00:04:11,571 --> 00:04:16,571
is claim that society that the purpose
of society is to protect the security or

78
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:17,480
the life,

79
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,480
liberty and estate of each of its members
and get Rousseau adds to this Lockian

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,300
or liberal clause.

81
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:26,631
Uh,

82
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:28,250
you might say a second,

83
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:28,850
uh,

84
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,300
and more distinctly Russolo sewing claim,

85
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,330
namely that the contract must ensure
not only the conditions for mutual

86
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:42,140
protection and the preservation
of law of self and property,

87
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,840
but rather awesome or also the,

88
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:46,850
in uniting with one another.

89
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:51,851
He says each person obeys
only himself and then he says,

90
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:55,190
remains as free as they were before.

91
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,830
But how is this possible?

92
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,880
We want to know,

93
00:04:59,330 --> 00:04:59,630
uh,

94
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,630
isn't the essence of this social
contract that we give up some part of our

95
00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:06,050
natural freedom,

96
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:06,471
uh,

97
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:09,470
to guarantee mutual peace and security.

98
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,310
How can we,

99
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,000
how can we remain as
free as we were before?

100
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,760
Uh,

101
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,261
and his,

102
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:15,741
he says,

103
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:18,230
obey only out I hit the,

104
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,710
that the participant obey only himself.

105
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,650
That is the paradox in many ways.

106
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:29,651
Or the fundamental problem is he calls
it to which his contract is a solution

107
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,280
and Rousseau provides
an answer as follows.

108
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:34,671
He says,

109
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:36,140
properly understood.

110
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,410
These clauses are all reducible to one.

111
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:40,910
Namely,

112
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:41,360
he says,

113
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,360
the total alienation of each associate
together with all of his rights to the

114
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:47,810
entire community,

115
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,830
the total alienation of each associates
with all of his rights to the entire

116
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:55,484
community.

117
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,020
And those two phrases,

118
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,350
total alienation and entire community,

119
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,160
uh,

120
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,900
are obviously central here,

121
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,800
uh,

122
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,540
in the first place or persons must give
themselves entirely over to the social

123
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,700
contract to,

124
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,730
to ensure that the terms of the
agreement are equal for all.

125
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:15,770
The total alienation clause,

126
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:16,311
uh,

127
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:16,971
as it were,

128
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:21,971
is Russo's manner of ensuring that the
terms of the contract are the same for

129
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:23,054
everyone.

130
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,040
But secondly,

131
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,900
when we alienate ourselves,

132
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,341
it is crucial.

133
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:33,341
He says that this be done or given to
the entire community for only then he

134
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:39,101
wants to argue is the individual beholden
not to any private will or any private

135
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,700
association or to some other person,

136
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,320
but to the general will the
will of the entire community.

137
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,460
The social contract is the
foundation of the general will,

138
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,270
which is for Roussel the
only legitimate sovereign,

139
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:57,260
not kings,

140
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,600
not parliaments,

141
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,590
not representative assemblies,

142
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,760
not presidents,

143
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,880
but the general will of the entire
community is the only general sovereign,

144
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,540
the doctrine of the famous doctrine
of what we call the sovereignty of the

145
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,880
people or popular sovereignty.

146
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:14,790
Yeah.

147
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,820
Since everyone combines
to make up this will,

148
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,160
uh,

149
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,450
when we give ourselves
over to it entirely,

150
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,770
he wants to argue,

151
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:25,770
we do nothing more than obey ourselves.

152
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:26,461
The sovereign,

153
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:31,461
in other words is not some distinct third
party that is created by the contract,

154
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,080
but rather the sovereign is simply
the people as a whole acting in its

155
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,700
collective capacity.

156
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:42,030
The people in their collective capacity.

157
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,130
Okay.

158
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,311
No,

159
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:49,260
you might suggest that there
is something deeply amiss here.

160
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,560
That is to say from a highly
individualistic set of
premises where each person

161
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:59,781
is concerned only in the state of
nature or in the pre contract tradition,

162
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,150
only with the protection of their lives,

163
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,920
persons and property.

164
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,220
Rousseau seems to be leading us to a
highly regimented and collectivized a

165
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,890
conclusion where the individual has given
over virtually his or her entire being

166
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,260
to the will of the community.

167
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:24,290
In what way does this render
us as free as we were before?

168
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:29,390
In what way do we remain a
free and obey only ourselves?

169
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,600
That seems to be a the problem.

170
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:34,434
Does this,

171
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,620
does Russo's formula for the general will
of recipe or a formula for freedom or

172
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:45,741
is it a recipe for the tyranny of the
majority of the type later analyzed by

173
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,660
Tocqueville that we'll be seeing,

174
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,990
uh,

175
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,380
after,

176
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,220
after the break,

177
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,190
Russo wants to say,

178
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,880
paradoxically only this total alienation.

179
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,130
Do we remain free?

180
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,780
Why is this,

181
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,500
why,

182
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,460
why is this?

183
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,860
Because he wants to argue.

184
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:09,360
No one is dependent upon
the will of another.

185
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,860
The people established through
their act a new kind of sovereign.

186
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,300
The general will,

187
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,500
which he says is not strictly
speaking the sum total,

188
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,060
the additive total,

189
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:21,720
uh,

190
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,170
of the individual wills
or the individual parts,

191
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,620
but is more like the general interest
or the rational will if you want to use

192
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:33,630
that kind of content formulation.

193
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,000
The rational will have a community.

194
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:40,020
Since we all contribute to the
shaping of this general will.

195
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,030
When we obey its laws,

196
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:42,990
we do.

197
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,890
He wants to say no more
than obey ourselves.

198
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:53,030
And Russo describes this new kind of
freedom that we achieve under the general

199
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:55,100
will.

200
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,350
Uh,

201
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,350
he wants to say that this brings about
in some ways a radical transformation of

202
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,180
human nature in itself.

203
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,040
The freedom of the citizen under the
general will is not the freedom of the

204
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:08,970
state of nature.

205
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,480
It's not the freedom to do anything we
like anything that our will and power

206
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,230
allows us to do.

207
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,730
But it is a new kind of freedom
that he calls moral freedom,

208
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,720
a freedom to do what the law commands,

209
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,240
the passage from the state of nature.

210
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,190
He writes to the civil state.

211
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,690
The passage from this state of nature
to the civil state produces a remarkable

212
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,720
change in man for its substitutes,

213
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:41,721
justice for instinct in his behavior and
gives his actions a moral quality that

214
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:45,600
they previously lacked.

215
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,020
And Roussel continues
that statement as follows.

216
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,940
What man loses through the social
contract is his natural liberty and an

217
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:56,520
unmitigated right to
everything that tempts him.

218
00:10:56,521 --> 00:11:01,521
And he can acquire what he gains his
civil liberty and proprietary ownership of

219
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:03,990
all he possesses.

220
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,333
But,

221
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,510
and here I think is the crucial
argument or the crucial clause,

222
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,270
but he writes to the
proceeding acquisitions.

223
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,740
That is to say civil liberty,

224
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:14,700
uh,

225
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,510
could be added the
acquisition of moral liberty,

226
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:23,570
which alone he says makes man truly the
master of himself for to be driven by

227
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:29,271
appetite alone is slavery and obedience
to the law one has prescribed for

228
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:31,800
oneself is freedom.

229
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,530
That has a remarkable statement.

230
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,480
Obedience to the law that one
prescribes for oneself is freedom.

231
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,880
That is moral liberty,

232
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,530
which is only created and possible
through the social contract.

233
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,570
And the implications of this,

234
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:51,810
the moral and political
implications of that statement,

235
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:52,440
uh,

236
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,273
are

237
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,110
need is here in many ways.

238
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:58,690
Reus where Roussel
departs most powerfully,

239
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:03,370
most dramatically from his
early modern predecessors.

240
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,720
Consider the following,

241
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:05,500
uh,

242
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,850
for Hobbes and Locke.

243
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,530
Liberty meant,

244
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,160
uh,

245
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,470
that sphere of human conduct,

246
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:13,540
which is unregulated by the law.

247
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,780
Remember Chapter 21 of Leviathan we're
Hobbes says where the law is silent

248
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:20,911
preacher,

249
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:23,590
mid hid in his term
where the law is silent,

250
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:28,591
the citizen is free to do
whatever he or she chooses to do.

251
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,610
Freedom begins so to speak
where the law is silent.

252
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,510
But for Rousseau law
is the very beginning,

253
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,050
uh,

254
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,750
of our freedom where the law is silent.

255
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,940
We may have a kind of natural freedom,

256
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,770
but our moral freedom,

257
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,550
uh,

258
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:50,550
we are free to the extent that we are
participants in the laws that we in turn

259
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:53,560
obey.

260
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,560
Freedom means acting in
conformity with self imposed law,

261
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,390
a radically different understanding
of what freedom consists and it seems

262
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:09,391
underlying that difference between one
could say Hobbes and Locke on the one

263
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:14,401
side and Russo on the other is a
difference between two very different

264
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:16,090
conceptions of liberty.

265
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:19,450
One might call them
liberal and Republican.

266
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:19,870
Uh,

267
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,651
respectively.

268
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:22,390
Small r Republican of course

269
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,860
democratic even if you like for liberals.

270
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:27,910
Uh,

271
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,550
following in the tradition
of Hobbes and Locke,

272
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,061
again,

273
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:36,061
freedom has always meant a sphere of
privacy with the law does not intrude or

274
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:38,260
where other people do not intrude.

275
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:38,411
This,

276
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:43,330
this is why the separation of the public
and the private sphere has always been

277
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:47,110
so sacred to liberals because
only in the private sphere,

278
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,860
only in that area of civil society,

279
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:51,371
uh,

280
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:56,371
where the state does not intrude is
the individual really and truly free.

281
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,340
But for the Republican theory of liberty,

282
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,650
of which you so is the most powerful,

283
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,130
uh,

284
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:03,940
modern,

285
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,773
uh,

286
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,823
exponent.

287
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,250
This separation of pro public and private
is only an exercise in what might be

288
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,110
thought of his private selfishness.

289
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,380
The task is rather to create a community
where the individual in the public

290
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,620
interest are not in conflict with
one another with the individual,

291
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:28,621
does not think of him or herself as
a being a part from the social body.

292
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,970
This is the freedom of the citizen for
Russo who takes an active role in the

293
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:38,650
determination of the laws
of one's own community.

294
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,390
Uh,

295
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,170
Russo's purpose in saying
this and then writing,

296
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:49,171
this seems to be to bring back to life
a concept that he believes has been

297
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:50,381
dormant,

298
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:52,310
had laid dormant for centuries,

299
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,620
and that concept is the citizen.

300
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,660
The last people who really
knew what a citizen meant.

301
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,560
He says,

302
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,700
we're the Romans in an a
footnote again to book one,

303
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:05,600
Chapter Six,

304
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,460
he indicates what?

305
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:12,461
That the how to what degree the true
meaning of citizen has been lost on modern

306
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:14,294
subjects.

307
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,980
Most modern men,

308
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:16,551
he writes,

309
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:21,551
mistake a town for a city and
a bourgeois for a citizen.

310
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,710
Think of that most mistake
of bourgeois for a citizen.

311
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,720
The modern world furnishes almost
no examples of what a citizen is.

312
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:39,770
And this is why it is necessary for
Russo to return to the histories of

313
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:40,521
antiquity,

314
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:42,800
especially Rome and Sparta,

315
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,980
to find models of citizenship
only in these societies has,

316
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,890
can one find the spirit of self sacrifice
and devotion to the common good,

317
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:59,210
a kind of patriotic devotion upon
which citizen ship is founded.

318
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,360
If I could take perhaps Russo's most
memorable example of the true citizen,

319
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,410
it comes from an example,

320
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,040
he lifts from the Roman Ryder Plutarch,

321
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:10,581
uh,

322
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:14,150
that he uses in the
opening pages of his book,

323
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,080
the meal,

324
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,130
which I hope you will have a
chance to read at some other time.

325
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,930
And here he tells an unforgettable
story for anybody who ever reads a meal.

326
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,250
A Spartan woman,

327
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,084
he writes,

328
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,950
had five sons in the army and
was awaiting news of the battle.

329
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,970
It five sons in the army and
was awaiting news of the battle.

330
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,180
A helot slave arrives trembling.

331
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,400
She asks him for news,

332
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,500
you're five sons were killed.

333
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,170
The hell at replies based slave.

334
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,430
Did I ask you this?

335
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,470
We won the victory.

336
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,363
He says,

337
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,690
the mother runs to the temple
and gives thanks to the gods

338
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,460
here for Russo is the ancient citizen
an example that is both terrible and

339
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:02,984
sublime,

340
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,200
which of course he wants it to be,

341
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,000
intends it to be.

342
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,860
There is the example of
what the true citizen is.

343
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,120
The question when you consider this
possibility is weather Russo's idea of the

344
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:24,881
freedom of the citizen freedom to live
under self imposed law leads to a higher

345
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:28,460
form of nobility,

346
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:33,461
high higher than the kind of low minded
pursuit of one self interest as Roussel

347
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:35,750
wants.

348
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,750
He wants to dignify politics again by
leading to a higher form of nobility,

349
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:44,690
or does it result in a
new kind of despotism,

350
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:46,310
the despotism of law,

351
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,760
the despotism of obedience to
the general will and of course,

352
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,840
underlying that sinister
a reading of Rousseau's,

353
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:55,350
uh,

354
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:00,060
of Russo is the famous or maybe infamous
statement that not only that the

355
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:02,310
general will is the source of freedom,

356
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,620
but that anyone who obeys,

357
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,620
who refuses to obey the general will,

358
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,230
may be in his famous formulation,

359
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,360
may be forced to be free.

360
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,230
That anyone who disobeys it,

361
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:15,721
uh,

362
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:18,060
in being chastised or being,

363
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,510
uh,

364
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,570
can be as you were forced to be free,

365
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:22,963
uh,

366
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,530
recall that this is a
conception of freedom,

367
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:30,751
which again,

368
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:33,720
is almost the opposite of that,

369
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,690
of what we might call
the liberal tradition.

370
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,471
A view,

371
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:37,951
which in a,

372
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,221
in a,

373
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:38,930
in a gigantic,

374
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,620
slightly paradoxical way,

375
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:44,850
was given a very powerful
formula formulation by hubs.

376
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:50,040
I want to read a passage that I read
a couple of weeks ago from Hobbs,

377
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,160
which I think stands as a striking
contrast to dat of Rousseau's.

378
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,010
Uh,

379
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,550
in chapter again in chapter
21 of Leviathan Hobbs Rights,

380
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,250
the Athenians and the Romans were free.

381
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,920
That is they were free Commonweal's.

382
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,050
Not that any particular men had liberty
to resist their own representatives,

383
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,910
but their representatives had the
liberty to resist or invade other people.

384
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:20,280
Hobbes clearly says that the ancient
freedom was the freedom of the cult of the

385
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:20,881
collective.

386
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:22,770
It wasn't the freedom of the individual,

387
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,770
the freedom of the authorities as he says,

388
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:28,380
to resist or invade other people.

389
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,620
There is written and the tourists of the
city of Luca remember that in the great

390
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:36,000
characters at this day,

391
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:37,350
the word Libertas,

392
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,870
and yet he goes on to say,

393
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,190
no man convince,

394
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:45,960
infer that a particular man has more
liberty or immunity from service to the

395
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:49,770
Commonwealth there than in Constantinople.

396
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,570
That is to say freedom for
hubs consists of as he puts it,

397
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,310
immunity from service,

398
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,260
immunity from service.

399
00:19:58,261 --> 00:19:59,190
And for this reason,

400
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:04,191
there is no reason to believe that anyone
is free or in the Republican city have

401
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:05,190
Luca,

402
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,410
which has Libertas on the wall.

403
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,620
Then in Constantinople that seems to
already a hundred or so years before

404
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,170
Rousseau suggests a powerful
alternative to their view.

405
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,790
His view of freedom to Hobbs is
point like Rousseau's is extreme.

406
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,170
Uh,

407
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,220
and that in many ways is the
power of these two views.

408
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:29,820
Uh,

409
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:34,110
Hobbes is view as freedom
is immunity from service.

410
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,860
Uh,

411
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,500
Russo's view is that freedom consists,

412
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:39,570
you might say only in service.

413
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,970
Our freedom starts where,

414
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,980
where the law begins.

415
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,631
And again,

416
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:50,631
at the basis of this or radically
different views of the role of participant

417
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:54,880
political participation
in lawmaking for Russo.

418
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:55,331
Again,

419
00:20:55,331 --> 00:21:00,331
laws are legitimate only if everyone
has a direct share in making them.

420
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,770
It doesn't mean we all
agree with the outcome,

421
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,980
but only if we have a some kind of share
or voice in making them for hubs for

422
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:12,820
lock,

423
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,890
for the authors of the federalist papers.

424
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,970
On the other hand,

425
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:20,971
the direct involvement of the citizen in
lawmaking is clearly a subordinate or a

426
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:27,391
secondary good legislation is better
handled by persons chosen from the

427
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:29,980
electorate who are so to speak,

428
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,740
the agents or representatives
of the people.

429
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,750
This was what the federalist authors
argued was the great advance of modern

430
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:38,740
political science,

431
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:40,750
the doctrine of representation.

432
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:45,910
What is far more important
for the federalist authors
as well as for lock hubs

433
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,120
and that tradition is that law is be
generally known that they be applied by

434
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:56,941
impartial judges rather than they be the
direct expression of the general will.

435
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:58,720
Uh,

436
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,970
in many ways underlying the,

437
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,391
again,

438
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:06,391
liberal conception of law is a certain
distrust of the collective wisdom or the

439
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:10,300
collective sovereignty of the people.

440
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,093
Uh,

441
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:17,550
it is too cumbersome in many ways and
also too dangerous a mechanism to call

442
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:23,080
people together to decide on
matters over public concern.

443
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:25,630
This is better left
according to this tradition,

444
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,980
to representatives.

445
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,580
Russo obviously could not disagree more.

446
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,130
Okay.

447
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:37,130
One could say that Rousseau makes who
ROIC and unreasonable assumptions about

448
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:39,900
human nature.

449
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:44,901
Why do we want to gather
together constantly or often
to decide to deliberate

450
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:51,990
and to debate over
questions of public concern?

451
00:22:51,991 --> 00:22:52,771
Most people,

452
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,350
it's hard enough just to
get most people as we know,

453
00:22:55,351 --> 00:22:56,460
to go out to vote.

454
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,270
Why do we want to engage
in endless debate?

455
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,660
Uh,

456
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,493
something like,

457
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:01,890
you know,

458
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:01,981
uh,

459
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:02,820
college,

460
00:23:02,821 --> 00:23:03,180
uh,

461
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,440
uh,

462
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,160
council,

463
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,470
uh,

464
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,951
meeting,

465
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,270
trying to discuss,

466
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:06,660
uh,

467
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,560
what to do,

468
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:07,861
uh,

469
00:23:07,861 --> 00:23:11,600
whether to buy or not a new set
of dumbbells for the weightroom.

470
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,001
You know,

471
00:23:12,001 --> 00:23:15,220
this is a debate that will go
on for hours and hours and May,

472
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,560
maybe even weeks.

473
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,470
Don't people simply want to be left alone.

474
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,543
Why do you,

475
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,120
uh,

476
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,601
why,

477
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:21,780
uh,

478
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,890
it Russo's again,

479
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:27,780
he seems in some way to make
a unreasonable assumptions
about human nature and

480
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,070
our capacity to,

481
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,210
uh,

482
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,480
to d to engage in debate.

483
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,900
But Russo will tell you he is
not being idealistic at all.

484
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:40,320
He is starting from the
assumption of men as they are.

485
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:41,154
He says,

486
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,800
unless everyone who wants to say is
engaged in the process of legislation,

487
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:51,250
there is no way for you to know that the
laws will be an expression of your will

488
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:57,020
rather than simply the private
will or corporate will have some,

489
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,530
uh,

490
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,890
individual or intermediary body.

491
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:05,891
You will find yourself in a condition of
dependence and slavery and the will of

492
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:07,670
others.

493
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,470
And what is really an issue,

494
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:09,920
uh,

495
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,920
for Russo is a freedom from
dependence on some faction,

496
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,280
some interest or some association
that we have come to call today.

497
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,360
Interest groups in some way.

498
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,900
Russo's appeal is not to our altruism,

499
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:27,651
uh,

500
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:31,220
but rather to our selfishness
in some way our desire,

501
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:35,360
our private or selfish desire
to preserve our freedom and,

502
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,950
and resist the willful
domination of others,

503
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,350
uh,

504
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,183
upon it.

505
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,383
So,

506
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,573
um,

507
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:51,190
so far this all in many ways is very
abstract and Roussel deliberately sets out

508
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:53,000
his,

509
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,720
uh,

510
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,030
plan for the general
will in the lane in a,

511
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,040
in a highly abstract and
semi semi technical language.

512
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,140
But he turns to questions,

513
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:11,141
particularly in books three about how
is the general will actually applied.

514
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:12,620
How does it,

515
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,340
uh,

516
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,150
how does it,

517
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,290
how is it applied?

518
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,191
And here,

519
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:18,890
Rousseau is far more specific,

520
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,250
uh,

521
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:24,250
sociologically and so on about the
conditions under which the general will,

522
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:25,470
uh,

523
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,930
or a general will,

524
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,600
can come about in the first place.

525
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,470
The general will can only
operate in small states,

526
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:39,440
much like the size of an
ancient republic in one place.

527
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,890
When particularly notable
place in the social contract,

528
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:47,891
he says only the island country of
Corsica is today a place where the general

529
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:50,510
will might be established.

530
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:52,100
The modern nation state,

531
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:52,521
uh,

532
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:55,430
as we have come to think
of it as far to diff,

533
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:00,050
large and diffuse a to determine
the general will such a,

534
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,390
such a state touch.

535
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,260
Large states will necessarily,

536
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,070
uh,

537
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:08,030
entailed considerable
degrees of social inequality,

538
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,021
of wealth,

539
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:09,950
of status.

540
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,140
And with such inequality,

541
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,670
such inequalities,

542
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:15,320
there can be no general will.

543
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,140
And finally,

544
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,490
or in addition,

545
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:19,851
uh,

546
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:24,140
as such a state where the general will
is operative would be one that would have

547
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:26,240
to in some sense is shoe,

548
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,021
uh,

549
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:30,380
that temptations of commerce and luxury,

550
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,400
uh,

551
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,170
for these bring with them.

552
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:33,741
Uh,

553
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:34,490
again,

554
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:34,850
uh,

555
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,840
large scale,

556
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,170
uh,

557
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,100
inequalities.

558
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:41,570
His ideal city seems to be a
kind of agrarian democracy,

559
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,500
a small scale,

560
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,780
a agrarian society.

561
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,300
Uh,

562
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,750
and yet at the same time we
might get the impression that,

563
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,170
uh,

564
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,120
only a direct democracy,

565
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,410
uh,

566
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:59,730
would satisfy Russo's requirement's
for a general the general will.

567
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,180
And yet we find out this
is not quite the case.

568
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:03,960
Uh,

569
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,830
in book three which I helped
you will look at with some care,

570
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,730
uh,

571
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,250
he shows surprising flexibility,

572
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,031
uh,

573
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:17,031
about the forms of government that may
be appropriate to different physical,

574
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,150
uh,

575
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,740
and geogrid in different climates
and different topographies and so on.

576
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,420
In the chapter on democracy,

577
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,080
he remarks even where
there a people of God's,

578
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:32,970
it would govern itself democratically
and then he adds so perfect.

579
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,310
A government is not suited to men.

580
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:41,300
So he is skeptical about the
possibility of a direct democracy.

581
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,070
And by that he means a democracy.

582
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:46,440
Not only were the people legislate,

583
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,303
bring,

584
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,390
create law,

585
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:53,660
but where they are in charge also with
the administration of law as well,

586
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:56,220
the execution or enforcement of the law,

587
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:59,790
he is very skeptical about
that kind of democracies.

588
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:00,061
Again,

589
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:02,850
democracies are only possible under very,

590
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:04,290
very special,

591
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,030
unique circumstances.

592
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,691
Otherwise,

593
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:08,970
aristocracy monarchy,

594
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,370
some kind of even mixed government,

595
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,060
uh,

596
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,120
is possible or even desirable.

597
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:20,121
He insists and the separation of powers
for much the same reasons that one finds

598
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:21,324
in lock,

599
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:27,020
the people who make the law should not
be charged with responsible for executing

600
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:28,320
and enforcing them.

601
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,320
And throughout this part of the book,

602
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:36,321
Russo seems to be in dialogue with an
unnamed rival when he'd sometimes simply

603
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:39,390
refers to as a famous author.

604
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,650
That author is of course Montesquieu.

605
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,240
The,

606
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,541
the,

607
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:46,080
the author of the spirit of the law is,

608
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,951
uh,

609
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:49,680
that came out in 1755.

610
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,330
And Montesquieu was of course,

611
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:56,331
famous for arguing at different forms
of government must be tailored to

612
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,780
different climates,

613
00:28:57,781 --> 00:28:58,950
different geographies,

614
00:28:58,951 --> 00:29:01,230
different circumstances in many ways.

615
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,190
In book three,

616
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:05,100
Russo seems to indicate or to introduce,

617
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,150
uh,

618
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:06,983
a very,

619
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,561
very,

620
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:09,300
almost unroof civilian,

621
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,260
uh,

622
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,790
emphasis and prudence,

623
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,810
moderation,

624
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,220
flexibility,

625
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,410
uh,

626
00:29:15,411 --> 00:29:20,411
that that seems at odds with the dogmatic
claims of the first two books with its

627
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:27,180
emphasis upon the absolute
inviolability of sovereignty.

628
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,000
But most important for Roussel,

629
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:35,180
it is important that legislative authority
in whatever kind of constitution and

630
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:37,260
under whatever kind of government,

631
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,680
that legislative authority is only
is always held by the people in their

632
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:45,760
collective capacity.

633
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,310
This is why in a very powerful chapter,

634
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:53,311
book three Chapter 15 Rousseau
rejects all together the legitimacy of

635
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:55,090
representative government.

636
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,700
That passage or that chapter
could be taken already,

637
00:29:58,701 --> 00:30:00,430
is a kind of repudiation,

638
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,780
not just of lock,

639
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,150
Locke's theory of the representative,

640
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,050
but also,

641
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:05,321
you know,

642
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:10,321
20 years or so before the fact of the
federalist argument for representation

643
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,410
sovereignty,

644
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:12,071
he says,

645
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:15,370
can never be delegated to sovereignty,

646
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:16,480
can never be,

647
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,680
uh,

648
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,610
represented.

649
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:20,590
It can only be expressed.

650
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,370
The general will can never
be delegated to some,

651
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,660
to someone else.

652
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,570
If you do that,

653
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,230
if you delegate the
Authority for making law,

654
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:32,861
you are,

655
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:37,861
he wants to say on the first step down
the road to tyranny because you give

656
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,370
someone else some partial
body or association,

657
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:45,640
the power to make law over you.

658
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,160
Oh,

659
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,160
the law making function can only
legitimately be jailed by the people

660
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,870
themselves.

661
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:54,960
Uh,

662
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,320
I'm going to skip over a bunch of stuff
that has to do very interestingly.

663
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,750
I hope you can discuss
it in your sections,

664
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:04,870
perhaps with Rousseau's
account of the legislator,

665
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:10,260
the extraordinary individual who was
responsible at the beginnings of regimes

666
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:12,220
for shaping the general,

667
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,100
for molding a people and for as it were,

668
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:19,180
giving the general will a kind of
shape and distinctive direction.

669
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,950
And I'm also going to skip,

670
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:21,850
uh,

671
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:26,770
for our purposes the very interesting
and discussion of civil theology,

672
00:31:26,771 --> 00:31:28,090
which occupies the theme,

673
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:33,120
the very last chapter of the book book
for Chapter Eight where Russo talks about

674
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:34,270
the way in which,

675
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:34,820
uh,

676
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,440
a civil religion must be tailored to,

677
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:38,920
uh,

678
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,030
bring about love and
obedience to the general will.

679
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:43,631
Uh,

680
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:45,010
it was that chapter,

681
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:45,761
I should say,

682
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:48,340
that more than anything else led to,

683
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,700
uh,

684
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,290
the books being burned,

685
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:50,680
uh,

686
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,540
and band,

687
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,000
uh,

688
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
in Geneva and in other places and for
its powerful attack on Christianity in

689
00:31:58,661 --> 00:31:58,960
that,

690
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,980
in that chapter,

691
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:00,491
uh,

692
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:02,050
I'm going to pass over that

693
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,721
with the time being,

694
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:08,410
to look at the legacies of
Rousseau and to talk about what,

695
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,160
and I just deliberately use
that word in the plural,

696
00:32:12,161 --> 00:32:17,161
the legacies of Roussel because there
is virtually no part of modern life,

697
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:17,800
uh,

698
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,611
political,

699
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:19,331
cultural,

700
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:20,290
intellectual,

701
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,423
moral,

702
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,000
uh,

703
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
with that does not in some sense bear
the stamp or fingerprints of Jacques

704
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,210
Rousseau Russo's description of the
legislator as a kind of political founder,

705
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,343
uh,

706
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,461
creating,

707
00:32:36,461 --> 00:32:38,980
creating a people was for many,

708
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:39,560
uh,

709
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,520
in many ways.

710
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,563
Uh,

711
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:42,250
the,

712
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,083
uh,

713
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:43,831
the,

714
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:44,121
the,

715
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:44,954
uh,

716
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,651
closely,

717
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:50,450
closely connected with
the French revolution and
particularly the claim of the

718
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:53,360
revolutionaries to create a new nation,

719
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:54,230
a new people,

720
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:54,740
a new,

721
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,790
a new sovereign,

722
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,400
a new popular sovereign and France.

723
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:02,340
Consider the following words of
the famous revolutionary rubs.

724
00:33:02,341 --> 00:33:05,090
Pierre in his homage are Russo,

725
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,660
a written in 1791 divine man.

726
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,420
This is Rob's PR divine man.

727
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:13,300
You taught my s you,

728
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,000
you,

729
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,690
you taught me to know myself
while I was still young.

730
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:22,040
You made me appreciate the dignity of
my nature and reflect upon the great

731
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,630
principles of the social order.

732
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,880
The old edifice is crumbling.

733
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,450
The Portico of the new edifice
is rising up upon its ruins.

734
00:33:29,451 --> 00:33:30,770
And thanks to you,

735
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,050
I have brought my stone to it,

736
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,730
received my homage.

737
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:35,750
As weak as it is,

738
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,980
it must please you.

739
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,220
I wish to follow your venerable footsteps.

740
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:45,020
Happy if in the perilous career that an
unprecedented revolution just opened up

741
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:45,854
before us,

742
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,540
I remained constantly faithful to the
inspirations that I found in your text.

743
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,853
It can be no.

744
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,570
People might tell you that the writings
of Rousseau had no influence on the

745
00:33:56,571 --> 00:34:01,160
French revolution that
the French revolution was
brought about by bread crises

746
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:02,720
and economic problems.

747
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:03,554
And so on.

748
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,990
Absolute Baloney.

749
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:06,921
Uh,

750
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:07,121
the,

751
00:34:07,121 --> 00:34:07,311
the,

752
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,960
the writings of Rousseau,

753
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:09,470
uh,

754
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:14,470
had this powerful influence on the
idea of creating a new people and a new

755
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,303
nation.

756
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,481
And yet,

757
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:18,650
despite a,

758
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:23,420
what appears to be a utopian and
impractical and his politics,

759
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:23,691
again,

760
00:34:23,691 --> 00:34:28,220
Russo had a profound influence
on the politics of his era.

761
00:34:28,221 --> 00:34:30,290
He was approached during his lifetime,

762
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:30,681
uh,

763
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:33,290
to write constitutions for Poland and,

764
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,490
and for Corsica.

765
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,181
And of course,

766
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:38,810
that was the island
where a generation later,

767
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,420
a man named Napoleon Bonaparte,

768
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,260
uh,

769
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,890
was,

770
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:43,160
uh,

771
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,140
born who attempted to,

772
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,130
you might say in a,

773
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:50,690
in some way extend route sows
teaching not just a France,

774
00:34:50,691 --> 00:34:52,010
but to all of Europe,

775
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:52,461
uh,

776
00:34:52,461 --> 00:34:57,461
at the point of a gun to bring democracy
to all of Europe at the point of a gun.

777
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,540
Does that sound familiar at all in any
way related to events going on now?

778
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,340
Uh,

779
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:03,580
we're,

780
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:03,741
we're,

781
00:35:03,741 --> 00:35:06,250
we have a new kind of
Bonaparte has perhaps,

782
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,533
um,

783
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,611
in many ways,

784
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:15,050
although Russo's attack on representative
government would seem to put him

785
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:18,140
strongly at odds with the
American constitution,

786
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,131
uh,

787
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:23,210
his glorification of the rural
republic based on equality,

788
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:24,560
moral simplicity,

789
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,320
skepticism of commerce and luxury.

790
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,280
This was to be re echoed in
the writings of Jefferson,

791
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:31,911
uh,

792
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:35,210
with his ideal of a nation
of small yeoman farmers.

793
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:39,750
And certainly any reader of Tocqueville's
d depiction in celebration of the

794
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:42,720
independent townships of New England,

795
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:43,740
uh,

796
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,920
Tocqueville's account of this
was directly dependent on,

797
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,400
uh,

798
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,810
his reading of Rousseau,

799
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:52,230
the small scale experiment
in direct democracy.

800
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:57,231
That Tocqueville saw was a real world
example of a kind of politics governed by

801
00:35:58,651 --> 00:35:59,730
the general will.

802
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:04,290
And when you read those early chapters
from Tocqueville's democracy in America

803
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,300
about the New England township,

804
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:10,290
you will very much see
Tocqueville looking at America,

805
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:15,470
do the lenses that were in
some ways crafted or shaped by,

806
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,520
uh,

807
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,353
Rousseau.

808
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,390
Uh,

809
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:23,340
and that influence was palpable
on a whole host of later,

810
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:23,730
uh,

811
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,410
19th century writers,

812
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:25,740
uh,

813
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,760
like toss die.

814
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,150
Uh,

815
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,841
for instance,

816
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:31,050
who celebration of
Russian peasant life was,

817
00:36:31,051 --> 00:36:31,380
uh,

818
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,870
inspired by Rousseau in to Tolstoy,

819
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,430
Rousseau influenced,

820
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,180
uh,

821
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,650
the establishment of the year Israeli
kibbutz movement that was also founded by

822
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:43,100
Russian Jews who had
been influenced by toll.

823
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,740
So you have a sort of
self reinforcing cycle,

824
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:47,120
uh,

825
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,360
have influenced these,

826
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:53,420
you might say small rural socialistic
experiments and communal living,

827
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:54,181
uh,

828
00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:56,490
exhibit the same kind of equality,

829
00:36:56,491 --> 00:37:01,491
self-government devotion to the common
good that Roussel helped people imagine.

830
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,990
Might be possible.

831
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,860
And yet Russo's influence
was not limited to politics.

832
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,410
If he was a divine man,

833
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,330
as Robespierre called him,

834
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,520
he was no less so to Emmanuel Kant
who claimed that it was his reading of

835
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:18,354
Rousseau,

836
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:18,630
uh,

837
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:23,250
that led him to learn respect for
the dignity and the rights of man.

838
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:23,970
Uh,

839
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:24,780
that's what roots,

840
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,210
that's what concept he called Russo,

841
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,280
the Newton of the moral universe.

842
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,443
Uh,

843
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,790
Kahn's entire philosophy.

844
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,820
And I hope you also have
a chance to read cons,

845
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:39,900
critique of practical reason in
some later philosophy course.

846
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:40,451
Concent.

847
00:37:40,451 --> 00:37:45,120
Tire moral philosophy is a kind of
deepened in radicalized Roussel organism

848
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,660
where what Russo called the general will
is transmuted into what Kant calls the

849
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:55,410
rational will and the
categorical imperative.

850
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:01,380
And it was not the least of Rousseau's
a legacies that after his death,

851
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,580
he became a hero both to,

852
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:03,960
to,

853
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,040
to the revolution,

854
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:05,490
uh,

855
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:10,490
and to the counterrevolution both to a
revival of Roman style republicanism as

856
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:13,110
well as to romanticism.

857
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,600
Or if I couldn't use the
words of a great Russo,

858
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:16,140
Ian,

859
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,490
a Jane Austin,

860
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,330
he became both an advocate
of sense and sensibility.

861
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,140
Uh,

862
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,640
Emerson Thoreau,

863
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:24,301
uh,

864
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:29,301
American transcendentalism
with its worship of nature
and it's protests against

865
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:33,270
the kind of deadening and
corrupting influence of society.

866
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:37,530
All of these people were the
direct areas of Rousseau,

867
00:38:37,531 --> 00:38:37,930
Rousseau,

868
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,950
his last work,

869
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:39,320
uh,

870
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,320
a book called the reveries of a solitary
walker set the stage for later American

871
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:48,670
classics like Walden Pond
and generations of nature.

872
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:53,671
Writers that have come after it and
imitated it only by turning away from the

873
00:38:55,241 --> 00:39:00,241
noise and buisiness of society can one
return to what proceeds society to the

874
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:03,940
feeling of existence,

875
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:09,030
to the feeling of or sweetness a of
mere existence to the sentiment of

876
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:10,541
existence.

877
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:15,130
The something is swatch as Russo
caused at the sentiment of the self,

878
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:20,131
there is a kind of union that
he celebrates with nature
that puts the solitary,

879
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:22,060
this Tyler Terry Walker,

880
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:22,660
uh,

881
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,200
either above humanity or below it.

882
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,090
That type of man,

883
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,040
a four shadowed by Rousseau.

884
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:35,250
The solitary is no longer a philosopher
in any sense that we would understand

885
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:36,371
it,

886
00:39:36,371 --> 00:39:40,690
but might be better understood
as an artist or a visionary.

887
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:41,530
Uh,

888
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:46,530
he can claim a privileged place in society
because such a person regards him or

889
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:52,120
herself as the conscience of that society.

890
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:58,080
His claim to privilege is based
on a heightened moral sensitivity,

891
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:58,780
uh,

892
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,780
read it in his wisdom or is,

893
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:02,320
uh,

894
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,370
rationality.

895
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,640
And it is this kind of
radical individualism,

896
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:11,620
the radical detachment of the solitary
from the interests of society,

897
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,140
uh,

898
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:17,140
that is perhaps Russo's deepest
and most enduring legacy,

899
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:18,730
uh,

900
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:19,150
for,

901
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,200
for us today.

902
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,550
So on that note,

903
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,590
I wish you a good break.

904
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,080
Uh,

905
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,050
I hope you have a lot of Turkey to eight,

906
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,150
and you come back well rested.

907
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,201
And most,

908
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:29,830
most,

909
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,060
most importantly,

910
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:35,560
we come back with a win over
the evil empire to our north.

911
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,850
Thank you very much.
