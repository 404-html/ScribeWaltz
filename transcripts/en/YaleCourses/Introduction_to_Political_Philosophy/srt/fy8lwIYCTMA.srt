1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,130
I was a,

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:02,690
I was,

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:02,970
I was,

4
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,380
I've always been told that,

5
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:05,214
uh,

6
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,220
any serious introduction to political
philosophy has to start with a big piece

7
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:11,304
of Plato.

8
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,780
All right?

9
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,231
So we've,

10
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:16,110
we've made some effort to do that.

11
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,520
Uh,

12
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,800
but now also we have to move on.

13
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,750
So we moved to Plato's son is adopted
son in a manner of speaking Aristotle.

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,013
Uh,

15
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,980
there's a story about
the life of Aristotle.

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,840
Uh,

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,160
it goes something like this.

18
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,310
Aristotle was born,

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,770
he spent his life
thinking and then he died.

20
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:48,840
Uh,

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,140
there's obviously more
to his life than that.

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,071
Uh,

23
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:54,150
but to some degree,

24
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:59,151
this captures some of the way in which
Aristotle has been perceived over the

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,001
centuries.

26
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:03,000
That is to say the ultimate philosopher.

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,910
Aristotle was born in the year three 84,

28
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:09,630
uh,

29
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,320
15 years after the trial of Socrates,

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,090
who was born in the northern part of
Greece in a city called Sta Guiro,

31
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,240
which is part of what
is now called Macedonia.

32
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,830
It was called that then.

33
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,240
And when he was about your age,

34
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,180
when he was 17 or thereabouts,

35
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:32,550
maybe slightly younger than many of you.

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,050
Uh,

37
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:39,050
he was sent by his father
to do what you are doing.

38
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:42,360
He was sent by his
father to go to college.

39
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,260
Uh,

40
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,130
he was sent to Athens
to study at the academy.

41
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,280
The first university spoke
about established by,

42
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,143
by Plato.

43
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,360
But unlike most of you,

44
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:59,361
Aristotle did not spend four
years at the platonic academy.

45
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:02,640
He remained attached
to it for the next 20,

46
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,183
uh,

47
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,720
until the death of Plato and
after the death of Plato.

48
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,530
Uh,

49
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,700
perhaps because of the choice
of successors to the academy,

50
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,860
Aristotle left Athens,

51
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,880
uh,

52
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,880
first to re first for Asia minor and
then to return to his home in Macedonia

53
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,510
where he had been summoned by King
Philip to establish a school for the

54
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:30,834
children,

55
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,220
uh,

56
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,390
of the Macedonian ruling class.

57
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,210
And it was here that Aristotle
met and taught Phillip's son,

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,250
right?

59
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:40,440
Who,

60
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,590
who was Phillips of Macedonia,

61
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:44,790
his son Alexander.

62
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,690
You all remember the recent movie of a
year or two ago about Troy with Collin

63
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,000
Farrel about Alexander who
played Aristotle in that film.

64
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:56,700
Do you remember Anthony Hopkins?

65
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:57,660
Actual excellent.

66
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:57,961
He was,

67
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:58,794
he was a,

68
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,840
was it Anthony Hopkins?

69
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,690
I have in my notes here.

70
00:03:05,691 --> 00:03:06,830
It was Christopher Palmer.

71
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:08,630
Okay.

72
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,470
I have to check.

73
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,270
I'll have to Google that when I go home,

74
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,680
but maybe it may be a ride.

75
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:12,830
Well,

76
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,900
I think I have a feeling
it wasn't Anthony Hopkins.

77
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:15,380
You're right.

78
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,550
Whoever it was an excellent,

79
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:18,950
Aristotle didn't have a large
enough part in the film.

80
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,151
In any case,

81
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:25,151
Aristotle returned to Athens later on
in established a school of his own,

82
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,930
uh,

83
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,880
arrival to the Platonic
Academy who did that?

84
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:35,570
He called the lyceum and there is a
story that near the end of his life,

85
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,860
Aristotle was himself brought up on
capital charges as with Socrates due to

86
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:46,130
another wave of hostility to philosophy,

87
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,410
but rather unlike Socrates rather
than staying to drink the hemlock,

88
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:56,710
Aristotle left Athens and
Rome was reported to have
said he did not wish to see

89
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:02,120
the Athenians sin against
philosophy for a second time.

90
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,740
I'll go back to that story in a minute
because I think it's very revealing about

91
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:07,574
Aristotle,

92
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,411
but in any way,

93
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:14,411
this story helps to underscore some I
think important differences between Plato

94
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,063
and Aristotle.

95
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,690
At one level you might say there is an
important difference in style that you

96
00:04:20,691 --> 00:04:25,580
will see almost immediately unlike
his intellectual godfathers,

97
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:30,581
Socrates who wrote nothing but converse
endlessly and unlike his own teacher,

98
00:04:32,451 --> 00:04:37,220
Plato who wrote imitations of this
endless Socratic conversations.

99
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:42,221
Aristotle wrote disciplined and thematic
treatises on virtually every topic from

100
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:48,941
biology to ethics to metaphysics
to literary criticism and politics.

101
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,240
One can assume safely that Aristotle would
have received tenure in any number of

102
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:58,840
departments at Yale.

103
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,510
Where is Socrates could not have applied
to have been a teaching assistant

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,580
and these differences conceal others

105
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,000
for Plato would same.

106
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:18,001
The study of politics was always
bound up with deeply philosophical and

107
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:19,600
speculative questions,

108
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,520
questions of metaphysics,

109
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:25,000
questions of the structure of the cosmos,

110
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,380
what is the soul?

111
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:27,214
What is,

112
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,971
what is,

113
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:29,170
what is the soul about?

114
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,960
Aristotle appears from the beginning to
look more like what we would think of as

115
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,400
a political scientist.

116
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,030
He collected constitutions 158 of them
all from throughout the ancient world and

117
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:49,570
was the first to give some kind of
conceptual rigor to the vocabulary of

118
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:50,410
political life.

119
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,503
Above all,

120
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,510
Aristotle's works like the politics and
the Nicomachean ethics were explicitly

121
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:01,070
intended as works of
political instruction,

122
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,600
political education.

123
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,070
They seem to be designed to to recruit
philosophers and potential philosophers

124
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,690
and to shape and educate
citizens and future statesmen.

125
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,890
His work seem less theoretical in a
sense of constructing abstract models of

126
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:23,660
political life.

127
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,230
Then advice giving in the sense of serving
as a sort of civic minded arbiter of

128
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,150
public disputes.

129
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,830
Unlike Socrates who famously in his image
in book seven of the Republic compared

130
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:44,291
political life to a cave and unlikely
apology or Socrates tells his fellow

131
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,090
citizens that their lives,

132
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,490
because unexamined are not worth living.

133
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,180
Aristotle takes seriously the dignity
of the city and showed the way that

134
00:06:56,121 --> 00:07:00,650
philosophy might be useful
to citizens and statement.

135
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,620
Yet for all of this,

136
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,910
one might say there is still a profound
enigma surrounding Aristotle's political

137
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:12,504
works.

138
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,820
To put it simply,

139
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:19,020
one could simply ask,

140
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,740
what were the politics
of Aristotle's politics?

141
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,350
What were Aristotle's
own political beliefs?

142
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,110
Aristotle lived at the
virtual cusp of the,

143
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:35,620
uh,

144
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,030
world of the autonomous city,

145
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:39,970
state of the Greek Polis.

146
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:41,500
Within his own lifetime.

147
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,500
Aristotle would see Athens,

148
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,460
Sparta,

149
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,730
and the other great cities
of Greece swallowed up by
the Great Macedonian Empire

150
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,703
to the north.

151
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,390
What we think of as the
golden age of Greece was,

152
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:00,160
was virtually at an end,

153
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,030
uh,

154
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,860
during the lifetime of Aristotle.

155
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,810
Other Greek thinkers of his time,

156
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:09,811
notably a man named Demosthenes knees
wrote a series of speeches called

157
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:10,990
Philippics,

158
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,010
uh,

159
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,180
Anti Phillip,

160
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,290
uh,

161
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,290
to the north to warn his contemporaries
about the dangers posed to Athens from,

162
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:20,800
uh,

163
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,600
the imperial ambitions,

164
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,041
uh,

165
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,130
of Mastodon.

166
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,430
But Philips warnings came too late.

167
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,120
Uh,

168
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,721
and again,

169
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:30,880
the autonomous Greek Polis,

170
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,220
Plato and Glaucon at a,

171
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,460
a mantis and others would
have known came to an end.

172
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,910
What did Aristotle think of these changes?

173
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,700
What did he think was going on?

174
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,160
He is silent.

175
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,010
Aristotle,

176
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,750
extreme reluctance.

177
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,040
His hesitance

178
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,660
just to the issues of his time are
perhaps the result of his foreignness to

179
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:02,154
Athens.

180
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:08,150
He was not an Athenian and therefore
he lacked the protection of Athenian

181
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:11,074
citizenship.

182
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,590
At the same time you
might think his reticence,

183
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,050
his reluctance to speak in his own voice
may have also been a response to the

184
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:27,291
fate of Socrates and the politically
endangered situation of philosophy.

185
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,740
It for a man is notoriously
secretive and reluctant is Aristotle.

186
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,810
His works acquired over the
centuries virtual canonical status.

187
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,180
He became an authority really one
could say the authority on virtually

188
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:56,601
everything for Thomas Aquinas
who wrote in the 13th century.

189
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,510
Aristotle was referred to by Aquinas
simply as the philosopher was no reason

190
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,560
even to say his name.

191
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,420
He was simply the philosopher

192
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,710
and for uh,

193
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,740
the Great Jewish medieval philosopher,

194
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,000
Moses Maimonides.

195
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,060
Aristotle was called by him,

196
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,820
the master of those who know.

197
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,641
Think of that,

198
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:31,641
the master of those who know for
centuries Aristotle's authority seem to go

199
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:34,650
virtually unchallenged,

200
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,013
right?

201
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,323
You with me?

202
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,153
Yet

203
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,080
the authority of Aristotle obviously no
longer has quite the power that it once

204
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:50,614
did.

205
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,500
The attack began.

206
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:59,550
Not all that long ago really only is
late as the 17th century in a man who we

207
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:06,361
will re later this semester named
Thomas Hobbs was one who led the pack,

208
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,080
led the charge

209
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,970
in the 46 chapter of Leviathan chapter,

210
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:14,950
we will relator Hobbs road.

211
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,880
I believe that scares anything can be
more repugnant to government then much of

212
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,800
what Aristotle has said in his politics,

213
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,600
nor more ignorantly then a
great part of his ethics.

214
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,033
Think of that.

215
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,590
Nothing more repugnant to government
then what Hobbs wrote in his,

216
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,990
I mean that Aristotle
wrote in his politics

217
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,653
naturally,

218
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,070
all thinkers to some degree have read
Aristotle through their own lenses.

219
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Aquinas read Aristotle is a defender
of monarchy and Dante in his book,

220
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,210
the Monarchia on monarchy.

221
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,240
So Aristotle was giving credence to the
idea of a universal monarchy under the

222
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,650
leadership of a Christian Prince,

223
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,751
but Hobbs,

224
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:05,050
sorry,

225
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,621
Aristotle,

226
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:06,490
quite differently.

227
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,353
For Hobbs,

228
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,690
Aristotle taught the dangerous doctrine
of Republican government that was seen

229
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:14,290
to be practice,

230
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:19,030
particularly during the Cromwellian
period in England during the civil war.

231
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,120
Aristotle's doctrine that
man is a political animal.

232
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,080
Hobbes believed could only
result result in did result.

233
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:26,561
In fact,

234
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:28,600
in regicide the murder of kings,

235
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,800
and there are certainly echoes of this
reading of Aristotle as a teacher of

236
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,470
participatory Republican government in
the later writings of democratic thinkers

237
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:43,420
from Tocqueville to Hannah Arent.

238
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,091
Anyway,

239
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:51,091
this return just to the
enigma of Aristotle who was
this strange and elusive man

240
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,110
who's writing seem to have been enlisted
boats for the support of monarchy and

241
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:00,700
for republics,

242
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,730
even for a universal monarchy and
smaller participatory democratic kind of

243
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:08,074
government.

244
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,150
Who was this man and how
to understand his writings?

245
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:13,480
Well,

246
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,480
the best place to start is of course with
his views stated in the opening pages

247
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:22,720
of the politics and the
naturalness of the city.

248
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,380
His claim,

249
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:33,190
that man is by nature
of the political animal,

250
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,903
right?

251
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,020
It's his famous claim.

252
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,010
What does that mean?

253
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,130
We are the political animal.

254
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,960
Aristotle states his reasons succinctly,

255
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,410
maybe to succinctly on the third page
of the politics where he remarks that

256
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,600
every city or every
policy exists by nature

257
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,170
and he goes on to infer from this.

258
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:10,690
That man is what he calls the Zohan.

259
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,580
Politik.

260
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,130
Yeah,

261
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,750
the political animal.

262
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:18,751
The Polis animal and his
reasoning here brief as it is,

263
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:19,750
is worth following.

264
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,450
Let me just quote him,

265
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,161
that man,

266
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:29,161
he's Tez is much more a political
animal than any kind of B or herd.

267
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,550
Animal is clear.

268
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,030
Why is it clear for we assert,

269
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:34,421
he says,

270
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:39,421
nature does nothing in vain and man
alone among the animals has speech

271
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,910
are other species he notes may have voice,

272
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,410
may have and be able to
distinguish pleasure and pain.

273
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,260
Speech logos is,

274
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:58,430
he is his word for it.

275
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,600
Man has logos,

276
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:00,980
reason or speech.

277
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,570
Word can mean either.

278
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,970
It's more than the ability simply to
distinguish pleasure and pain he goes on,

279
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,850
but logos he's writes serves to reveal
the advantageous and the harmful and

280
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:17,851
hence he writes the just and the unjust
for it is peculiar to man is compared to

281
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:23,840
other animals that he alone has
a perception of good and bad,

282
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,020
just and unjust and other things.

283
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:27,741
In other words,

284
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:32,741
he seems to be saying that it is speech
or reason logos that is able to both

285
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:38,690
distinguish and create
certain moral categories,

286
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,780
certain important moral
categories that we live by.

287
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:43,010
The advantageous,

288
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:43,910
the harmful.

289
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,180
The just and unjust in things of
this sort that constitute as he says,

290
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:51,530
a family and to Paula,

291
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,910
but that's Aristotle in what sense?

292
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,010
We could ask ourselves,

293
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,130
and I think you probably will
be asking in your sections,

294
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:06,131
in what sense is the city by nature and
in what sense are we political animals

295
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,173
by nature?

296
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Aristotle appears to give two different
accounts in the opening pages of the

297
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:16,730
book that you might pay attention to.

298
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,180
In the literal opening.

299
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,760
He gives what looks like a kind
of natural history of the Polis.

300
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,570
He seems there to be a kind
of anthropologist writing
us a natural history.

301
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:37,361
The Polis is natural in the sense that
it is grown out of smaller and lesser

302
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:40,670
forms of Human Association.

303
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:41,990
First comes the family,

304
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,370
then an association of
families in a tribe,

305
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,140
then an associate,

306
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:50,480
a further association in a village,

307
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,550
and then you might say an association
of villages that create a Polish or a

308
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,384
city.

309
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,590
The Polis is natural in the
sense that it is an outgrowth,

310
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:05,890
the most developed form of
of Human Association in the
way that one used to see

311
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:08,870
in natural history museums.

312
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,240
These kind of a biological,

313
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:11,721
you know,

314
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:14,240
charts of human development from,

315
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,103
you know,

316
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,180
these uh,

317
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,750
you know,

318
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,583
lesser

319
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,120
forms of a life all the way up
to civilization in some way.

320
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,733
But there is,

321
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,110
and that is part of Aristotle's argument,

322
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:35,111
but there was this a second sense for
him and in some ways more important sense

323
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:38,750
in which he says the Polis is by nature.

324
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:39,620
It has natural,

325
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,190
the city has natural in that it allows
human beings to achieve and perfect what

326
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,650
he calls there tell us
that is to see their end,

327
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,670
their purpose.

328
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,980
We are political animals.

329
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:57,981
He says because participation in the
life of the city is necessary for the

330
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:00,660
achievement of human excellence,

331
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,480
for the achievement of our wellbeing.

332
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,910
A person who is without a city,

333
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:06,541
he says,

334
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:11,541
who is our Polis without a city must
either be a beast or a God that is to say

335
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,970
below humanity or above it.

336
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:19,950
Our political nature is our essential
characteristic because only by

337
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:23,820
participating in political
life do we achieve,

338
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:28,821
can we acquire the excellence's or the
virtues as he says that our ma that make

339
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:34,851
us what we are that fulfill our two
loss or fulfill our our perfection.

340
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,710
So when Aristotle says that man
is a political animal by nature,

341
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:43,321
he is,

342
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:48,321
he is doing more than simply
asserting just a truism or just some,

343
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,830
some platitude.

344
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:55,370
I mean in many ways he is advancing a
philosophic postulate of great scope and

345
00:18:58,051 --> 00:18:58,884
power.

346
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:04,190
Although the full development of the
thesis is only left deeply embedded,

347
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:10,041
it doesn't fully develop it in this work
or in insane isn't saying that man is

348
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:11,370
political by nature.

349
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,850
Note that he is not saying,

350
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,180
although he has sometimes
taken to be saying this,

351
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:23,181
that he is not saying that there was some
kind of biologically implanted desire

352
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,020
or impulse that we have or share that
leads us to engage in political life.

353
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:33,240
That is to say

354
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,880
we do not.

355
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:40,910
He wants to say engage in politics to say
it's natural for us to do so is not to

356
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:46,341
say we engage in political life
spontaneously and avidly as you might say,

357
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,851
spiders,

358
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:51,600
spin webs or ants build and hills.

359
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,600
He is not a kind of socio biologist of
politics although he sometimes appears

360
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:02,160
this way when he says that man is a
political animal in some ways to the

361
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,510
contrary he says,

362
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:08,511
man is political because not because we
have some biological impulse or instinct

363
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:11,670
that drives us to participate in politics,

364
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:15,090
but he says because we are
possessed of the power of speech.

365
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,610
It is speech that makes us political
speech or reason in many ways far from

366
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,690
determining our behavior
in some kind of a,

367
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,400
again in some kind of
deterministic biological sense,

368
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:34,401
speech or reason gives us a kind of
freedom latitude in area of discretion in

369
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:37,350
our behavior,

370
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,250
not available to other species.

371
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:42,810
It is a reason or speech,

372
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:45,780
not instinct that makes us political,

373
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:48,190
but then the question is for Aristotle,

374
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,220
the question he poses for us is what
is the connection between logos?

375
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,720
The capacity for speech or
rationality into politics,

376
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:01,150
how are these two combined?

377
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,143
Okay.

378
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,650
Why does one lead to
or entailed the other?

379
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,120
Uh,

380
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,630
and in many ways he's not
making a causal claim so much.

381
00:21:11,631 --> 00:21:16,370
He's not saying that it is because we
are rational creatures possessed of the

382
00:21:16,371 --> 00:21:20,660
power of speech that causes
us to engage in politics.

383
00:21:20,661 --> 00:21:21,920
He's saying more,

384
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,370
he has more of an argument
of the kind that one of the,

385
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:28,310
this attribute of logos actually entails.

386
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,120
Uh,

387
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,910
political life logos.

388
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,220
He makes this argument I think

389
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,770
because logos entails to
fundamentally human attributes.

390
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,470
The power to know first the power to know.

391
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:51,530
You could say the power to know is our
ability to recognize by sight members of

392
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:56,010
the same polis or city.

393
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,010
It is above all speech.

394
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:05,310
That in a way ties us to others
of our kind that we share,

395
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:10,771
not just the capacity for language in a
way a linguist a linguist might assert,

396
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:16,771
but that we share a certain common
moral language and it is this sharing of

397
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:18,370
certain common

398
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,770
conceptions of what the just
and unjust that make a city.

399
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,690
And it is that capacity to know.

400
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:29,290
And to recognize others who
share this language with us.

401
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:34,950
That is the first sense in which logos
entails politics but reason entails or

402
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:38,680
logos entails more than uh,

403
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,570
this capacity.

404
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,940
It also entails for Aristotle,

405
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,290
interestingly,

406
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,060
the power of love.

407
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,090
Okay.

408
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:53,090
We love those with whom we are most
intimately related and who are most

409
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,580
immediately present and invisible to us.

410
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,711
In many ways,

411
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:03,090
Aristotle believes our social and
political nature is not the result of

412
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:07,110
calculation as we will see in Hobbes,

413
00:23:07,111 --> 00:23:09,750
Locke and other social contract theorists,

414
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,910
but such things as love,

415
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,960
affection,

416
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,140
friendship and sympathy or the grounds
of political life and are rooted in our

417
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:21,504
logos.

418
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:28,250
It his speech or his speech that allows
a sharing in these qualities that make

419
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:31,140
us fully human.

420
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,333
Yeah,

421
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,360
but to say,

422
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,890
of course that man is political by
nature is not just to say that we become

423
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:42,670
fully human by participating
with others in a city.

424
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,140
It means more than this.

425
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,910
The form of association that leads to
our perfection is net is necessarily

426
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:55,490
something particular Ristick.

427
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,360
The city is always a particular city.

428
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,040
It is always this or that particular city.

429
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:09,940
The Polis is Aristotle as well as Plato
clearly understand is a small society

430
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,960
what could be called
today a closed society,

431
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:22,150
a society that leads to our perfection
that leads us to complete and perfect our

432
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:28,850
t loss must be held
together by bonds of trust,

433
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,553
right?

434
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,860
A friendship of Camaraderie as society
based simply on the mutual calculation of

435
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:43,241
interests could not be a real
political society for Aristotle.

436
00:24:43,251 --> 00:24:45,440
We cannot trust our people.

437
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,950
Aristotle seems to say trust can only
be extended to a fairly small circle of

438
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:54,890
friends and fellow citizens.

439
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,270
Only a small city,

440
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:01,570
small enough to begin to be governed by
relations of trust can be political in

441
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:04,370
Aristotle's sense of the term,

442
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:05,990
the alternative to the city.

443
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,370
The empire can only be ruled despotically.

444
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:15,430
There can be no relations of trust
in a large imperial despotism.

445
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:22,630
So what follows in one sense that what
Aristotle says that man is by nature a

446
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:25,700
political animal and
the city is by nature.

447
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,480
The city can never be a universal state.

448
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:35,290
It can never be something that
incorporates all of humankind.

449
00:25:35,421 --> 00:25:38,140
It can never be a kind of cosmopolitans,

450
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:43,150
a world state or even a
League of states or nations.

451
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:43,850
Uh,

452
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,380
the universal state,

453
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,490
uh,

454
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:51,490
will never allow for or does not allow
for the kind of self perfection that is

455
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:53,564
small,

456
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,520
self-governing Polis.

457
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,990
We'll have the city is
Aristotle understands,

458
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,030
will always exist in a world with others,

459
00:26:02,031 --> 00:26:07,031
cities or other states based on different
principles that might be hostile to

460
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:08,481
one's own.

461
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:13,481
That is to say not even the best city on
areas Aristotle's account can afford to

462
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:16,310
be without a foreign policy,

463
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,400
a good citizen of a democracy will not
be the good citizen of another kind of

464
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,463
regime.

465
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,620
Partisanship and loyalty to one's own
way of life are required by a healthy

466
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:31,964
city.

467
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,200
To put the argument in terms that Paula
Marcus from Plato's republic would have

468
00:26:37,201 --> 00:26:38,000
known,

469
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
friend and enemy are this natural and
ineradicable categories of political life.

470
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,460
Just as we cannot be
friends with our persons.

471
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,480
So the city cannot be friends with or
other cities or the state with all other

472
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:54,091
states,

473
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:58,140
war and the virtues necessary for war are,

474
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:02,130
is natural to the city is are
the virtues of friendship.

475
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,500
Trust and camaraderie.

476
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,650
There are also a necessary,

477
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,070
yeah,

478
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,580
note that in the opening
pages of the book.

479
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,150
Okay.

480
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:20,150
Aristotle doesn't say anything yet about
what kind of city or regime is best.

481
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,800
All he tells us is that we are the Polis
animal by nature and that to achieve

482
00:27:28,741 --> 00:27:31,470
our ends it will be
necessary to live in a polos.

483
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,970
But what kind of Polis,

484
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,400
how should it be governed by the one,

485
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,563
the few,

486
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:41,220
the many or some combination
of these three categories.

487
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:47,010
At this point we know only the most
general features of what a policy is.

488
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:51,060
It must be small enough to be governed
by a common language of justice.

489
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,170
It is not enough merely
to speak the same words,

490
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,460
but in a sense citizens must
have certain common experiences,

491
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:05,420
certain common memory and experience
that shape a city and the people,

492
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:07,950
the large polyglot,

493
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,520
multi ethnic communities of today would
not be for an Aristotle's account,

494
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:20,150
allow for sufficient mutual trust and
friendship to count as a healthy political

495
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:23,604
community.

496
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,010
So Aristotle seems to be offering,

497
00:28:26,011 --> 00:28:27,270
in some respects,

498
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:32,750
a kind of criticism of the kind of states
with which we are our most familiar.

499
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:35,950
Think.

500
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,721
Think about that.

501
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:41,721
When you have your sections or when you
talk about this text with your friends,

502
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,310
what is Aristotle saying about us?

503
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:52,310
The citizens of such a city can only
reach their t Lois to perfection through

504
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,310
participating in the offices in
the ruling offices of a city,

505
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:57,721
and again,

506
00:28:57,721 --> 00:29:02,721
a large cosmopolitan state may allow
each individual the freedom to live as he

507
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:04,680
or she likes.

508
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,930
But this is not the freedom.

509
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,360
This is not freedom as
Aristotle understands it.

510
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:14,361
Freedom only comes to the exercise
of political responsibility,

511
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,380
which means responsibility for and
oversight of one's fellow citizens and the

512
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:24,294
common good.

513
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:29,760
It follows for him that freedom
does not mean living as we like,

514
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:35,810
but freedom is informed by a certain
sense of restraint in awareness that not

515
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,420
all things are permitted,

516
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:45,190
that the good society will be one
that promotes a sense of moderation,

517
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,890
restraint and self control.

518
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,290
Self governance is Eddie.

519
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:55,240
Amanda says that are inseparable
from the experience of freedom.

520
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,070
So in many ways,

521
00:29:59,071 --> 00:29:59,701
Aristotle,

522
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:01,620
their offers as does Plato,

523
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:07,490
a certain kind of critique of the modern
or even the ancient democratic theory

524
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:09,960
of freedom,

525
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,220
which is living,

526
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,900
living as one bikes.

527
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,350
So you can see these opening
pages of the book dense,

528
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,820
uh,

529
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,391
argument.

530
00:30:21,391 --> 00:30:25,020
Being condensed in a very deep ways.

531
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,450
Carry a great deal of
freight is a lot in there.

532
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:31,610
Uh,

533
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,970
that needs to be unpacked.

534
00:30:32,971 --> 00:30:35,520
And I've only tried to
do a little of that,

535
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,700
a little of that here with you today
to go over sort of what Aristotle,

536
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:42,560
uh,

537
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,910
is suggesting in this idea of man,

538
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,140
the Polis animal.

539
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,370
But whatever we may think about this view,

540
00:30:50,371 --> 00:30:54,360
whether we like it or don't like
it or whatever your view might be,

541
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,400
we must also confront

542
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,020
another famous,

543
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,950
more like infamous doctrine.

544
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,280
It is also very much a part of book one.

545
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,650
I refer to his arguments for
the naturalness of slavery.

546
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,750
Aristotle tells us that
slavery is natural.

547
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:25,250
The naturalness of slavery is said to
follow from the belief that inequality,

548
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:30,630
inequality is the basic
rule between human beings.

549
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:38,190
Aristotle and Thomas Jefferson seem to
disagree over the basic fact of human

550
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:39,911
experience,

551
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:41,800
whether it's a quality or inequality,

552
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,891
if this is true,

553
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:48,140
Aristotle's politics seems to be,

554
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,910
seems to stand condemned.

555
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,180
Is the most anti democratic
book ever written?

556
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,043
Is that true?

557
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,570
Aristotle's claim about
naturalness seems to require,

558
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:02,171
as he told us,

559
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:03,004
slavery

560
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:09,430
the category you'll distinction of
humanity into masters and slaves.

561
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,360
How to understand that.

562
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,081
Again,

563
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:19,081
Aristotle's argument is deeply compact
and will be easily misunderstood if you

564
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:21,100
only read it once.

565
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,810
It will just as likely be
misunderstood if you read it three,

566
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:26,201
four,

567
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:27,610
five or 10 times.

568
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,070
If you are not attentive

569
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,033
to what he's saying,

570
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,220
miss learning to be closely.

571
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,920
What was Aristotle saying

572
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,340
in the first place?

573
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,100
It's important that we avoid,

574
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,010
I think two equally,

575
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,283
uh,

576
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,690
unhelpful ways of responding to this.

577
00:32:55,010 --> 00:33:00,010
The first which one finds among many
modern day commentator as many kind of neo

578
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:02,810
Eris to [inaudible] we might call them.

579
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,770
It's just simply avert
our eyes from the harsh,

580
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:07,280
uh,

581
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,280
unappealing aspects of Aristotle's thought
and proceed as if he never actually

582
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,630
said or meant such things.

583
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,390
We need to avoid the
temptation in many ways,

584
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:25,391
understandable is it might be to airbrush
or sanitized Aristotle to make him

585
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,650
seem more politically
correct for modern readers.

586
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,740
And yet we should also avoid the
second equally powerful temptation,

587
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:41,770
which is to reject Aristotle out of
hand because his views do not correspond

588
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:43,880
with our own

589
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,770
question is what did
Aristotle mean by slavery?

590
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,930
What did he think was who or what
did he think was the slave by nature?

591
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,580
Until we understand what he meant,

592
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:01,190
we have no reason to either
accept or reject his argument.

593
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:09,060
The first point worth noting about this
is it Aristotle did not simply assume

594
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,090
slavery was natural
because it was practiced

595
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,890
virtually everywhere in the ancient world.

596
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,570
You will notice,

597
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,200
did he frames his analysis
in the form of the debate?

598
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,210
Yeah,

599
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:26,580
he says the outset of his argument.

600
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:26,850
There are,

601
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:31,020
there are some he says indicating this
is an opinion held by many people.

602
00:34:31,021 --> 00:34:35,640
There are some who believe that slavery
is natural because ruling and being

603
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:40,170
ruled is it pervasive distinction
that one sees all societies,

604
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:40,950
uh,

605
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:41,783
practice.

606
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,600
But he says others,

607
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:48,330
others believed that the distinction
between net master and slave is not

608
00:34:48,331 --> 00:34:49,164
natural,

609
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,990
but it's based on force or coercion.

610
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:57,750
Even in Aristotle's time it appears
slavery was a controversial,

611
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:58,680
uh,

612
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,680
institution and elicited very different
kinds of opinions and responses.

613
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,040
And here is one of those
moments when Aristotle,

614
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:09,390
as I indicated earlier,

615
00:35:09,391 --> 00:35:12,930
seems most maddeningly openminded.

616
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:18,120
He's willing to entertain
arguments both for both,

617
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,490
both for and against the debate.

618
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:26,660
Aristotle agrees with those who deny
that slavery is justified by war or

619
00:35:26,881 --> 00:35:28,290
conquest wars.

620
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:33,291
He remarks are not always just so
those who are captured in war cannot be

621
00:35:34,441 --> 00:35:38,670
assumed to be justly
or naturally enslaved.

622
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,040
Similarly,

623
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:47,120
he denies that slavery is always
or only appropriate for non Greeks.

624
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,340
There are no,

625
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:55,370
he is saying racial or
ethnic characteristics that
distinguish the natural slave

626
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,610
from the natural master and
in a stunning admission,

627
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,081
he says,

628
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:02,040
listen to this,

629
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,650
that while nature may intend to
distinguish the free man from the slave,

630
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,280
he says the opposite often results.

631
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,780
Nature often misses the mark.

632
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,033
He says,

633
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:22,100
now we seem to be completely confused
if slavery is natural and if nature

634
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:29,040
intends to distinguish the slave from
the unfree for the free from the unfree,

635
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,230
how can nature missed the mark?

636
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,920
How can the opposite often result?

637
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:41,180
I mentioned this because
such complications should
alert the careful reader,

638
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,253
right?

639
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,560
We're trying to read carefully what does
Aristotle doing and making this same so

640
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:49,764
complicated.

641
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,930
At the same time,

642
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,180
Aristotle agrees with those who
defend the thesis of natural slavery

643
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,560
and his defense seems to
run something like this.

644
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,970
Slavery is natural because we cannot rule
ourselves without the restraint of the

645
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:13,284
passions.

646
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,040
Self rule means self restraint.

647
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:22,970
Restraint or self control is necessary
for freedom or self government.

648
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,950
And what is true,

649
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,160
he seems to suggest a about the restraint
over one's passions and desires is

650
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:36,090
true of restraint and control over others.

651
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:40,950
Just as he appears to be saying there
is a kind of hierarchy within the soul

652
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,320
restraint of the passion.

653
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:48,321
So does that psychological hierarchy
translate itself into a kind of social

654
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:50,304
hierarchy,

655
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,693
uh,

656
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,940
between different kinds of people?

657
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,480
The natural hierarchy then seems to be
a sort of hierarchy of intelligence of,

658
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,020
or at least a hierarchy of the rational.

659
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,210
But how did this come to be?

660
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,920
Aristotle asks,

661
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:12,921
how is it that some people came to
acquire this capacity for rational self

662
00:38:13,831 --> 00:38:18,420
control that is necessary for
freedom and others seem to lack it?

663
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,650
How did that come to be?

664
00:38:19,651 --> 00:38:22,920
Is this hierarchy again a genetic quality?

665
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:24,420
Is it something we're born with?

666
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:29,220
Is it something that is implanted
in us by nature in that sense?

667
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,880
Or is that distinction something that
is created by nurture and education?

668
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,010
What we would call today
may be socialization.

669
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,500
And if the ladder,

670
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,970
if this hierarchy of intelligence
or this hierarchy of the rational,

671
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,703
uh,

672
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,860
is a result of upbringing,

673
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,800
then how can slavery be defended?

674
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:53,634
Is Natural.

675
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,550
There's an Aristotle calm man,

676
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,990
the rational animal,

677
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,260
the being with logo,

678
00:38:59,261 --> 00:39:04,261
suggesting that all human beings have a
desire for knowledge and the desire to

679
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:09,420
cultivate their minds
and live as free persons.

680
00:39:09,421 --> 00:39:11,820
Isn't there a kind of egalitarianism,

681
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,841
so to speak,

682
00:39:12,841 --> 00:39:17,841
built in to the conception of
rational animal and political animal?

683
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,500
Uh,

684
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,360
he begins his metaphysics,

685
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:22,021
his great book,

686
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:24,330
the metaphysics with the
famous opening statement.

687
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,360
All men have a desire to know
if we all have a desire to know,

688
00:39:30,031 --> 00:39:34,680
doesn't this connote something
universal that all should be free,

689
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:40,910
that all should participate in ruling
in being ruled as citizens of a city.

690
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,300
Yet at the same time,

691
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:50,520
Aristotle seems to regard education
is the preserve of the field

692
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:57,120
to kind of discipline and self restraint
necessary for an educated mind,

693
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,233
uh,

694
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:04,390
appears for him to be unequally
divided among human beings.

695
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,401
It follows,

696
00:40:06,401 --> 00:40:10,270
I think that the regime
according to nature,

697
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:15,540
it is to say the best regime would be
what we might think of as an aristocracy

698
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:16,240
of,

699
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,240
of the educated an aristocracy of
education and training in Aristocratic

700
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,830
Republic of some sort that governs.

701
00:40:26,831 --> 00:40:31,831
We're an educated elite governance for
the good of all Aristotle's republic.

702
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:34,980
Uh,

703
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,160
and I use that term to
remind you of Plato as well,

704
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:45,150
but Aristotle's republic is devoted
to cultivating a high level of citizen

705
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:51,331
virtue where this means those qualities
of mind and heart necessary for self

706
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:53,800
government.

707
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,570
These qualities he believes are the
preserve of the few of a minority,

708
00:40:58,571 --> 00:41:03,571
of a minority capable of sharing in the
administration of justice and in the

709
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:05,620
offices of a city.

710
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:14,120
It seems to be a very elite teaching.

711
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,773
Would you agree

712
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,540
and an appealing to us
perhaps for that reason?

713
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:26,650
Very contrary to our intuitions and
the way we have been brought up.

714
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,713
Yes.

715
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:31,280
Yeah.

716
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,113
You agree with me,

717
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:33,643
but

718
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,640
before we dismiss Aristotle's account
is insufferably in a Galitary Ian in

719
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,473
elitist,

720
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,450
we have to ask a difficult question,

721
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,790
not just of Aristotle,

722
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,430
but more importantly of ourselves.

723
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,810
What else is Yale

724
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,940
but in elite institution

725
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:06,360
intended to educate
morally and intellectually

726
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,100
potential members of a leadership class?

727
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,610
Think about that.

728
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,720
Can anyone get into Gail?

729
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,510
Do we have an open admissions policy
for all who want to come here?

730
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,373
Hardly.

731
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:32,310
Does it not require those
qualities of self control,

732
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,900
discipline and restraint
necessary to achieve success here?

733
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,230
I will leave aside for the moment.

734
00:42:43,231 --> 00:42:45,540
What happens on Friday
and Saturday nights?

735
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,780
Is it any coincidence that graduates
from this university in a handful of

736
00:42:54,811 --> 00:42:55,644
others,

737
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,550
not unlike it,

738
00:42:56,551 --> 00:43:00,450
find themselves in high
positions of government,

739
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:01,763
of business,

740
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,233
of law,

741
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,860
and the academy.

742
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:12,620
Is it unfair or unreasonable to describe
this class is Aristotle might as a

743
00:43:15,031 --> 00:43:16,560
natural aristocracy.

744
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:21,750
So I leave you with this
question to think about

745
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:28,250
before we reject Aristotle is
an anti democratic elitist.

746
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,730
Take a look at yourselves.

747
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,710
So are you,

748
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,920
or you wouldn't be sitting here today.

749
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,780
Think about that and
I'll see you next week.
