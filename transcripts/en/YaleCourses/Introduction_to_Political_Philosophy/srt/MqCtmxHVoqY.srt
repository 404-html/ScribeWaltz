1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,920
But today we wanted to
begin with Mr Lock part too.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,800
And I said at the end of class last time,

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:12,801
I want to speak a little bit about Locke
and let's just call up the spirit of

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,214
capitalism.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,270
And then I want to move into the
issue of government by consent.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,320
Uh,

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,280
along with the idea of natural law,

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,000
uh,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,500
perhaps one of locks,

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,683
uh,

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,470
clearly central,

12
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:35,340
perhaps most most significant
contribution to political philosophy,

13
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:40,341
the doctrine of consent and
various problems that I want to,

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,780
to examine with you today,

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:42,950
uh,

16
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,070
associated with,

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,170
with consent and what it means to see,

18
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,730
to consent to government,

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,910
but the first five chapters of this
tech and treat us if you take them as a

20
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:54,680
unit.

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:54,820
And,

22
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,310
and I think they should be,

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,331
uh,

24
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:58,830
they tell us a story.

25
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,540
Block presents us,

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:00,900
uh,

27
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,900
so to speak with a kind of philosophical
anthropology that takes us through the

28
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:08,100
state of nature,

29
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,020
the state of war,

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,290
the creation of private property.

31
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,000
And in the fifth chapter,

32
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:17,460
particularly lock begins,

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,800
as I mentioned last time with uh,

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,221
the,

35
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:22,890
you might say the original
condition of nature,

36
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,250
which forms a kind of primitive communism
to the creation of property through

37
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:31,650
the work,

38
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,200
uh,

39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,240
of ones,

40
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,103
uh,

41
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,350
the labor of one's body and
the work of one's hands.

42
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,290
And by the end of the fifth chapter,

43
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:45,291
we have the creation of really a kind
of full scale sophisticated market

44
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:47,790
economy,

45
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,540
uh,

46
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,240
replete with various,

47
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:51,930
uh,

48
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,010
inequalities,

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,120
perhaps even some larger scale inequality,

50
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,110
qualities of wealth and property
all within the state of nature.

51
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,000
How did this occur and
most importantly for lock,

52
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,010
what makes this legitimate?

53
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:08,791
Uh,

54
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:09,061
what,

55
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,860
what legitimizes this,

56
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,030
uh,

57
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,690
this,

58
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,610
this transition,

59
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:15,421
so to speak,

60
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:17,670
from the original state of nature,

61
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,671
governed by nothing more than a law of
nature to the emergence of property.

62
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,170
And in a way a kind of
market economy in many ways,

63
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:33,171
what Locke is doing in the first five
chapters of this second treatise is re

64
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,550
telling or maybe better rewriting a,

65
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:41,130
the account of human beginnings,

66
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:41,510
uh,

67
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,250
that had originally belonged to scripture.

68
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,650
He tells the story,

69
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,400
doesn't he?

70
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Right of how human beings
finding themselves in a
condition of nature with no

71
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:58,491
one or no authority to adjudicate their
disputes and governed only by a natural

72
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:00,490
law.

73
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,470
How they are nevertheless able to
create and enjoy the use of property,

74
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,430
uh,

75
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,970
created and acquired through
their labor and work.

76
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:10,511
Man,

77
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:15,511
he tells us in these opening chapters
is a property acquiring animal,

78
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,680
the inquisitive animal.

79
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,191
Uh,

80
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:21,010
even in a state of nature
where there is again,

81
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:26,011
nothing but the natural law to govern
a human associations and relations with

82
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,294
one another.

83
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,970
But the problem with the state of nature,

84
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,280
a four lock and as to some degree it
is four was four hubs as well is it's

85
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,210
instability,

86
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,140
uh,

87
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,190
with no civil authority
to umpire disputes,

88
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,070
especially disputes over property,

89
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,890
the peaceful enjoyment and
the further acquisition of

90
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,171
property.

91
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:58,171
The fruits of one's labor are continually
threatened by war and by conflict.

92
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:04,621
How can we ever be secure in our person
or property with no enforcement agency

93
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,520
to resolve breaches of the peace,

94
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,421
uh,

95
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,550
where everybody is so to speak.

96
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:12,911
Again,

97
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:16,690
the judge and jury and
executioner of the natural law,

98
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:21,691
the need for government arises out of
the real need to resolve conflicts or

99
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:25,420
disputes over property rights.

100
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,410
Uh,

101
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,670
in many respects.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,630
Uh,

103
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,090
right.

104
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,090
This sounds like a very familiar idea
that government exists for the sake of the

105
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:39,990
protection of property rights.

106
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:44,310
It's sort of a kind of cardinal doctrine
of what I suppose we would call today

107
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:45,450
libertarianism.

108
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,470
Uh,

109
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,070
the philosophy of,

110
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:49,260
of libertarianism.

111
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,520
Uh,

112
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,740
so important in,

113
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:53,310
in a lot of American thought.

114
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,620
Locke is in many ways
the first writer of my,

115
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,400
uh,

116
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,490
familiarity who claims that Ms,

117
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,570
these are his words,

118
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:08,571
the great in chief end of men's uniting
into Commonweal's is the protection of

119
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:10,980
their property.

120
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,410
No one prior to lock a,

121
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,880
at least to my knowledge,

122
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,910
I think it ever said in quite such a
bold and straight forward way that the

123
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:29,301
purpose of politics was the protection
of property rights and buy property.

124
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:30,990
Uh,

125
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,680
lock doesn't mean simply,

126
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,250
uh,

127
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:34,860
uh,

128
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,100
uh,

129
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,580
objects around us that we
have turned into property.

130
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:39,570
But property is,

131
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,621
is rooted.

132
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:43,110
Each tells us first and
foremost in our persons,

133
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:44,160
in our bodies.

134
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,610
We all begin the life with a certain
rudimentary property if only in ourselves.

135
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,050
Property for him implies
more than simply real estate.

136
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,190
Uh,

137
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,120
but everything that encompasses our lives,

138
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,130
liberties and possessions.

139
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:02,660
These are our property,

140
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,410
uh,

141
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,610
in the original,

142
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,120
uh,

143
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,420
and in many ways most revealing
sense of the term property.

144
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:11,330
That is to say things proper to us.

145
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,483
Is this okay?

146
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,893
You with us?

147
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,633
Okay.

148
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,603
Uh,

149
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,050
but lock continually emphasizes to us
the uncertainty of the state of nature

150
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,280
because life there he says it's full of
fears and continual dangerous that lead

151
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:40,530
us to civil association.

152
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,430
But think in a way how different locks
account of the transition from the state

153
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:51,840
of nature to the civil state
is from Hobbs is in many ways.

154
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:52,141
Again,

155
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:52,770
as I said,

156
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,420
lock tries to modify,

157
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:55,380
domesticate,

158
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,530
ameliorate hubs is harsh.

159
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:03,531
Teachings hubs had emphasize the absolute
fearfulness of the state of nature.

160
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,220
The state of nature was for hubs,

161
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:10,890
a kind of state of existential dread,

162
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,550
absolute fearfulness for for lock.

163
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,593
However,

164
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:22,010
it is a condition continually
be set by unease and anxiety.

165
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,500
To use the word he often
uses inconveniences.

166
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,460
Uh,

167
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,320
the state of nature is one that
consists of continual inconveniences.

168
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:34,950
Uh,

169
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,190
it is our unease are restlessness,

170
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:38,940
uh,

171
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,700
that is not only a spur to our labor,

172
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,320
but is rather the cause of
our insecurities that we have,

173
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,000
uh,

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,090
in the state of nature.

175
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:49,410
What is it about lock?

176
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,270
What is it about his account?

177
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:54,660
And I don't mean what is it about him
in some psychological or personal or

178
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:55,860
biographical sense,

179
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,340
but what is it in his writing that
leads him to emphasize the restlessness,

180
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,710
uneasiness,

181
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:10,010
and you might say perpetually anxious
character of human beings in the state,

182
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,020
in the state of nature.

183
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,473
Yeah.

184
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,120
Do we ever hear Plato or Aristotle,

185
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,380
uh,

186
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,380
discussing the fearful or
anxious or restless character of,

187
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,730
of,

188
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:29,971
of,

189
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:30,241
of,

190
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:31,740
of human psychology?

191
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,120
I think not,

192
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,853
uh,

193
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,220
was this simply a function of locks?

194
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Nervous disposition was the fact that
he was simply prone to reticence and a

195
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:50,070
kind of fearfulness in the same
way that Hobbes himself said,

196
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:55,071
or there's locks emphasis on the
uneasiness of our condition in the natural

197
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:59,880
condition really represent
the qualities of a new class.

198
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,590
Uh,

199
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,810
the new commercial classes,

200
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:04,740
uh,

201
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,580
as it were seeking to
establish their legitimacy.

202
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,100
Locke's second treatise
in many respects is,

203
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,100
uh,

204
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,100
a work of middleclass or as
the Marxists would like to say,

205
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:21,590
perhaps the bourgeois,

206
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,290
uh,

207
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,280
ascendancy when lock writes that he has,

208
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:30,240
he does that the world is intended
for the use of the industrious and the

209
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:31,074
rational.

210
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,860
Yes.

211
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,330
Who was he talking about there?

212
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,430
Who are the industrious,

213
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:35,891
uh,

214
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:36,780
and the rational?

215
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:41,781
He is speaking about a new middle class
ethos whose title to rule rests not on

216
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,190
heredity or on tradition.

217
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:51,390
He is not referring to a
customary ruling class,

218
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,890
a class whose title to rule comes
from its claims to nobility,

219
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,203
but it's,

220
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,240
but he's referring to people whose
title to rule or potential title to rule

221
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,160
rests on their capacities for hard work,

222
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,220
thrift and opportunity.

223
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:09,680
Uh,

224
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,620
as a former student of mine
who took this class once said,

225
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,753
Locke's

226
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,640
second treatise could well be
called the capitalist manifesto

227
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,840
or the Anticosti.

228
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,280
The anticommunist manifesto
may be one put it,

229
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,360
but as Locky aneurysm,

230
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,710
simply Machiavelli with the human face,

231
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,023
put it that way,

232
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,830
uh,

233
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,080
isn't the rule of the prince.

234
00:10:42,081 --> 00:10:43,100
And Machiavelli,

235
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,443
uh,

236
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,010
the rule of a new leader,

237
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,873
a new,

238
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,840
uh,

239
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,050
sovereign authority,

240
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,510
new authority of some sell,

241
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,570
some sense who operates outside the
parameters of traditional authority isn't

242
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,330
Locky and ism like
Machiavelli in some way.

243
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:06,901
Uh,

244
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:09,900
the ethic of the self made man,

245
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,861
uh,

246
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:13,980
with all of the
insecurities and anxieties,

247
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,230
uh,

248
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,720
restlessness that being self made,

249
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,770
uh,

250
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,760
represents,

251
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,510
uh,

252
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:26,170
does Lockey aneurysm represent in some
ways that the tranquilliser [inaudible]

253
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,380
of Machiavelli turning
Machiavelli's fierce warlike ethic,

254
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,980
uh,

255
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,980
the ethic of conquest and domination
to in fact the ethic of work.

256
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:38,931
And,

257
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:42,960
and is it where the
conquest and domination of,

258
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:43,201
of,

259
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:44,250
of work through,

260
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:45,840
through labor and,

261
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,710
and our heart and our
hard work is this again,

262
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:52,500
simply machiavellianism
with the human face,

263
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:53,200
but in any way,

264
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,860
I think,

265
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,740
or what I want to suggest
is that lock locks,

266
00:11:56,741 --> 00:12:01,741
political philosophy gives expression
to what the great German sociologist Max

267
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:03,550
Faber.

268
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:03,761
You,

269
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:04,331
you know him?

270
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:04,750
Yes.

271
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,260
Faber,

272
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,360
you read him in intro sociology?

273
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,230
No.

274
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,650
Okay.

275
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,340
Well,

276
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,431
uh,

277
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:10,264
you will,

278
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:10,630
uh,

279
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,320
vapor,

280
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,471
uh,

281
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:16,471
his famous book called the Protestant
ethic and the spirit of capitalism in 1904

282
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,261
1904.

283
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:21,011
Great work.

284
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:21,791
Classic work.

285
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,660
And in that work,

286
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,990
a vapor argued that the
capitalist ethic made a high duty,

287
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,700
a moral duty,

288
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,890
turned it into a moral calling,

289
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,020
a religious calling,

290
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:38,050
the duty of limitless
accumulation of capital.

291
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,340
Uh,

292
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,980
and this was in four in Weber's term,

293
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:46,981
the outgrowth of the Puritan and
Calvinist movements of the 16th and 17th

294
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:49,000
Century for vapor.

295
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:54,001
It was the Protestant reformation that
had taken root in the countries of

296
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:55,390
northern Europe.

297
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:59,800
And particularly with the roots
of this capitalistic ethos.

298
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:04,801
First developed and again adapted a wholly
new moral attitude to such things is

299
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:07,210
property,

300
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,860
property acquisition,

301
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:09,850
and moneymaking.

302
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,141
Previously,

303
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:14,830
these things had been deemed
to be morally dubious,

304
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:19,480
shunted aside something
shameful about this.

305
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,900
You can certainly see this
and the classical writings,

306
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,640
political philosophy that we did

307
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,180
for these early moderns.

308
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,380
Uh,

309
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:34,380
capital accumulation became a kind
of high calling and moral duty.

310
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:39,340
God gave the world to the
rational and the industrious,

311
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,240
not he says to the
quarrelsome and contentious,

312
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,690
not that is to those prideful aristocrats
who seek to struggle for domination

313
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,653
and power,

314
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:53,110
uh,

315
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,670
over over one another.

316
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,980
What lock brings into being is again,

317
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:04,981
a wholly new and revolutionary moral
attitude towards property and property

318
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:07,991
acquisition.

319
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:08,471
And again,

320
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:10,060
finds its expression,

321
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:15,090
great expression a century later with
Adam Smith and of course from Adam Smith,

322
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:20,500
we have the whole world
of modern economics.

323
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,090
So how many of you are potential
economics majors in here?

324
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,620
I bet more than one without John Locke,

325
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,270
there would be no modern
discipline called economics book.

326
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:35,800
Cause he was the one,

327
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:36,371
again,

328
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:41,371
a century before Smith and the rise of
the school of political economy who made

329
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:44,110
the first and decisive move,

330
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,520
which was to,

331
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,210
uh,

332
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:51,210
in many ways make respectable and even
more than respectable make turn into a

333
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:54,920
high moral calling and dignity,

334
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:55,940
uh,

335
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,331
the,

336
00:14:56,331 --> 00:15:01,331
the to the acquisition of property and
turned government turning politics into a

337
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:07,070
tool for the protection of
property and property rights.

338
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:12,080
That that is the significance in
many ways of what Locke has done.

339
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,420
And I want to talk,

340
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,610
probably not today,

341
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:17,090
but,

342
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,990
uh,

343
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,540
next Monday on some of the,

344
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,374
uh,

345
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,101
in many ways,

346
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:23,830
pros and cons of,

347
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:28,890
of this immense moral transformation
regarding property in economics that Locke

348
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:30,261
had helped,

349
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:31,610
has helped to bring into being.

350
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,190
But for the rest of today,

351
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:37,620
what I want to focus on is locks,

352
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:39,060
idea of consent.

353
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,680
The idea that the origin
of all government,

354
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,120
or at least all legitimate,

355
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,660
all legitimate government is
said to derive from consent.

356
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,010
The consent of the governed,

357
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,720
an idea that was implicit in some
respects in Hobbs is theory of this,

358
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,560
of the social,

359
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,290
of the covenant that
creates the sovereign,

360
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,300
but for a wit,

361
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,850
but to which lock gives in many ways,

362
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:04,980
much greater pride of place.

363
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,020
In chapter eight,

364
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,620
a of the second treatise
lock gives us there.

365
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:14,070
He provides us with a kind of
hypothetical reconstruction,

366
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:14,910
uh,

367
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,590
of the origin of society.

368
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:18,630
So Paul's Society,

369
00:16:18,631 --> 00:16:19,620
she writes it night,

370
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,910
section 95.

371
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:25,911
The only way whereby anyone divest
himself of his natural liberty and puts on

372
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:31,311
the bonds of civil society is by agreeing
with all others to join and unite in a

373
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:34,740
community for their comfortable,

374
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,520
safe,

375
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,900
and peaceful living.

376
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:37,590
Uh,

377
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,170
lock tells us there's something about the,

378
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,860
that the legitimate
ends of society for the,

379
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:44,100
the,

380
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,990
the ends that civil society,

381
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:46,380
uh,

382
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,910
serves comfortable,

383
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,460
safe and peaceful living.

384
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,670
And he goes on to affirm that whenever
a sufficient number of people,

385
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:56,490
uh,

386
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,670
have consented to make a single community,

387
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,170
and I quote him again,

388
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,110
they are thereby presently incorporated.

389
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:06,360
And to make one body politic,

390
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,320
they make one body politic
were in the majority,

391
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:15,620
have a right to act and conclude
for the rest were in the majority.

392
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Have a right to act and conclude for
the rest of that short statement.

393
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,110
Section 95 of Chapter Eight,

394
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:25,980
uh,

395
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,980
seems to make maybe the first and
most powerful case for democracy.

396
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,540
Okay.

397
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:34,930
Uh,

398
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,850
on the basis of that statement,

399
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,720
a famous Yale professor of at
least a couple of generations ago,

400
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,100
wrote an extremely important book that
made John into a majority rule democrat.

401
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,520
He said in that book that locks philosophy
provides the faith of the majority

402
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:03,570
rule Democrat largely
focusing on sections 95,

403
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:08,000
96 as sort of the key two locks,

404
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,000
political teaching,

405
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:09,630
uh,

406
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,620
in the second treatise.

407
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:12,420
Does anybody know the name of that?

408
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,910
A man who wrote that book by any chance?

409
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,130
Famous Yale political
scientist event back,

410
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,410
back awhile ago.

411
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,010
Nobody.

412
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,060
Not Nobody remembers.

413
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:22,620
Wellmark Kendall's book on luck.

414
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,090
Okay.

415
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:24,350
You know,

416
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,183
you know it.

417
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,001
Yes.

418
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:26,960
You were shaking your head

419
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:29,640
no you don't.

420
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,240
Okay.

421
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,073
Whatever.

422
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,040
It's not important.

423
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,280
Not,

424
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,881
not important.

425
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:35,280
I just mentioned it in passing,

426
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,410
but consider the,

427
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,620
consider the following
sentence again also,

428
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,650
that seems to add a to this claim for
when any number of men by the consent of

429
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:50,460
every individual make a
community they have their,

430
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:55,461
by made that community one body
with a power to act as one body,

431
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,240
which is only by the will and
determination of the majority.

432
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:02,620
Uh,

433
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,110
what are we to make of this assertion?

434
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,260
And in many ways continued assertion
that lock is that in any community we are

435
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,700
ruled by the majority,

436
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,703
uh,

437
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,960
to be sure that idea,

438
00:19:16,961 --> 00:19:19,390
what if come as an immense surprise,

439
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:25,110
no doubt to the King of England to
learn that his rule was justified by the

440
00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:33,031
consent of the governed or if you had
done something like cross the English

441
00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:34,840
Channel and,

442
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,480
and go to,

443
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,040
to the France of Louis
the 14th of this period,

444
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,210
uh,

445
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,210
Louis the 14th who famously said lay
toss saying why I am the state no doubt

446
00:19:45,611 --> 00:19:49,630
would have been very surprised
and probably found laughable.

447
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:55,110
The idea that his legitimacy came from
the consent of his subjects who had ever

448
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,860
thought such a thing that
government derives from the
consent of the majority is

449
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:05,680
lock in saying that,

450
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:06,610
uh,

451
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:11,610
denying the legitimacy of all government
or governments that do not derive from

452
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:15,880
the consent of the majority.

453
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,510
Uh,

454
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:21,510
is he on the basis of this truly
a kind of majority rule democrat?

455
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,950
Does he undercut,

456
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,970
for example,

457
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:29,971
something like Aristotle's argument
who had seen any number of forms of

458
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:33,310
government is equally a legitimate,

459
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:33,580
uh,

460
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,540
in many ways so long as they
are moderate and ruled by law,

461
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,030
uh,

462
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:43,030
or is lock saying again that there is
only one form of government one again,

463
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:45,670
legitimate or just form of government,

464
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,860
government by the majority.

465
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,220
That's what he appears here to be saying.

466
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,800
And I mentioned this sense appears,

467
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:56,970
uh,

468
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,860
lock is a slippery fish.

469
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,833
Uh,

470
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,150
he's a slippery writer.

471
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:09,410
He has a tendency of take back with
one hand what he gives with the other

472
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,333
[inaudible].

473
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,423
Yeah.

474
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,403
Uh,

475
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,190
the agreement

476
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:24,690
to join to make one community is he
calls it however is not the same thing.

477
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,830
Exactly.

478
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,910
Uh,

479
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:32,910
it's establishing a form of government
in many ways choosing to have a

480
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:34,030
government,

481
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,530
which is what lock has caught,

482
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,420
is talking about here in these
relevant sections in 95 and 96.

483
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:44,470
And so I'm choosing to have a
government to be one people,

484
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,370
uh,

485
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,300
so to speak,

486
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,000
uh,

487
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
is in many ways an act prior to electing
any particular form of government to

488
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:54,461
rule you.

489
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:56,650
The second treatise in some way,

490
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,750
a specifies only that governments derive
their just power from the consent of

491
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:02,584
the governed.

492
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,590
It does not seem to say very explicitly
about what form of government people

493
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,000
might wish to consent to.

494
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,000
In many ways.

495
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:18,060
The second treatise one wants to say
is even rather neutral two forms of

496
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:19,150
government.

497
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:23,980
The only form of government that seems
to be absolutely ruled out unlocks

498
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,800
account is some kind of absolute monarchy.

499
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,810
We cannot see our rights
entirely to another individual,

500
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:36,490
but he seems to be relatively
open to whatever it is.

501
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:39,070
People may wish to consent to.

502
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,030
The act of consent alone
does not create a government.

503
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:43,450
Uh,

504
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,090
it is merely an act of forming society.

505
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:46,661
Uh,

506
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:47,261
in many ways.

507
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:49,540
He accepts Pope's famous dictum,

508
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,640
Alexander Pope's famous dictum,

509
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:51,941
you know,

510
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:53,470
for farms of government.

511
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:58,270
Let Fools contest what air
is best administered is best.

512
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,260
In other words,

513
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:03,640
you'll have the best thing
that administers government
that protects your rights

514
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:05,830
to property and what form it is,

515
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:07,780
whether it's monarchic,

516
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,340
aristocratic,

517
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,030
uh,

518
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:14,560
Republican or whatever is not
as much is not so important.

519
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,930
What is important and for Loc about,

520
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:21,610
the only thing that is important is that
that form of government received the

521
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:23,170
consent of the governed.

522
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:24,191
And of course,

523
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:27,550
people don't necessarily
have to consent to democracy.

524
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,481
Uh,

525
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:28,780
if,

526
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,400
if lock is democratic in that way is,

527
00:23:31,401 --> 00:23:32,710
it is only because,

528
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:33,070
uh,

529
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,180
he's democratic.

530
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,610
Uh,

531
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,660
in a sense that government
derives the authority from,

532
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,523
from consent.

533
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,100
It does not necessarily
have to be democratical,

534
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,580
uh,

535
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,450
inform,

536
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,080
uh,

537
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,920
in that respect.

538
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,670
But it is this idea of consent and you
will no doubt talk about this and your

539
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:50,480
sections.

540
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,130
It is this idea of government as
being by consent that has so much,

541
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,390
uh,

542
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,490
insinuated itself.

543
00:23:58,491 --> 00:23:59,960
I'm not sure that's the right word,

544
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:00,920
but as so much,

545
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,820
uh,

546
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,180
formed in many ways the
cornerstone of American,

547
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,280
uh,

548
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:06,530
uh,

549
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:10,040
the American regime and American
political thought in many ways,

550
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,000
even more,

551
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:16,030
I would suggest than his doctrine of
property and property rights locks,

552
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:19,850
doctrine of consent,

553
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:20,570
uh,

554
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,403
is what,

555
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:22,963
uh,

556
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:27,380
captured the imagination
of the American founders.

557
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,360
Uh,

558
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,000
when Jefferson wrote about
the ends of government,

559
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:32,690
he said,

560
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,330
the ends of government
are to protect life,

561
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:35,811
liberty,

562
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:37,370
and the pursuit of happiness.

563
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:43,180
He seems in some ways he seems to
modified locks statement about life,

564
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:44,091
liberty,

565
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:44,840
and to state.

566
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,980
Why did he do that?

567
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,641
Uh,

568
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:47,840
we could talk about that.

569
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:48,411
And of course,

570
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:53,411
what is meant by the pursuit of happiness
certainly is intended to entail a,

571
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:55,430
among other things,

572
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,360
a Pr,

573
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,310
the acquisition of property.

574
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:03,380
But Jefferson in some ways
sort of elevates lock locks.

575
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:07,250
Language Locky and language does
not simply focused on property,

576
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:09,230
but the pursuit of happiness,

577
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:09,770
uh,

578
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,521
in many ways,

579
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:11,001
however,

580
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:12,740
construed consistent,

581
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,251
uh,

582
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:13,760
with,

583
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,050
with the rights of others.

584
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,700
But it is locks,

585
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:18,590
language of consent,

586
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,161
uh,

587
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:22,970
that the just powers of
government derived from consent,

588
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:23,900
uh,

589
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,150
that seems to have most,

590
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,230
um,

591
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,100
inspired,

592
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,760
uh,

593
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,560
Jefferson and the founders.

594
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:32,150
And through that doctrine,

595
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:37,390
it of course had a huge effect on
America's greatest second founder.

596
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:38,450
Uh,

597
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,410
Abraham Lincoln.

598
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,660
Consider the following
passage from Lincoln.

599
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:50,020
This is Lincoln in 1854
in his first major,

600
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,050
uh,

601
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,680
speech,

602
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,270
first most important speech,

603
00:25:53,271 --> 00:25:58,271
sometimes called the Peoria speech
where he was already debating a Stephen

604
00:25:59,180 --> 00:25:59,181
Douglas,

605
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:00,370
Steven A.

606
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:00,520
Douglas.

607
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:00,690
Uh,

608
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,570
it was for the Senate campaign,

609
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:03,680
uh,

610
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:03,951
in,

611
00:26:03,951 --> 00:26:04,400
uh,

612
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,400
in Illinois appropriate in our
time of the year where they were,

613
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,490
they were then arguing
as they would again,

614
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,180
uh,

615
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,040
if for the presidential campaign argue
over slavery and cure is what Lincoln

616
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:24,041
rights when the White Man governance
himself that is self-government.

617
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:30,910
But when he governs himself and also
governs another man that is more than self

618
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:32,571
government,

619
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:33,980
that is despotism.

620
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,510
Lincoln says,

621
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,550
my ancient faith,

622
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,470
my ancient faith,

623
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:42,830
no dead thinking about
declaration and Jefferson's ideas,

624
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,380
my ancient faith teaches me that there
can be no moral right with one man making

625
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:50,370
a slave of another.

626
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:56,180
What I do say Lincoln continues here
is that no man is good enough to govern

627
00:26:57,361 --> 00:27:00,420
another without that others consent.

628
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,560
This he concludes is
the leading principal,

629
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,710
the sheet anchor of
American republicanism.

630
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:13,830
So there is Abraham Lincoln referring
to the doctrine of consent by which he

631
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:18,330
says that no man is good enough to govern
another without that others consent.

632
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Calling this the leading principal
or the sheet anchor of American

633
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,960
republicanism.

634
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,030
That statement

635
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,860
as I suggested a moment ago as part of
his debate with Douglas over the issue of

636
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:36,024
slavery,

637
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:41,540
and in many ways cut to the
car of the meaning of consent.

638
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,140
Douglass also in some respects,

639
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,960
tried to derive his view,

640
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,840
his views from an idea of consent.

641
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,790
What Douglas said was,

642
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,840
uh,

643
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,310
that regarding slavery,

644
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,080
he said he didn't care.

645
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,570
It was a matter of indifference to him
whether people of a particular state or a

646
00:28:03,571 --> 00:28:06,600
territory wanted slavery
or didn't want it.

647
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,500
Uh,

648
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,500
whatever they wanted that is to say
whatever the majority consented to was all

649
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:13,590
right with him.

650
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,430
Uh,

651
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,770
he might prefer it not to be,

652
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,611
but again,

653
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:21,270
it was what people consented
to what the majority wanted.

654
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,320
Uh,

655
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,153
that was,

656
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:23,610
uh,

657
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,300
the,

658
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,540
the,

659
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,400
that w that would decide the matter.

660
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,360
Uh,

661
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,770
Lincoln however,

662
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,980
had said that the doctrine of consent
is not simply a kind of blank check or a

663
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:36,354
blank check,

664
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:36,870
uh,

665
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,720
that the doctrine of
consent still implied.

666
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:44,721
A set of moral limits or restraints on
what a people might consent to consent

667
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:48,540
was inconsistent with slavery.

668
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,261
He said,

669
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:49,831
because again,

670
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:54,810
no one can rule another without
that other person's consent.

671
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,950
And in many ways that crucial debates,

672
00:28:57,951 --> 00:29:02,951
so fundamental to American history in
politics grows out of a kind of internal

673
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:08,220
problem within locks,

674
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,750
doctrine of consent.

675
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:14,780
Namely that problem is what
form of government does it
make sense for a majority

676
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,350
of people to consent to?

677
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,400
Does government,

678
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:20,940
uh,

679
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,601
in other words,

680
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:25,770
by consent mean government by
whatever the majority wants,

681
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,130
a kind of could be a kind
of tyranny of the majority.

682
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,840
There's whatever they want
or does government by consent
in tail against certain

683
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:38,841
limits and restraints on what
majorities can do what guarantees,

684
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:39,810
uh,

685
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,160
does lock provide?

686
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:46,650
You might ask that government by consent
will be informed consent or rational

687
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:48,994
consent.

688
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,043
Uh,

689
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,040
can people simply consent to
anything to be ruled in by any means?

690
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:01,240
This is obviously not an
idol or a purely theoretical,

691
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:01,720
uh,

692
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,311
questions.

693
00:30:02,311 --> 00:30:03,730
Since popular majority's,

694
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:04,520
we know,

695
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:04,780
uh,

696
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,860
in the world today,

697
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,280
uh,

698
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,350
popular majority's can choose,

699
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:08,710
uh,

700
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,610
to be miss.

701
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:14,670
They can choose on the basis of whim
will or some other kind of arbitrary

702
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:16,241
passion,

703
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:21,020
unless there seems to be some set of
moral restraints on what individuals or

704
00:30:21,021 --> 00:30:23,140
majority's can consent to.

705
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:23,770
Uh,

706
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:28,770
what is to prevent a majority from
acting just as despotically or just as

707
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:32,530
arbitrarily is a king
or any absolute power.

708
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:33,100
That is,

709
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,240
was the question that
Lincoln was raising in his,

710
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:37,640
uh,

711
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,690
argument against Douglas
and his claims about,

712
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,950
about consent.

713
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:48,010
But this question of restraints or
limits on what people can consent to

714
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,660
raises a

715
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:53,640
yeah.

716
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,880
Or leads to another question
about the doctrine of consent.

717
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,330
How is consent conferred?

718
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,380
We are citizens of the oldest
democracy in the world,

719
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,660
most of us.

720
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,351
So I guess,

721
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:08,780
I don't know,

722
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,740
maybe not everybody,

723
00:31:09,741 --> 00:31:13,730
but most people in this room are citizens
of the oldest democracy in the world.

724
00:31:13,731 --> 00:31:16,310
Did anyone ask you for your consent?

725
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,673
Uh,

726
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,620
or may considerably older,

727
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:21,981
but,

728
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:22,760
uh,

729
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,420
you know,

730
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,260
I have never,

731
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,190
uh,

732
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,140
did anyone ask for my consent?

733
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:32,170
The idea of giving consent to a form
of government implies something active.

734
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,420
Uh,

735
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,910
an emphatic voice.

736
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,320
Uh,

737
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:36,741
but his,

738
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:41,741
anyone since the first
generation of founders who
ratified the constitution ever

739
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:46,430
been asked or required
to give their consent to,

740
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:47,450
it might ask,

741
00:31:47,451 --> 00:31:50,060
what is locks answer to this problem?

742
00:31:50,061 --> 00:31:50,990
It is,

743
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:53,590
and it is a problem
that he is aware of and,

744
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:56,900
and struggles with in
that important chapter.

745
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:05,890
His answer turns out to be something
quite different from our views about

746
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,550
citizenship

747
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,660
and who is a citizen.

748
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,700
And how was the consent of the
citizen conferred on government?

749
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,030
In section one 18,

750
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:19,511
he writes,

751
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:24,340
a child is born a subject
of no country or government.

752
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:25,240
Yeah.

753
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,020
In other words,

754
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:30,460
he's saying citizen is not
citizenship is not conferred by birth.

755
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,570
Uh,

756
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,290
this being born in a place does
not make you a citizen of it as,

757
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,213
as

758
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:36,460
okay

759
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,950
doctrine that we hold every person.

760
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,240
Uh,

761
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,220
lock continues,

762
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,020
uh,

763
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:48,980
is born free and equal in many ways
in this kind of state of nature,

764
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,010
under the authority only of their parents.

765
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,150
Uh,

766
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:58,150
what government that person may choose
to obey is not a matter of birth,

767
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,080
but of choice.

768
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,010
And again,

769
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:05,900
lock seems to be making some kind of
active principle of choice or decision,

770
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,030
uh,

771
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,010
a principal of citizenship
and the conferring of,

772
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,971
of consent.

773
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:11,900
And it is only,

774
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:16,901
he says that when a child reaches
what he calls the age of discretion,

775
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,910
18 or 21 or something like that,

776
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,300
that one is obligated to choose to some
sign or mark of agreement to accept the

777
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:29,450
authority to accept the
authority of government.

778
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:34,280
Lock is not altogether clear
about how such a sign or a mark,

779
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:34,910
uh,

780
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:38,510
is to be given one suspect
from what he is saying.

781
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:43,510
He may be referring to some kind of oath
or some kind of pledge or some kind of

782
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:48,731
civil ceremony where one vows
or pledges with one's word,

783
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,690
with one's word,

784
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,350
uh,

785
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,990
the acceptance of the form of the state.

786
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,780
Nothing can make any man.

787
00:33:55,781 --> 00:33:57,230
So lock rights,

788
00:33:57,231 --> 00:33:59,780
it is to say an actual citizen of a state.

789
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,170
Nothing can make any man so,

790
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,380
but his actually entering into it by
positive agreement and express promise and

791
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:09,974
compact.

792
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,650
He says at one 22,

793
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:13,670
uh,

794
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:18,670
by express promise and compact such
an express promise or agreement,

795
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,223
uh,

796
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,490
leaves one,

797
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:27,491
he says perpetually in indispensably
obliged to be and remain unalterably a

798
00:34:28,671 --> 00:34:31,190
subject of it that is to the state.

799
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:34,280
So once you give your word or agreement,

800
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:39,640
Locke says you are perpetually and
indispensably obligated to that state.

801
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,540
That's how seriously locked
takes this idea of consent.

802
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,560
It's something that can only be
entered into at the age of discretion.

803
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,630
It must be given consciously,

804
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:51,231
fully,

805
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:52,100
rationally,

806
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,860
presumably in some kind of ceremony.

807
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:59,861
And once given your consent to the
form of government remains as he says,

808
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,900
perpetual and Perpetual,

809
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:03,411
uh,

810
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:03,920
you are,

811
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,340
you are bound unalterably as he puts it.

812
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:07,970
Uh,

813
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,190
there's no such thing as taking it back.

814
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:15,191
It shows you how important lock puts
on the word or the oath or some,

815
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,420
some kind of civil,

816
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:17,830
uh,

817
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,663
agreement.

818
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,310
One's word is one's bond,

819
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:23,630
uh,

820
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:28,630
to give voice or consent to government
is not an act to be entered into lightly.

821
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:31,310
He says or implies.

822
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:36,311
But it is a kind of lifetime commitment
and it also shows us how different locks

823
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:39,690
view of the citizen is from ours.

824
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:40,681
In other words,

825
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,070
it would seem for Locke,

826
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:47,090
the only people who are full citizens
in our country would be people who have

827
00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:50,700
given their active consent.

828
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:54,870
And the only people who have given
their active consent are people who have

829
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:59,670
undergone what we interestingly
caught kind of naturalization process.

830
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,260
Is anyone here,

831
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,290
is anyone here a naturalized
citizen as we call it?

832
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,360
Has anyone ever been to
a naturalization process?

833
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:10,650
No.

834
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,970
Nobody where,

835
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,540
uh,

836
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,770
people go to,

837
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:14,131
you know,

838
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:17,070
it's administered by a judge and a,

839
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:18,780
you swear allegiance,

840
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:19,380
uh,

841
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:19,920
to,

842
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,300
to the new country.

843
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:22,380
You've presumably,

844
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:25,290
you shed your obligations
to your previous country.

845
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:27,750
You swear your allegiance to this one.

846
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:32,490
The only that seems to be the kind of
thing lock lock appears to be talking

847
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:32,851
about.

848
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:34,590
And it's interesting that again,

849
00:36:34,591 --> 00:36:36,970
the only people in our society and our,

850
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:41,210
in our country who would be
full citizens would be uh,

851
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:41,790
uh,

852
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,460
w w w net naturalized citizens.

853
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:44,911
Again,

854
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:49,911
birth alone does not confer on you
citizenship of any particular of any

855
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:51,930
particular country.

856
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,010
But what does that mean
for the rest of us?

857
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,340
Those who have not given
their active consent,

858
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,163
uh,

859
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,040
lock is aware that not everyone
gives their active consent.

860
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:10,250
That's why he introduces another
idea for how consent may be given.

861
00:37:10,351 --> 00:37:14,730
He talks about what he
calls tacit consent.

862
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,053
Uh,

863
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,800
there are those maybe who have not
sworn allegiance or given a civil oath,

864
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,440
but who nevertheless can be said to have
given their tacit consent to the form

865
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:29,760
of government and its laws.

866
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:32,670
But how do we give tacit consent?

867
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:37,671
Tacit consent is a strange word because
consent implies something active and

868
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,030
open.

869
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,030
Where tasks set.

870
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,420
Think of loc tasks.

871
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:44,640
Aternity tasks that's a,

872
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,390
implies something closed or concealed.

873
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,240
How is tacit consent,

874
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:51,780
uh,

875
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,300
given that's a problem,

876
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:57,960
that lock you can see lock
working on to some degree.

877
00:37:57,961 --> 00:37:58,561
He says,

878
00:37:58,561 --> 00:38:02,880
anyone who simply enjoys
the protection of the law,

879
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:08,210
the security of property and person
under the law can be said to have given

880
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,180
their tacit consent.

881
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:13,230
Uh,

882
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,930
they give it so to speak.

883
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,340
X Silencio even there,

884
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:18,390
there's silence.

885
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:20,220
Confers consent.

886
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,750
But how do we really know?

887
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,381
You could say,

888
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:23,214
how,

889
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:23,820
uh,

890
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,960
how do we know that,

891
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,500
uh,

892
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,500
silence confers tacit consent and
silence is not simply silence.

893
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,381
Uh,

894
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:32,730
an example I think of,

895
00:38:32,731 --> 00:38:33,564
for example,

896
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,490
if you go to wedding ceremony or,

897
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:38,440
and I guess in some wedding ceremonies,

898
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:38,951
the,

899
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:39,370
uh,

900
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:39,621
the,

901
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:39,730
uh,

902
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,440
justice or the minister,

903
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:42,191
whoever says,

904
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:42,431
you know,

905
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:43,264
whoever,

906
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:43,660
uh,

907
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,340
w what is the phrase about,

908
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,120
uh,

909
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,781
whoever,

910
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:47,614
uh,

911
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,610
hold your peace.

912
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:49,060
You know,

913
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,560
if anybody has any,

914
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,663
uh,

915
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,540
any question about this ceremony,

916
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,800
speak now or forever,

917
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:57,551
hold your peace.

918
00:38:57,551 --> 00:39:00,130
And of course everybody's
except in the movies of course.

919
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:00,940
Uh,

920
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,211
uh,

921
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:02,680
everybody's always silent.

922
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,930
Nobody says it's so their consent,

923
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:07,600
you might say their
tacit consent is given.

924
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,320
Uh,

925
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,630
there's silence from their silence,

926
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:10,980
uh,

927
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,120
to that question there,

928
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:14,170
their tacit consent is given.

929
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,131
But again,

930
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:15,430
that's,

931
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,390
that would be one way,

932
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:17,410
but a against,

933
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,251
how do we know,

934
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:18,581
again,

935
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:23,581
when silence confers tacit
consent or silence is simply,

936
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:25,810
is simply that silence.

937
00:39:25,811 --> 00:39:26,171
It just,

938
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:31,171
it's an issue that lacks struggles with
and to be sure never fully or I think

939
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:33,040
satisfactorily resolved.

940
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,510
Maybe you will resolve it.

941
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,390
Maybe you will resolve
it in your next paper.

942
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,020
Uh,

943
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,760
if you have the opportunity to write
about consent and the difference between

944
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:44,050
the express and tasks,

945
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,090
that form of citizenship.

946
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,360
And also the question being which
lock alludes to but does not fully or,

947
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:53,380
or there's not quite answered.

948
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,800
Is there any difference in privileges
in civil privileges between citizens who

949
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:02,440
have given their expressed consent?

950
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:07,300
And those who have only been said to
tacitly consent to the form of government,

951
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:11,780
does he suggest that one
class of citizens has more,

952
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,670
has greater rights or more greater
responsibilities than the other?

953
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,130
You might look into that question too.

954
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:18,880
Uh,

955
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,810
and see if you think Locke suggests any,

956
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,000
any differences on that

957
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,420
lock to go back.

958
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,350
Uh,

959
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:32,290
and just kind of begin to
wrap this up for today.

960
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:37,530
Lock does not appear to endorse
any particular form of government.

961
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,240
And in the second treatise,

962
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:40,661
uh,

963
00:40:40,661 --> 00:40:43,090
the task of forming the government,

964
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:43,640
uh,

965
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,510
will fall to the decision of the majority.

966
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,231
But again,

967
00:40:47,231 --> 00:40:48,011
what farm?

968
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:50,230
The majority we'll,

969
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:52,720
we'll decide remains to some degree.

970
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,070
Uh,

971
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,330
and open a question.

972
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:59,000
What gives lock or Lockie aneurysm?

973
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,610
It's distinctive tone.

974
00:41:00,611 --> 00:41:02,500
It's distinctive voice,

975
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:03,010
uh,

976
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:07,300
is the claim that whatever kind of
government a majority decides upon,

977
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,980
it must be one that limits
the power of the sovereign.

978
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,240
We cannot.

979
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:13,841
Uh,

980
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:15,520
and this I think in this respect,

981
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:20,521
I think luck is far closer to Lincoln and
he was just Steven Egg Douglas consent

982
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,800
does not simply mean consent to arbitrary
rule does not mean consent for this

983
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,350
power of the sovereign to do anything.

984
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:35,430
Lock Locke's theory of constitutional
government is a theory of restrained

985
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:42,131
government of constitutional
restraints of rule by law.

986
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:42,980
Uh,

987
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,590
this is lock gives in many ways,

988
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,130
uh,

989
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:49,690
the importance of law and
constitutional restraints,

990
00:41:49,691 --> 00:41:50,750
what we would today call,

991
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:52,430
I suppose limited government.

992
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,160
He gives us far greater expression,

993
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,860
far more powerful expression
than any of his predecessors.

994
00:41:58,861 --> 00:42:03,861
They're certainly not hubs who
had attributed absolute power,

995
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:04,460
uh,

996
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,190
to government or even to Aristotle who,

997
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:07,430
uh,

998
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:10,310
in many ways to share some
resemblances with Loc.

999
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,900
But even Aristotle had
severe doubts about a rule.

1000
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,070
Rule of law.

1001
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:17,770
Hobbes,

1002
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:18,571
Locke is,

1003
00:42:18,571 --> 00:42:20,630
is absolutely confident,

1004
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,560
uh,

1005
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,130
that,

1006
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:22,760
uh,

1007
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,930
limited government,

1008
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:24,650
uh,

1009
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:28,430
restraints restrains restraints on power.

1010
00:42:28,431 --> 00:42:30,290
Whether that power be from the one,

1011
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:30,711
the few,

1012
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:31,544
or the many.

1013
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:36,610
Restraints on power is the only kind
of government that can be trusted to

1014
00:42:38,661 --> 00:42:39,890
protect rights.

1015
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,750
And in one of the few jokes that
appears in the second treatise,

1016
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,650
you might've missed it because
lock is a subtle jokester.

1017
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,220
He doesn't,

1018
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:54,220
he's not like Machiavelli or Plato
lock as a very understated jokester.

1019
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:55,251
You know,

1020
00:42:55,251 --> 00:42:56,870
he was an Englishman after all.

1021
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,101
Uh,

1022
00:42:58,101 --> 00:43:00,110
he writes in section 93,

1023
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,250
referring to Hobbs Hobbs,

1024
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:04,770
but you'll,

1025
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,230
you'll also see his,

1026
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:11,260
his wonderful animal references he writes
in Hobbs is if men quitting the state

1027
00:43:12,621 --> 00:43:14,630
of nature entered into society,

1028
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:16,130
they agreed that all of them,

1029
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:18,830
but one should be under
the restraint of laws.

1030
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:20,540
Thinking about Hobbs is Leviathan,

1031
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:25,760
but that he should still retain all the
liberty of the state of nature increased

1032
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:27,110
with tower in,

1033
00:43:27,111 --> 00:43:29,990
made licentious by impunity.

1034
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:31,400
He goes on to say,

1035
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:36,200
this is to think that men are so foolish
that they take care to avoid what

1036
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:39,560
mischiefs be done to them
by polecats and foxes,

1037
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:44,830
but our content nay think it
safety to be devoured by lions.

1038
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,990
The love the lion being the uh,

1039
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:49,310
being,

1040
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:49,880
being the,

1041
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,061
the,

1042
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:50,301
the,

1043
00:43:50,301 --> 00:43:52,190
the Leviathan Salvin.

1044
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,770
Whereas in the Lockian state of nature,

1045
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:59,180
human beings are like Paul cats
and foxes there noxious creatures,

1046
00:43:59,181 --> 00:43:59,691
he says,

1047
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:00,381
but you know,

1048
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:02,930
they're not truly dangerous to you.

1049
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:05,510
And when one enters the state of nature,

1050
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,750
when one leaves the state of
nature to enter civil society,

1051
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,900
one is certainly not doing so to empower
a sovereign with Elian like powers over

1052
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:16,640
you as he says,

1053
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:17,330
uh,

1054
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:17,510
uh,

1055
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:17,900
who,

1056
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,070
who would do this?

1057
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:22,760
It's better to have some kind of
theory of restrained government,

1058
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,740
government limited government,

1059
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:25,281
uh,

1060
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:25,940
to,

1061
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,930
to do this for you.

1062
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:27,920
What I want to do,

1063
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:28,970
I'm going to end on this note.

1064
00:44:28,971 --> 00:44:33,971
What I want to do on Monday when I wrap
up lock is to continue with his doctrine

1065
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:37,140
of limited government because there is,

1066
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,710
it turns out there is a very
important exception to it.

1067
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:45,930
There is a kind of escape clause and I
would encourage you as you read it to pay

1068
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:50,580
particular attempt attention to
chapter 14 of the second treatise,

1069
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:53,580
his chapter on what he
calls prerogative power.

1070
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,190
That doctrine that has very,

1071
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:01,140
very important in grave
implications for our politics today.

1072
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:01,950
Uh,

1073
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,090
it's a very important chapter and I
want us to continue this and then talk a

1074
00:45:06,091 --> 00:45:10,800
little bit about the pros and cons
of locking in political philosophy.
