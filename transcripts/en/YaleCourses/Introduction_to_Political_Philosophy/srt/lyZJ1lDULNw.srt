1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,371
Okay.

2
00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:03,204
Good morning.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:04,710
We're going to,

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,480
I'm going to show another movie today,

5
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,680
but no,

6
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,200
not tell a little bit later in the class.

7
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,250
We'll get it.

8
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:11,571
We'll get it.

9
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:12,121
We'll get there.

10
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:12,954
Don't worry.

11
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:13,951
It doesn't,

12
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:15,600
it doesn't fit until,

13
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,360
until the,

14
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,490
the last part of the,

15
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:18,324
of the class.

16
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,680
Uh,

17
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,130
but today I want to
talk about sovereignty.

18
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Uh,

19
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
there are two great concepts that come
out of hubs that you have to remember.

20
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,370
One is the state of nature
and the other is sovereignty.

21
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:33,570
Uh,

22
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,480
I spoke a bit about the first one,

23
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:36,760
uh,

24
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,340
yesterday or Monday rather.

25
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,970
Today I want to talk about Hobbs.

26
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,390
This theory of the sovereign,

27
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,370
the sovereign state.

28
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,050
Uh,

29
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,050
the creation of the sovereign Hobbs
refers to the sovereign is a mortal God is

30
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,860
his answer to the problems
of the state of nature,

31
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,730
the state,

32
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,700
the condition of life being solitary,

33
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:00,091
poor,

34
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:00,601
nasty,

35
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:01,560
brutish and short.

36
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,480
And it is only the creation of the
sovereign for Hobbes and Dowd or possessed

37
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:11,481
with absolute power that is sufficient
to put an end to the condition of

38
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:13,770
perpetual uncertainty,

39
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:15,690
anxiety and unrest.

40
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,590
That is the case of the natural condition.

41
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,390
Let me talk for a while about
some of the formal features of,

42
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,180
of Hobbs is sovereign power
of the hobby and state.

43
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,581
And the first place,

44
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:37,581
what I want to impress upon you is that
the sovereign is four hubs less a person

45
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,870
then it is or he is an office.

46
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:43,700
Uh,

47
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,700
the sovereign is described by Hobbs is
an artificial person by which he means

48
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,150
the sovereign is the creation
of the contract or the covenant.

49
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:54,750
Uh,

50
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,970
that brought this office into being.

51
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,760
The sovereign does not exist by nature,

52
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,040
but rather hubs tells us again,

53
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,000
the sovereignty is the
product of art or science.

54
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,610
He's the CO product,

55
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:13,611
the creation of the people or of what
we might call and Jeffersonian language.

56
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,220
He is a product of the
consent of the governed,

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,590
the sovereign,

58
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,521
and again,

59
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:22,320
this is crucial is for hubs.

60
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,110
The representative of the people.

61
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,300
He is the sovereign representative.

62
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,690
It is the people who endow the sovereign
with the authority to represent them on

63
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,250
their behalf.

64
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,870
Uh,

65
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,770
in a net respect,

66
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,060
Hobbs is sovereign,

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,360
has many of the features
or characteristics that we
come to associate with what

68
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:48,630
we call modern executive power.

69
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,750
Or Executive Authority when Louis,

70
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:54,600
the 14th of France famously said,

71
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:56,910
lay Todd saying why I am the state.

72
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:02,140
He was expressing a peculiarly
pre modern in that way,

73
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,300
conception of the stake.

74
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,070
That is to say he regarded the state
as in some ways his personal property.

75
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,660
I am the state,

76
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,690
I am the state [inaudible] but this is
very different from Hobbs is sovereign.

77
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,730
The s the state for Hobbes is not
the possession of the sovereign.

78
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,980
Rather the sovereign
does not own the state.

79
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:28,981
He is appointed or authorized
to secure for the people.

80
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,220
Uh,

81
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,611
the,

82
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:34,960
in many ways limited ends
of peace and security.

83
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,070
He has much the same
function and to some degree,

84
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:41,230
much of the same personality,

85
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:41,661
uh,

86
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:44,470
is what we would call a modern day CEO.

87
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,900
That is to say there is a kind of
anonymity in impersonality about the

88
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:50,411
sovereign.

89
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:51,244
I mean who,

90
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:51,641
I mean,

91
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:52,600
unless you're in the,

92
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,030
you know,

93
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,130
Yale Entrepreneurial Society who,

94
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,240
who can name the CEOs of many
companies and the answers,

95
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,340
you probably can't,

96
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,020
they are for the most part,

97
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:03,610
relatively anonymous,

98
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,630
uh,

99
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,920
individuals and less,

100
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:06,281
you know,

101
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:11,281
they get into trouble like Ken lay or
someone like that or do something amazing

102
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:13,240
like Bill Gates for the most part.

103
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,670
They are rather impersonal,

104
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,451
uh,

105
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:16,820
and,

106
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,740
and anonymous.

107
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:22,090
And that is in many ways the
characteristic of hubs is sovereign

108
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,320
hubs,

109
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,280
is theory of the sovereign,

110
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,540
interestingly,

111
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:33,541
contains within itself elements of both
secular absolutism and in some ways

112
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:37,060
modern liberalism.

113
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:42,160
And it is the tension between
these two that I want to bring out,

114
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:42,911
uh,

115
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:43,151
in,

116
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:44,380
in my discussion here.

117
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,400
The power of the sovereign
hubs continually insist,

118
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,690
must be unlimited.

119
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,390
Yet at the same time he's tells us that
the sovereign is the creation of the

120
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:59,620
people whom he represents
or it represents.

121
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,873
Uh,

122
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,600
although Hobbs is widely taken to be
a defender of monarchical absolutism,

123
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:12,030
you will note in your readings that he
displays a kind of studied neutrality,

124
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:13,601
uh,

125
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:17,830
over actually what form
does sovereign should take.

126
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,230
A,

127
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,230
he only insists that sovereign
power remain absolute and undivided,

128
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,350
whether it belongs to a single person,

129
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,333
a few,

130
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:27,531
uh,

131
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:28,364
or the many.

132
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,060
And among the powers that the sovereign,

133
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,510
uh,

134
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,580
he insists must control,

135
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,180
uh,

136
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,530
are for example,

137
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,690
laws concerning property,

138
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,633
the right,

139
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,170
uh,

140
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,310
of declaring war and peace,

141
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,380
what what we would call foreign policy,

142
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,070
uh,

143
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,720
rules of justice,

144
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,230
uh,

145
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,970
concerning life and death,

146
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,590
which is to say criminal law.

147
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,890
And of course the right to determine
what books and ideas are permissible.

148
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:56,944
That is to say,

149
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,290
uh,

150
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,010
the right,

151
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,171
uh,

152
00:05:58,171 --> 00:05:59,090
of censorship.

153
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,573
In a sense.

154
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,680
The core of Hobbes is
theory of sovereignty can be
boiled down to the statement

155
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,870
that the sovereign and only the
sovereign is this source of law.

156
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,390
The law is what the sovereign says it is.

157
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,190
Does that sound in any way familiar
from what we have read this term?

158
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,780
Any anyone sound familiar?

159
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,920
[inaudible] do you remember that name?

160
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,460
Book One of the Republic Justice
is what this stronger say it is.

161
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:44,990
Hobbs tells us that the law is
what the sovereign commands.

162
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,720
This is sometimes known as the
doctrine of legal positivism,

163
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,250
which is to say that law is
the command of the sovereign.

164
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:57,410
I sort of command theory of law.

165
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,281
And again,

166
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:02,930
that seems to point back to a
Thrasymachus his point of view,

167
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:03,380
uh,

168
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,890
in the first book of the
Republic there is for Hobbes.

169
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:08,240
As for Thrasymachus,

170
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:10,370
no higher court of Appeal,

171
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,270
then the will or the
word of the sovereign,

172
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:16,340
no transcendent law,

173
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,370
no divine law and no source of authority
outside sovereign command sovereign is

174
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:27,530
appointed four hubs to
be much like an umpire,

175
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:28,431
uh,

176
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:30,890
in a baseball or a football game.

177
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:33,020
Just set the rules of the game.

178
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,660
But the Hobbsy and sovereign,

179
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,430
uh,

180
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,430
unlike umpires are not just the enforcers
of the rules or the interpreters of

181
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:44,040
the rules.

182
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,280
That sovereign is also the creator,

183
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,930
the shaper and maker,

184
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,390
uh,

185
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,230
of the rules and Hobbes draws from this,

186
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:54,620
the startling a conclusion in many ways,

187
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:58,910
the infamous conclusion that the
sovereign can never act unjustly.

188
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,120
Sovereign can never act unjustly.

189
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:03,391
Why?

190
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:07,410
Because the sovereign is the
source of law and this the source.

191
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,740
If the sovereign is the source
of the rules of justice,

192
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,730
therefore,

193
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,000
hubs concludes he can never act unjustly.

194
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:19,950
And he supports this example
by a deeply perverse and uh,

195
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,761
amusing.

196
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:21,511
I have to say,

197
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:23,760
reading from a biblical story.

198
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:24,541
Do you remember this?

199
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:24,711
He,

200
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:28,020
he refers to the story of David and Uriah.

201
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:33,630
Everybody will remember that story
from Sunday school or Hebrew school or

202
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:34,464
whatever.

203
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,100
Does anyone remember that David
was the king at that time?

204
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:43,101
He was the king of Israel and he
coveted Uriah as wife Bathsheba.

205
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,200
He wanted to sleep with Beth Sheba.

206
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,970
So what did he do?

207
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,660
He had Uriah killed so he could,

208
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,680
he could sleep with her.

209
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,790
And Hobbes reasons this story that while
David's action may have sinned against

210
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:01,224
God,

211
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,470
he did no injustice to Uriah.

212
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,150
Imagine that.

213
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,240
I think Uriah might've had a
different point of view about this.

214
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:09,871
Uh,

215
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:13,590
he did no injustice to Uriah
because as the lawful sovereign,

216
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:15,300
he could do any,

217
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,950
not just anything he liked,

218
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:20,280
but whatever he did was
the Wa was set by the,

219
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,840
by the rules of the law.

220
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,600
And when Hobbs tells that story,

221
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:25,110
which he,

222
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,480
which he mentions a couple
of times in the book,

223
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,130
one can only imagine.

224
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:33,400
He must've had a kind of
wry grin on his face when,

225
00:09:33,401 --> 00:09:33,660
when,

226
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,110
when he,

227
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:34,831
when he wrote,

228
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:35,220
when he,

229
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,390
when he wrote that out.

230
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,041
In fact,

231
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:42,840
next semester I'm teaching an entire
course devoted to Hobbs as critique of

232
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:43,674
religion,

233
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,190
uh,

234
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,090
in which this will,

235
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,520
among other things figure prominently,

236
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,703
uh,

237
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,280
but Hobbs is teaching about law is in
some ways less draconian then then it

238
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,360
might at first appear,

239
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:00,720
he makes clear that law is
what the sovereign says it is.

240
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,930
There can be no such
thing as an unjust law.

241
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:05,430
He infers again,

242
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:08,850
because the sovereign is
the source of all justice,

243
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,740
but he does distinguish,

244
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:14,010
he tells us between
adjust law into good law,

245
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,460
all laws are by definition
just he tells us,

246
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:18,720
but it doesn't follow that.

247
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:22,110
All laws are by definition
good a good law.

248
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,210
He says chapter 30 is that which is
needful for the good of the people.

249
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,900
A good law is needful for
the good of the people.

250
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:31,910
But then he,

251
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,210
but then one asks,

252
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:37,230
what are the criteria by which we
determine the good of the people?

253
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:38,610
How was this determined?

254
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,290
And Hobbes makes clear that
the sovereign is not invested,

255
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,593
uh,

256
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,020
with the authority to exercise a kind
of absolute control over everything that

257
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:52,260
people do.

258
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:52,481
The,

259
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:57,330
the purpose of law Hobbes tells
us is not so much to control,

260
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,190
but to facilitate.

261
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,760
Consider just the following passage from
chapter 30 section 21 Hobbes rights for

262
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:09,900
the use of laws which
are but rules authorized,

263
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:10,650
he says,

264
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,820
is not to bind to the people
from all bow voluntary actions.

265
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:17,940
It is not to bind them
from voluntary actions,

266
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:22,941
but to direct and keep them in such
motion as not to hurt themselves by their

267
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,050
own impetuous desires,

268
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,290
rationalists or indiscretion as
hedges are set not to stop travelers,

269
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,360
but to keep them on their way.

270
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,450
This is the force or purpose of law to,

271
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,920
to set rules,

272
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:41,310
to keep people as he puts it on their way.

273
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,330
Uh,

274
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,330
a law that is intended simply to
constrain and control for its own sake.

275
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,520
Hobbes says cannot be a good law.

276
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,640
The purpose of a good law is to
facilitate human agency in some ways.

277
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:57,220
And I think again,

278
00:11:57,221 --> 00:12:00,880
that too is central to Hobbs
is theory of the sovereign.

279
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,840
It's purpose is to facilitate
not simply to control,

280
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,350
uh,

281
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,183
and inhibit.

282
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,520
But the power to control or the power
of law for Hobbs also very much applies.

283
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:15,220
And here is one of his most,

284
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,343
uh,

285
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,120
um,

286
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,910
controversial doctrines.

287
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,120
It must certainly apply to
matters of opinion to what,

288
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,990
to what we would call today
first amendment issues.

289
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,273
Uh,

290
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,130
this is something that Hobbes
insists upon for the actions of men.

291
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:33,940
He says,

292
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,740
proceed from their opinions,

293
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,520
actions proceed from
opinions and in the end,

294
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,080
in the weld governing of opinions
consistent the weld governing of men's

295
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:44,914
actions.

296
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,240
So if we are,

297
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,780
if we are going to govern
or regulate human behavior,

298
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:52,450
we have to begin by regulating opinion.

299
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,100
And it follows from this.

300
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:58,090
Hobbes believes that the sovereign
has the right to decide what opinions,

301
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,111
what books,

302
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:04,111
what ideas are conducive to peace and
which ones aim simply to stir up war and

303
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:07,564
discontent

304
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,250
in these comments of hubs about the
sovereigns power to control opinions are

305
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:17,860
directed at two principal institutions,

306
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,953
the church.

307
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,540
And guess what the other one is

308
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,140
the university.

309
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,950
Both of these for Hobbs,

310
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,150
he considers to be locusts.

311
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,900
The focus of s or centers
of seditious opinion,

312
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:38,901
uh,

313
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,850
that required to remain under
sovereign control by the churches.

314
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:43,830
Uh,

315
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,990
Hobbs is speaking of the reformed church,

316
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:52,020
but in particular he is concerned
with those radical Puritan sect

317
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,920
of the type that later or can't came and
founded a America these radical sects

318
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:05,941
that elevate matters of conscience and
private belief over and above the law.

319
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,790
That is to say arrogating to themselves,

320
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,340
to the rights of conscience
in the private belief,

321
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:14,410
the powers to judge the sovereign.

322
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,320
It was these dissenting Protestants.

323
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:22,321
It was these dissenting sects formed
the rank and file of Cromwells armies.

324
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:23,650
Uh,

325
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,600
during the civil war in England.

326
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:30,490
They formed the rank and file of
the Republican armies in England,

327
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:30,881
uh,

328
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:32,440
against the rule of the king.

329
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:37,441
And Hobbes tells us he would banish
all doctrines that profess to make the

330
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:40,330
individual or the sect.

331
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,411
More importantly,

332
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:41,921
in some ways,

333
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:42,754
the sect,

334
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,740
the judge of the sovereign,

335
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,840
it is only in the state of nature.

336
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,870
He tells us that individuals have
the right to determine Justin unjust,

337
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:54,320
right and wrong for themselves.

338
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:56,060
Once we entered society,

339
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,940
once we engage or,

340
00:14:57,941 --> 00:15:00,440
or conclude the social compact,

341
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,160
we transfer our power to
do this to the sovereign,

342
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:05,120
to determine,

343
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:05,600
uh,

344
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,460
these matters for us.

345
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,130
And just as important as the,

346
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,250
as the radical churches in the ref,

347
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,160
in the reforms.

348
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:13,994
Sex,

349
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:14,440
uh,

350
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,440
is four hubs of the university and its
curriculum in particular hubs is Fox,

351
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:25,760
the universities for teaching what?

352
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,360
For teaching the radical doctrines of
[inaudible] it in the 17th century.

353
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,620
Aristotle in this period was the
source of modern Republican ideas.

354
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,960
Ideas about self-government,

355
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,850
ideas about direct in some ways what
we might call direct democracy or

356
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:48,590
participatory democracy.

357
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:53,000
People who believe that the only
legitimate form of government is one where

358
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:58,001
Aristotle says citizens take turns
ruling and being ruled in turn,

359
00:15:58,101 --> 00:16:00,830
it was above all the
influence of the classics,

360
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,651
the,

361
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:01,841
the,

362
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:02,151
the,

363
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:07,151
the Aristotle and Cicero in particular
that hubs regards as an important cause

364
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:09,770
for the recent civil war.

365
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,020
And the regicide of Charles,

366
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:17,021
the first considered the following
passage that he writes as to rebellion

367
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,680
against monarchy.

368
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,400
One of the most frequent causes is the
reading of the books of policy in history

369
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:26,420
of the ancient Greeks and Romans.

370
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,090
Reading of those books,

371
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:29,780
uh,

372
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,780
leads people to rebel against monarchy
for which young men like yourself,

373
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,411
he says,

374
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:41,411
or what young women to for which young
men and all others that are unprovoked

375
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,820
guided by the antidote of solid reason,

376
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,080
uh,

377
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,220
who are susceptible.

378
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:50,630
That is to reading these stories and
reading these books receive a strong and

379
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:54,080
delightful impression of
the great exploits of war.

380
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,673
Okay.

381
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,760
From reading of such books,

382
00:16:57,761 --> 00:16:58,720
Hobbs continues.

383
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:03,721
Men have undertaken to kill their kings
because the Greek and Latin writers in

384
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:09,271
their books and discourses of policy make
it lawful and laudable for any man to

385
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:12,100
do so provided before he do it,

386
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,540
he called him a tyrant.

387
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,520
Okay.

388
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:15,810
Ah,

389
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,370
that's what you learn.

390
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,510
Hobbes believes from,

391
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:23,310
from the reading of Aristotle and
the Greeks enrollments regicide,

392
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:23,820
uh,

393
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,900
that the only legitimate form of
government is a republic and that it is a

394
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:31,230
lawful and even is your
duty to kill your king.

395
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,250
Uh,

396
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:32,761
of course,

397
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:33,690
before doing so,

398
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:35,610
he says you must call him first a tyrant.

399
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,073
Uh,

400
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:42,150
it's a wonderful passage
and this is so interesting,

401
00:17:42,151 --> 00:17:47,151
I think not only because of its humor
and Hobbes is in many ways characteristic

402
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:48,720
exaggerations,

403
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,390
but because he shows,

404
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,530
it shows how much emphasis Hobbs
puts on the reform of opinion,

405
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,000
the reform of ideas in
many ways like Machiavelli,

406
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,220
unlike Plato to before him,

407
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:06,510
hubs regards himself as
an educator of princes,

408
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,430
an educator of in a transformer,

409
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:12,930
a reformer of ideas.

410
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:17,931
There was a kind of internal irony here
I think because hubs sometimes writes as

411
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:18,960
if,

412
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,730
as we've seen as if human beings are
nothing more than complex machines that

413
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:27,750
mechanically obey the laws
of attraction and repulsion.

414
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:32,700
But he also obviously writes that we
are beings with will and purpose who are

415
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:34,650
uniquely guided by opinions,

416
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:36,240
ideas and doctrines.

417
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,340
And it is in many ways the first business
of the sovereign to act as a moral

418
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,290
reformer of ideas.

419
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,960
Hubs realizes this is a difficult and
uphill task that he has set for himself.

420
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,930
And in a rare moment of,

421
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,500
of sort of personal self
reflection or self reference,

422
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,543
he notes,

423
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:58,970
uh,

424
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,720
somewhat,

425
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,200
uh,

426
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,840
drolly that the novelty of his ideas,

427
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:03,330
uh,

428
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,430
will make it difficult for
them to find an audience.

429
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,823
Uh,

430
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,150
I am at the point of believing,

431
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,030
he says this might,

432
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,420
that my labor will be as useless
is the Commonwealth of Plato.

433
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,240
Okay.

434
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,240
He says in a moment of sort
of uncharacteristic despair
will be as useless as

435
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,500
the Commonwealth of Plato.

436
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:26,251
For Plato,

437
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:30,780
he says also is of the opinion that it
is impossible for the disorders of the

438
00:19:30,781 --> 00:19:35,220
state ever to be taken away
till sovereigns be philosophers.

439
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,760
And while in many ways
initially despairing of the
possibility of finding a sort

440
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:47,761
of friendly reception or audience
for his work hubs then goes on in a,

441
00:19:48,411 --> 00:19:53,411
in a more optimistic note to observe
that his book is considerably simpler and

442
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,680
easier to read than Plato's.

443
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,600
Okay.

444
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,810
Can you might have a discussion
about that over which witches?

445
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,551
The easier one.

446
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:06,551
But Hobbes believes it is simpler and
easier and therefore more likely to catch

447
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,260
the ear of a sympathetic prince.

448
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,090
I recover some hope.

449
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,171
He says,

450
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:14,540
I recover some hope
that one time or other,

451
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:19,541
this writing of mine may fall into the
hands of a sovereign who will consider it

452
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,100
for himself for it is short.

453
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,360
And I think Claire,

454
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:24,901
well,

455
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:29,610
we might question that he says it's
a short book and I think clear.

456
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:30,330
He writes,

457
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:30,810
well,

458
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,670
it's complex and long,

459
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:33,630
but nevertheless,

460
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,350
uh,

461
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:39,030
perhaps hoping that his advertising
it in this way will gain the ear of a

462
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,010
sovereign and that without the help,

463
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:44,520
he continues of any interested
or envious interpreter.

464
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And by the exercise of entire in
protecting the public teaching of it,

465
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,320
convert this truth of speculation
into the utility of practice.

466
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,570
The very end of chapter 31,

467
00:20:59,440 --> 00:20:59,860
uh,

468
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,860
we'll convert this truth of speculation
into the utility of practice.

469
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:09,901
So Hobbes clearly believes he or thinks
that this will be a useful book for a

470
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:13,570
sovereign to read and hope,

471
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,840
hoping it will gain the
ear of a sympathetic,

472
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,020
a sovereign or potential sovereign.

473
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:22,830
Uh,

474
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,270
Hobbes may I think,

475
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,160
overestimate a,

476
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:30,060
or maybe I really should say
underestimate the difficulty of the book.

477
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,020
Uh,

478
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,720
but he returns to this again
at the very end of Leviathan,

479
00:21:33,721 --> 00:21:34,680
the universities,

480
00:21:34,681 --> 00:21:39,150
he says that where he talks again a little
bit about the audience for the book.

481
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,280
The universities he says are the
fountains of civil and moral doctrine,

482
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,260
the universities or the fountains of
civil and moral doctrines and have the

483
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:50,170
obligation to,

484
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,690
to teach the correct doctrine
of rights and duties.

485
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,460
And this means for Hobbes.

486
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:57,211
First of all,

487
00:21:57,211 --> 00:22:02,211
adopting his book is the authoritative
teaching on moral and political doctrine

488
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:04,740
in the universities.

489
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:09,741
This should be the required
textbook of political science,

490
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,940
of political teaching in the universities
to replace the older textbook,

491
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,980
I.

492
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:16,980
E.

493
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,850
Aristotle's politics.

494
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,481
Therefore,

495
00:22:18,481 --> 00:22:19,021
he says,

496
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:23,550
I think it may be profitably printed
and more profitably taught in the

497
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:24,420
universities.

498
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,040
He confidently,

499
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:26,590
uh,

500
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,310
asserts the ideal audience for the book.

501
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:29,761
He says,

502
00:22:29,761 --> 00:22:30,990
should be the preachers,

503
00:22:30,991 --> 00:22:32,010
the Gentry,

504
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,060
the lawyers.

505
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:38,300
Men have affairs who drawing such water
as they find from the book can use it.

506
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:40,680
He says to sprinkle the same,

507
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,060
both from the pulpit and from
their conversation upon the people.

508
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,040
This is how he sees it.

509
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,810
That it should be taught from the pulpit.

510
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,670
It should be taught from the universities
and from this conversation will be

511
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:58,671
sprinkled upon the people hubs is hope
like that of all the great political

512
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:04,830
philosophers was to be a kind
of legislator for mankind.

513
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,930
This again is a book with,

514
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:07,764
with epic,

515
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,940
epic ambition.

516
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,823
Okay.

517
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,110
Let me mention,

518
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,130
uh,

519
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:22,130
I've emphasized that in many ways the
absolutist and authoritarian side of Hobbs

520
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:23,364
is teaching.

521
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,540
Let me talk about something
that might sound oxymoronic.

522
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,860
Let me call it for the moment.

523
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:30,150
Hobbsy and liberalism

524
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:36,950
hubs enjoys describing the sovereign
in the most absolute and extreme term.

525
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,280
Sovereign is to have supreme
command over life and death,

526
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,440
war and peace.

527
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,910
What is to be taught and

528
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:46,690
yeah.

529
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,580
And yet in many ways
that's the hubs again,

530
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:53,581
sovereign aims to allow for ample
room for individual liberty.

531
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,860
And even he even set some limits,

532
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,381
uh,

533
00:23:57,381 --> 00:24:01,840
under legitimate use of sovereign
power for all of his tough talk.

534
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,590
Uh,

535
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:07,090
Hobbes takes justice and the
rule of law very seriously,

536
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,600
uh,

537
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,820
far more seriously than for example,

538
00:24:09,821 --> 00:24:10,001
does.

539
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:10,834
Machiavelli,

540
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,131
that's it.

541
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:14,410
One time in the book or one point,

542
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:19,411
he maintains that a person cannot be
made to accuse themselves without the

543
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,250
assurance of pardon.

544
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,590
You can't be forced to accuse yourself
what we would call the fifth amendment.

545
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,500
You cannot be forced to accuse yourself.

546
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,101
Similarly,

547
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:30,461
he says,

548
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:35,410
a wife or a parent cannot be coerced
to accuse a loved one and an a similar

549
00:24:35,411 --> 00:24:35,741
point.

550
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:40,390
He maintains that punishment can never
be used as an instrument of revenge,

551
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,160
but only for what he calls the
correction or what we would call the

552
00:24:45,161 --> 00:24:46,330
rehabilitation,

553
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,111
uh,

554
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:47,830
of the,

555
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,730
of the offender.

556
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,670
Add to the above.

557
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:57,030
Hobbes is repeated insistence that lost
serve as an instrument for achieving

558
00:24:57,671 --> 00:24:59,230
social equality.

559
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,720
In a chapter called of the office
of the sovereign representative,

560
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,320
Hobbes argues that justice be equally
administered to all classes of people rich

561
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,820
as well as poor.

562
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,490
The equal application of justice.

563
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:16,750
He maintains further,

564
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:20,140
the titles of nobility are a value,

565
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,680
uh,

566
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,513
only,

567
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:21,790
uh,

568
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:26,790
for the benefits they confer on those
of lesser rank or they're not useful at

569
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:28,594
all.

570
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,680
Equal justice.

571
00:25:29,681 --> 00:25:34,681
He tells us requires equal taxation
policy and he seems to be proposing a kind

572
00:25:35,411 --> 00:25:37,790
of consumption tax so that the,

573
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,270
the rich who consume more,

574
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:45,540
we'll have to pay their fair share when
he argues that indigent citizens who are

575
00:25:46,601 --> 00:25:51,601
unable to provide for themselves should
not be forced to rely simply upon the

576
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:54,670
private charity of individuals,

577
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,640
but should be maintained
at public expense.

578
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:02,080
He seems in this way to anticipate what
we might think of as the modern welfare

579
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:03,430
state that,

580
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,353
uh,

581
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:04,870
that,

582
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,500
uh,

583
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,280
public,

584
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,541
uh,

585
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:11,530
assistance be provided and the poor
are not simply depend on the private

586
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,693
goodwill,

587
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,091
uh,

588
00:26:13,091 --> 00:26:13,510
of,

589
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,500
of their others.

590
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,290
Okay.

591
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,580
But most importantly,

592
00:26:18,581 --> 00:26:21,450
I think is to go back to the individual.

593
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:25,600
The importance given to the
individual in Hobbs is philosophy.

594
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,750
Hobbes derives the very power of the
sovereign from the natural right of each

595
00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:36,250
individual to do as they
like in the state of nature.

596
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,350
And it follows,

597
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,213
I think,

598
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,030
uh,

599
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:44,700
that the purpose of the sovereign is
really to safeguard the natural right of

600
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:45,900
each individual,

601
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,090
but to regulate this right.

602
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:48,601
Uh,

603
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:51,810
so that it becomes consistent
with the right of others.

604
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,890
And not simply,

605
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:53,251
again,

606
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:56,910
a kind of open war against
all of all against all.

607
00:26:56,911 --> 00:27:01,911
What is significant about this I think
is the priority that Hobbes gives to

608
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:04,080
rights over duties.

609
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,700
This in many ways arguably
makes him the founding father,

610
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,630
or maybe we should say
godfather of modern liberalism,

611
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:12,970
the,

612
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:17,970
the importance given to rights over
duties of the individual over in many ways

613
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,420
the collective or common good.

614
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,140
And I think this is
expressed in Hobbs is novel.

615
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:25,600
Uh,

616
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,600
and in many ways altogether unprecedented
teaching about liberty in chapter 21

617
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,810
very famous and important chapter.

618
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,840
And here he distinguishes
the liberty of the,

619
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,450
what he calls the liberty
of the ancients or what,

620
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,250
what he doesn't exactly call,

621
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:45,570
but I'll call the liberty of the
ancients and the liberty of the moderns.

622
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,001
The ancients,

623
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:53,001
he believes operated with a defective
understanding of human freedom.

624
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,770
For the ancients,

625
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,270
liberty meant,

626
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:57,660
uh,

627
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:02,660
living in a self governing republic liver
living in a republic in which everyone

628
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,900
again took some share
in the ruling offices.

629
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:07,441
Liberty.

630
00:28:07,441 --> 00:28:08,310
In other words,

631
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:13,311
for the ancients was not just
a property of the individual.

632
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:17,430
It was an attribute of
the regime of which one,

633
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:17,890
uh,

634
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,110
of which one was a member.

635
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:20,670
The Athenians and the Romans,

636
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:21,151
he says,

637
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:22,020
we're free.

638
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,880
That is they were free.

639
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,170
Commonweal's.

640
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:30,410
Not that any particular man had the
liberty to resist his own representative,

641
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,540
but that his representative had the
liberty to resist or invade other people.

642
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,823
In other words,

643
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,500
liberty for the ancients
was a collective good.

644
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:40,770
The,

645
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,430
the liberty,

646
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,001
as he says,

647
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:44,970
to resist or invade other people.

648
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,430
It was a property of the Commonwealth,

649
00:28:47,431 --> 00:28:50,220
not of the individuals
who who inhabited it,

650
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,620
but that sense of collective liberty.

651
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,380
Uh,

652
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,560
the freedom to resist or invade is not an,

653
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,610
is in fact even opposed to the modern
idea of liberty that Hobbs proposes.

654
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:06,450
And by Liberty Hobbs means it's something
that sounds very familiar to us.

655
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:11,610
Liberty means the absence of
constraints or impediments to action.

656
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,500
We are free to the extent that we
can act in an unimpeded manner.

657
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,950
And it follows from him that political,

658
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,980
political liberty means the freedom to
act where the law is silent as he says.

659
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,360
Think of that,

660
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,220
that where the law is silent,

661
00:29:29,221 --> 00:29:33,150
we have the freedom to do
or not to do as we choose.

662
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:37,530
Very important to the way we think
of liberty today in a modern,

663
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,390
now you might say liberal democracy,

664
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,560
Hobbes is sovereign,

665
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:46,830
is more likely to allow citizens as zone
of private liberty where they are free

666
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:49,210
to act as they choose.

667
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:54,570
Then in the classical republic where
there is a kind of coerced participation,

668
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:55,930
uh,

669
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:00,930
in collective affairs or in political
deliberation and Hobbes here takes a dig

670
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:06,811
at the defenders of the view in his own
day that only the citizens of a republic

671
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,170
can be free.

672
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:10,250
Okay.

673
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,001
There is written,

674
00:30:11,001 --> 00:30:11,571
he says,

675
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:15,290
and the tourists of the
city of Luca and anybody,

676
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,240
let me just ask before
I continue this passage.

677
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:18,830
Anybody here in Pearson College?

678
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,500
So you know,

679
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,130
you all know that the dean,

680
00:30:22,131 --> 00:30:23,120
Mr Amerigo,

681
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:24,410
yeah,

682
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:24,980
you're doing,

683
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,840
your dean is from the city of Lucca.

684
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,840
Ask him if this is true.

685
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,861
Uh,

686
00:30:30,861 --> 00:30:35,390
when you see them there is written and
the tourists of the city of Lucca in

687
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:36,620
great characters,

688
00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:39,290
meaning great letters at this day.

689
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:44,291
The word Libertas Libertas has written
on the walls of the tourists of the city

690
00:30:45,651 --> 00:30:46,484
of Luca

691
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,920
is find out if that's still true yet.

692
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,320
No Man Hubs Can,

693
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,640
continues convince,

694
00:30:53,641 --> 00:30:58,641
infer consents in furthered a particular
man has more liberty or immunity from

695
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:03,830
the service of the Commonwealth
there then in Constantinople,

696
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,500
the city of the Caliphs,

697
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,560
the caliphate living in a republic alone
doesn't guarantee you more freedom.

698
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:16,160
He says freedom in that
interesting passage.

699
00:31:16,161 --> 00:31:18,740
Freedom here requires as he puts it,

700
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:19,520
immunity,

701
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,080
immunity from service.

702
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:26,390
A regime is to be judged for
Hobbes on how much private liberty,

703
00:31:26,391 --> 00:31:31,391
how much immunity it grants each of its
citizens and idea of individual liberty

704
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:35,150
in many ways unknown and
unprecedented in the,

705
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,350
in the modern world.

706
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,060
And in this respect,

707
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:43,061
one can say that Hobbs has some connection
to the creation of what we think of

708
00:31:44,271 --> 00:31:48,830
as the modern liberal state with
its conception of private freedom,

709
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:53,920
as immunity from forced co
forced participation or forced,

710
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:55,883
uh,

711
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,650
uh,

712
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,483
uh,

713
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,650
participation in,

714
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,660
in politics,

715
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,710
very different from the ancients.

716
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,410
So what does this all mean?

717
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,323
Uh,

718
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,280
let me talk about what Hobbs
has to say for us today.

719
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,260
We who have in many ways
become hubs as children

720
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,390
hubs gives us the definitive
language of the modern state,

721
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,350
yet he remains in many ways,

722
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,290
is contested for us as
he was in his own time.

723
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,251
For many today,

724
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:39,200
Hobbs is conception of the Leviathan
state is synonymous with anti-liberal

725
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,220
absolutism.

726
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,050
And yet for others,

727
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:46,580
he opened the door to John Locke and
the liberal theory of government.

728
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:51,290
He talked the priority of rights over
duties and he argued that the sovereign

729
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:56,291
should serve the lowly interest or
the lowly ends of providing peace and

730
00:32:57,051 --> 00:32:57,771
security,

731
00:32:57,771 --> 00:33:02,771
leaving it to individuals to determine
for themselves how best to live their

732
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:03,914
lives.

733
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,151
Nonetheless,

734
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,070
the liberty that subjects,

735
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:12,130
the subjects in joy in Hobbs
is plan falls in that area.

736
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:17,380
That the simply that he says the sovereign
omit to regulate hubs does not craze

737
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,960
vigilance in defense of liberty.

738
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,100
And he denounces all efforts
to resist the government.

739
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:31,210
It best one could say Hobbes is a
kind of part time liberal at best,

740
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:37,620
but Hobbs is best when he
is providing us with the,

741
00:33:37,621 --> 00:33:41,940
in many ways the moral and psychological
language in which we think about

742
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,560
government and the state.

743
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:49,830
The state is a product of a psychological
struggle between the contending

744
00:33:49,831 --> 00:33:52,440
passions of pride and fear.

745
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,660
Fear you remember,

746
00:33:54,661 --> 00:33:58,380
is associated with the
desire for security order,

747
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,900
rationality and peace.

748
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,380
Pride is connected with the love of glory,

749
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,543
honor,

750
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,770
recognition and ambition.

751
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:13,610
All the goods of civilization hubs tells
us stem from our ability to control

752
00:34:14,311 --> 00:34:15,144
pride.

753
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:21,120
The very title of the book comes from
this wonderful biblical passage from Joe

754
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:26,250
where Leviathan is described as
king of the children of pride.

755
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,980
And the 19 laws of nature that hubs,

756
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:30,500
uh,

757
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,550
IX develops in his book.

758
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,480
Uh,

759
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,480
really are there simply to enumerate or
instruct us about the virtues of socio

760
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:40,710
ability and civility,

761
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,310
uh,

762
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:46,310
especially directed against
the sin of pride or Hubris.

763
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:49,950
So the modern state is,

764
00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:52,770
we know it and still have it in many ways,

765
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:54,090
grew out of the hubs,

766
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:59,091
Ian Desire for security and the fear of
death that can only be achieved at the

767
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:04,440
expense of the desire for honor and glory.

768
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,440
The Hobbsy and state was intended
to secure the conditions of life,

769
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:11,550
uh,

770
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,310
even a highly civilized
and cultivated life,

771
00:35:14,311 --> 00:35:19,311
but one calculated in terms of
self interest and risk avoidance

772
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:27,810
hubs wants us to be fearful and to avoid
dangerous courses of action that are,

773
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,520
are,

774
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,540
are inflamed by beliefs and honor,

775
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,160
ambition and the like.

776
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,200
The Hobbsy and fearful man is not likely
to become someone who risks life for

777
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:49,791
liberty for honor or for a cause is more
likely to be someone who plays by the

778
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:52,104
rules,

779
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,550
avoids dangers and bets
on the shore thing.

780
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,080
The Hobbs and citizen is not likely to
be a risk taker like a George Washington

781
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:08,601
or Andrew Carnegie is more likely to
think like an actuary or a CPA or an

782
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:13,470
insurance agent.

783
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:19,370
Always calculating the odds and
finding ways to cover the damages.

784
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,001
Later,

785
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:26,001
political theorists like John Jacques
Rousseau in Nicha would even develop a

786
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:29,310
word for Hobbsy and man,

787
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,940
they would call him
somewhat contemptuously,

788
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,350
the bourgeois.

789
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:37,981
But nevertheless,

790
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:42,660
Hobbs was remarkably successful in
converting us to his point of view,

791
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,350
the type of individual he tried to create,

792
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,110
careful self interested,

793
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,820
risk averse.

794
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:56,010
This is become the dominant ethos
of our civilization has has it not.

795
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,240
We even have entire disciplines like
economics and psychology and I dare even

796
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:08,091
say modern political science that
reinforce this view of human nature.

797
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,530
We have all become,

798
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:12,840
whether we choose to admit it or not,

799
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,700
Hobbes,

800
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,533
eons.

801
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,280
And yet at the same time,

802
00:37:17,281 --> 00:37:18,960
and here is the paradox,

803
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:24,260
I think even a HUBZone and society
cannot entirely exist without some

804
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:29,250
individuals who are willing
to risk life and limb,

805
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,151
uh,

806
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:31,920
either for the sake of honor,

807
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,450
for self respect,

808
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:38,370
or even just from the sheer joy
that comes from risk itself.

809
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,600
Remember my example on
Monday of Ralph Esposito?

810
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:45,180
Why do people become firemen,

811
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,133
policemen,

812
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,070
soldiers,

813
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,240
freedom fighters,

814
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:53,390
all activities that cannot be explained
in terms of self interest alone will not

815
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:56,580
even a Hobbsy in society,

816
00:37:56,581 --> 00:37:57,150
again,

817
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,130
require fire departments.

818
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:03,480
And where will people come from
that if they all follow that?

819
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:09,290
The psychology of fear and self interest
that Hobbes wants to instill in US

820
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,600
Hobbes regards to these passions.

821
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,170
What Plato called by the
word fool most played up,

822
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,890
Hobbes regarded these passions
in many ways is barbaric,

823
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,470
uncivilized and warlike.

824
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:23,700
And to some degree he would,

825
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,563
he was right

826
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:26,520
even though,

827
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,380
but even the HUBZone and state Hobbes
admits himself the hubs and state lives in

828
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:33,150
the midst of a HUBZone and world.

829
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:39,050
That is to say the world of
international relations is four hubs.

830
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,240
The simply the state of nature writ large,

831
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,221
the hubs and,

832
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:49,221
and state will always exist in
a world of hostile other states,

833
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:54,870
unregulated by some kind of higher loss
state stand to one another on the world

834
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:58,780
stage as individuals do in
the condition of nature.

835
00:38:58,781 --> 00:39:03,781
That is to say potential enemies with no
higher authority by which to adjudicate

836
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,560
their conflicts.

837
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,390
And in such a world,

838
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:12,630
even a sovereign state will be endangered
either from other states or from

839
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:17,890
groups and individuals devoted
to terror and destruction.

840
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:18,550
Uh,

841
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,690
think of September 11th,

842
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,470
2001,

843
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:23,890
uh,

844
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:28,890
this is a problem that profound political
scientist by the name of Prs Nair,

845
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,170
uh,

846
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:35,170
a French student of Internet international
politics has described as the

847
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:38,770
dialectic of the bourgeois
and the barbarian.

848
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:44,020
A struggle that is to say between the
modern Hobbsy in state with its largely

849
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:49,021
pacified and satisfied citizen bodies
and those pre modern states or maybe in

850
00:39:51,071 --> 00:39:55,540
some ways even postmodern states that
are prepared to use the instruments of

851
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:56,290
violence,

852
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:00,550
terror and suicide bombings
to achieve their goals.

853
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:00,851
Uh,

854
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:02,050
Hobbsy in state,

855
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:05,170
paradoxically still
requires from its citizens,

856
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:05,890
uh,

857
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:10,890
men and women prepared to fight to risk
everything in the defense of their way

858
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:12,424
of life.

859
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,331
But the hubs,

860
00:40:13,331 --> 00:40:14,020
Ian,

861
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,531
the point,

862
00:40:14,531 --> 00:40:16,340
the paradox being that the hubs,

863
00:40:16,341 --> 00:40:21,341
the and bourgeois cannot entirely
dispense with the barbarian,

864
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:22,810
uh,

865
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,970
even in its own mist mist.

866
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:27,280
Can Hobbs explain this paradox?

867
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,040
He seems to avoided this
problem has been brought out,

868
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,150
I think brilliantly.

869
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:34,810
Uh,

870
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:38,310
in a recent book by a
man named James Bowman,

871
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:38,870
uh,

872
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,560
a book called honor a history,

873
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,540
he wrote a history of honor.

874
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,240
And here he points out that while affairs
of honor is they are quaintly called

875
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,900
have largely disappeared
from advanced societies.

876
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:01,170
That honors still remains a consuming
passion in many parts of the world today,

877
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,950
including for him.

878
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:04,060
Most importantly,

879
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,260
the Middle East

880
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,880
honor in most societies is thought to
be not merely a personal quality like

881
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,010
something like medieval chivalry,

882
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,710
but is above all group honor.

883
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,050
The honor that surrounds the family,

884
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:25,080
the extended clan or the religious sect
and assault on one is an assault on all.

885
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,110
This helps us to explain for instance,

886
00:41:32,111 --> 00:41:33,010
why in so many,

887
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,670
uh,

888
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,820
the concept of saving
face is so important,

889
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,820
even if to most modern Americans,

890
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:42,980
it seems relatively trivial.

891
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,000
Uh,

892
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,790
in one reason Boehm and
believes this is that we,

893
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:50,810
that we have such a difficult time in
understanding other peoples and other

894
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:55,811
cultures is that the very idea of
defending one's honor has largely been

895
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:56,714
devalued.

896
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:57,500
Uh,

897
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,090
in the modern west,

898
00:41:59,470 --> 00:41:59,720
uh,

899
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,370
we tend to look at human behavior as a
matter of providing rational incentives

900
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,200
for human action.

901
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,320
Why most people in fact are driven by a
need for esteem and the desire to avoid

902
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:13,610
humiliation.

903
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,351
I remember,

904
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:16,184
for example,

905
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:20,140
during the Vietnam War when
Richard Nixon spoke about,

906
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:20,880
uh,

907
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,730
achieving peace with honor,

908
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:23,310
uh,

909
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,870
and this was largely marked
as a kind of ludicrous,

910
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:27,320
uh,

911
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,153
idea,

912
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:32,240
honor to so many of us sounds quaint,

913
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:37,270
like an honor code or the boy scouts
a code or something like that,

914
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:38,960
or something primitive,

915
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:40,850
some kind of primitive ethic,

916
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:41,421
uh,

917
00:42:41,421 --> 00:42:44,210
which we therefore
don't really understand.

918
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:44,900
Uh,

919
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,930
we don't often see that
it was in large parts.

920
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,960
Hubs is efforts to
discredit this kind of war.

921
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:53,960
Your virtue,

922
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,360
this kind of virtue of honor.

923
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:56,910
Uh,

924
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,960
that is so a part,

925
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:01,460
so much a part of cultures,

926
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,000
uh,

927
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,491
that is,

928
00:43:02,491 --> 00:43:05,750
is also responsible for
our current blindness.

929
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:11,590
And that brings me to my final point
about our hubs and civilization that

930
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:15,230
conceals from us a very
uncomfortable truth,

931
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:17,690
peace,

932
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:18,523
the peace,

933
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,570
security and safety,

934
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:23,660
what we might call our bourgeois
freedoms that we enjoy.

935
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,730
Rest on the fact,

936
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:30,410
on the uncomfortable fact that there are
people still people who are willing to

937
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:35,411
risk their lives for the sake of
higher goals like honor or duty.

938
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,440
Is that irrational for them to do so?

939
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,920
Hubs would believe it is.

940
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,570
I think he would say yes.

941
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:49,571
It doesn't make sense from a purely Hobbsy
and point of view that encourage us.

942
00:43:49,741 --> 00:43:54,741
It encourages us to think like rational
actors interested mainly in safety and

943
00:43:55,311 --> 00:43:56,390
beating the odds.

944
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,680
Hubs in many ways finds himself in the
position of the young military lawyer

945
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,040
played in the following movie clip.

946
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:07,903
I'm going to show you,

947
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:11,323
okay,

948
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:16,980
this is the point made the point is
made then I will not even provide any

949
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:19,240
further commentary on what I know.

950
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:22,190
I only apologized it for some
reason I couldn't get the picture.
