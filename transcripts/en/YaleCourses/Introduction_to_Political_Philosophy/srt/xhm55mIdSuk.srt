1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,680
Let me start today by asking the question,

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:06,450
what is political philosophy?

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,043
Uh,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,250
custom dictates that I say something
about the subject matter of discourse,

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,240
uh,

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,410
at at its outset.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,340
Uh,

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,340
this in some ways it might seem a case
of putting the cart before the horse or

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,650
the cart before the course may be,

10
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,440
because how can you say,

11
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:31,230
how can we say what
political philosophy is in,

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,520
in advance of,

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,510
of doing it?

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,400
Uh,

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,423
anyway,

16
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,670
let me try to say something
that might be useful.

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,790
In one sense,

18
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,330
you could say political philosophy is
simply a branch or what we call a subfield

19
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,210
of the field of political science.

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,313
Yes.

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,273
Right.

22
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,700
Uh,

23
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,690
it exists alongside of other
areas of political inquiry,

24
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,370
like American government,

25
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,210
comparative politics and
International Relations.

26
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,660
Yet in another sense,

27
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,990
political philosophy is something much
different than simply a sub field.

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,060
It seems to be the oldest and most
fundamental part of political science.

29
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,810
It's purpose is to lay bare as it were,

30
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:23,400
the fundamental problems,

31
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,940
the fundamental concepts and categories
which frame the study of politics in

32
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:31,741
this respect.

33
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:36,741
It seems to me much less like just
a branch of political science.

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,800
Then a foundation of
the entire discipline.

35
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,900
The study of political philosophy,

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,860
uh,

37
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,440
often begins as this course will do.

38
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:54,441
Also with the study of the great books
or some of the great books of our field.

39
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,240
Political philosophy is the oldest of
the social sciences and it can boast a

40
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:07,851
wealth of heavy hitters from Plato
and Aristotle to Machiavelli Hobbs,

41
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,103
Hagle,

42
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:10,890
Tocqueville,

43
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,510
nature and so on.

44
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,610
You might say that the best way to find
out what political philosophy is is

45
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:22,611
simply to study and read the works
of those who have shaped the field.

46
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,203
Yes,

47
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,313
right.

48
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,560
But to do that is I recognize
not without dangers,

49
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:33,090
often severe dangers of its own.

50
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,370
Why study just these
thinkers and not others

51
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,900
isn't any so called list of great thinkers
are great texts like likely to be are

52
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,740
simply arbitrary and to tell us more
about what such a list excludes than what

53
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:54,360
it includes.

54
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,700
Furthermore,

55
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,070
it would seem that the
study of the great books,

56
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,090
great thinkers of the past can easily
degenerate into a kind of antiquarianism

57
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:05,620
into a sort of pedantry.

58
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,790
We find ourselves easily intimidated by
a list of famous names and end up not

59
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,310
thinking for ourselves.

60
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,551
Furthermore,

61
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:19,560
doesn't this study of old books,

62
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,920
often very old box risk overlooking
Lee issues facing us today?

63
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,540
I mean,

64
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,540
what can Aristotle or Hobbs tell us
about the world of globalization,

65
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,190
of terrorism,

66
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,830
of ethnic conflict and the light?

67
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,310
Doesn't political science
make any progress?

68
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:42,720
Uh,

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,620
after all,

70
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,580
uh,

71
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,550
economists no longer read Adam Smith,

72
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,280
I hesitate to,

73
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,430
I don't hesitate to say that a it for
you will never read Adam Smith in a,

74
00:03:56,281 --> 00:03:58,440
in an economics course here at Yale.

75
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,010
And it is very unlikely
that you will read Freud,

76
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,840
uh,

77
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,470
in your psychology classes.

78
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:09,471
So why then does political
science apparently uniquely
among the Social Sciences

79
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,870
continue to study Aristotle,

80
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,280
Locke,

81
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,770
uh,

82
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,600
and other old books.

83
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,910
These are all real questions and I
raised them now myself because they are

84
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:30,791
questions I want you to be thinking
about as you do your reading and,

85
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,293
uh,

86
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,220
work through this course.

87
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,330
I want you to remain alive to
them throughout the semester.

88
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,313
Yes.

89
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,813
Okay.

90
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,481
Uh,

91
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:45,570
one reason I wanted to suggest that we
continue to read these books is not,

92
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,620
not because political science makes no
progress or that we are somehow uniquely

93
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,350
fixated on an ancient pass.

94
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:59,351
But because of these works provide
us with the most basic questions that

95
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:02,000
continue to guide our field.

96
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:07,001
We continue to ask the same
questions that were asked by Plato,

97
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,660
Machiavelli,

98
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,340
Hobbs and others.

99
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:12,620
We may not accept their answers,

100
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,990
and it's very likely that we do not,

101
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:19,991
but their questions are often put with
a kind of an unrivaled clarity and

102
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,034
insight.

103
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,940
The fact is that there are
still people in the world,

104
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,450
many people who regard
themselves as Aristotle,

105
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,220
Ian's Thomas Lock,

106
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,123
eons,

107
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,073
eons,

108
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:35,720
uh,

109
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,720
even the occasional Marxist can still
be found in the Ivy League universities.

110
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,440
These doctrines have not simply been
refuted or replaced or historically

111
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,291
superseded.

112
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,700
They remain in many ways,

113
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:54,500
constitutive of our most
basic outlooks and attitudes.

114
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:58,670
They are very much alive with us today,

115
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,073
right?

116
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,040
So political philosophy is not just some
kind of strange historical appendage to

117
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,061
the,

118
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:08,271
uh,

119
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:11,510
attached to the trunk
of political science.

120
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,790
I just constitutive of
its deepest problems.

121
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,780
If you doubt the importance of the
study of political ideas for politics,

122
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:27,170
consider the works of a famous economist,

123
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,970
John Maynard Keynes.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,960
Everyone's heard of him.

125
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Keynes wrote in 1935 the ideas of
economists and political philosophers both

126
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:39,320
when they are right and
when they are wrong,

127
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,770
I'm more powerful than
is commonly understood.

128
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,410
Practical men,

129
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,970
canes continues practical men who believed
themselves to be quite exempt from

130
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:54,971
any intellectual influences are usually
the slave of some defunct economist.

131
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,810
Madmen in authority who hear voices in
the air are distilling their frenzy from

132
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:07,670
some academic scribbler
of a few years back.

133
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,920
So this course will be devoted to the
study of those academic scribblers who

134
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:17,930
have written books that,

135
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,823
uh,

136
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,980
continue to impress a and
create the forms of authority,

137
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:25,940
uh,

138
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,920
with which we are familiar.

139
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,033
Okay.

140
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,860
But one thing we should not do,

141
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,850
right?

142
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:37,850
One thing we should not do is to approach
these works as if they provide somehow

143
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,220
answers ready made answers
to the problems of today.

144
00:07:41,221 --> 00:07:45,000
Only we can provide
answers to our problems.

145
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:50,001
Rather the great works provide us so to
speak with a repository of fundamental

146
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:55,911
or permanent questions that political
scientists still continue to rely on in

147
00:07:58,351 --> 00:07:59,370
their work.

148
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,260
The great thinkers are great not because
they've created some set of museum

149
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:09,660
pieces that can be catalog,

150
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:14,730
admired and then safely ignored like
a kind of antiquities gallery in the

151
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,513
Metropolitan Museum of art,

152
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,350
but rather because they have defined
the problems that all later thinkers and

153
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:27,351
scholars have had to use in order
to make sense of their world at all.

154
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:27,991
Again,

155
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:32,991
we still think in terms of the basic
concepts and categories that were created

156
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,160
for us long ago.

157
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,413
Okay,

158
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,790
so one thing you will quickly note.

159
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:47,940
Okay,

160
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,261
is it,

161
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,950
there are no permanent answers.

162
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,830
In a study of political philosophy,

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,700
a famous mathematician

164
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,653
once said,

165
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,680
every question must have a
correct answer for every question.

166
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:05,334
One answer.

167
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,010
That itself is an eminently
contestable proposition.

168
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,890
Among the great thinkers,

169
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,340
there is profound disagreement over the
answers to even the most fundamental

170
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:24,981
questions concerning justice concerning
rights concerning liberty in political

171
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:28,194
philosophy.

172
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,270
It has never a sufficient answer to a
request to answer a question with the

173
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:33,750
estate.

174
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,750
With the statement because Plato
says so or because nature says so.

175
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,400
Uh,

176
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,290
there are no final authorities in that
respect in philosophy because even the

177
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:51,291
greatest thinkers disagree profoundly
with one another over their answers.

178
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,960
And it is precisely this disagreement
with one another that makes it possible

179
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:58,254
for us.

180
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,790
The readers today,

181
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,610
to enter into their conversation.

182
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,170
We are called upon first to read and
listen and then to judge who is right.

183
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,460
How do we know?

184
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:20,100
The only way to decide is
not to defer to authority,

185
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,990
whoever's authority,

186
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,480
but to rely on our own powers
of reason and judgment.

187
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,340
In other words,

188
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,340
the freedom of the human mind to
determine for us what seems right or best.

189
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,303
Okay,

190
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,280
but what are these problems
that I'm referring to?

191
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:51,281
What are these problems that constitute
the subject matter of this study of

192
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:52,214
politics?

193
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,410
What are the questions that
political scientists try to answer?

194
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,340
Such a list may be long,

195
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:01,910
but,

196
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,960
but not infinitely.

197
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:07,961
So among the oldest and still most
fundamental questions are what is justice?

198
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,600
What are the goals of a decent society?

199
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,170
How should a citizen be educated?

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,830
Why should I obey the law?

201
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,170
And what are the limits,

202
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,303
if any,

203
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,320
to my obligation?

204
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,450
What constitutes the
ground of human dignity?

205
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,040
Is it freedom?

206
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,540
Is it virtual?

207
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,213
Is it love?

208
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,180
Is it friendship?

209
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,930
And of course the all important question.

210
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:47,090
Even though political philosophers and
political scientists rarely pronounce it,

211
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,000
namely quid sit dios.

212
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,300
What has God does he exist and what does
that imply for our obligations as human

213
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:59,920
beings and citizens?

214
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:05,740
Those are some of the most basic and
fundamental problems of the study of

215
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:06,341
politics,

216
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:07,390
but you might say,

217
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:07,720
where did,

218
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,310
where does one enter this debate?

219
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Which questions in which thinkers
should one pick up for oneself?

220
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,720
Perhaps the oldest and most fundamental
question that I wish to examine in the

221
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:26,710
course of this semester is the question,

222
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:27,850
what is a regime?

223
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,510
What are regimes?

224
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,360
What are regime politics?

225
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,690
The term regime is a familiar one.

226
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,620
We often hear today about shaping
regimes or about changing regimes,

227
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,580
but what is a regime?

228
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,190
How many kinds are there?

229
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,620
How are they defined?

230
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,270
What holds them together and
what causes them to fall apart?

231
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,390
Is there a single best regime?

232
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,230
Those are the questions
I want us to consider.

233
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,520
The concept of the regime is perhaps
the oldest and most fundamental of

234
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,550
political ideas.

235
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:12,010
It goes back to Plato and even before him.

236
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:13,901
In fact,

237
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:17,860
the title of the book that you will
be reading Pardot for this semester,

238
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:21,910
Plato's Republic is
actually a translation.

239
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,870
The title of it,

240
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,640
of the Greek word polar,

241
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:25,474
a Taya,

242
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,960
that means constitution or regime.

243
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,160
The Republic is a book about the regime
and all later political philosophy.

244
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,640
It's a series of footnotes to Plato and
that means that it must provide a series

245
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:43,330
of variations,

246
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,560
so to speak,

247
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,100
on Plato's conception of the best regime,

248
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,120
but what is a regime?

249
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,140
Broadly speaking,

250
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,350
the regime indicates a form of government,

251
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,990
whether it is ruled by the one,

252
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,213
the feel,

253
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,463
the many,

254
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,490
or is more common,

255
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:07,720
some mixture or a combination
of these three ruling powers.

256
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,630
The regime is defined in
the first instance by how
are people are governed and

257
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:18,190
how public offices are
distributed by election,

258
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,103
by birth,

259
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:21,963
by lot,

260
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,200
by outstanding personal personal
qualities and achievements,

261
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,330
and what constitutes that people's
rights and responsibilities.

262
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,550
The regime regime again refers
above all to a form of government.

263
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:43,020
The political world does not present
itself as simply an infinite variety of

264
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:45,160
different shapes.

265
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:50,190
It is structured and ordered into
a few basic regime types and this,

266
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:56,861
I take it to be one of the most important
propositions and insights of political

267
00:14:57,741 --> 00:14:58,574
science,

268
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,210
right so far,

269
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,700
but there is a corollary to this insight.

270
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,320
The regime is always something particular.

271
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,610
It stands interrelation of opposition
to other regime types and as a

272
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:23,710
consequence,

273
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,340
the possibility of conflict of tension
and war is built in to the very structure

274
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,640
of politics.

275
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,000
Regimes are necessarily partisan.

276
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,120
That is to say they install certain
loyalties in passions in the same way that

277
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:43,900
one may feel.

278
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:48,400
Partisanship to the New York
Yankees or the Boston red sox.

279
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,510
What?

280
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:54,510
Yale overall rival
colleges and institutions,

281
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,503
right?

282
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,310
Fierce loyalty,

283
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,443
partisanship.

284
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,620
It's inseparable from the
character of regime politics.

285
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:06,880
These passionate attachments are not
merely something that take place,

286
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,460
you might say between different regimes,

287
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:14,461
but even within them is different
parties and groups with loyalties and

288
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,400
detachments contend for power,

289
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,550
for honor and for interest.

290
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,320
Henry Adams once cynically reflected that
politics is simply the organization of

291
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:29,914
hatreds

292
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,330
and there is more than a
grain of truth to this.

293
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,093
Right.

294
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,800
Although he did not say that.

295
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:44,801
It is also attempt and attempt to
channel and redirect those hatreds and

296
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:48,860
animosities towards
something like a common good.

297
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,390
This raises a question.

298
00:16:50,391 --> 00:16:55,391
Is it possible to transform politics to
replace enmity and factional conflict

299
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:02,981
with friendship to replace
conflict with harmony

300
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,790
today is it is the hope of many people
both here and abroad that we might even

301
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:10,700
overcome,

302
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,780
might even transcend the basic structure
of regime politics altogether and

303
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:22,151
organize our world around global norms
of justice and international law.

304
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,670
It is such a thing possible.

305
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,340
It can't be ruled out,

306
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,230
but such a world I would note that
is to say a world administered by

307
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:38,231
international courts of law by judges
and judicial tribunals would no longer be

308
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:41,510
a political world.

309
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,710
Politics only takes place within
the context of the particular,

310
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,070
it is only

311
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,000
possible within the structure
of the regime itself,

312
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,500
but the regime is more than simply
a set of formal principal of formal

313
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,690
structures and institutions.

314
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,673
Okay.

315
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,160
It consists of the entire way of life,

316
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,490
the moral and religious practices,

317
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,324
the habits,

318
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,440
customs and sentiments that
make people what they are.

319
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,880
The regime constitutes an ethos that
is to say distinctive character that

320
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:26,880
nurtures distinctive human types.

321
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,440
Every regime shapes a common character,

322
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,820
a common character type with
distinctive traits and qualities.

323
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:41,540
So the study of regime politics is in
part a study of the distinctive national

324
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,810
character types that
constitutes a citizen body.

325
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,680
To take an example of
what I mean when talk,

326
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:54,681
they'll study the American regime or the
democratic regime properly speaking and

327
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:56,070
democracy in America.

328
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,080
He started first with our formal political
institutions is enumerated in the

329
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:01,980
constitution,

330
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:04,170
such things as the separation of powers,

331
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,800
the division between state and
federal government and so on,

332
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,370
but then went on to look at such informal
practices as American manners and

333
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:14,484
morals.

334
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,170
Our tendency to form small
civic associations are peculiar,

335
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,200
moralism and religious life or
defensiveness about democracy and so on.

336
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,900
All of these intellectual and moral
customs and habits help to constitute the

337
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,720
democratic regime.

338
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:34,890
This regime,

339
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,641
in this sense,

340
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:40,641
the regime describes the
character or tone of a society.

341
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,330
What a society finds most praiseworthy,

342
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,120
what it looks up to.

343
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,890
Okay.

344
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:54,890
You can't understand a regime
unless you understand so to speak,

345
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:56,430
what it stands for,

346
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,500
what a people stand for,

347
00:19:58,501 --> 00:19:59,130
what they,

348
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,330
what they look up to

349
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,840
as well as its,

350
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:03,231
again,

351
00:20:03,231 --> 00:20:08,000
its structure of institutions
and rights and privileges.

352
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,030
This raises a further set of questions
that we will consider over the term how,

353
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:21,230
how our regimes founded
the founding of regimes,

354
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,190
what brings them into being
and sustains them over time.

355
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,800
For thinkers like Tocqueville for example,

356
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:31,970
regimes are embedded
in the deep structures,

357
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,260
uh,

358
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:37,260
of human history that have determined
over long centuries the shape of our

359
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:39,950
political institutions and
the way we think about them.

360
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,460
Yet other voices within the tradition,

361
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,210
Plato,

362
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,110
Machiavelli,

363
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,400
who sell come to mind believe that
regimes can be self consciously founded

364
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:55,530
through deliberate act of great statesman
or founding fathers as we might call

365
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:57,364
them.

366
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,960
The statesmen.

367
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,580
Machiavelli for example,

368
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:02,560
refers to Romulus Moses.

369
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,730
Cyrus is the founders that he looks too,

370
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:09,160
we might think of men like Washington,

371
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,280
Jefferson Adams and the like are
shapers of peoples and institutions.

372
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,500
The very first of the federalist papers
by Alexander Hamilton even begins by

373
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:22,960
posing this question
and its starkest terms.

374
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,290
It has been frequently remarked,

375
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,790
Hamilton writes,

376
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:28,721
did.

377
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:32,170
It seems to have been reserved to the
people of this country by their conduct

378
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:37,171
and example to decide the
important question whether
societies of men are really

379
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:43,021
capable or not of establishing good
government from reflection and choice or

380
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:48,850
whether they are forever
destined to depend for their
political constitutions on

381
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:50,440
accident and force.

382
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:56,550
There we see Hamilton asking the basic
question about the founding of political

383
00:21:57,431 --> 00:21:58,270
institutions.

384
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,050
Are they created as he as he
puts it by reflection and choice.

385
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,080
That is to say by a deliberate act
of state craft and in conscious human

386
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:12,511
intelligence or our regimes
always the product of accident,

387
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,720
circumstance,

388
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,540
custom and history.

389
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,893
Yeah,

390
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:24,990
but the idea that regimes may be created
or founded by a set of deliberate act

391
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,140
raises a further question that we will
study and is inseparable from the study

392
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:34,930
of regimes as pie.

393
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,020
Okay.

394
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,040
Who was a statesman?

395
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,350
What does a statesman,

396
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:43,820
again,

397
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,820
one of the oldest questions of political
science very rarely asked by the

398
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:54,281
political science of today that is
very skeptical of the language of

399
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,370
statesmanship

400
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,180
and its oldest sense.

401
00:22:58,181 --> 00:23:02,200
Political science simply
was a science of statecraft.

402
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,740
It was addressed just statesmen
or potential statesmen
charged with steering the

403
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:09,940
ship of state.

404
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,280
What are the qualities necessary
for sound statesmanship?

405
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:20,170
How does statecraft differ
from other kinds of activities?

406
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,620
Must have good statesmen
as Plato believed,

407
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,731
for example,

408
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:28,180
be a philosopher versed in poetry,

409
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,670
mathematics and metaphysics,

410
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,720
or the statesmanship as Aristotle believed
a purely practical skill requiring

411
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,010
judgment based on
deliberation and experience.

412
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,140
It's a streak of cruelty and a
willingness to act immorally necessary for

413
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,793
statecraft.

414
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,780
As Machiavelli infamously argued,

415
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:03,130
was the statesman be capable of literally
transforming human nature as Roussel

416
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:10,481
maintains or is the sovereign a more or
less faceless bureaucrat in the manner

417
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:14,750
of a modern,

418
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:16,760
say a modern CEO,

419
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,540
uh,

420
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,680
as for example,

421
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:23,681
someone like Hobbs seems to have believed
all of our texts that we will read the

422
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:24,711
republic,

423
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:25,521
the politics,

424
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:26,031
the prince,

425
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:31,031
the social contract have different
views on the qualities of statecraft.

426
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,260
And what it is,

427
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,540
what,

428
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,370
what those qualities necessary to
found and maintain states that we will,

429
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,480
we will be considering

430
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:45,530
all of this in a way is another
way of saying or at least implying,

431
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,483
okay,

432
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:51,800
that political philosophy is an
imminently practical discipline.

433
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,120
A practical field.

434
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,680
It's purpose is not simply contemplation.

435
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,950
It's purpose is not reflection alone.

436
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,270
It is advice giving all of the peat,

437
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,133
none of that.

438
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:11,230
None of the people we will study this
semester were cloistered scholars detached

439
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:12,741
from the world.

440
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:17,741
Although this is a very common prejudice
against political philosophy that it is

441
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:23,531
somehow a uniquely sort of pie in the
sky and and detached from the world.

442
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,510
But the great thinkers,

443
00:25:26,511 --> 00:25:31,511
we're very far from being just sort
of speak detached intellectuals.

444
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,880
Plato undertook three long and dangerous
voyages to Sicily in order to advise

445
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,620
the king guy in ics.

446
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Aristotle famously was a tutor of
Alexander the Great Machiavelli,

447
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:54,410
spent a large part of his career in the
foreign service of his native Florence

448
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,630
and wrote as an advisor to the medic.

449
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:04,150
Hobbes was the tutor to a royal household
who followed the king into exile

450
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:10,510
during the English civil war and lock was
associated with the Shaftsbury circle,

451
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,870
who also was forced into exile after
being accused of plotting against the

452
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:19,334
English gain.

453
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,170
Russo had no official
political connections,

454
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:28,250
but he signed his name
always John Jacques Rousseau,

455
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:30,170
citizen of Geneva,

456
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,540
and was approached to write constitutions
for Poland and for the island of

457
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:36,374
Corsica.

458
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,800
And Tocqueville was a,

459
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:42,230
was a member of the French National
Assembly whose experience of American

460
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:47,010
democracy deeply affected the
way he saw the future of Europe.

461
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,890
So the great political thinkers,

462
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:55,070
we're typically engaged in the politics
of their times and help in that way to

463
00:26:55,411 --> 00:27:00,411
provide us okay with models for
how we might think about ours.

464
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,553
Okay.

465
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,080
A little break for refreshment.

466
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,653
Okay.

467
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,610
But this goes in a slightly
different direction as well.

468
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:30,270
Not only is this study of the regime
is we've seen as I've just tried to

469
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:35,281
indicate rooted in in many
ways the practical experience
of the thinkers will be

470
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:36,641
looking at,

471
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:41,641
but the study of regime politics either
implicitly or explicitly raises a

472
00:27:43,391 --> 00:27:47,260
question that goes beyond
the boundary of any,

473
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,580
any given society

474
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:50,841
regime,

475
00:27:50,841 --> 00:27:51,471
as I've said,

476
00:27:51,471 --> 00:27:53,990
constitutes a people's way of life.

477
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:59,020
What they believe makes their life worth
living or to put it against slightly

478
00:27:59,451 --> 00:28:02,000
different what people stand for.

479
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,300
Yeah.

480
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:09,300
Although we are most familiar with the
character of a modern democratic regimes

481
00:28:10,371 --> 00:28:11,204
such as ours.

482
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,160
This study of political philosophy is in
many ways a kind of immersion into what

483
00:28:17,651 --> 00:28:19,810
we might call today comparative politics.

484
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:20,644
That is just a,

485
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,680
it opens up to us the variety of regimes
each with its own distinctive set of

486
00:28:26,711 --> 00:28:28,270
claims or principals,

487
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:33,280
each vying and potentially in
conflict with all the others.

488
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,293
Okay.

489
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:39,040
Underlying this cacophony of
regimes is the question always,

490
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,860
which of these regimes is best?

491
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:48,890
What has or ought to have a claim
on our loyalty and rational consent?

492
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,940
Political philosophy is always guided
by the question of the best regime,

493
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:02,570
but what is the best regime even to
raise a central question seems to pose in

494
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,280
Superbowl obstacles,

495
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:10,080
isn't that you're completely
subjective judgment.

496
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,050
What one thinks is the best regime.

497
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:16,260
How could one begin such a study

498
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:22,620
is the best regime as the
ancients tended to believe,

499
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,540
I know Aristotle and others,

500
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:30,350
is it or is it an aristocratic republic
in which only the few best habitually

501
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:34,290
rule or is the best regime?

502
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:37,440
As the moderns believe
a democratic republic,

503
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,400
we're in principle,

504
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:43,401
political office is open to our by virtue
of their membership in society alone,

505
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:52,140
will the best regime be a small closed
society that through generations has made

506
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,820
a supreme sacrifice
toward self perfection?

507
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,673
Think of that

508
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:07,010
or will the best regime be a large
cosmopolitan order embracing all human

509
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:08,724
beings,

510
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,760
perhaps even a kind of universal league
of nations consisting of are free and

511
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:16,710
equal men and women.

512
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,410
Whatever form the best regime takes,

513
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,273
however,

514
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,760
it will always favor a certain kind
of human being with a certain set of

515
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:32,861
character traits is that type the
common man is found in democracies.

516
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:40,180
Those of acquired taste and money is in
aristocracies the warrior or even the

517
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:45,500
priest is in theocracies.

518
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:46,790
No,

519
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,730
no question that I can think
of can be more fundamental.

520
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:56,470
And this finally raises the question of
the relation between the best regime or

521
00:30:56,661 --> 00:31:01,661
the good regime and what we could
say are actually existing regimes,

522
00:31:01,731 --> 00:31:03,590
regimes that we are all familiar with.

523
00:31:03,591 --> 00:31:08,150
What function does the best
regime play in political science?

524
00:31:08,151 --> 00:31:13,151
How does it guide our actions here and
now this issue re received a kind of

525
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:19,901
classic formulation in
Aristotle's distinction of
what he called the good human

526
00:31:20,391 --> 00:31:22,310
being and the good citizen

527
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,010
for the good citizen.

528
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,340
You will read this chapter later on
in the politics for the good citizen.

529
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:33,340
You could say patriotism is enough to
uphold and defend the laws of your own

530
00:31:35,331 --> 00:31:40,331
country simply because they are your
own is both necessary and sufficient.

531
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:48,500
Such a view of citizen virtue runs into
the obvious objection that the good

532
00:31:48,501 --> 00:31:53,501
citizen of one regime will be at odds
with the good citizen of another.

533
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:58,901
A good citizen of contemporary Iran will
not be the same as the good citizen of

534
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,060
Contemporary America.

535
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:08,060
But the good citizen Aristotle goes on
to say is not the same as the good human

536
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,013
being,

537
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,093
right?

538
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,850
Or the good citizen is
relative to the regime.

539
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:16,190
You might say regime specific,

540
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,140
the good human being.

541
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,720
So he believes is good everywhere.

542
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,170
The good human being loves what is good,

543
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:25,100
simply not,

544
00:32:25,101 --> 00:32:27,110
not because it is his own,

545
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,570
but because it is good.

546
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:35,860
Some sense of this was demonstrated in
Abraham Lincoln's judgment about Henry.

547
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,280
Uh,

548
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,113
in early,

549
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,260
uh,

550
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,840
idol of Lincoln's clay wrote,

551
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,170
uh,

552
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,550
Lincoln Road of clay.

553
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,770
He loved his country.

554
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,680
He said partly because
it was his own country,

555
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,650
partly because it was his own country,

556
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,310
but mainly because it was a free country.

557
00:32:59,380 --> 00:32:59,780
Uh,

558
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,780
his point I think is that clay exhibited
at least on Lincoln's telling something

559
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:07,490
of the philosopher.

560
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:09,440
What he loved was an idea,

561
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,390
the idea of freedom.

562
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:16,730
That idea was not the property
of one particular country,

563
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,570
but it was constitute of,

564
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,740
of any good society.

565
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,500
The good human being it would seem,

566
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:30,850
would be a philosopher or at least would
have something philosophical about him

567
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:36,380
or her and who may only be fully
at home in the best regime.

568
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,740
But of course the best regime,

569
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,810
laxed actuality,

570
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,200
we all know that it has never existed.

571
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,110
Okay.

572
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,010
Best regime embodies a supreme paradox.

573
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:54,950
It would seem it is
superior in some ways too,

574
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:56,330
all actual regimes,

575
00:33:56,331 --> 00:34:00,020
but it has no concrete existence anywhere.

576
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:01,340
This makes it difficult.

577
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:02,721
You could say,

578
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:04,610
and this is Aristotle's point,

579
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I think this makes it difficult for the
philosopher to be a good citizen of any

580
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,620
actual regime.

581
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:18,310
Philosophy will never feel fully or
truly at home in any particular society.

582
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:26,080
The philosopher can never be truly
loyal to any one or any thing,

583
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,540
but what is best?

584
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,250
Think of that.

585
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,460
Okay.

586
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,250
Raises a question about issues of love,

587
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,870
loyalty and friendship.

588
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,430
This tension of course,

589
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:48,431
between the best regime in any actual
regime is the space that makes political

590
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:52,460
philosophy possible.

591
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,680
In the best regime.

592
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,920
If we were to inhabit such a political
philosophy would be unnecessary or

593
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:01,994
redundant,

594
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,490
it would wither away.

595
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:11,750
Political philosophy exists and
only exists in that call it zone of

596
00:35:13,741 --> 00:35:18,741
indeterminacy between the is and the
art between the actual and the ideal.

597
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:28,190
This is why political philosophy is
always in necessarily a potentially

598
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:31,020
disturbing undertaking.

599
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:37,550
Those who embark on the
quest for knowledge of the
best regime may not return

600
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:42,090
the same people that they were before.

601
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:50,020
You may return with very
different loyalties and
allegiances than you had in the

602
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:52,244
beginning,

603
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,930
but there is some compensation for this.

604
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:01,610
I think the ancients had a beautiful word,

605
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:05,300
or at least the Greeks had a
beautiful word for this quest,

606
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:06,470
for this desire,

607
00:36:06,471 --> 00:36:11,471
for knowledge of the best regime
they called it arrows or love,

608
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:16,723
right?

609
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,900
The quest for knowledge of the best
regime must necessarily be accompanied,

610
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,580
sustained,

611
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,070
and elevated by arrows.

612
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:34,040
You may not have realized it when
you walked into this class today,

613
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,250
but the study of political philosophy,

614
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,410
maybe the highest tribute,

615
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,820
we pay to love.

616
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,833
Think of them,

617
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,540
and while you're thinking about it,

618
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:51,500
you can start reading
Plato's apology for Socrates,

619
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,620
which we'll discuss
for class on Wednesday.

620
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,413
Okay.

621
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,700
It's nice to see you back and have a
very good but thoughtful September 11th.
