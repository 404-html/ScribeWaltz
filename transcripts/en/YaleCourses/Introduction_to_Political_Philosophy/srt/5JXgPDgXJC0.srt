1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:01,920
Uh,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,161
well,

3
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:02,401
good,

4
00:00:02,401 --> 00:00:02,680
good.

5
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,000
It's,

6
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,850
it's so nice to see you
again on this gorgeous,

7
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,620
gorgeous autumn day.

8
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,230
And we had a wonderful,

9
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:11,190
wonderful weekend.

10
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:12,024
Didn't win.

11
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:13,650
Yes,

12
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,483
we did.

13
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,720
Uh,

14
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,320
okay.

15
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,153
Today

16
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,710
I want us to begin.

17
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:23,670
We move ahead.

18
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,930
We're moving ahead.

19
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,300
Today we begin with Mr John Locke.

20
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,090
Put the next three classes,

21
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,953
Mr. Lock.

22
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,330
It is hard to believe that a little
book like this in this not terribly

23
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:44,340
distinguished addition mind you,

24
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:47,940
but nevertheless in this edition of
just pissed over a hundred pages,

25
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,990
did a book of this length could
have such world shaping effects.

26
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,070
If anyone would ever doubt
the importance of ideas,

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,040
political ideas in history.

28
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,210
Uh,

29
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,210
I would only say to you to consult the
history and the influence of John Locke.

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,450
A remarkable,

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,561
uh,

32
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:19,350
I want to talk today a
little bit about Mr Locke.

33
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,810
John Locke is for our purposes today.

34
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:25,051
I mean,

35
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,050
there are many reasons
why one would read him in,

36
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:28,381
in,

37
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,420
in different kinds of classes.

38
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,280
But for our purposes,

39
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,450
uh,

40
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,030
John Locke gives the modern state,

41
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,170
uh,

42
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,200
the expression that is
most familiar to us.

43
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:41,670
Uh,

44
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,670
his writings seem to have been so
completely absorbed and adopted by Thomas

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Jefferson when he wrote the
declaration of independence.

46
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,780
That lock seems to have
become virtually a,

47
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,360
a kind of honorary,

48
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,920
a founding father,

49
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,810
as it were of,

50
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,653
of America.

51
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,040
Uh,

52
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,330
among other things,

53
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,260
uh,

54
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,970
John Locke advocates,

55
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,300
the natural liberty and equality of
human beings are natural rights to such

56
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,960
things as life,

57
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,883
liberty,

58
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,680
and what he calls estate or property.

59
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,570
Uh,

60
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,140
the idea that government,

61
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,470
at least legitimate government
is government by consent.

62
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:26,790
Uh,

63
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,090
that legitimate government
is necessarily limited,

64
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,240
uh,

65
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,680
in,

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:31,890
uh,

67
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,420
limited government constituted
by a separation of powers.

68
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,700
And that when governments become
repressive or that when governments become

69
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:44,340
abusive of natural rights,

70
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:44,880
uh,

71
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,670
that the people have
a right to revolution.

72
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,240
Uh,

73
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,230
in addition to this,

74
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:50,064
John Locke,

75
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,300
a,

76
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,330
it was a famous,

77
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:51,611
uh,

78
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:53,820
advocate of religious toleration.

79
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,631
Uh,

80
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:59,631
his name is forever linked with our
ideas today of what we might call liberal

81
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:01,600
or,

82
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,610
or constitutional democracy.

83
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,630
He gives the modern constitutional state.

84
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,261
It's,

85
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:08,651
again,

86
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:10,750
it's definitive and in many ways,

87
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:12,880
most familiar expression.

88
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,683
Yeah,

89
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,360
lock did not arise.

90
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:23,830
X Nilo is nor did anyone.

91
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,220
Locke's writings come from some
somewhere and from some source.

92
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,280
They were prepared in many ways in
part by Machiavelli who had died

93
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,150
approximately a century before locks,

94
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:38,984
birth,

95
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,440
but more importantly by another English
writer or by an English writer with whom

96
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:46,250
we have spent some time.

97
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:48,170
Namely Mr. Hobbs.

98
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,063
Thomas Hobbes,

99
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,170
Hobbes Tuck,

100
00:03:51,171 --> 00:03:56,171
Machiavelli's idea of the prince and
in effect turned it into a theory or

101
00:03:57,981 --> 00:03:59,390
doctrine of sovereignty.

102
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,221
The Hobbs,

103
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:02,360
he in sovereign,

104
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,980
is it the basis of our,

105
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,010
of our idea?

106
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:09,200
Is it impersonal or what we might
call representative government?

107
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,100
Uh,

108
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,470
he transforms princely rule.

109
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,040
Hobbes does into an office into,

110
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,000
uh,

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,420
an,

112
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:17,810
uh,

113
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,430
an an office call.

114
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:23,990
The sovereign and this
office is for Hobbes.

115
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:28,991
The creation of a social contract or
covenant is he calls it responsible to the

116
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:33,740
agents or persons who
have created the contract.

117
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,810
Hobbes had taught that the sovereign is
representative of the people who create

118
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,660
his office in order to ensure peace,

119
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,793
justice,

120
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,663
and order.

121
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,340
Without the power of the sovereign,

122
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,580
we would find ourselves
in a condition of nature,

123
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,210
a state of nature term coined by hubs
to indicate a world without civil

124
00:04:56,271 --> 00:05:00,470
authority or at least with
only week civil authority,

125
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,280
unable to enforce common rules and laws.

126
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:08,450
Hobbs gave voice to the
doctrine of secular absolutism,

127
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:14,230
one that invests the sovereign with
absolute power to do whatever is necessary

128
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,940
to ensure again,

129
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,200
the rule of law,

130
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,720
justice and political stability.

131
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,110
And out of these rather harsh,

132
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,010
uh,

133
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,630
and formidable premises,

134
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,350
uh,

135
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,790
lock created,

136
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,630
uh,

137
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,740
a different,

138
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,011
uh,

139
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:35,600
what we wouldn't meet think of is a more
liberal constitutional theory of the

140
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:36,434
state.

141
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,493
Okay.

142
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,791
Why?

143
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:43,791
Being still in many ways very dependent
on the premises that that hubs again,

144
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:46,770
modifying Machiavelli had,

145
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,090
had undertaken

146
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,240
lock,

147
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,050
set out a process of domestication.

148
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,160
He set out,

149
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:03,161
he set out to tame or to domesticate
Hobbes is fierce or harsh theory of

150
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:07,010
absolute government,

151
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,330
which had found few
defenders in his own day,

152
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,620
uh,

153
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,071
locks.

154
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,590
Most important book political,

155
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,780
at least his most important
work of political theory
of political philosophy is

156
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,880
his two treatises of civil government,

157
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,170
of which we are only reading the second
the book we have before us is called

158
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:32,780
this often simply referred
to as the second treatise.

159
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,990
But you will probably have suspected,

160
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,560
I think that the second treatise
was proceeded by a first treat us.

161
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:48,350
The first treatise is much longer
than the second treatise and it was an

162
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:53,351
elaborate and painstaking one could
almost say deconstruction of the theory of

163
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,590
the divine right of kings,

164
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,720
which in his era,

165
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:00,800
uh,

166
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,800
had received a expression by a man
named Robert filmer whose name appears.

167
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:11,480
I think occasionally in the second
treatise filmer had written a book called

168
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,380
Patriarchy.

169
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,820
And the Patriarchy had argued that,

170
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,450
uh,

171
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:22,450
all political authority derives from the
grant of authority that God had given

172
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:26,084
to Adam.

173
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,510
And therefore that all legitimate
authority has divine right behind it.

174
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,840
Locks first treatise is a very important,

175
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,410
but also I have to say extremely tedious
work and you should be grateful that I

176
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:44,810
am not assigning it to,

177
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,860
but it's at a very interesting
book in its own right of,

178
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,400
of in many ways biblical
criticism and exposition.

179
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,710
But it's only in the second treatise,

180
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:55,730
uh,

181
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,530
that locks set out to,

182
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,280
uh,

183
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,610
set out his own positive
theory of government.

184
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:04,040
Is it worth this book was written.

185
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:04,740
Uh,

186
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,740
we now believe shortly before the famous
wig revolution of 1,688 and in a lock

187
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:17,921
sets out his theory of a parliamentary
supremacy rule of law and constitutional

188
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:22,760
government lock was,

189
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,480
I mean,

190
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,480
to put it maybe slightly oddly
lock was in his day to some degree,

191
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,990
what Aristotle was to his,

192
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,910
the second treatise is
intended as a practical book.

193
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,900
Uh,

194
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,900
it was a book addressed not so much
to the philosophers of his age,

195
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:49,210
but to Englishman written to them in
the everyday language of their time.

196
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,481
Uh,

197
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:57,990
he wrote to capture in a way
the common sense of his time.

198
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,430
Uh,

199
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,430
although this is not to say lock was not
at the same time a deeply controversy,

200
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,450
we'll figure lock had the
ability and it's a very,

201
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,343
uh,

202
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,710
desirable ability to take in many ways
radical or even revolutionary ideas and

203
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:22,251
express them in a kind of language that
makes people believe that this is what

204
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:24,660
they had thought all along.

205
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,190
And that is to some degree the
genius of the second treatise.

206
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,240
Uh,

207
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,240
in many ways that is it easier for
easier for us because locks language has

208
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:36,661
become,

209
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:38,670
for us the kind of,

210
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:43,620
I would almost take common sense or
shorthand language for the way we think

211
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,240
about politics.

212
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,261
And it was again,

213
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:46,680
his,

214
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,680
a mark of his genius to be able to create
that language and give it a stamp that

215
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:57,600
seemed to make people believe that this
is what they had simply been thinking

216
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:58,434
all along.

217
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,980
Lock was himself a deeply political man,

218
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,660
but he was also at the same
time as I've just been hinting,

219
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,580
perhaps a very reticent one.

220
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:09,750
Uh,

221
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,360
he lived in a period of intense,

222
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,960
uh,

223
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,120
religious and political conflict.

224
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,231
Uh,

225
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:17,880
he was just a boy,

226
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,220
a school in school.

227
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,380
When a King Charles the first,

228
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:22,950
uh,

229
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,680
was executed and he was an adult.

230
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,320
When another King James the second,

231
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:28,800
uh,

232
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,100
was overthrown and forced into exile,

233
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,170
a lock lived.

234
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:34,441
I mean,

235
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:35,250
he was a container,

236
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,320
a younger contemporary of Hobbs,

237
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:42,321
but he lived in a period of immense civil
conflict and war lock spent many years

238
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:49,371
at Oxford where he was both a student
and a fellow and he was suspected,

239
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:50,910
uh,

240
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,680
throughout much of his time there of
harboring a radical political sympathies,

241
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,280
but he was so cautious and
careful and expressing them.

242
00:10:59,281 --> 00:10:59,431
They,

243
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:00,810
after many years,

244
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,760
even those closest to him,

245
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,073
uh,

246
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,140
we're unclear as to
what his opinions were.

247
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:12,141
The master of locks own residential
college at Oxford Bailey all college

248
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,610
described Mr Lock as the master of tasks.

249
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,463
Aternity.

250
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:18,620
Okay.

251
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:18,830
Um,

252
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,580
master of tasked Aternity
because he could not discover,

253
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,390
uh,

254
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,250
through questioning and so on.

255
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:25,880
Locks,

256
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,301
locks,

257
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:29,360
opinions on religious
and political matters.

258
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,301
Just think of that.

259
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:35,620
There used to be a very wonderful bust of,

260
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,503
of lock,

261
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,430
uh,

262
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,821
in the,

263
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:40,640
in the lobby of the British arts centre.

264
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:46,100
And I used to recommend to students when
they were down in that part of campus

265
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:51,101
to stop in and look at his look at his
face because as with Machiavelli or

266
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,590
there's the face is very revealing.

267
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,580
A,

268
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,890
and I used to ask people to see,

269
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:57,370
do you,

270
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,140
do you detect in here the sense of tat,

271
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,050
the master of tasks to eternity?

272
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:02,950
That was so,

273
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,730
uh,

274
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,730
that is that his college
master ahead and disgust lock,

275
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,030
uh,

276
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,030
was a private secretary in a physician
to a man named Anthony Ashley Cooper.

277
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,530
Uh,

278
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,340
later,

279
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,850
uh,

280
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,680
known as large Shaftsbury.

281
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,260
Uh,

282
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,610
Shaftsbury had a circle,

283
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,350
the Shaftsbury circle of,

284
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,410
of political followers who were opponents
of the monarchy and who were forced

285
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:38,500
into exile in 1683 lock
followed them into exile.

286
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,300
He spent several years in Holland,

287
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,380
uh,

288
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:46,380
in 1683 before returning to England
again shortly before the wid revolution

289
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:48,970
where his book,

290
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,390
uh,

291
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:54,390
the second treatise was published and
where he lived until his death in 1704,

292
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,630
just two years ago.

293
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,440
In fact,

294
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,910
Yale at the Beinecke library
held a major conference,

295
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:04,570
uh,

296
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,570
in commemoration of the 300th
anniversary of the death of Mr Lock.

297
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,200
So those are a few things about
his contributions and his context.

298
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:17,860
I want to begin today,

299
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:18,461
uh,

300
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:23,461
the substantive part of this talk by
focusing on the theme that in many ways

301
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:28,420
forms the central core of locks,

302
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,890
a political doctrine,

303
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:31,480
his theory of natural law.

304
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,260
This is a term that has
come up from time to time.

305
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,270
There is no modern thinker,

306
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,500
uh,

307
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,220
that I'm aware of who makes a natural law,

308
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,620
is important to his doctrine.

309
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,220
Uh,

310
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,240
as does lock.

311
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:52,530
The best way to observe the working or
to reconstruct the working of natural law

312
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,480
is to follow a procedure
that we have seen before.

313
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,440
To think about what is
the condition of nature,

314
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,610
the state of nature,

315
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,170
where we can see the natural
law in its operative form.

316
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:14,570
The state of nature before lock in many
ways as for Hobbs is not a condition of

317
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,020
ruling and being ruled
as it is for Aristotle.

318
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,810
The state of nature is
not a political condition.

319
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,550
Lock describes the state of nature
is a condition of perfect freedom.

320
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:31,821
Well,

321
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:34,520
Aristotle said that we were by nature,

322
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:36,380
members of a family,

323
00:14:36,381 --> 00:14:37,214
a Polis,

324
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,700
a moral community of some kind,

325
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:45,550
bound by ties of civic
or family obligation lock
understands by the state of

326
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:52,481
nature a condition without civil
authority or civil obligations.

327
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,820
The state of nature is not for
him and historical condition,

328
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,020
although he does,

329
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,390
uh,

330
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,460
occasionally,

331
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:01,820
uh,

332
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,420
right referred to uh,

333
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,310
the vast tracts of North America as,

334
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:07,640
uh,

335
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,600
suggesting,

336
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,100
uh,

337
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,270
W I a condition of nature,

338
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:14,480
but the state of nature is a
kind of thought experiment.

339
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,760
What is human nature like?

340
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:17,510
Uh,

341
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,550
in the absence of authority,

342
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,060
the state of nature,

343
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:31,090
Locke suggests to us is not in a
moral condition as it was for Hobbes.

344
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:37,670
It is not simply a condition of war of
all against all the state of nature.

345
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,310
He tells us,

346
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,460
isn't in fact a moral condition.

347
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:46,090
It is governed by a moral law or a
natural law that dictates piece and socio

348
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,143
ability.

349
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,540
There is a moral law of nature that
determines that no one should harm another

350
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,120
person in their life,

351
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,860
liberty or possessions.

352
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,210
This law,

353
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,550
this natural law lock
affirms Willis Willis,

354
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:06,890
the piece in preservation of all mankind.

355
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,390
So the natural condition
for Loc is a moral state,

356
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:15,590
one in which a natural law
again dictates the peace,

357
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,450
peace into preservation.

358
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,770
It is not a war of all against all locks.

359
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Natural law in some ways seems like
a very traditional form of moral law.

360
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,340
Familiar to readers of his time.

361
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,820
Readers who would have been familiar
with the natural law tradition.

362
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:36,350
Going back to Cicero,

363
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,360
uh,

364
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,720
the Roman stoics,

365
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,000
Saint Thomas Aquinas,

366
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,580
and in Locke's own day,

367
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,200
uh,

368
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,033
an important,

369
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,381
uh,

370
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:46,214
Anglican,

371
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,560
a divine by the name of Richard Hooker.

372
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Locke's theory of moral law or natural
law sounds comforting and traditional.

373
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,410
And to some degree it is.

374
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,800
All civil authority has its foundation.

375
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,220
In a law of reason that is knowable by
virtue of our rational capacities alone.

376
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,210
The law of nature declares
according to Locke,

377
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:13,850
that we are all in his famous war term,

378
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,880
the workmanship of one omnipotent in
infinitely wise maker and his product of

379
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:23,270
divine workmanship.

380
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,390
We are never to harm
anyone in their lives.

381
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:31,391
Liberties or possessions lock again
seems to effortlessly weave together the

382
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:37,641
stoic tradition of natural law with these
Christian ideas of divine workmanship

383
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,760
into one seamless hole.

384
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:46,160
You can see the way in which locks
rhetoric here and his writing brings,

385
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:51,161
brings together a different strands
of the philosophical and theological

386
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:52,314
tradition.

387
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,730
Weaving them together in a kind of,

388
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,110
uh,

389
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,980
effortless,

390
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,581
whole,

391
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:57,414
almost.

392
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,460
Do not be simply seduced by
this because even within,

393
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,120
why do I say that?

394
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,510
Because even within the same paragraphs,

395
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,000
locks natural law,

396
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,380
the law that again,

397
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:18,381
mandates or dictates piece
and preservation of all
mankind turns into a right of

398
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:22,920
self preservation

399
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,770
from the beginning.

400
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,761
You have to say,

401
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:31,761
it is not altogether clear even whether
the natural law is a theory of moral

402
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,130
duty duties that we have to preserve,

403
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:35,880
uh,

404
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,920
others duties and obligations.

405
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,140
Or is it,

406
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:43,980
or whether it is a theory of natural
rights that mandates that the highest

407
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:48,981
priority be given to individual self
preservation and whatever is necessary to

408
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:53,220
achieve the preservation
of the individual.

409
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:57,120
The state of nature is a
condition without civil authority.

410
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:58,530
The law of nature,

411
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,311
in other words,

412
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:03,450
has no person or office to oversee,

413
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,990
uh,

414
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,390
it's enforcement or its application.

415
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:11,340
So the state of nature that he wants
describes our early describes in the book

416
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:14,550
as a condition of peace
and mutual distrust.

417
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,350
Quickly degenerate,

418
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,531
sinned,

419
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:21,531
do a condition of civil war or of war
where every individual serves as the

420
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:22,680
judge,

421
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,490
jury,

422
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,640
and executioner of the natural law,

423
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,750
the state of nature
quickly becomes quickly,

424
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:33,510
becomes a hobby and condition,

425
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,081
uh,

426
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:36,690
of essentially every man for himself.

427
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,710
Consider the following passage in
section 11 of the second treatise,

428
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,540
the damn unified person,

429
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:42,900
uh,

430
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,733
lock rights.

431
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,940
Someone who has been mistreated
in the condition of nature,

432
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:52,350
the damn defied person who's been
injured or mistreated has this power of

433
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:56,070
appropriating to himself the
goods or services of the,

434
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:01,130
of the offender by the right of self
preservation as every man has a power to

435
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,800
punish the crime to
prevent it being committed.

436
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:09,801
Again by the right he has of preserving
all mankind in doing all reasonable

437
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:11,970
things he can in order to that end.

438
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,900
In other words,

439
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,800
uh,

440
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,790
if you feel,

441
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,750
or if you have been wronged or feel you
have been wronged in the individual,

442
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,800
in the state of nature,

443
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:23,520
you have according to the
natural law of for Locke,

444
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,630
the right to as he puts it
appropriate to yourself,

445
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,660
the goods or services of the offender.

446
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,930
And you have that too to take from them,

447
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,651
uh,

448
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:35,041
their,

449
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:35,731
their goods,

450
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:36,660
their property,

451
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,340
their services in some way,

452
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,121
uh,

453
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:40,350
whatever you feel,

454
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,353
uh,

455
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,773
appropriate.

456
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,380
Uh,

457
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,370
as again,

458
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:47,160
the person who has suffered
some kind of wrong,

459
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,710
uh,

460
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,270
every person becomes,

461
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,470
is it worth judge and
executioner of the law of nature,

462
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,870
the fundamental law of nature.

463
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,161
Locke says,

464
00:20:57,161 --> 00:21:02,161
here is the right of self preservation
in this states that each person is

465
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:04,960
empowered to do again,

466
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:09,730
whatever is in his power
to preserve him or herself.

467
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,271
Again,

468
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,030
consider the following in section 16

469
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,560
and one may destroy a man
who makes war upon him,

470
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:24,270
may destroy another who makes war upon
you or has discovered an enmity to his

471
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:29,501
being for the same reason that he may
kill a wolf or a lion because such men are

472
00:21:30,771 --> 00:21:34,160
not under the ties of
the common law of reason.

473
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,260
They have no other rule,

474
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,180
but that of force and violence.

475
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,960
So also they may be
treated as beasts of prey,

476
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:46,961
those dangerous or noxious creatures that
we'll be sure to destroy him whenever

477
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:49,430
he falls into their power.

478
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,130
Listen to that language.

479
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,700
Uh,

480
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:57,680
from an original moral condition
where we are under a natural law,

481
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,330
not to harm others.

482
00:21:59,540 --> 00:21:59,751
Uh,

483
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:04,751
a law to preserve and protect the
wellbeing of others of our kind.

484
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:10,130
We have become like lions
and wolves to each other,

485
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,190
beasts of prey and
other noxious creatures.

486
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,470
What is the state of nature?

487
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,350
But Eh,

488
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:16,780
in,

489
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,260
in the words of Dorothy,

490
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:19,820
Gale Lions,

491
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:21,230
tigers and bears,

492
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,333
oh my,

493
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,210
uh,

494
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,610
this is what we are to one another.

495
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,330
This is what I've come
to think of his locks,

496
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:30,200
Beastie airy.

497
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:31,701
And in fact,

498
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:36,701
the second treatise is rife with language
of comparing human beings to and our

499
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:39,770
behavior to animals.

500
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:42,770
He speaks about lions
and wolves elsewhere.

501
00:22:42,771 --> 00:22:47,660
He speaks about polecats and
skunks and foxes and all this.

502
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:48,910
How,

503
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,340
if,

504
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,460
if in fact we are all beings as he says,

505
00:22:52,461 --> 00:22:54,380
created under a natural law week.

506
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,870
We seem to quickly degenerate into,

507
00:22:56,871 --> 00:22:58,810
into be almost be steel,

508
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,180
uh,

509
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,991
behavior,

510
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:01,070
beasts of prey,

511
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,860
far from being cooperative and peace,

512
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,690
peace seeking creatures.

513
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,650
Uh,

514
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:11,650
the very freedom that such beings as
ourselves enjoy in the state of nature

515
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:19,450
leads us to abuse that
freedom and in turn requires,

516
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:22,640
or is it the basis of the
need for civil government.

517
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,830
Okay.

518
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,341
However,

519
00:23:26,341 --> 00:23:27,180
in the meantime,

520
00:23:27,181 --> 00:23:32,010
the question that any reader of the
second treatise has to ask of themselves,

521
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:34,170
and I hope you put this forward in your,

522
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,940
in your sections to one another,

523
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,750
is whether the natural condition is lock,

524
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:44,751
understands it is one overseen by a moral
law of justifying or sanctifying peace

525
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:48,740
and security,

526
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,830
or whether Hobbes is,

527
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:51,400
uh,

528
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:51,891
excuse me,

529
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:56,840
lock state of nature is simply
a thinly veiled description,

530
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:02,270
a thinly papered over description of
the Hobbs Ian War of all against all was

531
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,853
lock,

532
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,500
uh,

533
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,760
simply hubs in some way
in sheep's clothing.

534
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,620
You remember his famous test?

535
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,454
Aternity

536
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,680
lock seems to be speaking
to very different languages.

537
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,281
In other words,

538
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:27,720
one of traditional natural law
that holds out duties to others,

539
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,320
uh,

540
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,320
as primary and the other in some ways
a modern hubs and conception of natural

541
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:37,800
rights that maintains the priority,

542
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,400
uh,

543
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,400
of right and each individual's
right to self preservation is lock.

544
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,570
In other words,

545
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,140
uh,

546
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,500
and this is perhaps more of an
historical than a theoretical question,

547
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:54,501
is lock a member of the ancient in
some ways sis Aronian and Tom Mystic

548
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:57,570
tradition of natural law or a modern hubs.

549
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,413
Ian,

550
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,440
do his politics derived from a theological
conception of divine workmanship or

551
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:08,010
an ultimately you might say naturalistic,

552
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:13,270
a conception or account of the human
passions and the struggle for survival.

553
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:18,950
Do his priorities go to duties or two
rights or is lock simply confused?

554
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:25,910
Is he confusing two different languages
or is he being intentionally ambiguous

555
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,290
in his account?

556
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,630
A recent book,

557
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,410
uh,

558
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,850
by a well known scholar,

559
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,340
uh,

560
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,173
of lock,

561
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,160
uh,

562
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,460
his argued I think quite
powerfully in some ways.

563
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,390
The,

564
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,210
the idea that locks idea of equality,

565
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:42,990
uh,

566
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,160
in the state of nature,

567
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:44,880
uh,

568
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,880
specifically relies upon a certain kind
of Christian theological context of

569
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:56,151
argument locks statement in paragraph
four of the second treatise,

570
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,291
uh,

571
00:25:58,291 --> 00:25:59,460
his statement that,

572
00:25:59,590 --> 00:25:59,910
uh,

573
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:04,320
there being nothing more evident than it
creatures of the same species and rank

574
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:09,321
promiscuously born to all
the same advantages of nature
should also be equal to

575
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:10,884
one and other.

576
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:16,130
That walks statement that creatures of
the same species and rank should be equal

577
00:26:16,891 --> 00:26:17,610
to one another.

578
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,610
This is said to rely upon and dependent
upon a very specific religious argument,

579
00:26:23,371 --> 00:26:28,371
what it means to belong to a species
and why belonging to the same species

580
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:31,650
confers a special rank or dignity,

581
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,161
uh,

582
00:26:32,161 --> 00:26:37,161
on each of its members only makes sense
according to this recent interpretation

583
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:43,310
if you believe or if it is believed that
the species in question has this moral

584
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,390
relation to God.

585
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,630
The question I think

586
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,840
is whether locks,

587
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:58,130
idea of equality in the state of nature
or his idea of the moral law in the

588
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:03,441
state of nature relies upon this belief
or whether it can be inferred from such

589
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:07,040
things as uh,

590
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,030
the basic principles of freedom.

591
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:14,090
Whether this can be inferred as it
were from purely a non theological

592
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,910
naturalistic premises or grounds lock
to be short is silent in the second

593
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:28,461
treatise about the theological
foundations of his position,

594
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:34,641
there are no discussions of important
theological figures such as Jesus or Saint

595
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,650
Paul or the New Testament,

596
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,360
at least in the second treatise.

597
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:42,270
He discusses these issues
at length elsewhere.

598
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,350
These may be in some way thought
of as background considerations.

599
00:27:46,351 --> 00:27:47,850
But the question remains,

600
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:49,050
I think for us,

601
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:55,310
whether these are deeply
embedded in Locke's arguments
about divine workmanship,

602
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:56,850
uh,

603
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:01,850
or whether or not that language of divine
workmanship simply serves as a kind of

604
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:04,110
window dressing,

605
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,651
again,

606
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:06,960
for a purely secular,

607
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,090
naturalistic theory,

608
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:09,700
uh,

609
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,171
of,

610
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:10,560
of,

611
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:10,980
of,

612
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,370
of,

613
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:11,910
uh,

614
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:16,080
of human nature and political authority.

615
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,080
Very important issue.

616
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:20,980
Uh,

617
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,880
I think in,

618
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:25,750
in coming to understand
lock and indirectly,

619
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,260
uh,

620
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,250
very important for how we come
to think of the American regime.

621
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:35,230
Because I'll just say simply as a kind
of footnote to what I've been saying,

622
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,740
uh,

623
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,610
if lock,

624
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,240
uh,

625
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,080
is thought of in some
ways as his doctrine,

626
00:28:41,081 --> 00:28:42,970
as being in some ways at the,

627
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:43,450
uh,

628
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:48,450
founding principles of the American
regime declaration of independence,

629
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,020
most notably,

630
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,090
it becomes very important.

631
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:52,481
Uh,

632
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:55,480
it becomes part of a
contemporary public argument.

633
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:58,150
Whether those foundations,

634
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,100
uh,

635
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,351
oh,

636
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:02,650
their authority to some kind
of theological doctrine,

637
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:03,580
uh,

638
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,010
as Jefferson costs it.

639
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,030
In the opening of the declaration,

640
00:29:07,031 --> 00:29:12,031
the laws of nature and nature's God seems
in some way to have a kind of locking

641
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:15,400
and overtones to it.

642
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,440
Does do our founding doc documents
imply a theology of some kind,

643
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,220
the laws of nature and nature's God,

644
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,410
or are those principles,

645
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:27,010
again,

646
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,900
purely of a naturalistic,

647
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:33,360
secular kind that can do
without theology altogether?

648
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:33,860
Uh,

649
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,390
that,

650
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,020
that,

651
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,310
that is an argument,

652
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,990
um,

653
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,090
uh,

654
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,060
a kind of scholarly and
academic argument to be sure,

655
00:29:40,061 --> 00:29:42,160
but it spills over,

656
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:42,880
uh,

657
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,660
into,

658
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:43,960
uh,

659
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,960
many of our public debates over the role
or place of religion in public life.

660
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:53,830
Whenever we talk about issues
of the appropriateness of a,

661
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,460
of school issues like
school prayer or the,

662
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,410
should the 10 commandments be,

663
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,430
uh,

664
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,200
publicly displayed in,

665
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:02,760
uh,

666
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,001
in,

667
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,550
in courthouses or another
in other public places?

668
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:10,420
Or if you want to take
another famous Jeffersonian,

669
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,020
uh,

670
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,680
position,

671
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,290
is there a kind of absolute firewall,

672
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:18,270
a wall of separation between religion and,

673
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:18,690
and,

674
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,600
and to this state,

675
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,590
these issues,

676
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,191
uh,

677
00:30:21,191 --> 00:30:25,690
that we very much a work work
on today and think about are,

678
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:30,930
you can see deeply embedded in how we
think about Locke and those opening

679
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:37,650
sections of the second treatise dealing
with natural law in the state of nature.

680
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,820
So you can see again how these ideas
penetrate deeply into the marrow of our

681
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,500
public or political culture.

682
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,890
Are we so different?

683
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:57,600
Have we become so different?

684
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,200
Uh,

685
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,200
we'll people living 300 years from now
think of us as so different and our

686
00:31:04,261 --> 00:31:09,150
public debates so different from those
that animated the public issues in the

687
00:31:09,151 --> 00:31:09,621
time of,

688
00:31:09,621 --> 00:31:10,530
of John Locke.

689
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,043
Maybe not.

690
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,070
Maybe we aren't that different.

691
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,463
So,

692
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,550
okay.

693
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,920
Enough for contemporary,

694
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:20,670
let me go,

695
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,080
go back to Mr. Lock.

696
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,503
Uh,

697
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,920
the core of Locke's theory of
natural law in the state of nature.

698
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,733
Okay.

699
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:41,300
Is arguably lodged in
his account of property.

700
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:42,810
Yeah.

701
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,880
Chapter five of the second treatise.

702
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,053
Yeah.

703
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,640
If you remember anything
about lock after this class,

704
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:52,140
remember chapter five,

705
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,600
it is by all accounts,

706
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,660
maybe chapter 19 as well,

707
00:31:56,661 --> 00:31:58,410
the theory of revolution,

708
00:31:58,411 --> 00:32:01,440
but chapter five kind of property,

709
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,540
certainly in many ways,

710
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:08,541
one of the most characteristic
doctrines of Lockian political thought.

711
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,993
Okay.

712
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,080
Locke's view of human nature is that
we are very much the property acquiring

713
00:32:21,411 --> 00:32:22,244
animal.

714
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,250
Aristotle had said we
were political by nature.

715
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,790
Locke says we are
property acquiring beings,

716
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:33,450
our claims to property
derived from our work.

717
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,090
Okay.

718
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:38,450
The fact that we have expended our labor,

719
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,373
our work,

720
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,870
something gives us a title to it.

721
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,900
Labor confers value and is
the source of all the values.

722
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:52,540
The state of nature is a condition he
tells us of communal ownership with Karl.

723
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:56,180
Marx would have called
primitive communism.

724
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:01,210
The state of nature is given to all men
and common Locke says it only becomes

725
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,440
parts only of it become private property.

726
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:09,950
Only when we add our labor to something,

727
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:16,090
let me read a famous formula in sections
20 from sections 27 and 28 every man

728
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:21,140
Locke says his property in his person.

729
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,790
This nobody has any right to but himself.

730
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,300
We all in other words have a certain Ph.

731
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:34,160
We come into the world with a certain
private property property in our person.

732
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,230
No one else has a right to that.

733
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,500
The Labor of his body block continues
and the work of his hands we may say are

734
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:47,081
properly his fur for labor being the
unquestionable property of the laborer.

735
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,270
No Man,

736
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:55,310
but he can have a right to what is once
joined to at least where there is enough

737
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,380
as good left and common for others.

738
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:02,710
That Labor Locke says puts a distinction
between him and the common that added

739
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:07,760
something to them more than nature.

740
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:12,410
The common mother of all had done
and so they become his private.

741
00:34:12,411 --> 00:34:13,244
Right?

742
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:19,830
So we have moved here in this one
paragraph from the state of nature,

743
00:34:20,741 --> 00:34:23,200
which he says is common to all,

744
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,510
to a condition of
rudimentary private property,

745
00:34:28,511 --> 00:34:30,490
which we have in our body.

746
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:31,990
Our person,

747
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,820
which he says also includes,

748
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,570
uh,

749
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,120
the Labor of the body and
the work of the hands,

750
00:34:37,121 --> 00:34:39,280
how we expand our activity,

751
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,750
that Labor,

752
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:41,231
he says,

753
00:34:41,231 --> 00:34:46,231
which puts something between us and the
common becomes the source of ownership

754
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,230
of things around us.

755
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,550
And that ownership then
in turn becomes a right.

756
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:55,840
So they become,

757
00:34:55,841 --> 00:34:56,830
he concludes there,

758
00:34:56,831 --> 00:34:58,360
his private right.

759
00:34:58,890 --> 00:34:59,230
Uh,

760
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,840
the source of a right to property.

761
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,850
The natural law as hot as lock,

762
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:06,640
uh,

763
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,930
seems to be saying,

764
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:12,931
dictates a right to private property
and it is to secure that right that

765
00:35:14,171 --> 00:35:17,200
governments are ultimately established

766
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:21,100
in a striking formulation.

767
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:27,150
Lock tells us that the world was created
in order to be cultivated and improved.

768
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,980
Those who work to improve
and develop nature,

769
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:38,010
who add to nature through the labor
of their body and work of their hands,

770
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,040
those who develop an improved nature
or the true benefactors of humanity,

771
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:44,251
of,

772
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:45,230
of human kindness.

773
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,940
God gave the world two men in common.

774
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,463
He says,

775
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,000
section 34,

776
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,760
God gave the world two men in common,

777
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,800
but since he gave it to them for their
benefit and the greatest conveniences of

778
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:01,470
life that they were
capable to draw from it,

779
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,933
he writes,

780
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,700
the world was given for our convenience.

781
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,110
It says to be drawn from
it cannot be supposed.

782
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,200
He meant it should always remain common
and uncultivated and then he adds,

783
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,140
he gave it to the use of the industrious
and the rational and not to the fancy

784
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:27,201
or covetousness of the quarrelsome and
contentious God gave the world for our

785
00:36:31,531 --> 00:36:32,550
improvement of it.

786
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,090
And therefore he gave
it to the industrious.

787
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,380
And the rational

788
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,330
lock seems to suggest in that very phrase
that the state will be a commercial

789
00:36:46,141 --> 00:36:46,974
state,

790
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:52,310
that the Lockian republic or the Lockian
state will be a commercial republic.

791
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,770
Think of that ancient political theory,

792
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:57,060
Plato,

793
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,700
Aristotle regarded commerce,

794
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:05,040
regarded a property is in many ways
subordinate to the life of the citizen.

795
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:09,480
Plato would have instituted a
kind of communism of property,

796
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:10,530
uh,

797
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,300
among the guardians of his calypso.

798
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,500
Aristotle regarded the necessity thought,

799
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,870
thought of the necessity
of private property,

800
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:24,350
but simply as a means to allow a few those
citizens to engage in political life.

801
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,400
Economy,

802
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:29,790
uh,

803
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,421
you might say,

804
00:37:30,421 --> 00:37:33,510
was always subordinate to the polity.

805
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,170
Lock turns this doctrine,

806
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,740
this ancient and medieval
doctrine is well on its head.

807
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,660
In many ways.

808
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,280
The world belongs to the
industrious and the rational.

809
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,440
Those who through their own efforts,

810
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:52,590
through their labor and
work increase and enhance,

811
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,100
uh,

812
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,990
the plenty of all,

813
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:59,991
it is only a relatively short step
from John Locke to Adam Smith in that

814
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:02,190
respect.

815
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,010
The great author of the wealth of nations,

816
00:38:05,011 --> 00:38:06,720
again about a century after,

817
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,900
just under a century after
Locke's second treatise for lock.

818
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,190
And let me just go on a
little more about this.

819
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:19,850
There are no natural limits to property
acquisition and this is in a way the

820
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:22,620
essential point,

821
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:29,510
the introduction of money or coinage
into the state of nature issue.

822
00:38:29,821 --> 00:38:31,860
I'm not going to talk much about here,

823
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,670
but that becomes an important moment in
his chapter five in his account of the

824
00:38:36,671 --> 00:38:37,504
state of nature.

825
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,823
The introduction,

826
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,860
the introduction of money makes
unlimited capital accumulation,

827
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:45,100
not only possible,

828
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:47,230
but even a kind of moral duty.

829
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:52,590
It becomes our duty to enhance and work
upon the raw materials of the natural

830
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,700
world around us.

831
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:56,500
By enriching ourselves.

832
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,300
We unintentionally,

833
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,110
uh,

834
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,300
work for the benefit of others.

835
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,420
Consider the following
remarkable sentence,

836
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,520
a king of a large and
fruitful territory in America.

837
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,353
He says,

838
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,980
feeds lodges and is clad worse
than a day laborer in England.

839
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,210
Uh,

840
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,250
because of course our work,

841
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,750
Locke thinks has,

842
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,230
has enhanced that the
plenty of all in some way,

843
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:31,231
the creation of a general planted of
a general planty the Commonwealth.

844
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,860
And think of the way in which the
revealing use of that term Commonwealth,

845
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:36,310
uh,

846
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:36,670
con,

847
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,670
the wealth of all is do in many ways
to the emancipation of labor from the

848
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:48,211
previous kinds of moral and political
restrictions imposed upon it by the

849
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:53,110
ancient philosophical as
well as religious traditions.

850
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:58,111
Labor becomes four lock the source
of all value and our title two common

851
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:04,021
ownership and in a remarkable a
rhetorical series of shifts he makes,

852
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:08,560
not nature but rather human
labor and acquisition,

853
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:13,561
this source of property and an
unlimited material possessions.

854
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,960
He begins this chapter,

855
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:19,540
chapter five with the assertion.

856
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,201
Think about it,

857
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:23,260
that God hath given the
World Two men in common.

858
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:28,620
Once again suggesting that the original
state is one of common ownership.

859
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:36,190
He then suggests that every person is the
owner of their own bodies and that one

860
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:41,191
acquires a title two things to Labor that
we have mixed with that common world,

861
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,970
but what starts as a very,

862
00:40:45,971 --> 00:40:50,470
very modest title to the objects
that we have worked on it.

863
00:40:50,471 --> 00:40:54,610
His example is nothing as simple as
something as sort of simple as picking

864
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:55,930
apples from a tree.

865
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:01,630
The act of picking gives us
a title too to the apple,

866
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,310
that very simple,

867
00:41:03,311 --> 00:41:08,311
a rudimentary form of property soon turns
into a full scale explanation of the

868
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:14,551
rise of property and a kind of market
economy in the state of nature.

869
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,660
Labor accounts,

870
00:41:16,661 --> 00:41:19,930
he tells us for 10 times
the amount of value,

871
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:20,800
uh,

872
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,020
that is provided by nature alone.

873
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:28,050
He says it 37 section 37 our labor
enhances the value of nature 10 times,

874
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,010
but he then goes on to add very quickly.

875
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:37,640
I have here rated the improved land
very low in making its product,

876
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:42,641
but as one to 10 when it is much nearer
a hundred to one our labor in advances

877
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:46,770
things a hundred fold.

878
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,170
Shortly later in section 43 he has said,

879
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:55,210
he says that the value of anything is
improved a thousand fold due to labor.

880
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,451
Again,

881
00:41:56,451 --> 00:42:00,830
what began is that fairly rudimentary
discussion of the origins of private

882
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:05,831
property at the beginning of section five
chapter five limited by the extent of

883
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:11,021
our use and spoilage has by the end
of that same chapter you might say,

884
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:16,571
morphed into an account of large scale
ownership with considerable inequalities

885
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,480
of wealth and possession.

886
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:26,530
By the end of chapter five there appears
to be almost a direct link between

887
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:27,741
locks,

888
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:32,741
dynamic theory of property and chapter
five and James Madison's famous statement

889
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:38,201
in federalist number 10 that is Madison
says the protection of different,

890
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:43,511
an unequal faculties of acquiring property
is the first object of government.

891
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,550
Yeah.

892
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,450
It seems to vary.

893
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,640
Lockian proposition in
the federalist lock gives,

894
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,470
in other words to commerce to moneymaking,

895
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,461
to Aquas,

896
00:42:59,461 --> 00:43:04,461
to acquisitiveness a kind of pride of
place and just sort of moral status you

897
00:43:07,021 --> 00:43:08,940
might even call it that.

898
00:43:08,941 --> 00:43:12,770
It never enjoyed in the
ancient and medieval worlds.

899
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:17,810
The new politics of Lockian of the
Lockian state will no longer be concerned

900
00:43:18,841 --> 00:43:20,490
with glory,

901
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:23,610
honor through most virtue.

902
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:27,060
But locking and politics will be sober,

903
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,490
will be pedestrian,

904
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,100
it will be hedonistic

905
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:39,060
without sublimity or joy lock
is the author of the doctrine.

906
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,490
Did Commerce,

907
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,290
softens manners,

908
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:49,450
did it makes us less warlike
that it makes us civilized.

909
00:43:49,451 --> 00:43:52,120
Something that reaches its a,

910
00:43:52,121 --> 00:43:52,954
you might say,

911
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,280
highest expression.

912
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,150
In the 20th chapter,

913
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:00,470
The 20th book of Monto
skews a spirit of the laws.

914
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,520
Commerce does not require us for
lock to spill blood or risk life.

915
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:07,390
It has solid,

916
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,530
reliable,

917
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,140
thoroughly middle class.

918
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:11,600
Uh,

919
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,580
in some ways,

920
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:13,960
lock is the,

921
00:44:13,961 --> 00:44:14,380
again,

922
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:19,380
the great author of the idea that the
task of government is to protect not just

923
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:21,430
the rights of property,

924
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:25,840
but the right to acquire and build upon,

925
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,230
uh,

926
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,660
the property that we already own.

927
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:29,761
Sorry,

928
00:44:29,761 --> 00:44:32,500
what to end on this note and begin,

929
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:32,920
uh,

930
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,210
on Wednesday talking a little bit about
what we might call John Locke and the

931
00:44:37,211 --> 00:44:38,860
spirit of capitalism.
