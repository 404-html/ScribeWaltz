1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:02,961
Okay,

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:03,794
today.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:04,690
What a,

4
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,523
what a joy.

5
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,500
What a joy.

6
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,060
We start hubs and he's one of the great,

7
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,690
this is one of the great treats.

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,513
Okay.

9
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,090
Thomas Hobbs was the author of the first
and I believe undoubtedly the greatest

10
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:28,100
work of political theory
written in the English language.

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,160
Uh,

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,160
he was a master of English style and
prose and his work ranks among the very

13
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:44,750
greatest in this or any other language,

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,570
Leviathan is to pros

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,270
what Milton's paradise
lost is to epic poetry.

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,180
Think about that.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Hobbs was in many ways a
perfect foil for Machiavelli.

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,800
He played the part of

19
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,160
Dr. Watson to Machiavelli's
Sherlock Holmes

20
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,341
pubs.

21
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:24,210
In other words,

22
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:25,110
carried out

23
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,490
what Machiavelli had
helped to make possible.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,221
Machiavelli,

25
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:35,430
you remember claimed to have
discovered a new continent,

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,710
new modes and orders.

27
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,930
It was Hobbs who helped to make
this new content at habitable.

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,201
Machiavelli,

29
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:46,831
you might say,

30
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:47,940
cleared the brush.

31
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,850
He was the Lewis and Clark or the
Columbus hubs built the houses and

32
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:57,780
institutions.

33
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,260
Hobbes provided us with the definitive
language in which even today,

34
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,500
we continue to speak
about the modern state.

35
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,883
However,

36
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,730
uh,

37
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,650
and this is what I want to emphasize,

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,513
uh,

39
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,740
throughout our reading of Hobbes,

40
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,820
he has always been something
of a paradox to his readers.

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,080
And the one hand you will find Hobbs,

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,950
uh,

43
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,570
the most articulate,

44
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,140
articulate defender of
political absolutism,

45
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,260
uh,

46
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,320
Hobson,

47
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:41,270
the Hobson and doctrine of sovereignty
over the hubs and sovereign is to have a

48
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:46,100
complete monopoly of power
within his given territory.

49
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,811
In fact,

50
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:50,990
the famous frontest piece of the book,

51
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,910
which is reproduced in your addition,

52
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:55,910
although it's not altogether very clear,

53
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:57,680
it's not a very good reproduction.

54
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,800
The famous frontest piece
to the original 1651,

55
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,310
uh,

56
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,800
addition of Leviathan depicts,

57
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,220
uh,

58
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,240
the Leviathan,

59
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,190
uh,

60
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,460
depicts the state,

61
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,531
uh,

62
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:15,531
the sovereign holding a sword in one
hand in the sector in the other and the

63
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:21,391
various institutions of this civilian
and churchly ecclesiastical authority on,

64
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,010
on each side.

65
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:29,011
The sovereign holds total power over
all the institutions of civilian and

66
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:34,981
ecclesiastical life holding sway
over a kind of peaceable kingdom

67
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,590
add to this,

68
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,083
uh,

69
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,050
to the doctrine of indivisible
sovereign power hubs,

70
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,471
hubs,

71
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:49,471
his insistence that the sovereign exercise
complete control over the churches,

72
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,230
over the university curricula.

73
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,930
And over what books and
opinions can be read in taught.

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,160
He seems to be the perfect model of
absolutism and have absolute government.

75
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,490
You have to consider also the following.

76
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,140
Hobbes insists on the fundamental
equality of human beings who he says are

77
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:20,500
endowed with certain natural
and inalienable rights.

78
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,970
He maintains the state is a product of
a covenant or a compact or contract of

79
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,690
kind of a sword between individuals and
that the sovereign owes his authority to

80
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:38,980
the will or the consent
of those he governs.

81
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,830
And finally that the
sovereign is authorized only
to protect the interests of

82
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:48,940
the govern by maintaining
civil peace and security.

83
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,250
From this point of view,

84
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,790
it would seem that Hobbes
helps to establish the
language of what we might think

85
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:01,030
of is the liberal
opposition to absolutism.

86
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,920
And this paradox was noted in
even in Hobbs his own time.

87
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Was he a defender of royalism and the
power of the king or was he a defender or

88
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,030
an opponent of royalism?

89
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,790
I mean in many ways to be sure
Hobbs was a product of his time.

90
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,820
What else could he be?

91
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,660
But Hobbs lived at a time when the
modern system of European states,

92
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,640
even as we understand them today,

93
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:36,800
was just the beginning to emerge.

94
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,060
Three years before the
publication of Leviathan,

95
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,230
1651,

96
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,140
the signing of the Treaty
of Westphalia famous,

97
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,183
uh,

98
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,780
peace treaty brought an end to more
than a century of religious war that had

99
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,980
been ignited by the
Protestant reformation.

100
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,580
The treaty of vest failure,

101
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,200
um,

102
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,260
officially put an end
to the 30 years' war.

103
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,120
But more than that,

104
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:16,121
it ratified to decisive features that
would be given powerful expression by

105
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:17,384
Hobbs.

106
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,033
First,

107
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,850
the treaty declared that the individual
sovereign state would hence forth become

108
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,340
the highest level of authority.

109
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,700
You might say putting an end once.

110
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:36,560
And for all to the universalist
claims of the holy Roman Empire,

111
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,270
each state was to be sovereign
and to have its own authority.

112
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:42,104
And secondly,

113
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,800
that the head of each state would have
the right to determine the religion of

114
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:48,854
the state.

115
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:49,611
Again,

116
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:49,911
Dus,

117
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:54,911
putting an end to the claims of
a single universalist church.

118
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,310
This is what the Treaty of Westphalia,

119
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:58,850
uh,

120
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,020
put into practice.

121
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,030
And among other things,

122
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:06,590
what Hobbs attempted to
express in theory in his book.

123
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:09,900
Okay,

124
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,900
the autonomy and authority of the
sovereign and the sovereign power to

125
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,790
establish,

126
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,080
uh,

127
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,590
what religious doctrine
or what even more broadly,

128
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:27,591
what opinions are to be taught and held
within a community within a state who

129
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:29,470
was hot.

130
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:29,910
So let me,

131
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,260
let me say a word about him.

132
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,830
Hobbes was born in 1588,

133
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:35,740
uh,

134
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,740
the year that the English naval forces
drove back the invasion of the famous

135
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:43,440
Spanish Armada.

136
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,340
He grew up in the waning years,

137
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,710
the last years of the Elizabethan era,

138
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:55,310
and he was a boy when Shakespeare's
most famous plays were first performed

139
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,500
hubs.

140
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,580
Like many of you,

141
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,500
what's a gifted student?

142
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,750
And he went to college.

143
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,521
His father,

144
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:09,600
who was a local pastor from
the south west of England,

145
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:10,800
sent him to Oxford,

146
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,770
although he went at the age of 14

147
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,610
and after he graduated,

148
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:21,030
he entered the service of
an aristocratic family,

149
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,360
the Cavendish family where he
became a private tutor to their son.

150
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,540
His first book was a translation of the
acidities history of the Peloponnesian

151
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:38,544
war,

152
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,310
which he completed in 1629.

153
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,390
Who Cities The great historian
of the Peloponnesian War,

154
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,130
who we've met a mentioned before.

155
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:47,520
When we,

156
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,780
when we talked about Plato,

157
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,830
a habits was a gifted classical scholar.

158
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,230
He spent a amount of time
on the European continent,

159
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,280
uh,

160
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,520
with his young two t Mr Kevin dish.

161
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:03,571
Uh,

162
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:05,610
and while he spent time in Europe,

163
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,070
he,

164
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,900
he met gala.

165
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,200
He met Galileo and Rene Descartes.

166
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:11,880
Um,

167
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,010
it was during the 1640s,

168
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,060
the period,

169
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,481
uh,

170
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:17,970
that initiated the great civil wars,

171
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,670
uh,

172
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,503
in England,

173
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,850
uh,

174
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,420
and the execution of the
King Charles the first,

175
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,381
uh,

176
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:27,990
that hubs left England to live in France.

177
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,980
Uh,

178
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,450
why the fighting went on.

179
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,010
He left England with,

180
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,000
uh,

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,870
many of the,

182
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:34,561
the,

183
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:34,860
uh,

184
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,090
the royal families,

185
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:40,830
the aristocratic families who were
threatened by the Republican armies,

186
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,281
uh,

187
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,210
organized by,

188
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,080
by Chrom.

189
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,410
Well,

190
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,540
and that had executed the king.

191
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,381
In fact,

192
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:47,970
the three justices,

193
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,020
the three judges who were in
charge of the judicial trial of,

194
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,730
uh,

195
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,181
Charles,

196
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:55,050
the first king,

197
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,831
King Charles,

198
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:57,120
the one who lost his head.

199
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:57,630
Uh,

200
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,360
those three judges
later found a home where

201
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,530
in new haven they came to new haven.

202
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,590
The three judges judge Whaley,

203
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,000
golf and Dixwell cause it sound familiar?

204
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,433
Yes.

205
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,940
New Haven was in part started
by founded by members of the,

206
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:19,560
uh,

207
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,780
you might say the Republican opposition,

208
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,530
uh,

209
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,260
to row two to royalty and to the,

210
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:25,410
uh,

211
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:25,920
to the,

212
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,870
to the English king in any way.

213
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:28,590
Hobbs.

214
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,210
However,

215
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,870
it was deeply distressed by the outbreak
of war and you spent a great deal of

216
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:38,871
time reflecting on the causes
of war and political disorder.

217
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,940
His first treatise,

218
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,230
uh,

219
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,120
a book called Day Civi or day keyway,

220
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,800
depending on how you pronounce it.

221
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,760
I'm the citizen,

222
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:48,710
uh,

223
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,710
was published in 1642 and it was a kind
of draft version of Leviathan that was

224
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:57,360
published almost a decade later.

225
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,691
Again,

226
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:02,691
in 1651 hubs returned to England the
same year of the book's publication and

227
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:07,920
spent most of the rest of his long life.

228
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,190
A Leviathan was written
well into his sixties.

229
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:15,620
He was 63 when it,

230
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,800
when it was published.

231
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:17,550
Uh,

232
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,550
he spent the rest of his long life working
on scientific and political problems.

233
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:26,520
He wrote a history of
the English civil wars,

234
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,270
uh,

235
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,320
called behemoths,

236
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,360
which remains a classic of the analysis
of the causes of social conflict.

237
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,720
And as if this were not enough
near the very end of his life,

238
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,590
uh,

239
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,590
he returned to his classical studies
translating all of Homer's Iliad and

240
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:44,934
Odyssey.

241
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:45,900
Uh,

242
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,900
he died in 1679 at the age of
91 from the various portraits,

243
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:55,810
uh,

244
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,970
and descriptions of Hobbs.

245
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:58,870
Uh,

246
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,870
we can tell he was a man of considerable
charm and I wish the book that we had

247
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,730
had his picture,

248
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,950
a reproduction of this portrait on it,

249
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,330
but I just want to read,

250
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:10,990
uh,

251
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,870
one brief passage from his biographer.

252
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,110
A man named John [inaudible] who knew him,

253
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:17,910
uh,

254
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,040
who,

255
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,311
who,

256
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:18,881
who knew him.

257
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:21,400
It was written during hubs is lifetime.

258
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,020
Aubrey wrote about Hobbs.

259
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:25,870
He had a good eye and that of Hazel Color,

260
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:29,410
which was full of life and
spirit even to the last,

261
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,360
when he was earnest in dis,

262
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,320
in discourse.

263
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:34,090
These shown as it were,

264
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,480
a bright as if a bright
live coal within it.

265
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,930
He had two kinds of looks when he laughed,

266
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,793
was witty.

267
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,090
And in a Mary humor,

268
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,130
one could scare see his eyes.

269
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,280
And by and by when he
was serious and positive,

270
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,590
he opened his eyes around.

271
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,460
He was six foot high and something better.

272
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,390
So it was very,

273
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,380
very tall.

274
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,180
In the 17th century,

275
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:00,550
he was six foot high and very better.

276
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:01,180
He was.

277
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,690
He was,

278
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,080
he had read much if one
considers his long life,

279
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,260
but his contemplation was
much more than his reading.

280
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,520
He was want to say that he did it,

281
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,620
that if he had read as much as other men,

282
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,340
he should have known
no more than other men.

283
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,630
Uh,

284
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,360
so his point was he had read a lot,

285
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,550
but what was most important was his,

286
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,540
his thinking,

287
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,280
if he had red is not as much.

288
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,530
He would know his little.

289
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,900
Let's do a little sense of hubs,

290
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:32,711
his spirit,

291
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,544
his humor,

292
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,390
the wry wit that becomes a parent on,

293
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:38,770
on almost every,

294
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,570
every page of this book.

295
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,390
But you have to be a careful reader.

296
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,770
Hubs was deeply controversial,

297
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,590
as you might suspect during his lifetime.

298
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:56,310
Leviathan was excoriated by almost every
reader of the text to the church men.

299
00:13:59,230 --> 00:13:59,441
Uh,

300
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:01,210
he was a godless atheist,

301
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,170
uh,

302
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,400
to the Republicans.

303
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,940
He was tainted with monarchy or
monarch ism and to the monarchists,

304
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,150
he was a dangerous skeptic.

305
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,640
Uh,

306
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,540
and free thinker hubs.

307
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,530
Again,

308
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,530
along with Machiavelli was one of the
great architects of the modern state.

309
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,420
And to some degree he even seems to speak.

310
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:23,650
He see,

311
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,430
he seems even more characteristically
modern than Machiavelli.

312
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:27,971
I mean,

313
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:29,920
considers just some of the following.

314
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:34,921
Machiavelli speaks of the prince while
hubs speaks of the sovereign that is a

315
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:39,610
kind of impersonal or
in Hobbs is language,

316
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,960
artificial power,

317
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:41,590
uh,

318
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,690
created out of a contract.

319
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,300
Hobbes is method,

320
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,790
seems scientific.

321
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,120
It seems formal and analytical in
contrast to Machiavelli's combination of

322
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,790
historical commentary in reflection
drawn from personal experience.

323
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:02,841
Well,

324
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:03,674
Hobbs,

325
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,070
I,

326
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,581
excuse me.

327
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:08,180
While Machiavelli often
spoke of the sublime cruelty,

328
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:08,900
uh,

329
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,900
of men like Skipio and Hannibal hubs
speaks the more pedestrian language,

330
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,660
the language of power politics,

331
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,110
where the goal is not glory and honor,

332
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:22,460
but self preservation.

333
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,280
And Machiavelli's emphasis
upon law upon arms,

334
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,040
uh,

335
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,410
is considerably attenuated by Hobbs,

336
00:15:31,411 --> 00:15:32,990
is emphasis on laws.

337
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,593
Hubs,

338
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,280
in other words,

339
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,040
tried to render acceptable,

340
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,440
tried to render palatable.

341
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,460
What Machiavelli had done by providing
a more precise and more legal and

342
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:53,030
institutional framework
for the modern state.

343
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,830
So let's think a little bit about what
it was that Hobbes was attempting to

344
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:00,734
accomplish.

345
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,533
Okay.

346
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:10,260
Hubs like Machiavelli was an innovator
and he was self consciously aware of his

347
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:16,060
innovations,

348
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,510
can like Machiavelli who said in the 15th
chapter of the prints that he would be

349
00:16:22,511 --> 00:16:27,511
the first to examine the effectual truth
of things as opposed to the imaginings

350
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:28,774
of them.

351
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,750
Hubs wrote that civil science,

352
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,030
that's what he called political science.

353
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:38,320
Civil Science was no older
than my book day Keyway,

354
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,950
modern political science,

355
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:43,300
he said began with his,

356
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,280
this book of 1642.

357
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:46,650
What,

358
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,030
what did he think of as his novelty?

359
00:16:49,031 --> 00:16:49,301
What,

360
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,470
what was new?

361
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,500
What was revolutionary about or innovative
about Hobbs is political science.

362
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,660
Hobbes clearly saw
himself in many respects,

363
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:03,860
is founding,

364
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,011
uh,

365
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:09,011
political science modeled along that
of the early founders of the scientific

366
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:12,044
revolution.

367
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,400
Galileo,

368
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:18,230
I've already indicated that
Hobbes had met William Harvey,

369
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,370
Rene Descartes,

370
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,910
a handful of others who were part of
what we think of is the modern scientific

371
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,600
revolutionaries.

372
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:31,340
Unlike these other revolutionaries
who had overthrown a,

373
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:31,851
you might say,

374
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:36,851
the Aristotelian Paradigm in natural
science hubs set out to undermine the

375
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:42,800
authority of Aristotle in civil science,

376
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,290
in political and moral science.

377
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,910
Hobbes set himself up as
the Great Anti Aristotle,

378
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,403
the great,

379
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:52,920
uh,

380
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,920
opposition to Aristotle considered just
the following passage from Leviathan

381
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,070
with one of my favorite
titles from the book,

382
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:08,170
a chapter called of darkness from vein
philosophy and fabulous traditions.

383
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,110
In that chapter,

384
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:11,940
Chapter 46 hobs writes,

385
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:16,260
there is nothing so absurd that
the old philosophers have not,

386
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,150
some of them maintained.

387
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,640
And I believe that scares anything
could be more absurdly said in natural

388
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:28,641
philosophy then that which is now
called Aristotle's metaphysics normal

389
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:34,020
repugnant to government then much
that he has said in his politics,

390
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,280
nor more ignorantly then a
great part of his ethics.

391
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,090
So there you say Hobbs
laying down a challenge.

392
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,970
What was it that he
claimed to find so absurd,

393
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,920
repugnant and ignorant,

394
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:52,880
uh,

395
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,810
in Aristotle.

396
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,980
Why did he,

397
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,053
what did he,

398
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,690
what was he trying to and thrown?

399
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,610
D dethrone and Aristotle.

400
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,340
Okay.

401
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,280
Hubs is typically concerned,

402
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,270
uh,

403
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,970
with the foundations of this new science.

404
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,730
Getting the building blocks
right from the beginning,

405
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:19,550
the opening chapters of Leviathan,

406
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,070
which I've only assigned a few,

407
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,520
but the opening chapters present a kind
of political physics where human beings

408
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:33,010
are reduced to body and the body is
further reduced to so much matter and

409
00:19:33,951 --> 00:19:34,784
emotion.

410
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,590
Human beings can be re reduced
to their movable parts,

411
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,180
much like a machine.

412
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,220
What does life,

413
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,000
he asks rhetorically
and in the introduction,

414
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:51,280
what is life but emotion of the limbs?

415
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,210
What does the heart but a spring or reason
but a means of calculating pleasures

416
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,654
and pains

417
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,220
he sets out to give a deliberately
and thoroughly materialistic and non

418
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,920
teleological physics of human nature.

419
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,000
In fact,

420
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,240
a French disciple of
Hobbs in the next century,

421
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:14,650
a man named La Tree,

422
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:15,700
uh,

423
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,700
wrote a treatise very much following in
the lines of Hobbs called Lum machine or

424
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:24,160
literally man a machine.

425
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,460
This is the way Hobbs Hobbs is.

426
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:30,070
New Science of politics appears to begin

427
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:39,090
and that new beginning is intended to
offer in many ways it comprehensive

428
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:44,290
alternative to Aristotle's
physics or Aristotle's politics.

429
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Aristotle argues that all
action is goal directed,

430
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,260
is goal oriented.

431
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,190
All actions aim at
preservation or change it,

432
00:20:57,191 --> 00:21:01,180
making something better or
preventing it from becoming worse.

433
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,330
Hubs believed,

434
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,440
on the other hand,

435
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:07,900
did the overriding human fact,

436
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,603
uh,

437
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:14,380
of the overriding motivation of
human behavior is largely negative,

438
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,900
not the desire to do good,

439
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,440
but the desire to avoid some evil.

440
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,240
Aristotle for Hobbes had simply seeing
the world through the wrong end of the

441
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:28,414
telescope.

442
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,490
For Aristotle,

443
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,430
human beings have a goal or a t loss,

444
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:39,130
which is to live a life in community
with others for the sake of human

445
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:39,964
flourishing.

446
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,130
But for hubs,

447
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,470
we enter into society,

448
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,640
not in order to fulfill or
perfect our rational nature,

449
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,670
but rather to avoid the greatest evil,

450
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:57,070
namely death or fear of
death at the hands of others.

451
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:02,310
Politics for him is less a matter of
prudential decisions of better and worse

452
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,740
than it is,

453
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,701
you might say,

454
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:11,701
an existential decision of choosing
life or death for Hobbs in many ways.

455
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,520
As for Machiavelli,

456
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:16,900
uh,

457
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,900
it is the extreme situation of
life and death of chaos and war.

458
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,870
They'd come to serve as the norm for
politics in political decision making,

459
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,700
fundamental alternative
or challenge to Aristotle.

460
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,770
And furthermore,

461
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,360
Hobbs not only criticized you
might see the foundations,

462
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,510
the motivational and
psychological foundations,

463
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,101
uh,

464
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:49,990
of Aristotle's theory of
politics and human nature.

465
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,070
He blamed the influence of Aristotle,

466
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,570
uh,

467
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,960
for much of this civil
conflict of his age.

468
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,640
Aristotle who was increasingly
being embraced by Civic
Republicans in England of

469
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:09,034
his time,

470
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:09,890
uh,

471
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,900
had been brought up according to
Hobbs on Aristotle's teaching.

472
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,450
That man is by nature a political animal.

473
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,670
This was again,

474
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:22,690
the thesis of the classical
Republican's according to which,

475
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:23,800
uh,

476
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,800
we are only fully human or we only
become fully human when we are engaged in

477
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,480
political life,

478
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,740
in ruling ourselves by
laws of our own making,

479
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,290
which was a doctrine that Hobbes
attributes to many of the,

480
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:41,530
uh,

481
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,230
teaching,

482
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,400
uh,

483
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,350
much of the teaching at the university,

484
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,850
the universities of his age.

485
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:49,900
And it is precisely this
desire to be self governing.

486
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,070
You might say to rule directly,

487
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,580
you have a direct part in political rule
that saw Hobbs is one of the great root

488
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:00,020
causes of civil war.

489
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:06,310
And his answer to Aristotle and the
classical Republican's of his age was his

490
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:12,971
famous doctrine of what we might call
indirect government or what perhaps would

491
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:18,230
be more familiar to us by the
term representative government.

492
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,870
The sovereign

493
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,710
is not four hubs.

494
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,980
The people or some faction of the people
ruling directly in their collective

495
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,634
capacity.

496
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:31,960
Uh,

497
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,850
the sovereign is four hubs.

498
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:38,910
The artificially reconstructed will
of the people in the person of their

499
00:24:39,221 --> 00:24:40,150
representative,

500
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,620
the sovereign representative act,

501
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,330
you might say like a filter for the
wills and passions of the people.

502
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,690
The sovereign is not the direct
expression of my will or your will,

503
00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:00,510
but rather an abstraction from my
natural desire to rule myself in.

504
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,250
In other words,

505
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:08,251
instead of seeking to participate
directly in political rule,

506
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:14,370
Hobbes wants us to abstain from
politics by agreeing to be ruled by this

507
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:16,930
artificial man is,

508
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:21,931
he calls it this artificial person or
representative that he gives the name,

509
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,033
the sovereign

510
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,720
four by art.

511
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:32,810
He says in the introduction for by art
is created that great leviathan called

512
00:25:33,451 --> 00:25:35,010
the Commonwealth or the state,

513
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:40,790
which is but an artificial man though
of greater stature and strength than the

514
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:46,221
natural for whose protection
and defense it was intended to.

515
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:47,101
Sovereign,

516
00:25:47,101 --> 00:25:47,641
he says,

517
00:25:47,641 --> 00:25:48,660
are Leviathan,

518
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,910
this great artificial man.

519
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:55,650
It isn't that the sovereign is something
more like what we would call today an

520
00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:00,710
office rather than a person is when we
speak of the executive as an office.

521
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,350
Uh,

522
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,100
and it is the,

523
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,340
it is simply the person
who inhabits the office.

524
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,620
Uh,

525
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,453
although

526
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,240
that might be somewhat questionable in
some of our recent executive decisions.

527
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,590
But for Hobbes,

528
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,080
Hobbes creates this office of,

529
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,020
of of a political of
call call the sovereign.

530
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,360
Now there's language in that
sentence that I just read from,

531
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:33,390
from the introduction for by art again
is created that great leviathan called a

532
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:40,000
Commonwealth or state when
hubs uses the term art,

533
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,021
there are four.

534
00:26:41,021 --> 00:26:42,730
By art is created.

535
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,220
That term is deeply
revealing of his purpose.

536
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:49,740
Again,

537
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,790
for Aristotle,

538
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,590
by contrast,

539
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,270
art presupposes nature or in other words,

540
00:26:57,271 --> 00:26:59,100
nature precedes art.

541
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,150
Nature supplies the standards,

542
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,710
the materials,

543
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,580
the models.

544
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,070
For all the later arts,

545
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,440
the city being by nature,

546
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,790
man by nature,

547
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,660
nature provides a
standard nature proceeds,

548
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,110
art and human artifice or human making.

549
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,580
But for Hobbs.

550
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:21,930
Think of this,

551
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,830
think of this by contrast are,

552
00:27:23,831 --> 00:27:26,340
does not so much inner imitate nature.

553
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:31,970
Rather art can create a new kind of nature
and artificial nature and artificial

554
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,630
person as it were.

555
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,790
Do Art again is created
the Great Leviathan.

556
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,570
Do art properly,

557
00:27:45,571 --> 00:27:47,280
understood and buy art?

558
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:47,791
Of course.

559
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,280
I mean something like human making,

560
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:51,750
human ingenuity,

561
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:52,561
human art,

562
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:52,871
Ful,

563
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:53,704
ness,

564
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,450
uh,

565
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,410
through art we can begin
not just to imitate,

566
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:00,240
but we can transform nature.

567
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,450
Make it into something of our own.

568
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:08,570
Choosing art here is not to be understood
also is the antithesis of science is

569
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:14,400
when we speak of the arts
and the sciences rather.

570
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,820
Science a is the highest form of art.

571
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,880
Science is the highest kind
of human making a science
or what Hobbs simply calls

572
00:28:24,881 --> 00:28:29,881
by the term name reason is simply the
fullest expression of human artfulness

573
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:32,940
reason he stays in chapter five.

574
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:36,900
Reason is not as sense
and memory born with us.

575
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,670
Reason is not born with us
nor gotten by experience,

576
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:42,900
only he says,

577
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,120
but is it tainted by industry?

578
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,570
First in APP imposing of names.

579
00:28:48,571 --> 00:28:49,381
And secondly,

580
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:51,780
by getting a good and orderly method.

581
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,320
I think of those terms,

582
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,603
um,

583
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,800
reason and again,

584
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:03,801
he uses this synonymously with other
terms like science or art is not simply

585
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,490
born with us.

586
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:10,491
It is not simply a genetic endowment nor
is it simply the product of experience

587
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,340
which Hobbs caused by the name prudence,

588
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,070
but rather reason.

589
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:17,461
He says,

590
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:20,970
is it chained by industry by uh,

591
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
by work and it's develop.

592
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:28,740
First he says bite you the imposing
imposing of names on things.

593
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,390
The correct names aren't things.

594
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,800
And second,

595
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:36,801
by getting a good and orderly method of
study reason consists in the imposition

596
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:44,331
of a method for the conquest of nature
by science hubs tells us he means the

597
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:49,150
knowledge of consequences.

598
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,660
And especially he goes on to say when we
see how anything comes about upon what

599
00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:57,100
causes and by what manner.

600
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,130
When like causes come into our power,

601
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,700
we can see how to make
it produce like effects.

602
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,670
We can see how to make it produce like,

603
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,230
like effects a reason.

604
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,970
Science art is that is
the capacity to transform,

605
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,220
transform nature,

606
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:15,940
uh,

607
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,990
by making it,

608
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:22,170
imposing on it a method that will
produce like effects after similar

609
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:24,281
consequences.

610
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:24,671
There is,

611
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:25,211
in other words,

612
00:30:25,211 --> 00:30:30,211
that kind of radically transformative
view of reason and knowledge and science,

613
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,310
political science,

614
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:36,250
civil science running
throughout Hobbs is work.

615
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,460
Reason is not about simple observation,

616
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,510
but rather it is about making production.

617
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,321
Or as he says,

618
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:48,760
making light consequences
produce the desired effects.

619
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,570
We can have a science of politics.

620
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:57,130
Hobbes believes we can ever civil science
because politics is a matter of human

621
00:30:57,131 --> 00:30:57,730
making,

622
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,750
of human doing,

623
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,520
of human goings on.

624
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,250
We can know the political world.

625
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:07,240
We can create a science of
politics because we make it.

626
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,170
It is something constructed by us hubs.

627
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:13,480
This goal here is,

628
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:18,220
is it worth to liberate knowledge to
liberate science from subservience or

629
00:31:18,221 --> 00:31:21,790
dependence upon nature or by chance,

630
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,800
by on Fortuna,

631
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:28,801
by turning science into a tool for
remaking nature to fit our needs,

632
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,960
to impose our,

633
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,010
uh,

634
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,740
needs or satisfy our needs through,

635
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,090
through our science,

636
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,080
art,

637
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,070
and especially the political art
is a matter of reordering nature,

638
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,150
even human nature.

639
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,220
First according to Hobbs,

640
00:31:45,221 --> 00:31:50,221
by resolving it into its most elementary
units and then by reconstructing it so

641
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:55,120
that it will produce the desired results,

642
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,400
much like a physicist,

643
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,240
uh,

644
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,410
in a laboratory mice,

645
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,440
this is Hobbes is answer to Machiavelli's
famous call and chapter 25 to master

646
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:09,730
for tuna to master chance or luck fortune.

647
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,810
But you might say,

648
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:13,690
hubs goes further than Machiavelli.

649
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,280
Machiavelli said in that famous
chapter 25 that the prints,

650
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:19,240
if he's lucky,

651
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,780
will my master for tuna
about half the time,

652
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,330
only about 50% of the time,

653
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:27,460
the rest of human action,

654
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:30,650
the rest of state craft
will be really left to,

655
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,050
to chance luck,

656
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:34,180
contingency circumstances.

657
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:34,960
Uh,

658
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,290
Hobbes believes that armed
with the proper method,

659
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,320
with the proper art or scientific doctrine
that we might eventually become the

660
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:46,580
masters and possessors of nature.

661
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,240
And I use that term masters
in possessors of nature,

662
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:55,241
a term not of Hobbs is making but of
day coat from the sixth part of the

663
00:32:55,431 --> 00:33:00,431
discourse on method because I think it
perfectly expresses Hobbs as aspirations

664
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:03,740
to not only to create
a science of politics,

665
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:08,750
but to create a kind of immortal
Commonwealth which is based on science and

666
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:13,751
therefore based on the proper
civil science and therefore
will be impervious to

667
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,620
fluctuation,

668
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,300
a decay,

669
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:17,870
uh,

670
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:22,790
and war and conflict which all
other previous societies have,

671
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,900
have experienced.

672
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,680
You can begin to see in other words,

673
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:32,681
in Hobbs is brief introduction to his
book as well as the opening chapters.

674
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,520
Uh,

675
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:39,520
you can really see the
immensely transformative and
really revolutionary spirit,

676
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:40,480
uh,

677
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,313
underlying,

678
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:41,840
uh,

679
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,380
this,

680
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:42,980
this,

681
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,220
uh,

682
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,080
this amazing,

683
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,010
amazing book.

684
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,973
Oh,

685
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,500
so where do we go from here?

686
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:03,690
We turned from methodology and science

687
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,090
to politics.

688
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,103
Um,

689
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,210
what is Hobbes is great question.

690
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,390
Always important when reading,

691
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,220
starting out with a new book,

692
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:26,060
asking yourself what question
is the author trying to answer?

693
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,980
What is the question?

694
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:34,990
And it's not always easy to ask answer
because sometimes they don't always make

695
00:34:36,331 --> 00:34:40,220
their deepest or most
fundamental questions altogether.

696
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,153
Clear.

697
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,030
In the case of Leviathan,

698
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,490
I would suggest to you,

699
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,553
uh,

700
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,730
hubs is central.

701
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,470
Central question is what
makes authority possible.

702
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,820
What is the source of authority?

703
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,621
And you might say,

704
00:35:02,621 --> 00:35:05,290
what renders it legitimate?

705
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:11,660
Maybe the question is what makes
legitimate authority possible?

706
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,640
Still,

707
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,640
this is still a huge question for us when
we think about a Cree nation building

708
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,150
and building new states,

709
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,043
uh,

710
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,120
how to create a legitimate authority.

711
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,780
Obviously there's a tremendous issue
with this in Iraq today is we try,

712
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,670
it's people there and
here struggle with what,

713
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,421
what would,

714
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:37,770
what would constitute
a legitimate authority?

715
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,830
Perhaps we should airlift,

716
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,783
uh,

717
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,560
copies of Leviathan to
them because that's hubs.

718
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,270
That's the issue that Hobbes is
fundamentally concerned with.

719
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,410
How his,

720
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,850
his question goes further.

721
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,800
How can individuals

722
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,450
who are biologically autonomous,

723
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:03,530
who judge in see matters very differently
from one another who can never be sure

724
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:06,840
whether they trust one another?

725
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,130
How can such individuals
except a common authority,

726
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,360
and again that is not just
what constitutes authority,

727
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:17,460
but what makes authority legitimate.

728
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,720
That remains not only the
fundamental question for Hobbs,

729
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,830
but for the entire,

730
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:27,890
at least for the entire social contract
tradition that he helped or he he,

731
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,600
he helped to establish.

732
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,001
You might say,

733
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:33,481
of course,

734
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:38,310
the question what renders authority
legitimate is only possible.

735
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,100
It was only raised when
authority is in question.

736
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:46,130
That is to say when the rules Governing
Authority has broken down in times of

737
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:49,710
crisis and that was certainly
true in Hobbs is time,

738
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:51,780
a time of civil war and crisis.

739
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:52,440
What?

740
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,920
What renders authority
legitimate are respectable.

741
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,320
And to answer that question,

742
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,020
hubs tells a story,

743
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:02,950
okay.

744
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:06,520
He tells a story about something
he calls the state of nature

745
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,360
a term he did not invent,

746
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:15,460
but with which he will his name will
always and forever be associated.

747
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,770
The idea of the state of nature.

748
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:24,300
The state of nature is not a gift of
grace or a state of grace from which we

749
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:28,990
have fallen is in the
biblical account of Eden.

750
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,160
Uh,

751
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,740
nor is this is the state of nature,

752
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:37,450
a political condition as maintained
in some sense by Aristotle.

753
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,400
When he says the Polis is by nature,

754
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,260
the state of nature for hubs,

755
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,090
uh,

756
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,610
is it condition of conflict and war?

757
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:48,980
Okay.

758
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,810
In by a state of nature,

759
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:52,700
he means or by a state of war,

760
00:37:52,701 --> 00:37:57,701
he means a condition where there is no
recognized authority in his language to

761
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:00,410
keep us in awe,

762
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,990
no authority to awe.

763
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:03,681
Uh,

764
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:04,514
us,

765
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:05,563
uh,

766
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,770
such a condition.

767
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:11,450
State of war may mean a
condition of open warfare,

768
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:11,870
but,

769
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,780
but not necessarily it can signify battle,

770
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,440
but hubs says it can also signify the
will to contend simply the desire or the

771
00:38:21,861 --> 00:38:26,060
will to engage in conflict
renders something.

772
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:26,720
Uh,

773
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,160
like a state of nature.

774
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,320
A state of war can include,

775
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:30,891
in other words,

776
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,780
what we might call a Cold War,

777
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:33,710
uh,

778
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,760
to hostile,

779
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,250
looking at each other across
a barrier of some type,

780
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:43,120
not clear or not certain
what the other will do.

781
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:48,310
So the state of nature is not necessarily
a condition of actual fighting,

782
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:52,180
but what he calls a known
disposition to fight.

783
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,740
If you are known or believed
to be willing to fight,

784
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,060
you're in a state of war.

785
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,720
It is a condition for
hubs of maximum security.

786
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,830
Where in his famous
formula life is solitary,

787
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,903
poor,

788
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,893
nasty,

789
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,790
brutish and short.

790
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,280
Okay.

791
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,720
Perhaps he should have said,

792
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,160
fortunately short.

793
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,893
Uh,

794
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,420
this is the natural condition,

795
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,370
the state of nature,

796
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,880
the state of war that
Hobbes attributes to,

797
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:25,770
uh,

798
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,410
again the fundamental
fact of human nature.

799
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,040
Now his claim that the state of nature
is the condition that we are naturally

800
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:38,240
did.

801
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,090
The state of war rather is a
condition that we are naturally in,

802
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:47,750
is to say among other things that nature
does not unite us in peace and harmony,

803
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,500
in friendship or in solidarity.

804
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,960
If nature is a norm,

805
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:55,680
uh,

806
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,580
it does not,

807
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,360
again mandate or incline us to peace,

808
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,820
friendship and solidarity with others.

809
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:06,540
Only human art or science or art.

810
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,180
Human contrivance can bring about peace,

811
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,800
conflict in war.

812
00:40:10,801 --> 00:40:14,250
Our primary piece is derivative.

813
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,960
In other words for Hobbs Authority and
Relations of authority do not arise

814
00:40:21,811 --> 00:40:25,650
naturally among us but are rather again,

815
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,870
like civil science itself,

816
00:40:27,871 --> 00:40:30,120
the product of contrivance or art.

817
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:37,120
So the question for us remains is it
was deeply challenged readers and Hobbes

818
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,411
his own time.

819
00:40:39,411 --> 00:40:44,411
What makes hubs is story is I'm calling
it his story about the state of nature

820
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,730
being a condition of what,

821
00:40:46,731 --> 00:40:48,020
what makes it plausible,

822
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,030
what makes it believable?

823
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,050
Uh,

824
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,850
as an account of,

825
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:53,481
again,

826
00:40:53,481 --> 00:40:55,580
the condition we are naturally in,

827
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,150
why should we believe Hobbs is story?

828
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,320
Uh,

829
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,160
and uh,

830
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,581
not,

831
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:04,750
not some other story

832
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,613
from,

833
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,240
no,

834
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,070
I just want to say a word about that.

835
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:15,980
Before closing

836
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,720
from one point of view,

837
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,133
bleeding Hobbs,

838
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:27,030
his account of the state of nature seems
to derive from his physics of motion

839
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:32,230
and rest in the opening chapters
of the via and he begins to work.

840
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,393
You remember,

841
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:34,250
uh,

842
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,200
within an account of human nature,

843
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:41,860
kind of human psychology as product
is a product of sense and experience.

844
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:48,220
We are bodies in motion and who cannot
help but obey the law or the physics of

845
00:41:49,161 --> 00:41:50,660
attraction and repulsion.

846
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,660
We are bodies in constant motion.

847
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:54,741
He seems,

848
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:55,551
in other words,

849
00:41:55,551 --> 00:42:00,551
to have a kind of materialistic psychology
in which human behavior exhibits the

850
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:02,750
same as it were,

851
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:07,751
mechanical tendencies as billiard balls
that can be understood as obeying again,

852
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:13,970
geometric or causal processes
of cause and effect,

853
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:14,804
right.

854
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,110
The state of nature is not seen by him,

855
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:18,890
uh,

856
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:22,640
as an actual historical
condition in some ways,

857
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:23,330
although he,

858
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,440
he occasionally,

859
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:25,031
uh,

860
00:42:25,031 --> 00:42:29,660
we'll refer to what we might think
of as anthropological evidence to,

861
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,680
um,

862
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,020
to support his views
in the state of nature.

863
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,270
But the state of nature for him,

864
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:35,750
uh,

865
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,000
is rather a kind of thought experiment,

866
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:38,810
uh,

867
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,870
after the manner of experimental science.

868
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:46,871
It is a kind of thought experiments
consists of taking human beings who are

869
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:51,380
members of families of
estates of Kingdoms and so on,

870
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:56,240
dissolving these social relations
into their fundamental units,

871
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,090
namely the abstract individuals.

872
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,290
And then imagining again in the
manner of a chemist or a physicist,

873
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,580
how these basic units would
hypothetically interact with one another.

874
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,360
Again,

875
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,170
almost like the properties of
chemical substances in some ways.

876
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:15,140
How would we behave in this?

877
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:15,741
Again,

878
00:43:15,741 --> 00:43:15,891
this,

879
00:43:15,891 --> 00:43:18,170
this kind of thought experiment

880
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,680
that would be one way of
reading or that Hobbes seems to,

881
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,650
wants us to think about
the state of nature as a,

882
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:28,161
as again,

883
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:28,930
an expert,

884
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:29,150
as,

885
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:29,420
as,

886
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:29,691
as,

887
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:32,480
as a kin to a scientific experiment.

888
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:33,680
Uh,

889
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,790
hubs is the,

890
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:35,541
again,

891
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:40,541
the great founder of what we might call
the x among others is the experimental

892
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,570
method in social and political science.

893
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,810
And there's a reason perhaps
a reason for this too,

894
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,700
and I'll end just on this note.

895
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:51,350
When Hobbs was a young man,

896
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,520
uh,

897
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,960
he worked as a private
secretary for a short time,

898
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:00,020
a private secretary to uh,

899
00:44:00,021 --> 00:44:04,670
another very famous Englishman
by the name of Francis Bacon,

900
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,980
the great founder of what we think
of as the experimental method.

901
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,133
Uh,

902
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,200
the method of trial and error
of experience and experiment.

903
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,430
Uh,

904
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:21,430
and it arguably Hobbes was
influenced in many ways by,

905
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:25,640
by Bacon's own philosophy of experience.

906
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:30,641
And experiment and Hobbes took
Bacon's method in some ways,

907
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,520
applying it to politics,

908
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,020
tried to imagine,

909
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:34,381
again,

910
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:39,240
the natural condition of human
beings and what we are by nature,

911
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,980
by UB strapped,

912
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:45,981
by a process of abstraction
and abstracting all of the
relations and properties

913
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:52,590
that we have acquired over history,

914
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:55,770
through customed to experience
stripping those away,

915
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:01,100
like the layers of an onion and putting
us almost as it were in an experimental

916
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:03,690
test tube or an under a microscope.

917
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,310
Seeing how we would,

918
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:05,791
uh,

919
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:10,230
under those conditions react
and behave with one another.

920
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,360
I'll leave it at that,

921
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:13,550
although I want to tell,

922
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:18,620
I will start next week by showing how
that view of hubs is only at best,

923
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:20,370
partially correct.

924
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:21,600
Uh,

925
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,433
so anyway,

926
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,070
have a wonderful weekend
with your parents here and,

927
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:26,610
uh,

928
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:27,660
I'll see you next week.
