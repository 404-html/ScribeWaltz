1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,930
Okay.
Where are we?

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,410
Today we're going to study,

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,420
I'm going to talk about Aristotle's,
Aristotle's comparative politics

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,010
and focusing on the idea of the regime.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,800
This is the theme that you
remember in the opening day. Uh,

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,810
I said was really the central concept
or the leading thread of this,

7
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:28,160
of this course,

8
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:33,161
and it's in books three through six of
Aristotle's politics that he develops.

9
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,730
Uh, his, his idea of rich,

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,840
of the regime and regime politics books
book one that we spoke about last time

11
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,770
really in a way tells us
something about the, uh,

12
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,080
you might say almost the metaphysics
of Aristotle's politics today.

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,290
Aristotle speaks more empirically,

14
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,060
more politically about what a regime is.

15
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,683
Yeah.

16
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,290
His idea of regime [inaudible] again,
the same word,

17
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:14,291
the same word that was used for the title
of Plato's Republic is the centerpiece

18
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,500
of Aristotle's politics.
Literally,

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,360
it occupies the, the theme of the
third of the middle three books,

20
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:24,650
books three through six.

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,300
These books are difficult in many ways.
They're complicated.

22
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:31,730
They're not everybody's
favorite part of the book,

23
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,760
but they are my favorite part because
it tells us more precisely than anywhere

24
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:38,234
else.

25
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,330
How Aristotle understands the nature
of politics in that after all,

26
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,440
it's what we are most interested in.

27
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,890
A regime refers to both the formal in
numeration of rights and duties within a

28
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:52,994
community,

29
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:59,110
but it also addresses something closer
to what we would call the way of life or

30
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:04,610
the culture of the people. There
are distinctive customs, manners,

31
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,930
laws, habits, moral
dispositions and sentiments.

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,760
And Aristotle's constitutional theorizing
begins by asking a simple question,

33
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:19,680
what is the identity of a city?
What?

34
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:24,110
What gives it its identity and
enduring existence over time?

35
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,390
And his answer is the regime.

36
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,580
The regime is what gives a
people in the city its identity.

37
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Aristotle distinguishes between what
he calls the matter and the form of the

38
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:47,600
regime.
Let me examine both of these.

39
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,850
In turn, the matter, the substance,

40
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,510
the material basis of the regimes
concerns it's citizen body.

41
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,160
That is to say the character
of those who constitute a city.

42
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,460
And here he reject a number
of alternatives for what
constitutes a citizen body.

43
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,910
He rejects the idea that the city is
defined simply by a group of people who

44
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:18,400
inhabit a common territory,
the same space as it were.

45
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:20,740
The identity of a Paul as he writes,

46
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,010
is not constituted by its walls at is to
say it is not constituted by geography

47
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,330
alone.
And similarly,

48
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:33,331
he rejects the idea that a regime can
be understood as a defensive alliance

49
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,880
against invasion by
others. Uh, in our terms,

50
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:43,150
for example,
NATO would not be a regime,

51
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,470
a purely military or defense of alliance.
And finally,

52
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:51,490
he denies the possibility
that a regime exists,

53
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:56,491
that whenever a number of people come
together to establish commercial relations

54
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:59,080
with one another,
uh,

55
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,160
organizations like Nafta or the WTO,

56
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,870
the World Trade Organization,

57
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:09,670
do not a regime make a regime
cannot be understood simply as a,

58
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,620
as a commercial, uh, alliance.
What is a regime then?

59
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,600
It is evident. Aristotle said, this is it.

60
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:21,601
A city is not a partnership in a location
or for the sake of not committing

61
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:26,590
injustice against one another
or for transacting business.

62
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,900
So what is a citizen body?

63
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:30,990
Okay.

64
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,450
The citizens who constitute a regime.

65
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,670
He tells us do more than
occupy a common space,

66
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,060
but are held together according to
Aristotle by bonds of common affection.

67
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,740
It is affection,
loyalty,

68
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,190
and friendship that make up a regime.

69
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,100
This sort of thing.

70
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,600
He says this political partnership
is the work of affection.

71
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,280
Phi Leah is,

72
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:07,281
his word is the work of affection for
affection is the intentional choice of

73
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:12,150
living together 1288
if anyone's interested.

74
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,240
It is the intentional
choice of living together.

75
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:18,810
Friendship he writes is the
greatest of good things for cities,

76
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,710
for when people feel
affection for each other,

77
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:25,200
they are less likely
to fall into conflict.

78
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,850
But what kind of friendship
is he talking about?

79
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,240
Is it the kind of friendship that,
uh,

80
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:38,241
you feel for your best friend
or for your parents or siblings?

81
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,330
What kind of friendship are these bonds
of affection that he says holds the city

82
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:47,520
together and that make it a regime?

83
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:58,130
Political friendships he tells us are not
the kind of thing that us to forgo our

84
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:04,151
own individual identities in the way that
one might find in passionate relations

85
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:06,284
of love.

86
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,943
Right?

87
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,900
We had did they presuppose relations
that is to say political relations,

88
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:18,550
not between lovers or even
best friends of some kind,

89
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:23,551
but between civic partners who may
in fact be intensely rivalrous and

90
00:06:24,821 --> 00:06:29,821
competitive with one another for positions
of political office and honor civic

91
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:33,880
friendship, civic five Leah
is there, in other words,

92
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:38,881
not without a strong element of what
might be thought of as sibling rivalry in

93
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:45,091
which each citizen strives to outdo the
others for the sake of this civic good.

94
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:52,110
Many of you have siblings and know a
little bit about what sibling rivalry is

95
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:56,620
like siblings is,
everyone knows maybe the best of friends,

96
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,240
but this does not exclude
strong elements of competition,

97
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,520
rivalry and even conflict for
the attention of the parents

98
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,010
and fellow citizens for Aristotle are
like siblings each competing with one

99
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:14,510
another for the esteem,

100
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,080
the affection and the recognition of the
city that serves for them as a kind of

101
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:22,250
surrogate parent.

102
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,920
That is the way that Aristotle
understands a civic body, a citizen body,

103
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,590
so that when he says that citizens are
held together by Chi ties of common

104
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:35,930
affection,
he means something very specific.

105
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,790
The civic bond is more than an aggregate
of mirror self interest or rational

106
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:50,831
calculation as was going to be defended
by someone like Thomas Hobbes or by most

107
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,310
of today's modern economists who believe
that society can be understood simply

108
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:04,391
as a series of rational transactions
between buyers and sellers of different

109
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:10,151
goods and that can be modeled along
some kind of game theoretic lines.

110
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:13,370
Aristotle denies this,
explicitly denies this.

111
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,800
He seems to have known something about
the modern economic theory of society

112
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:22,700
long before modern economics
was even developed.

113
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,651
But again,

114
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:29,651
when Aristotle speaks of the kinds
of affection that hold a citizen body

115
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:30,471
together,

116
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:35,471
he does not mean anything like the bonds
of personal intimacy that characterize

117
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,970
private friendships.

118
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,000
What he means when speaking about civic
affection is more like the bonds of

119
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:44,834
loyalty,

120
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,320
camaraderie that hold together
members of a team or a club.

121
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,650
These are more than,
again, ties of mutual.

122
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,280
They require loyalty.
Trust.

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,710
What social scientists today
sometimes call social capital.

124
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,550
That successful societies
requires social capital.

125
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,750
A distinguished political
scientist at another university.

126
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,610
I will not mention its name
here at another university,

127
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:22,611
has spoken about the importance of social
capital or trust as the sort of basic,

128
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,910
uh, relation, the basic component of a,

129
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,940
of a healthy democracy.
Aristotle knew that he didn't,

130
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,980
he didn't use a kind of ugly social
scientific word like social capital.

131
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,030
Rather, he spoke about civic
friendship and Phi Leah,

132
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,960
the political partnership, he
says, must therefore be regarded

133
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,020
as being for the sake of noble actions
and not just for the sake of living

134
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:55,670
together. The city, as
he likes to say, exists,

135
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,790
the regime exists not
merely for the sake of life,

136
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,410
but for what he understands
to be the good life,

137
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,060
the life of friendship,
that life of, again,

138
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:13,440
competitive relations for
positions of honor and office.

139
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,500
So we can say that a regime is in the
first instance constituted by its citizen,

140
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:24,060
but it's citizen bodies. Citizens are
those who share a common way of life,

141
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,000
the citizen in an unqualified sense.

142
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:32,001
Aristotle writes is defined by no other
things so much as sharing in decision

143
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:37,950
and office
or as he puts it a little bit later.

144
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,980
Whoever is entitled to participate in
an office involved in deliberation or

145
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:45,870
decision making is a citizen of the city.

146
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,580
Listen to the words he uses
there in describing the citizen.

147
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
A citizen is one who takes sharing in
decision in office who participates in

148
00:10:57,661 --> 00:11:01,770
deliberation and decision
making as citizen is one.

149
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:06,770
Therefore who not only enjoys
the protection of the law
is not merely you might

150
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:12,480
say a passive beneficiary of the
protection of society and its laws,

151
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:17,481
but is one who takes a share in shaping
the laws and who participates in

152
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:22,320
political rule and deliberation.
Aristotle even notes,

153
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,670
you probably observed that
his definition of the citizen,

154
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:31,671
he says it's most appropriate to
citizens of democracy were in his famous

155
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:36,450
formulation. Everyone knows how
to rule and be ruled in turn.

156
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,340
It is this reflection and the character
of the citizen that leads him to wonder

157
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:48,450
whether the good citizen in the good
human being are one and the same.

158
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,770
Can One, can a person be
both as it were, a good man,

159
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,750
a good person and a good citizen?

160
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,260
Famous discussion in Aristotle's book,

161
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,740
Aristotle answer to this is
perhaps deliberately obscure.

162
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,250
The good citizen he tells us is
still relative to the regime.

163
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,160
That is to say the good
citizen of a democracy,

164
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:23,260
well not necessarily be the same person
or the same kind of person is the good

165
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:28,261
citizen of a monarchy or an aristocracy
citizen virtue is relative or we might

166
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:33,970
say regime relative only in
the best regime. He says,

167
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:37,420
well the good citizen and the
good human being be the same,

168
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,880
but what is the best regime,

169
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,110
at least at this point he has not told us.

170
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,910
The point he's trying to make is
there are several kinds of regimes and

171
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:53,380
therefore several kinds of
citizenship appropriate to them.

172
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,240
Each regime is constituted by it's matter.

173
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,390
That is to say by its citizen
body as we've been talking about,

174
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,520
but also now by its form,
by its formal structures.

175
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,520
That is to say every regime will also
be a set of institutions and formal

176
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:15,590
structures that give shape to it.

177
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:18,670
Citizens regimes or constitutions,

178
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:23,671
you might say our farms or formalities
that the determine how power is shared

179
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,360
and distributed amongst
citizens. Every regime, uh,

180
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,050
is an answer, uh, consciously or,

181
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:40,110
or not to the oldest political
question of all who governs who,

182
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,970
who should govern.

183
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,140
Every regime is an answer to that question
because every regime sets forward a

184
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:55,501
way of distributing formally distributing
powers and distributing offices among

185
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,310
its citizen body. So we move now
from the matter of the regime.

186
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:06,311
It's what constitutes its citizens and
its citizen body to the question of the

187
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:10,000
form of the regime. It's
forms, it's formalities,

188
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:13,180
its structures and institutions.
You might say

189
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,280
entirely too much of modern political
science is focused on simply the forms and

190
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:26,230
formalities of political life.
Not Enough in my opinion,

191
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:29,860
with questions of the
citizen body and what makes,

192
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,040
what constitutes the character or
the virtue in Aristotle's term of its

193
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:36,370
citizens.
But nevertheless,

194
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Aristotle gives extraordinary
importance and attention to the forms or

195
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:45,430
formalities that make up a regime.
What, what does he mean by that?

196
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,150
Aristotle defines this
strictly formal criteria,

197
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,230
other polity or twice in his politics.

198
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,640
And I'm sure you noted both
times where they appeared. Yes.

199
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,240
Yeah.

200
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,540
Book three chapters,
six famous definition.

201
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,430
The regime he says is an arrangement of
a city and arrangement of a city with

202
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:13,960
respect to its offices,

203
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,920
particularly the one who has the
authority over all matters for what has

204
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:21,970
authority in the city is everywhere.

205
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:26,050
The governing body and the
governing body is the regime.

206
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,430
The regime is an arrangement of a city.

207
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:35,600
He says with respect to
its offices in every city,

208
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,290
we'll have a governing body.
That governing body being the regime.

209
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,180
The second definition

210
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,770
appears at the beginning of book four
chapter one for a regime he writes is an

211
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:53,831
arrangement in cities connected with
offices establishing the manner in which

212
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,640
they have been distributed,

213
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:01,210
what the authoritative element of
the regime is and what the end of the

214
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:04,220
partnership is.
In each case

215
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,800
a similar but slightly different
definition of what constitutes the formal

216
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:18,060
structure of regime politics,
but from these two definitions

217
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,640
appearing in book three Chapter Six and
book for Chapter One we learned a number

218
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:26,770
of important things.

219
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:33,210
First is to repeat a regime concerns
the manner in which power is divided or

220
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:35,800
distributed in a community.

221
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,130
This is what Aristotle means when he
uses the phrase in arrangement of a city

222
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:44,740
with respect to its offices.
In other words,

223
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:49,660
every regime will be based on some
kind of judgment of how power should be

224
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:54,661
distributed to the one to the few or the
many to use the Aristotelian categories

225
00:16:57,071 --> 00:17:01,270
of political rule or, or
some mixture. Uh, some,

226
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,300
some mixture of those three classes that
constitute every city in every regime.

227
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:11,320
One of these groups he says will be
the dominant class will be the dominant

228
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,180
body,
the ruling body,

229
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,190
as he says in that definition
and that ruling body will intern.

230
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,920
He says,
define the nature of the regime.

231
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,180
But Aristotle tells us something
more than this. A regime,

232
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:37,170
his regime topology is to say his division
of power is division of regimes into

233
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,250
the rule of the one,

234
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:44,251
the few and the many is based not
only on how powers are distributed,

235
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,590
that's purely factual base way.

236
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,780
He also distinguishes between
regimes that are well ordered,

237
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:59,590
well governed and those that are corrupt.
Uh,

238
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,420
those that are well, those
that are corrupt, what,

239
00:18:02,421 --> 00:18:05,940
what does he mean in
terms of this distinction?

240
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,980
Aristotle's distinction is now
seems to be not only empirical, uh,

241
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:13,730
again, based on the factual
distribution of powers,

242
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,210
it seems to have a non at what we,

243
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,820
what we might call today a
normative component to it.

244
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,560
It makes a distinction or a judgement
between the well ordered in the deviant

245
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,060
regimes, the corrupt
regimes. On the one side,

246
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:30,840
he tells us the well ordered
regimes are monarchy,

247
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,850
aristocracy and what he calls polity
rule of the one, the few and the many.

248
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,040
And on the corrupt side he calls,
he describes them. Is Tyranny,

249
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:45,420
oligarchy and democracy also ruled
by the one, the few and the many.

250
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,750
But what criteria we want to know does
he use to distinguish between these,

251
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,800
uh, as it were six fold a
classification of regimes.

252
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,830
How does he distinguish the well ordered
regimes from the corrupt regimes?

253
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,100
And here is where Aristotle's analysis
gets in some ways maddeningly tricky,

254
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,050
uh,

255
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,080
because in many ways of his general
reluctance to condemn any regime out of

256
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:21,810
hand. If you were to read, uh,

257
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,580
more than I had assigned for you in class,
if you were to read throughout,

258
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,550
through, through all of
books, six, for example,

259
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:35,870
you would find Aristotle not
only giving advice to Democrats,

260
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,100
uh, democracies and other regimes
on how to preserve themselves.

261
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:44,550
You would find a lengthy
discussion description of how,

262
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:47,540
of how tyrants should,
uh,

263
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,240
moderate or how tyrants learn to
preserve and defend their own regime.

264
00:19:55,141 --> 00:20:00,141
It seems as if it seems almost as if
living before the incarnation of pure evil

265
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,950
in the 20th century with the
rise of modern totalitarianisms,

266
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:11,820
that Aristotle seems to think
that no regime was so bad.

267
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:17,210
No regime was so devoid of goodness that
its preservation was not worth at least

268
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:18,900
some effort.

269
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:23,930
Think of that rather in many ways he
provides reasoned arguments for the

270
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:29,700
strengths and weaknesses of
several different regime types.

271
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,980
But consider, uh, the one that's
closest to our own democracy,

272
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,850
let's consider what Aristotle
has to tell us about that regime.

273
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:48,160
In fact, it would be an interesting
question for people to consider. Uh,

274
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,040
do you know how would Aristotle,
uh,

275
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:56,350
confront or what would his analysis
be of a regime like Hitler's Germany,

276
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,240
uh, Stalin's Russia,
the around of Khomeini,

277
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,400
uh, regimes that, uh,
are clearly tyrannies,

278
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:12,090
but do they even go beyond in some way
the tyrannies that Aristotle spoke about?

279
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:15,100
And what kind of advice,
what would he,

280
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:19,030
what would he have to say about them in
any way? Let's think about democracy.

281
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,601
Interestingly,

282
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:27,601
we find Aristotle defending democracy
on the grounds that it may contain

283
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,920
collectively greater wisdom
then originally am ruled
by the one or the fuel.

284
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,830
In Book Three, Chapter 11,
for example, he writes for,

285
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:44,830
because they are many,
that is to say the citizen body,

286
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:46,420
the ruling body of a democracy,

287
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:51,450
each can have a part of virtue and
prudence and on their uniting together and

288
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:53,440
under joining together,

289
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:58,441
he says the multitude with its many
feet and hands and having many centers

290
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,960
becomes he writes like
a single human being.

291
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,130
And so also with respect
to character and mind,

292
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,900
think of that the people in a
democracy, he says, coming together,

293
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:12,100
uniting together,

294
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:16,120
become like a single human
being with many hands and feet.

295
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,270
And he says with greater
character in mind,

296
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,490
we even here more than
any single individual.

297
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:29,470
And in the same text we
also hear Aristotle praising
the practice of ostracism.

298
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:35,130
That is to say exiling banishing goes
individuals deemed to be preeminent in any

299
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,370
particular virtue or quality.

300
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,000
And he makes a similar
point in book three,

301
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:47,650
Chapter 15 and describing the
process of democratic deliberation,

302
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:53,650
uh, as a superior means
of arriving at decisions.

303
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:57,760
He compares it to a potluck dinner.
Any one of them,

304
00:22:57,761 --> 00:23:02,410
he says that is to say any one of the
citizens taken singly is perhaps inferior

305
00:23:02,411 --> 00:23:04,180
in comparison to the best,

306
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,640
but the city is made up of many
persons just as a feast to which many

307
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:14,170
contribute. It's finer is better
than a single and simple one.

308
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,100
And on this account,

309
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,210
a crowd also judges many matters
better than a single person.

310
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,220
Furthermore, what is many he
says is more incorruptible,

311
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,710
like a greater amount of water? The many
is more incorruptible than the fuel.

312
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,380
So he gives, they're a powerful
argument in defense of democracy,

313
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,120
like a potluck dinner,

314
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,350
each individual cook may not
be as good as the best chef,

315
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:46,430
but many taken together will provide
many more dishes in many more.

316
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,910
A variety of for a variety of tastes.

317
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,920
Then does a single chef.

318
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,890
And he says, furthermore, a crowd,

319
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,000
the many is more in
incorruptible than the few,

320
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,150
uh, less light, an incorruptible.

321
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:08,000
Here I take it in a kind of
ordinary sense of the term,

322
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,100
less susceptible to bribery.

323
00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:15,101
You can't bribe a lot of people in the
way that you can a single individualistic

324
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,020
or Aristotle's views on democracy.
Correct.

325
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:20,690
Here in his analysis,
uh,

326
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,720
do in fact many chefs make for a
better dinner than a single chef.

327
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,030
Uh, well, no, no.

328
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:34,031
Would you rather have dinner at the Union
league and there's one chef or master

329
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:36,290
chef?
What would you hear there?

330
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:41,291
Have dinner with a bunch of your
friends each providing some piece of the

331
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:45,980
dinner. Wow. It's a good arm.
Gets an interesting argument.

332
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:49,270
It's open to debate it at any rate.
Yet at the same time

333
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:56,670
is Aristotle is seen defending democracy
and providing reasoned and in many

334
00:24:57,281 --> 00:25:00,430
ways,
sensible arguments for democratic regimes.

335
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,460
You find him in the same section of the
book providing a defensive kingship.

336
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:11,290
And the rule of the one
in book three, Chapter 16,

337
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,400
he considers the case of the king who
act in all things according to his own

338
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:20,980
will. One's like a kind of
absolute monarch of some kind.

339
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,030
This is the part of Aristotle's politics.

340
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:29,260
It seems closest in a way to the
idea of a platonic philosopher,

341
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,730
King King,

342
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:35,731
who rules without law and rules for the
good of all simply on the basis of his

343
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:37,900
own superiority.

344
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:42,040
Aristotle coins a term for
this kind of king overall.

345
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,170
He calls it the Pan Boster layer,

346
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,730
Basa layer being the Greek word for king,

347
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:54,700
uh, like the name. You know, people
like the name Basel Bazell Basel.

348
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,760
It's the Greek word for king
and a pan meaning universal,

349
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,920
uh, pan buster layer, the universal king.

350
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,980
The King of our Aristotle does not rule
out the possibility of such a person,

351
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:13,630
uh, emerging a person of what
he calls excessive virtue,

352
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,830
almost hyperbolic excellence.
He says,

353
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:22,831
who stands so far above the rest as to
deserve to be the natural ruler overall.

354
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:30,680
But how we want to know does Aristotle
reconcile his account of the pound Bazza

355
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,533
layer,

356
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:36,280
the king of overall with his earlier
emphasis upon democratic deliberation and

357
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:37,180
shared rule,

358
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:42,181
the citizen recall is one who
takes turn ruling and being ruled.

359
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,130
In turn,

360
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,280
when readers look at
Aristotle's account of kingship,

361
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,140
and particularly this notion of the
pond Basa layer, the king overall,

362
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,920
the suggestion must at least occurred
that there is a hidden Alexandrian or

363
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:09,441
Macedonian streak to Aristotle's political
thinking that owes more to his native

364
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,410
mastodon than to as adopted Athens.

365
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,380
The idea of universal kingship.

366
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,050
Think of Alexander the
great later on and in fact,

367
00:27:21,051 --> 00:27:23,160
in one of my favorite
passages in the book,

368
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,440
which you will read for next time,
uh,

369
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,640
I cannot resist quoting already a passage
from book seven and near the end of

370
00:27:32,971 --> 00:27:37,590
the book, book seven Chapter Seven
or Aristotle writes as follows,

371
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,150
he writes to the nations in cold
locations and Kolbe locations,

372
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:48,510
particularly in Europe,
are filled with spiritedness.

373
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:54,230
There's that platonic word again through
most are filled with thumos but lacking

374
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:59,100
in discursive thought, lacking in the
deliberative element. In other words,

375
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,730
hence they remain free
because they're through modic,

376
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,980
but they lack political governance.
Those in Asia,

377
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:12,120
on the other hand, he writes thinking,
probably hear of Persia, Egypt,

378
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:17,121
places like Egypt and Persia have
souls endowed with discursive thought,

379
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,380
but lack spiritedness lack thumos.

380
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,510
Hence they remain ruled and enslaved.

381
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,410
But then he goes on to
say the stock of Greeks,

382
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,250
Sharon both just as it holds,

383
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:36,240
he says the middle in
terms of location for itch.

384
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,490
That is to say the
Greeks are both spirited,

385
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:43,491
are both through modic in endowed with
deliberative thought and hence remain

386
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:46,740
free and governs itself
in the best manner.

387
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,860
And he writes and he concludes at the
same time is capable of ruling all should

388
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:59,181
it obtain a single regime that these
Greeks are capable of ruling all he says

389
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:05,400
all who is all, what do you mean
by the all here, the Greeks,

390
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,700
the rest of the world, uh, should are,

391
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:14,090
are capable of attaining it seems
as single hegemony a single regime,

392
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:19,140
uh, are if in fact circumstances, uh,

393
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,003
develop.

394
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,140
So here is a passage in which Aristotle
clearly seems to be pointing to the

395
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:30,141
possibility of a kind of universal
monarchy under Greek rule

396
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,560
as at least as a,
as a possibility.

397
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,480
And this passage I read at length,
uh,

398
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,320
is important, uh, for a number
of reasons. Let me just, uh,

399
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,190
try to explain

400
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,870
in the first place,

401
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,900
it provides us with crucial information
about Aristotle's thinking about the

402
00:29:55,811 --> 00:30:00,520
relations of impulse and reason of Thumos.
And reason,

403
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,790
as you might say,
the determinants of human behavior

404
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,310
are the crucial path term in
that passage is this again,

405
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:14,311
this platonic term spiritedness which
is both a cause of the human desire to

406
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:20,221
rule and at the same time a because of
our desire to resist the domination of

407
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:23,344
others,

408
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:29,220
it is the unique stores
of human assertiveness and
aggressiveness as well as the

409
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:33,580
source of resistance to
the aggression of others.

410
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,740
It's a very important psychological
concept and understanding politics.

411
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,863
And second,

412
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:47,010
the passage tells us something about
certain additional factors extra in many

413
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:48,760
ways,

414
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,760
extra political factors such as
climate and geography as components.

415
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,760
Uh,
in the development of political society.

416
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:03,810
Apparently apparently qualities such as
through most and reason through most and

417
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:08,770
deliberation are not distributed
equally and universally.

418
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:12,580
He says he distinguishes between
the peoples of the north,

419
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:14,410
he calls them the Europeans,

420
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:19,650
spirited and warlike but lacking
through most those of Persia and Egypt

421
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:26,680
containing highly developed
forms of intellectual knowledge,

422
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,100
no doubt,

423
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,180
thinking about the development of things
like science and mathematics and Egypt,

424
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:36,790
but lacking this quality of most,
which is so important for self government,

425
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:40,540
for self rule. These are one
might think about this. These,

426
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:45,370
these things he says are at least in part
determined by certain kinds of natural

427
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:50,050
or g geographic and
climatic, uh, qualities.

428
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,943
Uh,

429
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:56,190
a modern reader of this passage that
comes to mind is a skew in the spirit in

430
00:31:58,781 --> 00:31:59,491
his famous book,

431
00:31:59,491 --> 00:32:03,190
the spirit of the laws with its emphasis
upon the way in which geography and

432
00:32:03,191 --> 00:32:06,370
climate and environment,
uh,

433
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,400
become impart determinants of the kind
of political culture and political

434
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,120
behavior exhibited by different peoples.

435
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:20,380
And finally, this passage tells us
that under the right circumstances,

436
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:25,381
at least Aristotle suggests the Greeks
could exercise a kind of universal rule

437
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,300
if they chose.
He does not rule out this possibility.

438
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Perhaps it testifies to his view that
there are different kinds of regimes that

439
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,960
may be appropriate to different kinds
of situations to different situations.

440
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:49,241
There is no one size fits
all model of political life,

441
00:32:49,611 --> 00:32:53,060
but good regimes may come
in a variety of forms.

442
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:58,061
There seems to be at least built in
to Aristotle's account of politics,

443
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,130
a certain flexibility, a certain, uh,

444
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,880
latitude of discretion that in some kit
Kat passages even seems to border on a

445
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:11,720
kind of relativism.
But nevertheless,

446
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:14,060
Aristotle understands that a person,

447
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,360
this pond Basilea this person of
superlative virtue is not really to be

448
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:20,504
expected.

449
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,230
Politics is really a matter of dealing
with less than best circumstances,

450
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:32,230
which is perhaps one reason why Aristotle
gives relatively little attention to

451
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:36,500
the structure of the best regime.

452
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,320
Such a regime which I do
want to talk about tomorrow.

453
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,510
Wednesday is something to be
wished for but is not, uh,

454
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,290
for practical purposes. Something to
which he devotes a great deal of time.

455
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:49,340
Most regimes,

456
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:54,370
and for the most part we'll
be very imperfect mixtures
of the few and the many,

457
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,170
the rich and the poor.
Most regimes for the most part,

458
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:04,520
most politics for the most part will
be struggles between what he calls

459
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:09,521
oligarchies and democracies ruled by
the rich oligarchies ruled by the poor

460
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,790
democracies.
And that respect,

461
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:18,791
Aristotle seems to add an economic or
sociological category to the fundamentally

462
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:21,530
political categories of few.
And many.

463
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,430
The few are not simply
defined quantitatively,

464
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:29,120
but they are defined as it were
also sociologically the rich,

465
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:34,690
the poor again defined as the many
again defined by him as the poor.

466
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:39,410
It was not. You have to see
when you read these passages,

467
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,790
it was not Karl Marx,

468
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:46,370
but rather it was Aristotle
who first identified the

469
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,980
importance of what we would call
class struggle and politics.

470
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:56,981
Every regime is in many ways
a competition between classes,

471
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:03,790
but where he differs from Mark's right
where he differs is not is he believes

472
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:07,340
that the fundamental form of
competition between classes,

473
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:09,710
it's not just for resources.

474
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,220
It is not a struggle over who controls
what Marx calls the means of production.

475
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,680
It is a struggle over positions of honor,

476
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,220
of status and position
of positions of rule.

477
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,140
Struggle is in short political struggle,
not economic struggle.

478
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:32,230
Every regime he believes it will be in
some ways a site of Qantas station with

479
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:33,530
completing,

480
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:38,530
with competing claims to justice with the
competing claims to political rule for

481
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:40,230
who ought to rule.

482
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,390
There is, in other words, not only
a partisanship between regimes,

483
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,610
but partisanship within regimes
where citizens are activated,

484
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,290
different groups of citizens,

485
00:35:55,291 --> 00:36:00,090
different classes of citizens are
activated by rivalrous and competing

486
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,670
understandings of justice and the good,

487
00:36:02,671 --> 00:36:07,140
the Democratic faction he tells us
believes because all are equal in some

488
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:10,710
respects they should be equal.
In all respects,

489
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,820
the oligarchy tells us because
people are unequal in some respects.

490
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:19,590
They should be unequal in all respects.
For Aristotle,

491
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:24,620
the point and purpose of political science
is to mediate the causes of faction

492
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:31,050
to help causes affection that
lead to revolution and civil war.

493
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,580
Aristotle's statesman,
Aristotle state craft is political.

494
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:39,000
Science is a form of political mediation.

495
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,320
How to bring peace to
conflict ridden situations.

496
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:50,250
And it's always surprising to me that
many people think that Aristotle ignored

497
00:36:50,701 --> 00:36:55,701
or has no real theory of political
conflict when it seems to me conflict is

498
00:36:55,861 --> 00:37:00,660
built in to the very structure of his
understanding of a regime. And again,

499
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:03,870
not just conflict between rival regimes,

500
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:09,060
but conflict built into the nature of
what we could call domestic politics,

501
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:14,040
different classes contending with
different conceptions of justice.

502
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:18,570
And how can political, how can the
political scientist to bring peace,

503
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,250
bring,
uh,

504
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,520
bring moderation to these deeply
conflict ridden situations.

505
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,833
Uh,

506
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,480
Aristotle proposes,
how does he to pros to do this?

507
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:37,481
He proposes a couple of remedies to
offset the potentially warlike struggle

508
00:37:39,411 --> 00:37:41,000
between various factions.

509
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,990
And the most important of these
remedies is the rule of it.

510
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:50,060
Law Law

511
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:57,190
ensures he says the equal treatment of
all citizens and prevent arbitrary rule

512
00:37:58,421 --> 00:38:03,421
at the hands of the one the few or the
many law establishes what he says is a

513
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:06,850
kind of impartiality for law.

514
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:11,230
He says his impartiality one
who asks the law to rule.

515
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,820
You said it's in book three.

516
00:38:12,821 --> 00:38:17,821
Chapter 16 is held to be acting is held
to be asking God and intellect alone to

517
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:21,130
rule.
Why one who asks,

518
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:25,990
man asks the beast desire
is a thing of this sort.

519
00:38:25,991 --> 00:38:27,130
And spiritedness.

520
00:38:27,131 --> 00:38:32,131
He writes again through most spiritedness
perverts rulers and the best men and

521
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,010
to law is intellect,
appetite,

522
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,480
even the best men he says can
be perverted by spiritedness.

523
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:41,860
Uh,

524
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,860
law is the best hedge we have against
the domination of partiality and desire.

525
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:53,560
But this is not the end of the story.
In fact, it is only the beginning.

526
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,450
Aristotle raises the question,
very important question,

527
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,160
whether the rule of law is to be
referred to the rule of the best,

528
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:07,670
the best individual.
And typically again, he,

529
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,650
he seems to answer the question from
to two different points of view.

530
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,520
Giving each perspective
it's, it's do, it's justice.

531
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:21,450
He begins in many ways by appearing to
defend Plato's view about the rule of the

532
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:26,970
best individual. The best regime he
says is not one based on written blah.

533
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,153
Okay

534
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:33,300
law. And there's a reason it seems to
be something like this. Law is at best,

535
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:35,130
a clumsy instrument,
a clumsy,

536
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:40,340
clumsy tool because law is only deal
with general matters and cannot deal with

537
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:47,810
particular concrete situations for their
more law seems to bind the hands of the

538
00:39:49,081 --> 00:39:54,081
statesmen and legislators who always have
to be responding to new and unforeseen

539
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,990
circumstances.
And yet at the same time,

540
00:39:57,991 --> 00:40:02,730
Aristotle makes the case for law
the judgement of an individual,

541
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,270
no matter how wise is more corruptible,

542
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,840
whether due to passion or interest or
simply the fallibility of human reason.

543
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,040
Then as law,
he notes as a practical matter,

544
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:20,700
no one individual can oversee all things.

545
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,563
Yeah.

546
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,150
Only a third party in this case law,
uh,

547
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,280
is capable of judging adequately.
Again,

548
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:37,260
he seems to give reasons and
good reasons for both cases.

549
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:42,240
So he, but he moves to the question,
should lobby changed his law changeable?

550
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,020
And if so, how? And once again,

551
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:49,500
he puts forward different arguments
in book two, Chapter Eight,

552
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:54,890
he compares law to other arts and
sciences and suggest was sciences such as

553
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:59,970
medicine and uh, his exhibited
progress. This is true.

554
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,210
This should be true for law.
The antiquity of a law.

555
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,350
A alone is no justification for its usage.

556
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,380
Aristotle seems to reject a,

557
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,510
you might say Burkey and conservatism,
uh,

558
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:18,590
long before the time antiquity or
tradition alone is no justification.

559
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,830
Yet. At the same time, he, he seems
to recognize that changes in law,

560
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,610
even when the result is
improvement are dangerous.

561
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:32,930
He writes it as a bad thing to habituate
people to reckless disillusion of laws

562
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:38,330
for the city will not be benefited as
much from changing law is it will be

563
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:42,650
harmed through being habituated
to just obey the rulers.

564
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,431
In other words,

565
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:47,810
he's saying lawfulness like
every other virtual is a habit.

566
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:53,210
It's a habit of behavior and the
habit of destroying, disobeying,

567
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:58,160
even an unjust law will make
people all together lawless.

568
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:07,370
This emphasis upon law is a constraint
on human behavior in many ways.

569
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:12,441
Seems to introduce a strong element of
conventionalism in Aristotle's thought.

570
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:18,080
Okay. This is the view that justice
is determined by laws, by customs,

571
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,240
traditions that are just conventions.
No,

572
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:25,710
most in the broadest sense of the
term that constitutes justice.

573
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,660
And as I indicated,

574
00:42:27,661 --> 00:42:32,070
there's also seems to be a certain degree
of relativism associated with this.

575
00:42:32,071 --> 00:42:37,071
Since conventions vary from society to
society to standards of justice will seem

576
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,400
to v to again be regime dependent and
this seems to be entirely consistent with

577
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,250
parts of Aristotle's anthropology.
After all,

578
00:42:47,251 --> 00:42:50,160
if we are political animals by nature,

579
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:55,650
then the standards of justice must
derive from politics are right.

580
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:00,870
That's transcends.
Society cannot be a right natural to man.

581
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:12,170
Yet Aristotle's conception
of our political nature
seems to require standards of

582
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:17,460
justice that are natural or right for us.

583
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,720
Rule of law presupposes that there was a
form of justice or right natural to us.

584
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,560
But what is the Aristotelian
Standard of natural,

585
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:30,690
right or natural justice?

586
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,170
Aristotle makes it surprising assertion.
Uh,

587
00:43:37,171 --> 00:43:39,090
unfortunately it's an
assertion and a book.

588
00:43:39,091 --> 00:43:42,240
You're not reading a book,

589
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,080
the Nicomachean Ethics Book Five,
Chapter Seven,

590
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,120
he says there that all natural,
right is mutable, are changeable.

591
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,610
All standards of natural
justice are changeable.

592
00:43:55,611 --> 00:44:00,611
And by this he means that natural right
is revealed not in general propositions

593
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:05,570
or universal maxims is for example,
Emmanuel.

594
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:07,430
Kant would argue later on,

595
00:44:07,431 --> 00:44:12,050
but in the concrete decisions of a
community or its leaders about what is a

596
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:12,950
right or wrong,

597
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:19,030
natural right is mutable because different
circumstances will require different

598
00:44:19,581 --> 00:44:20,780
kinds of decisions.

599
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,330
Okay,

600
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:24,640
so does this mean then that for Aristotle,

601
00:44:24,641 --> 00:44:28,840
there are no universally valid
standards of justice or right?

602
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,680
Did it all depends on that justice
like the good citizen is as it were,

603
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:36,510
regime dependent.

604
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:41,511
Is this not to fall into the boundless
field of machiavellianism that declares

605
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:47,400
right and wrong to be entirely
relative to circumstance?

606
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:51,690
Context dependent? Is that what
Aristotle is saying? Not at all.

607
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,700
Aristotle emphasizes the mutable character
of natural right in part to preserve

608
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:03,780
the latitude of freedom of
action required by the Statesman.

609
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,880
Every statesmen must confront new and
sometimes extreme situations that require

610
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:17,361
inventiveness and creative action and in
such situations where the very survival

611
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:22,080
of the community may be at stake,
we might call these emergency situations.

612
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,180
The conscientious statesmen must
be able to respond appropriately.

613
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:31,320
Nine 11 for example,

614
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:37,170
a moral law that refused to allow the
statesman to protect the community in

615
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:41,100
times of crisis would not be
a principle of natural, right?

616
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,830
It would be a suicide note.

617
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,253
Okay?

618
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:50,810
To considerable degree,
Aristotle, Aristotle,

619
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:54,930
helion standards of natural right
reside in the specific decisions,

620
00:45:54,931 --> 00:45:58,900
the concrete decisions
of the ablest states.

621
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:01,200
These cannot be determined in advance,

622
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:06,060
but must be allowed to emerge
in response to new and again,

623
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:10,080
different in unforeseen situations.
What does naturally right,

624
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:14,730
what is it right? By nature in
peacetime will not be the same.

625
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:18,840
It is what is naturally right or
right by nature in times of war,

626
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:21,390
okay?

627
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:25,440
What is right in normal situations will
not be the same as what is right in

628
00:46:25,441 --> 00:46:26,550
states of emergency.

629
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:31,320
The Statesman in the areas to telian
sense is the one who seeks to return as

630
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:35,700
quickly and efficiently as
possible to the normal situation.

631
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:41,860
And this is what distinguishes Aristotle
from Machiavelli and all those later

632
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:45,060
thinkers who take their
bearings from Machiavelli.

633
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:50,061
I'm thinking of thinkers like hubs like
Carl Schmitt and Max Weber's in the 20th

634
00:46:51,211 --> 00:46:55,950
century. All of these thinkers take their
bearings from the extreme situation,

635
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,790
situations of civil war,
of social collapse,

636
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,530
of national crisis.

637
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:10,500
The Aristotelian statesmen will not be
unduly affected by the occasional need to

638
00:47:11,111 --> 00:47:12,370
depart from the norm.

639
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:17,920
Whether this means just to spend in the
case and to take an American case. Uh,

640
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:22,810
the suspension of Habeas Corpus
is Abraham Lincoln did in the,

641
00:47:22,811 --> 00:47:23,110
uh,

642
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:28,110
during the civil war or the regrettable
need to engage in domestic espionage.

643
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,810
But in any case,

644
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:37,140
the Aristotelian statesmen goal will
be the restoration of the conditions of

645
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:43,051
constitutional government and rule of law
as quickly and again as efficiently as

646
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:49,390
possible. Uh, uh, net, uh, grim note,

647
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,720
uh, I think, uh, I let
you go and we will, uh,

648
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,980
conclude Aristotle next time.
