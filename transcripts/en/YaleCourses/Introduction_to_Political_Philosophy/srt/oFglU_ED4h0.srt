1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,680
Uh,

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,700
today we start,

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:03,600
guess what?

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,051
We start.

5
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:05,100
We start with Plato,

6
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,070
Plato's apology of Socrates.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,833
Uh,

8
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,420
this is the best introductory text
to the study of political philosophy.

9
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,263
Why,

10
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,330
let me give you two reasons.

11
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,573
First,

12
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,830
it shows Socrates the,

13
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:26,430
a reputed founder of our discipline,

14
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:28,050
the founder of political science.

15
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:30,930
And I will say a little bit
more about that later on today.

16
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:31,711
Uh,

17
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:36,711
explaining himself and justifying himself
justifying his way of life before a

18
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:40,170
jury of his peers.

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,840
It shows Socrates speaking,

20
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:43,200
uh,

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,200
in a public forum defending the utility
of Philosophy for political life.

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,103
And secondly,

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,160
the apology demonstrates
also the vulnerability of
political philosophy in its

24
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:05,040
relation to the city in its
relation to political power.

25
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,110
You apology puts on trial not
merely a particular individual,

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,260
Socrates,

27
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,620
but puts on trial the very idea of
philosophy from its very beginnings

28
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,060
philosophy and the city philosophy and
political life have stood in a sort of

29
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:29,040
tension with,

30
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,180
with one another.

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Socrates is charged as we will see by
the city for corrupting the youth in

32
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,940
impiety toward the gods.

33
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:39,774
Right?

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,673
In other words,

35
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,990
he's accused of treason,

36
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,170
high capital offense,

37
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,650
no other work of which I am aware helps
us better think through the conflict.

38
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,260
I would even say the necessary in end,

39
00:01:55,261 --> 00:02:00,261
inevitable conflict between the freedom
of the mind and the requirements of

40
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,000
political life.

41
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,160
Are these two things,

42
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:07,860
are these two goods as it were,

43
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,820
freedom of mind and political life?

44
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,850
Are they compatible or are they
necessarily at odds with one another?

45
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:20,460
That seems to me to be a,

46
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,470
in some ways the fundamental question
that the apology asks us to consider.

47
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,723
Okay.

48
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,270
Now for generations,

49
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,773
uh,

50
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,890
the apology has stood out as a symbol
for the violation of free expression.

51
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,660
A,

52
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,610
it sets the,

53
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,760
the case for the individual committed
to the examined life over and against a

54
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:55,590
bigoted and prejudiced multitude.

55
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,190
The clearest statement of this view of,

56
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:00,581
again,

57
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,220
the individual set against the mob.

58
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,250
In some ways it's founded it very in a
work of a very famous civil libertarian

59
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,970
of the 19th century men named John Stuart
Mill in his famous tract called simply

60
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,510
I'm liberty mill road.

61
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Mankind can hardly be too often reminded
that it was once a man named Socrates,

62
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,380
between whom and the legal authorities
of his time there took place.

63
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,940
A memorable collision

64
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,790
over and again,

65
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,050
and mill is kind of a famous case of
this over and against Socrates has been

66
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:43,051
described as a martyr for freedom
of speech and he has been somewhat

67
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:47,680
extravagantly compared at
various times to Jesus,

68
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:48,790
to Galileo,

69
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:54,510
to Sir Thomas Moore and has been used as
a role model for thinkers and political

70
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:59,020
activists from Henry
David Thoreau to Gandhi,

71
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,550
to Martin Luther King.

72
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,600
So Socrates has become a very central
might say symbol of political resistance

73
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:11,050
and political and resistance to,

74
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,110
to political power and of the dangers
to the individual of sort of unchecked a

75
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,263
rule.

76
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,990
But this reading of the apology,

77
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,220
as you might say,

78
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:29,221
a kind of brief for freedom of expression
in a warning against the dangers of

79
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,060
censorship and persecution.

80
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,920
Although this has been enormously
influential over the centuries,

81
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,800
at least over the last century and a half,

82
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,890
you have to ask yourself,

83
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,060
is this the reading that Plato intended?

84
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,210
Did Plato want us to read
the dialogue this way

85
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,680
as a teacher of mine use to say,

86
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,620
you read Plato your way.

87
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,870
I'll read him his way.

88
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,670
But uh,

89
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,330
how did,

90
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,770
how did Plato intend this
dialogue to be understood?

91
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:10,771
Note that Socrates never defends
himself by reference to the doctrine of

92
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,910
unlimited free speech.

93
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,100
He doesn't make that claim.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He doesn't make the claim about the
general utility of freedom or unlimited

95
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:23,950
speech.

96
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,520
Rather he maintains as he puts
it near the end of the dialogue,

97
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,300
uh,

98
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,410
end of the defense speech,

99
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:29,800
that the,

100
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,800
that the examined life is
alone worth living only those,

101
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:36,851
in other words,

102
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:40,510
engaged in the continuous struggle
to clarify their thinking,

103
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,130
to remove sources of
contradiction and incoherence.

104
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,310
Only those people can be said
to live worthwhile lives.

105
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,280
The unexamined life is not worth living.

106
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,970
Socrates confidently know,

107
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,780
defiantly say asserts to his listeners,

108
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:03,770
to his audience.

109
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,200
Nothing else matters for him.

110
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,930
His in other words seems to be
a highly personal in many ways,

111
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:16,931
highly individual quest for
self perfection and not a
doctrine about the value

112
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,410
of freedom of speech in general.

113
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,270
But even though you might say Socrates
seems to be engaged and again,

114
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:32,030
this highly personal
quest for self perfection,

115
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:35,090
there is something which one can't avoid.

116
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,200
Deeply political about the
apology and about his teaching.

117
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,210
At the heart of the dialogue are at
the heart of this speech rather is a

118
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,110
quarrel,

119
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,230
a quarrel with his
accusers over the question,

120
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,680
uh,

121
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,020
never stated directly perhaps,

122
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,590
but over the question of who has the
right to educate future citizens and

123
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:00,470
statesmen of the city of Athens.

124
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,080
Socrates is dispense speech like every
platonic dialogue is ultimately a

125
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:10,340
dialogue about education.

126
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,130
Who has the right to teach?

127
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,140
Who has the right to educate?

128
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:21,010
This is in many ways for Socrates the
fundamental political question of all

129
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:22,041
times.

130
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:26,810
It is the question of really who
governs or maybe put another way,

131
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:28,520
who should govern,

132
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,300
who,

133
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,380
who ought to govern.

134
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,950
Remember also that the city that brought
Socrates to trial was not just any

135
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:37,304
city.

136
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,890
It was a peculiar kind of city.

137
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,760
It was Athens and Athens was until only
fairly recent times in human history,

138
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:51,320
the most famous democracy
that ever existed.

139
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,060
I'd say fairly recent times until
you know the American democracy.

140
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,930
But it wasn't until at least
the 18th or 19th century,

141
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:03,120
the most famous democracy
that ever existed.

142
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,450
The speech of Socrates before the jury
is perhaps the most famous attempt to put

143
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,590
democracy itself on trial.

144
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,050
It is not merely Socrates
who was on trial.

145
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:18,290
Socrates intends to put the
democracy of Athens itself on trial.

146
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,330
Not only does the apology to,

147
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,970
for Socrates to defend
himself before the city,

148
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,580
before the city of Athens,

149
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:31,581
but Socrates puts the city of Athens on
trial and makes it defend itself before

150
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,070
the High Court of Philosophy.

151
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,120
So the ensuing debate within the dialogue
can be read as a struggle again over

152
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,960
who has title to rule?

153
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,370
Is it the people?

154
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,860
Is it the cart of Athens,

155
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,000
the De Moss,

156
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,160
to use the Greek word for the people?

157
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,230
Or is it Socrates,

158
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,970
the philosopher King,

159
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,780
who should be vested with
ultimate political authority?

160
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,680
That is of course,

161
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:04,950
the question that's taken
up in a very vivid way,

162
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,290
much more explicit way in the republic.

163
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,650
But it runs throughout the apology.

164
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,390
And you can't really,

165
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,740
uh,

166
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,740
understand the apology unless you see
that that is the question that Socrates is

167
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:20,640
posing throughout.

168
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,893
Yes.

169
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,020
With them.

170
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,400
Yeah.

171
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,233
Good.

172
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:29,803
Okay.

173
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,323
So

174
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,130
it's in names put on the board and some
dates just because I wanted to talk a

175
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:40,670
little bit about the political
context of this dialogue.

176
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,590
One can of course read,

177
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:44,840
there's nothing wrong
with reading the apology.

178
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:45,171
Again,

179
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:49,650
it's the kind of enduring
symbol of the plight of the a.

180
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,740
You might say the just individual,

181
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,023
uh,

182
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:58,330
confronted with an unjust mob
or an unjust political rule,

183
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,690
uh,

184
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,690
is again a question that Plato
takes up in the apology when,

185
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,211
uh,

186
00:10:05,211 --> 00:10:06,560
we will see in the republic,

187
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:07,221
excuse me,

188
00:10:07,221 --> 00:10:10,790
when a character in the book
named Glaucon who happens to be,

189
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,241
as it were,

190
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:16,241
the brother of Plato ask Socrates if it
is actually better to be just or simply

191
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:19,220
to have the reputation for justice.

192
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:24,080
And Socrates Rep says it is better
to be just even if that results in

193
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,940
persecution and death.

194
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,680
But the trial is not,

195
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:27,951
again,

196
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:32,240
just an enduring symbol of
justice versus injustice.

197
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:37,241
It is an actual historical event that
takes place in a particular moment of

198
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:41,150
political time.

199
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,010
And this bears,

200
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:47,870
I think decisively on how we
come to understand the case,

201
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,330
both for and against Socrates.

202
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,260
Let me talk a little
bit about that context.

203
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:58,980
Okay.

204
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,980
The trial of Socrates takes place in the
year three 99 and all of these refer to

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,450
know before the common era three 99.

206
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,360
Some of you will know that,

207
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,810
that try this try that trial follows
very quickly upon the heels of the Pella,

208
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,650
the famous Peloponnesian war.

209
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,700
This was the war related by Socrates
is slightly older contemporary,

210
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:33,990
a man named through acidities who wrote
the history of the Peloponnesian war,

211
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:38,991
the war that took place between the
two great powers of the Greek world,

212
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:44,010
between the Spartans and the and their
allies and Athens and its allies.

213
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,091
Uh,

214
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:45,840
the Athens,

215
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,840
the Athens that fought this war against
Sparta was in Athens at the height of

216
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:57,501
its political power and prestige under
the leadership of its first citizen

217
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,260
Paraclese whose name is is also up there
at the very top under paraclese Athens

218
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:06,490
had built the famous Acropolis.

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,301
Uh,

220
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:12,301
it had established Athens as a
mighty and redoubtable naval power.

221
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:19,110
And it created an unprecedented
level of artistic and cultural life,

222
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,370
even today known simply
as para Cleon Athens.

223
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,280
But Athens was also something
completely unprecedented in the world.

224
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,540
It was a democracy.

225
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,880
And again,

226
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,720
even today,

227
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:39,721
the expression Athenian democracy connotes
an ideal of the most complete form of

228
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:44,770
democratic government
that has ever existed.

229
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,070
We are the school of helpless.

230
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,460
This is what [inaudible] boasts to his
listeners in the famous funeral oration,

231
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:54,940
uh,

232
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,200
told by through acidities,

233
00:12:56,201 --> 00:13:01,180
we throw our city open to the world
and never exclude foreigners from any

234
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,400
opportunity of learning and observing,

235
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:09,330
even though the eyes of an enemy may
profit from our liberality paraclese

236
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:10,810
boasts.

237
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,643
Once again,

238
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,850
the question maybe you
want to ask about this is

239
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,450
how could the world's first freest and
most open society sentenced to death?

240
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,340
A man who spoke freely
about his own ignorance and
professed to care for nothing

241
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:36,370
so much as virtue and human excellence.

242
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,393
Now,

243
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,720
at the outbreak of the Peloponnesian war,

244
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:44,740
Socrates was just under 40 years of age.

245
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,810
And we learned from the speech
that Socrates was himself.

246
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,230
Uh,

247
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,790
serve in the military and served
in defense of his country.

248
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:56,820
The war,

249
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:56,951
uh,

250
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:59,050
the Peloponnesian war was fought,

251
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,700
uh,

252
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,610
as you can see,

253
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,850
a over considerable length of time on
and off for almost a period of 30 years.

254
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,530
And it was concluded in the year four,

255
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:16,531
all four with the defeat of Athens and
the installing of a pro spartan oligarchy

256
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,690
as pro spartan regime known as simply as
the 30 tyrants also out there who ruled

257
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,180
Athens for a year.

258
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,663
Uh,

259
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,780
the next year,

260
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,800
four oh three,

261
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,663
the tyrants,

262
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,181
the 30,

263
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:34,991
as they were called,

264
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:37,750
were driven out and a democracy,

265
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:42,280
a democratic government was once
again reestablished in Athens.

266
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,920
Just three years later,

267
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:45,850
uh,

268
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,320
three men named Anna
[inaudible] Mellitus and Lycos,

269
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,250
uh,

270
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,250
all of whom had been part of their
democratic resistance movement against the

271
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,723
Spartan Oligarchy.

272
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,910
These men brought
charges against Socrates.

273
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,460
Their charges against him were corrupting
the young and disbelieving in the gods

274
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:08,600
that the city believes in.

275
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:13,400
So you can see that the charges were
brought by people who were themselves.

276
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:13,970
Again,

277
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,790
part of the Democratic
Resistance Movement,

278
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,660
uh,

279
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,140
and Eh and eh,

280
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,360
the names of antiques and
Mellitus is you've read,

281
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:23,631
you know,

282
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,464
appear in the,

283
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:24,770
in,

284
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,700
in the dial in,

285
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:25,970
in,

286
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,110
in the speech itself.

287
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,200
So the charges brought against Socrates
did not simply grow out of thin air.

288
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,360
Maybe we should rephrase the question,

289
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:40,010
not why did the Athenians
bring Socrates to trial,

290
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:45,310
but why did they permit him to carry on
his practice of challenging the law and

291
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,490
the authority of the law
for as long as they did?

292
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,913
Okay.

293
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:58,803
Add to this,

294
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,780
the fact that when the sock,

295
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,180
when Socrates was brought to trial again,

296
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,330
the democracy had only
recently been reestablished,

297
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,020
but that many friends and former students
of Socrates had been in themselves

298
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,830
implicated in the rule of the 30.

299
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,860
The hated 30 tyrants among the members
of the 30 were a man named courteous,

300
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,410
is actually a platonic
dialogue named after him,

301
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:34,110
a man named Critias who
was a relative of Plato's.

302
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,490
And another man named comedies also name
is the title of a platonic dialogue.

303
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:41,911
Comedies,

304
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:43,140
who was Plato's Uncle

305
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,260
Plato himself.

306
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,400
Uh,

307
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,590
he tells us much later in life.

308
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,120
And his famous seventh letter,

309
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:56,121
Plato himself was invited by his
relatives to help to form a part of the

310
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:03,060
government of the 30 and later Plato said,

311
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:03,620
ah,

312
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,040
that's so abhorrent.

313
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,220
Did they become that they made the older
democracy look like the golden age?

314
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,040
So the point I'm suggesting is that many
of Socrates's students and associates,

315
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,170
including Plato himself,

316
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,120
had some connection
with this oligarchical,

317
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,270
uh,

318
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:24,630
uh,

319
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,160
government that had ruled,

320
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,880
uh,

321
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,660
Athens,

322
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,350
uh,

323
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,730
for a brief time.

324
00:17:29,731 --> 00:17:32,730
And Socrates was himself
not above suspicion.

325
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,250
You often don't we,

326
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:36,120
even today,

327
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,601
yes,

328
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:40,470
we often judge teachers by their students,

329
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,260
by the company they keep,

330
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,843
yes.

331
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,133
Don't worry.

332
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,840
No one is above suspicion.

333
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,110
Socrates himself had been a close
associate of a man named El Sobriety's.

334
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,490
Uh,

335
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,810
probably the most prominent Athenian
and the generation after Paraclese,

336
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:01,970
uh,

337
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,480
Elsa by cities was the man
who engineered a disastrous,

338
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,340
a Sicilian expedition,

339
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,301
uh,

340
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:12,150
and later ended his life as a defector,

341
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:12,630
uh,

342
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,010
going to Sparta.

343
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,113
Uh,

344
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,630
his complex relationship with Socrates is,

345
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:21,410
by the way,

346
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:26,410
recounted in the drunken speech that Al
Sobriety's gives in Plato's dialogues

347
00:18:28,211 --> 00:18:29,044
symposium.

348
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,420
So you can see that the trial of Socrates,

349
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:37,421
the little speech that you have read
takes place in the shadow of military

350
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:38,954
defeat,

351
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,700
of resistance,

352
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,760
of conspiracy and betrayal.

353
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,460
Okay.

354
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,210
Socrates was 70 years old
at the time of the trial.

355
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,700
So this was a highly charged
political environment,

356
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,380
uh,

357
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,220
far more volatile than,

358
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,160
for example,

359
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:00,640
uh,

360
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,440
the kind of partisan quarrels
we see today in our republic.

361
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,973
I hope.

362
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,713
Yeah.

363
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,853
Okay.

364
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,290
So let me talk about the accusations.

365
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:26,300
Let me move from the political context
of the speech to the accusations.

366
00:19:26,301 --> 00:19:28,820
And I say accusations because they are,

367
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,051
there are,

368
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:31,010
as you read,

369
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,330
if you read closely,

370
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:37,331
you will see there were actually two
sets of accusations leveled against

371
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:41,120
Socrates early in the speech.

372
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:45,200
Socrates claims that his current
accusers annotates and Mellitus,

373
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:45,561
uh,

374
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:45,951
again,

375
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,810
the democratic resistance fighters,

376
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:48,920
uh,

377
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,670
have brought charges against the charges
they have brought against him are

378
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,900
themselves,

379
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,901
the descendants of an earlier generation
of accusers who were responsible for he

380
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:04,760
claims maligning and creating an
unfavorable prejudice against Socrates.

381
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,080
Okay.

382
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,790
These charges are not new.

383
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,540
He tells the jury and
many members of the jury,

384
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:12,991
he says,

385
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:13,231
well,

386
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:18,231
if had a fee and unf we'll have had
formed an unfavorable opinion about him.

387
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,350
This was the day before.

388
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:26,100
They were intense forms of jury
selection where they would ask people,

389
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,900
do you have a view of the case?

390
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,340
Many of the jurors would have known
Socrates or certainly would have heard of

391
00:20:32,341 --> 00:20:33,174
him,

392
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,870
uh,

393
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,870
and he says would have had already an
unfavorable opinion formed about him by

394
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:42,330
this earlier generation
of accusers referenced.

395
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:44,430
He makes to a comic poet.

396
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,391
Yes.

397
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:50,391
A comic poet and unequivocal reference
to the playwright Aristophanes whose,

398
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,133
whose name,

399
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,400
uh,

400
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,090
I've had put up on the board.

401
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:59,860
Aristophanes is the one who created
the original or the initial prejudice

402
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:00,671
against Socrates.

403
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:02,410
What was that prejudice that sa,

404
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,480
that aristophanes's comic poet had created
the illusion to Aristophanes and the

405
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:10,540
comic poet

406
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:16,600
is a part of what Plato calls
in Book 10 of the Republic.

407
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,620
The old quarrel between
philosophy and poetry.

408
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,630
This call is as staple
of Plato's dialogues.

409
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,910
What is a central theme,

410
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:33,180
not only of the symposium
in which Aristotle and
Socrates are actually shown at

411
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:36,130
the same dinner table with one another.

412
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,720
Uh,

413
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,300
but it is also a key
feature of the republic,

414
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:45,160
which we will be reading in a week where
Socrates offers in elaborate proposal

415
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:50,161
for the censorship and control of poetry
if it is to be made compatible with the

416
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:52,690
demands of political justice.

417
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:53,801
In fact,

418
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:58,540
in a way you cannot understand the
republic unless you understand the poetic

419
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,830
backdrop to it.

420
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:05,130
And Socrates is longstanding
engagement with the poetic tradition.

421
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,860
Okay?

422
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,860
And this back and forth between himself
and the man he calls this comic poet the

423
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:15,270
core,

424
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:19,230
the core of this quarrel between
the philosopher and the poet,

425
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,360
between Socrates and Aristotle and A's.

426
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,300
It's not just an aesthetic,

427
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,693
uh,

428
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,580
judgment or it is not
simply an aesthetic coral.

429
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,030
It is,

430
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,600
again,

431
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,600
deeply political or at least has
something very political about it.

432
00:22:35,881 --> 00:22:40,881
It gets to the essence of the question
of who is best equipped to educate future

433
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:44,640
generations of citizens.

434
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,600
And civic leaders are the
philosophers or are the poets,

435
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,620
uh,

436
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,620
you might say the true legislators for
mankind if you want to use Shelley's

437
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,360
favorite Shelley's dictum.

438
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,230
Okay.

439
00:22:59,230 --> 00:22:59,950
Which one?

440
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,650
Legislates for mankind
at the time of Socrates,

441
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,910
the Greeks already had a century's long
tradition of poetic education going back

442
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:15,811
centuries to the time of homer and
Hesiod that set out certain x and clary

443
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:21,540
models of heroic virtue and civic life.

444
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,680
The Homeric epics were to the Greek world.

445
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,760
What the Bible is to our world.

446
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,720
That is to say in some respects,

447
00:23:34,721 --> 00:23:37,570
the ultimate authority
regarding the way of the gods,

448
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:43,290
the relation to the world and the type
of virtues appropriate to human beings.

449
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,280
The virtues endorsed by the poetic
tradition of which aristophanes's is the

450
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,710
great representative here,

451
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,610
the great inheritor,

452
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:58,790
and represent the virtues of this
tradition with the virtues of a warrior

453
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:03,791
culture of a people at warlike
peoples and men at war.

454
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:10,070
These were the qualities that had
guided the Greeks for centuries and

455
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,590
contributed to their rise to power.

456
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,620
It contributed to Athens as well as
Sparta's rise to greatness from a small

457
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,920
dispersed people to a great world.

458
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:22,820
Power and again,

459
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:26,090
allow them to achieve a level of artistic,

460
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,000
intellectual and political accomplishment.

461
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,610
Akin to Renaissance Florence,

462
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,390
uh,

463
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,030
Elizabethan England and,

464
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:35,864
uh,

465
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,030
dirt is Weimar.

466
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,790
So what does it cost?

467
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,500
What is at stake in this quarrel between
Socrates and the poets between Socrates

468
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:48,630
in the poetic tradition
that he alludes to it?

469
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,123
First,

470
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Socrates manner of teaching is
markedly different from the poets,

471
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,150
right?

472
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:05,150
Does anyone know here the opening
line of the Iliad home resilient?

473
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,860
Does anyone know the first line?

474
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,340
Want to remember that from high school?

475
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,453
What?

476
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,660
Right?

477
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,420
But I mean same goddess,

478
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,800
the wrath of Achilles.

479
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,193
Alright.

480
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:21,720
Uh,

481
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,770
sing goddess.

482
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,850
The wrath of Achilles.

483
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:25,550
The poet are irregular,

484
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,430
right?

485
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:30,870
They call on gods and goddesses
to inspire them with song,

486
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,930
to fill them with inspiration,

487
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:38,931
to tell stories of people with superhuman
strength and courage and anger.

488
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:41,933
Okay?

489
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,380
By contrast,

490
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:46,860
you could say the method of
Socrates is not a rat killer.

491
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:48,450
It is not storytelling.

492
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,600
It is conversational.

493
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,550
It is argumentative.

494
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,520
If you want to use the
word he applies to it.

495
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:57,660
It is dialectical.

496
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,800
Socrates makes arguments and he wants
others to engage with him to discover

497
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:10,941
which argument can best withstand the
test of rational scrutiny and debate.

498
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,080
There are no arguments in Homer's
Iliad or artists that you,

499
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:16,860
you hear stories,

500
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,080
you hear strong and compelling stories,

501
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,430
no arguments.

502
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,540
Socrates makes,

503
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:22,051
in other words,

504
00:26:22,051 --> 00:26:27,051
continual questioning and not the
telling of stories and the recitation of

505
00:26:27,451 --> 00:26:32,451
versus the essence of this
new political education.

506
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,840
He questions the methods
of teaching of the poet,

507
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,850
but secondly,

508
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,020
again,

509
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,870
homer and the poets sing the virtues.

510
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,070
Men at war.

511
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:50,450
Socrates wants to replace the warrior
citizen with a new kind of citizen,

512
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,550
a whole new set you might say,

513
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:55,170
of citizen virtues,

514
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,810
the new Socratic citizen,

515
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,580
let's call him that for a moment.

516
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:04,581
The new Socratic citizen may have some
features in common with the older Homeric

517
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:05,694
warrior,

518
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:11,570
but Socrates ultimately wants to replace
military combat with a new kind of,

519
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,130
you might take call it verbal facility,

520
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:16,350
verbal combat in which the,

521
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:16,741
again,

522
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:21,741
the person with the best argument
is declared to be victorious.

523
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,020
The person with the best argument,

524
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:26,920
let the best argument prevail.

525
00:27:26,921 --> 00:27:31,921
The famed Socratic method of argumentation
is basically all that remains of the

526
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,953
older,

527
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:34,680
uh,

528
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,550
pre Socratic culture
of struggle and combat.

529
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:39,780
The Socratic set up.

530
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:44,810
The new Socratic citizen is to be trained
in the art of argument in dialectic.

531
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,230
And we will talk a little
later about what that means.

532
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,283
So

533
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,940
it is as a challenge or is a challenger
to the poets and all they stand for with

534
00:28:02,171 --> 00:28:07,171
century long tradition of poetic education
that Socrates asserts himself that

535
00:28:08,831 --> 00:28:10,630
Socrates presents himself.

536
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:17,040
The apologies show Socrates as
offering a new model of citizenship.

537
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,270
A new kind of citizen

538
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,720
is challenge to the poets,

539
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:32,780
is in a way the basis for the resentment
that has built up against him and that

540
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:38,970
aristophanes's and what he calls
the earlier accusers have brought,

541
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,870
brought to bear.

542
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,023
In fact,

543
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:47,060
you might take so seriously was Socrates
taken by Aristophanes and the poets

544
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,570
that aristophanes's
devoted an entire play.

545
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,710
He wrote an entire play about
Socrates called the clouds,

546
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,173
the clouds,

547
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,740
right devoted to debunking in ridicule.

548
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:06,630
Socrates is profession of
learning Aristophanes play.

549
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:10,470
Sometimes it's even included in
certain additions of the book.

550
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:11,440
You're reading like this one.

551
00:29:11,441 --> 00:29:12,450
It has the,

552
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,140
uh,

553
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,980
uh,

554
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,940
addition of the
aristophanes's clouds in it,

555
00:29:17,941 --> 00:29:20,250
along with the apology and Credo.

556
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:26,380
The existence of that pledge shows to
all of us just how seriously Socrates was

557
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:30,330
taken by the greatest
of his contemporaries.

558
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:33,360
And aristophanes's was
along with Sophocles.

559
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:37,380
And you rip Adiz and others
among the greatest of the,

560
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,940
of the Greek playwrights,

561
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:44,450
the mockery you might say of Socrates
remains one of the sincerest form of

562
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:46,624
flattery.

563
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,400
They took him very seriously.

564
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,543
Okay,

565
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,770
let me just say something
about the clouds.

566
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:55,180
This comic play,

567
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,720
this satire on,

568
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,910
on Socrates because it is part
of that initial accusation.

569
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,680
It's awkward,

570
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,370
he says is,

571
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,460
is leveled against him.

572
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:10,430
Here Aristophanes presents
Socrates as an investigator,

573
00:30:10,431 --> 00:30:12,140
and this is part of the first charge.

574
00:30:12,141 --> 00:30:12,561
Remember,

575
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,150
an investigator of the things,

576
00:30:14,151 --> 00:30:18,110
a loft in the things under the earth
and who makes the weaker argument the

577
00:30:18,111 --> 00:30:18,944
stronger.

578
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,200
That's the argument that,

579
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,100
uh,

580
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,000
Socrates,

581
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,870
uh,

582
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,850
says Aristophanes brought about,

583
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,650
brings against him.

584
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,170
In this play,

585
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,280
Socrates is presented as the head,

586
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,600
uh,

587
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,201
the leader,

588
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:39,100
the director,

589
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:39,971
uh,

590
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:44,330
what we might think of is the
first think tank in human hitting,

591
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,820
known to human history.

592
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,430
Uh,

593
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,570
it's called in the play itself,

594
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:50,890
the front hysteria,

595
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:55,950
which means there is sometimes translated
as the thinkery or the think a tear.

596
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:02,250
The think materia or simply a
kind of think tank where fathers,

597
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:07,561
Athenian fathers bring their sons to
be indoctrinated into the mysteries of

598
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,670
Socratic wisdom.

599
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:10,391
And in the play,

600
00:31:10,391 --> 00:31:12,880
Socrates is shown hovering,

601
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:17,910
flying above the stage in a basket in
order better to be able to observe the

602
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:21,340
clouds that the things a lot,

603
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,360
right.

604
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,240
But also in many ways symbolizing
Socrates is at least on the air staff.

605
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:27,820
And he's a con.

606
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:32,200
Socrates is detachment from
the things down here on earth.

607
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,160
The thing that concern his
fellow citizens Socrates's,

608
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,870
uh,

609
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,280
Socrates is a kind of a,

610
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:42,350
what in German people
will call a Lyft match.

611
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,930
She's a man up in the air,

612
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,321
you know,

613
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:44,831
kind of,

614
00:31:44,831 --> 00:31:45,310
uh,

615
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:45,581
he's,

616
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:45,881
he's,

617
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:46,240
he's,

618
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,320
he's so detached.

619
00:31:47,321 --> 00:31:47,591
He's,

620
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:47,810
he,

621
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,330
he doesn't have his feet on the ground.

622
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:55,240
And a Socrates is shown not only
mocking the gods in doing this,

623
00:31:55,241 --> 00:32:00,241
but he is shown by Aristophanes to teach
incest and to teach all of the things

624
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:04,960
that violate every decent human,

625
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,261
you know,

626
00:32:05,261 --> 00:32:06,870
taboo in Sas,

627
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,330
the,

628
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,280
the beating of one's parents,

629
00:32:09,281 --> 00:32:10,960
all these kinds of things.

630
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:12,340
Socrates is shown,

631
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:17,110
Socrates is presented as a
kind of corrosive skepticism,

632
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,130
which,

633
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:18,850
uh,

634
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:23,290
is it the core of his chief of staff
of Aristophanes charge against him.

635
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,730
To make a long story short,

636
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,020
uh,

637
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,050
the play concludes with Socrates.

638
00:32:28,051 --> 00:32:30,970
His think tank being
burned to the ground by,

639
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,350
uh,

640
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,800
just ground whole disciple,

641
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,530
an object lesson for all later.

642
00:32:37,531 --> 00:32:38,281
Professors,

643
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:41,720
I would say teach teaching nonsense,

644
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,973
right?

645
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:47,900
Yeah.

646
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,920
Don't get any ideas

647
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,431
dick.

648
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:53,990
A match to the department.

649
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,210
Yeah.

650
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,330
So how accurate is that
picture of Socrates,

651
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:02,930
the man who investigates the things
aloft and the things under the ground?

652
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:08,110
The clouds was written in for 23
when Socrates was in his mid forties.

653
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,740
And the error Stefanik
Socrates is essentially a,

654
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,180
we call a natural philosopher,

655
00:33:14,181 --> 00:33:14,510
again,

656
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,620
investigating the things,

657
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:16,820
a loft under the ground.

658
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,800
He is what we would call today,

659
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,170
a scientist and natural scientist.

660
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,450
But this seems quite removed,

661
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:27,930
doesn't it from the Socrates who was
brought up on charges of corrupting the

662
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,750
young and impiety in,

663
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,890
in the apology.

664
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,300
And here is where Socrates tells
actually here is where Socrates,

665
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:37,730
he actually tells a story
very important in the,

666
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:39,830
in the course of this speech,

667
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:45,070
he provides a kind of
intellectual biography of an
incident that occurred long

668
00:33:46,131 --> 00:33:49,940
before the trial and set him
on a very different path.

669
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,640
He recalls the story dot.

670
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:53,630
Don't you remember,

671
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,321
uh,

672
00:33:54,321 --> 00:33:59,321
of a man named Carafano and a friend of
his who had gone to the Delphic oracle

673
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,920
who had gone to the Oracle Adelphi
and ask if there was anyone wiser than

674
00:34:03,921 --> 00:34:07,520
Socrates and was told there was not.

675
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,690
Socrates real tells us that when he
was told us he express disbelief in the

676
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:15,681
Oracle,

677
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:16,640
he didn't believe it.

678
00:34:16,641 --> 00:34:19,700
And in order to disprove
the Oracle statement,

679
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:25,090
he says he began a lifelong quest
to find someone wiser than himself.

680
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:31,160
A quest that in the course of which
led him to interrogate the politicians,

681
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,113
the poets,

682
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,680
the craftsmen,

683
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:38,710
all people of reputed to be knowledgeable
and his conversations led him to ask

684
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:40,671
questions.

685
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:41,340
Not About,

686
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:41,841
as we were saying,

687
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:43,820
natural scientific phenomenon,

688
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:49,160
but questions about the virtues as he
tells us the virtues of a human being and

689
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:49,850
a citizen,

690
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,810
what we would call today,

691
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:53,480
perhaps moral and political questions.

692
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,060
That incident,

693
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,260
uh,

694
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,990
that Socrates tells here is,

695
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,201
uh,

696
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:04,330
represents what one could
call the famous Socratic turn.

697
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:08,090
Socrates is second sailing,

698
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,080
so to speak.

699
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,520
Uh,

700
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,520
it represents the moment in the life of
Socrates where he turns away from the

701
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:21,641
investigation of natural phenomenon to
the study of the human and political

702
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:22,731
things,

703
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:24,380
the moral and political things,

704
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,720
the Delphic Oracle,

705
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:31,750
the Delphic story for what it's worth
marks a major turning point in Socrates is

706
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,850
intellectual biography.

707
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:37,620
The move from the younger Eric,

708
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,350
we could call an heiress to phonics,

709
00:35:39,351 --> 00:35:40,141
Socrates,

710
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:40,980
the Socrates,

711
00:35:40,981 --> 00:35:44,400
who again investigates the things
a loft and under the earth,

712
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,360
uh,

713
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,970
to the later platonic,

714
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,910
what we could call platonic Socrates,

715
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,050
the founder of political science,

716
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,100
Socrates,

717
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:58,101
the founder of our discipline who asks
about the virtues of moral and political

718
00:35:58,951 --> 00:35:59,784
life.

719
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,020
Socrates account of this turn,

720
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,140
this major turn in his life and career
leaves a lot of questions on answered

721
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:15,330
that may be even occurred to you
as you were reading this dialogue,

722
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,260
reading this speech.

723
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:21,261
Why does he turn away from
the investigation of natural
phenomenon to the study

724
00:36:22,351 --> 00:36:24,240
of human and political things?

725
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:25,820
Yeah.

726
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:30,820
The Delphic oracle is interpreted by
Socrates at least to command engaging with

727
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:35,510
other others in
philosophical conversation.

728
00:36:35,511 --> 00:36:38,390
Why does he interpret it this way?

729
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,050
Why does this same,

730
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:45,080
the proper interpretation to engage
in these kinds of conversations?

731
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,613
Uh,

732
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:54,620
it is this Socrates who was brought up
on charges of corruption and impiety,

733
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:57,170
and yet none of this quite
answers the question,

734
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,780
what is the nature of Socrates is crime?

735
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,890
What did he do?

736
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,510
What did corruption and impiety mean?

737
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,123
Uh,

738
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,650
to try to answer those questions,

739
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,840
we would have to look a little bit at
what Socrates means or what is meant by

740
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,210
this new kind of Socratic citizen.

741
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:21,980
Who is this citizen?

742
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:27,930
Okay.

743
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,310
The charges brought
against Socrates by Anna,

744
00:37:30,311 --> 00:37:34,800
just in melodies we see are not the same
exactly as those brought against him by

745
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:38,370
Aristophanes the comic poet
and it just in Mellitus.

746
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,560
Talk about impiety in corruption,

747
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,450
not investigating the things aloft and
making the weaker argument is stronger.

748
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,190
What do these terms mean?

749
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:48,570
Impiety and corruption?

750
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:51,630
In what sense are these civic offenses?

751
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:53,860
What,

752
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,330
what,

753
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:59,010
what could impiety have meant to
his audience and his contemporary?

754
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,833
At a minimum,

755
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,940
we would think the charge of impiety
suggest disrespect of the gods.

756
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,340
Impiety need not be the
same thing as atheism,

757
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,520
although mellitus confuses the two.

758
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,571
Uh,

759
00:38:15,571 --> 00:38:17,610
but it does suggest your reverence,

760
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:23,030
even blasphemy toward the things that
a society cares most deeply about.

761
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,283
Yes.

762
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,300
To be mps is to disrespect those things.

763
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:35,330
A person or a society cares most deeply
about when people today for refer to

764
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,840
flag burning as a desecration
desecrating the flag,

765
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,210
they were speaking the
language of impiety,

766
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:44,823
right?

767
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,480
They are speaking the language of some
kind of religious or crazy religious

768
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,120
desecration.

769
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,660
Melitis whose name in Greek actually
means care accuses Socrates of not caring

770
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:04,660
properly for the things that
his fellow citizens care about.

771
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,410
So the question is what
does Socrates care about?

772
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:08,740
What,

773
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,180
what does he care about?

774
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,490
Consider the following.

775
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,200
Every society,

776
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,160
uh,

777
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,160
which we know operates within the
medium of belief or faith of some kind.

778
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,060
Take our founding documents,

779
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,870
the declaration of independence,

780
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:31,860
the constitution,

781
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,800
all men are created equal.

782
00:39:34,801 --> 00:39:36,960
That we are endowed
with inalienable rights,

783
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:38,580
that all government,

784
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,460
legitimate government grows
out of consent and the like

785
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:48,140
these beliefs farm something
like a kind of national creed,

786
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,030
you might say American national creed,

787
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:55,060
what it means to be an American and not
someone else get how many people could

788
00:39:56,661 --> 00:40:00,920
give a kind of reasoned account
of what makes these beliefs true?

789
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,140
What grounds these beliefs?

790
00:40:03,141 --> 00:40:03,921
Most of us,

791
00:40:03,921 --> 00:40:07,820
most of the time hold these
beliefs as a matter of faith.

792
00:40:07,821 --> 00:40:09,110
As a matter of belief,

793
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:09,880
uh,

794
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
we have learned about the,

795
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:14,210
because we have learned about them from
childhood because they were written by

796
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,160
Thomas Jefferson or some other,

797
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,600
a reputed high authority to question
those beliefs would seem to exhibit a kind

798
00:40:22,431 --> 00:40:24,650
of lack of civic faith,

799
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,690
faith in our ruling opinions.

800
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:27,231
In short,

801
00:40:27,231 --> 00:40:31,220
you might say a lack of
civic piety or respect.

802
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:39,770
Socrates clearly believes that piety or
faith is the natural condition of the

803
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:40,614
citizen.

804
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,940
Every society no matter of what kind
requires a kind of faith in its ruling

805
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,680
principles and its fundamental beliefs.

806
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:54,780
But belief seems to be threatened
from at least two sources.

807
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,950
One is simple disbelief or unbelief.

808
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,101
Uh,

809
00:40:59,101 --> 00:41:04,101
kind of just sort of rejection of a ruling
opinion simply because you don't like

810
00:41:05,641 --> 00:41:06,690
it of some kind.

811
00:41:06,691 --> 00:41:06,961
You know,

812
00:41:06,961 --> 00:41:10,470
when you see the bumper sticker
on the car question authority,

813
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,660
just kind of rejection of,

814
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:13,201
of,

815
00:41:13,201 --> 00:41:14,310
of ruling opinion.

816
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:19,620
But the other source of conflict with
ruling opinion is from philosophy.

817
00:41:19,621 --> 00:41:24,030
Philosophy is not the same thing
as simple disbelief or rejection.

818
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,580
But the two can be easily confused.

819
00:41:26,581 --> 00:41:31,581
Philosophy grows out of a desire
to replace opinion with knowledge,

820
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,710
opinion,

821
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,410
or belief with reason for philosophy.

822
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:39,740
It is not enough simply
to hold a belief on faith,

823
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,750
but one must be able to
give a rational account,

824
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,930
a reasoned account for one's belief.

825
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,200
It's goal again is to replace civic faith
with rational knowledge and therefore

826
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:55,961
philosophy is necessarily at odds with
beliefs and with this kind of civic

827
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:56,541
faith,

828
00:41:56,541 --> 00:42:01,541
the citizen may accept certain beliefs
on faith because he or she is attached to

829
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:04,700
a particular kind of
political order or regime.

830
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,260
But for the philosopher,

831
00:42:06,261 --> 00:42:11,261
this is never enough for the philosophers
seeks to judge those beliefs in the,

832
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,710
in the light of true standards and the
light of what is always and everywhere.

833
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:17,840
True is a quest for knowledge.

834
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,500
There was unnecessary in in an inevitable
tension between philosophy and belief

835
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:28,930
or to put it another way
between philosophy and the
civic pieties that holds the

836
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:30,830
city together.

837
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:32,840
Okay.

838
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,130
From this point of view,

839
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:35,750
I want to say Socrates,

840
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,400
where we could ask what Socrates
guilty of impiety on the face of it.

841
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,380
The answer it had that seems yes,

842
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,570
Socrates does not care about the same
thing his fellow citizens care about his

843
00:42:47,571 --> 00:42:52,571
opening words to the jewelry scene to
convey this I he says him simply foreign

844
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:54,890
to the manner of speech here.

845
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,280
This seems to be a statement of his
alien nation or disaffection from the

846
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:03,020
concerns of his fellow Athenians.

847
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:08,110
I know nothing about what you
do or what you care about yet.

848
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:12,560
It certainly doesn't seem right to say
that Socrates does not care at all.

849
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:12,920
He,

850
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,660
he claims to care deeply,

851
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,960
perhaps in more deeply than anyone has
ever cared around him before or since in

852
00:43:20,841 --> 00:43:23,540
among the things he cares deeply about.

853
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:24,140
He says,

854
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,260
is this calling to do nothing as he says,

855
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:30,410
to do nothing but persuade
you both younger and older,

856
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,720
not to care for bodies and money,

857
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:37,310
but how your soul will be in
the best possible condition.

858
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,230
That concern with the state of one soul,

859
00:43:42,231 --> 00:43:46,070
he tells the jury has led him
not only to impoverish himself,

860
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,610
but to turn himself away
from the public business,

861
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:54,230
from the things that concern the city
to the pursuit of private virtue.

862
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:59,660
And here are the words of his that I
want to leave you with today from section

863
00:43:59,661 --> 00:44:01,910
31 d of the apology.

864
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,331
It's awkward.

865
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:03,950
He's right.

866
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:08,690
This is what opposes my political activity
and its opposition seems to me to be

867
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,630
altogether noble for no well,

868
00:44:11,631 --> 00:44:12,321
men of Athens,

869
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:15,410
if I had long ago attempted
to be politically active,

870
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,190
I would long ago have perished
and I would have benefited.

871
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:20,780
Neither you nor myself.

872
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:21,891
No.

873
00:44:21,891 --> 00:44:24,140
Do not be vexed with me when I speak.

874
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:29,170
The truth for there is no human being who
will preserve his life if he genuinely

875
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:35,081
opposes either you or any other multitude
and prevents many unjust and unlawful

876
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:36,840
things from happening in the city.

877
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:37,321
Rather,

878
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:38,154
he says,

879
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:43,370
if someone who really fights for justice
is going to preserve himself even for a

880
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:44,340
short time,

881
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:50,330
it is necessary for him to leave a pride
to lead a private rather than a public

882
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,043
life.

883
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:53,311
Think about that.

884
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:56,940
If someone who really fights for
justice is going to preserve himself,

885
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,550
it is necessary for him to lead a private,

886
00:44:59,551 --> 00:45:00,720
not a public life.

887
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:05,990
How are we to understand Socrates's pursue
his claim that the pursuit of justice

888
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:11,730
requires him to turn away
from public to private life?

889
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,730
What is this new kind of citizen again,

890
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:18,660
concerned with this
kind of private virtue,

891
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,720
this concern for the virtue of one soul?

892
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,990
That's the question I
want us to consider again,

893
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:25,470
uh,

894
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:30,470
for next week as we finish the apology
and move our way up to the cryto.

895
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,573
Okay.

896
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,840
We'll do that for next week.
