1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,100
Last time,

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,190
I believe I said I wanted to discuss three
features that Tocqueville regarded as

3
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:13,161
central to American democracy
that is not just study.

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,260
They were central to the
democratic experience.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,310
Uh,

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,310
but they are central features of the
American Democrat Democratic experience.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,670
And to what degree these can be or
could possibly be translated to other

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,260
contexts in other emerging democracies
remains very much an open question.

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,440
But of these three features,

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:37,740
uh,

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,573
the first,

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,180
uh,

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,320
talked a little bit about on Monday
is the importance of local government,

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:44,910
uh,

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,230
the township as it's translated in,

16
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:48,500
in,

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:48,961
in this,

18
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:49,920
in this edition.

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,910
What Tocqueville cause the
commune that community,

20
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:54,931
community,

21
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:55,710
Spirit,

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,700
local government,

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,753
um,

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,660
in some way connected to what
he calls later in the book,

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,500
uh,

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,500
the spirit of the city using the city in
the here and the context of the ancient

27
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:12,310
sense of Polis lists breed the city,

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,830
that spirit of a kind of Polish
like character in these small,

29
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:18,060
New England townships,

30
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,470
very important.

31
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,070
Uh,

32
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,180
Tocqueville believes,

33
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,110
uh,

34
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:22,771
for the,

35
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:23,280
uh,

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,970
uh,

37
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,350
sustaining a democratic country
in a democratic society.

38
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,670
But the second and probably the aspect
of Tocqueville's account of democratic,

39
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:36,650
uh,

40
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,010
America that has received the
most attention at least recently,

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:41,910
uh,

42
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,690
is,

43
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,020
uh,

44
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,020
the aspect of what he calls throughout
the Book Civil Association Civic

45
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,591
Association.

46
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:50,460
It is these,

47
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,001
uh,

48
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:53,700
what one might think of
as intermediary groups,

49
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:55,020
voluntary groups,

50
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:59,610
civic organizations of
all kinds that have,

51
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,530
uh,

52
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,980
that that Tocqueville is,

53
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:06,981
is immensely impressed with and which
he turns into one of the central pillars

54
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,650
of the democratic experience.

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,200
He writes that in democratic countries,

56
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,190
uh,

57
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,260
one of the most famous sentences,

58
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,950
uh,

59
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,810
from the book in democratic countries,

60
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:23,670
the Science of association he
says is the Mother's science.

61
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,860
The progress of all the others
depends on the progress of that one.

62
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,890
And it is through uniting and
joining together in common endeavors.

63
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,370
He believes that people
develop a taste for liberty.

64
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,400
It taste for freedom in America.

65
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,720
If I can just quote him again.

66
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,711
In America,

67
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:48,570
I encountered all sorts of associations
of which I confess I had no idea.

68
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,400
And I often admired the infinite art
with which the inhabitants of the United

69
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,400
States managed to fix a common goal to
the efforts of many men to get them to

70
00:02:58,621 --> 00:02:59,290
advance,

71
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,290
freely struck by the immense variety and
multiplicity and sheer number of these

72
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,050
various kinds of civic association.

73
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,263
And it doesn't,

74
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,050
it is important to see perhaps
this is one area in which,

75
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:17,740
uh,

76
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,740
Tocqueville's teams to most
clearly depart from Roussel,

77
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,750
at least the root cell
of this social contract.

78
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,020
After having said last time that his
account of local democracy township

79
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:36,160
democracy owes so much to Russo's
account of the general will.

80
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,160
But remember that Rousseau
in the social contract,

81
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:44,161
he did invade against warned against
what he called partial associations.

82
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,190
Uh,

83
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,870
partial associations like interest groups
of various kinds and have the tendency

84
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:51,280
to frustrate a,

85
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,310
the general will that stand as it were
between the individual and the general

86
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:57,640
will.

87
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,421
But Tocqueville,

88
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:02,230
on the other hand regards these
kinds of voluntary associations,

89
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:03,970
associations of all sorts.

90
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:09,210
It's precisely the place where
we learn habits of initiative.

91
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,570
A cooperation and
responsibility with others.

92
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:18,571
By taking care of our own interests
or the interests of our association.

93
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:22,300
We learn to take care of
the interests of others.

94
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,630
Sentiments and ideas renew themselves.

95
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:26,530
Tocqueville writes,

96
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:31,060
the heart is enlarged and
the human mind is developed.

97
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,081
So he puts,

98
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:36,970
you can see from a passage like that
how much weight he puts on these civic

99
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:37,870
associations.

100
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:39,400
The heart is enlarged,

101
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,830
the mind is developed.

102
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,080
It is through these associations,

103
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,070
PTA,

104
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,971
churches,

105
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:50,971
synagogues and other civil bodies and
association that institutions are formed

106
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:57,160
that can both resist in its way
the power of centralized authority,

107
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,480
central government.

108
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,280
But they are also the,

109
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,630
is it where the locus,

110
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,400
the seed bed where citizens
learn to become demo,

111
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,010
where we learn to become
democratic citizens.

112
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,880
It's very much important for
Tocqueville that these associations,

113
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,870
uh,

114
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,610
which the absence of which he
felt very acutely in France,

115
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,030
uh,

116
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,940
which had already become
a highly centralized,

117
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,870
uh,

118
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,740
society.

119
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,161
Uh,

120
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:24,994
it was these,

121
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,510
uh,

122
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,961
these,

123
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:30,961
these intermediary voluntary associations
that stand between the individual and,

124
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:33,460
and central authority,

125
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,580
the authority of the national government,

126
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,210
which,

127
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,210
which is what makes them
so important for him.

128
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,500
And this argument about the
importance of civic association.

129
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,900
I say it has become a,

130
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,910
in a way the most talked about past edge
or a part of the book in recent years.

131
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:57,241
This is due in large part to the influence
of political scientist Robert Putnam.

132
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,240
Uh,

133
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,520
a man who teaches at another university,

134
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,300
uh,

135
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,020
called,

136
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,380
uh,

137
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,900
called a book called Bowling alone.

138
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,610
You've probably maybe heard of that and
hear Putnam speaks about what he calls

139
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:11,780
human capital.

140
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,380
Uh,

141
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,340
what Tocqueville,

142
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,610
uh,

143
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:13,801
in,

144
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:14,040
uh,

145
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,950
in less obviously science,

146
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,040
less social scientific jargon because
habits of the heart mores habits of the

147
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:22,430
heart,

148
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,360
mind and heart.

149
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:28,361
But Putnam argues that it is this social
capital that is developed through civic

150
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:33,491
association and its chief example as the
title of the book in the article from

151
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,181
which it draws,

152
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,010
suggests it said the bowling league,

153
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,790
it's a kind of model of civic association
and particularly he is concerned with

154
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:48,821
the decline of these associations
in contemporary American life.

155
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,190
Hence the title of the Book Bowling alone.

156
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,990
The fact that Tocqueville himself
describes these civic associations is the

157
00:06:56,991 --> 00:07:01,991
product of art suggest that that is
to say that they are not natural.

158
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:03,074
They are not,

159
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,440
uh,

160
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,020
somehow uh,

161
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:05,450
uh,

162
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,800
the result of um,

163
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:07,970
uh,

164
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,280
some kind of instinctual behavior on us.

165
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,280
They are joining with others in voluntary
associations is a learned activity.

166
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:16,971
Uh,

167
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:20,990
it is something that requires a certain
kind of culture and that end is a

168
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:21,920
learned activity.

169
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:23,810
It is something also it is an artist,

170
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,411
his skill,

171
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,570
it is a craft that can also be lost.

172
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,800
And his argument is that more
and more people are so to speak,

173
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,060
choosing to bowl,

174
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,260
bowl alone,

175
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,620
uh,

176
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,620
something that shows an alarming tendency
towards isolation and the subsequent

177
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:43,370
kind of a depletion or most
of our civic capacities.

178
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,881
Uh,

179
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,870
the question is have our uh,

180
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,360
taking Tocqueville to the prison,

181
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:52,361
have our capacities for
joining with others being
eroded by the forces of modern

182
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,780
politics and technology are in fact we
becoming more and more a nation of solid,

183
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:00,510
solitary and,

184
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,540
and couch potatoes.

185
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,350
Jude,

186
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,910
can I get you here for just a minute?

187
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,830
These are some of the serious questions
and there is a big literature,

188
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:10,640
uh,

189
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,170
that has grown up around it.

190
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,670
And some of this literature,

191
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,150
uh,

192
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,320
finds Putnam's,

193
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,160
uh,

194
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,960
conclusions to be overdrawn,

195
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:18,740
uh,

196
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,640
that he exaggerates
the influence of these,

197
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:23,150
uh,

198
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,720
associations did or the
decline of these associations.

199
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,350
Uh,

200
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,030
I'll tell you this,

201
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,200
when these associations,

202
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:31,034
and in fact,

203
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,460
uh,

204
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,870
our civic state is not as
bad off as he suggests,

205
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,730
but what I want to do suggest today,

206
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:40,850
and this is where I'm going to show a
film and June is going to help me just a

207
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:41,930
couple of clips,

208
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,140
is that there is a serious question,

209
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,370
I think in my mind,

210
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,820
whether bowling leagues are a proper
model for Democratic Association,

211
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:52,940
uh,

212
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,390
now one can say and using the title
bowling alone that Putnam is just speaking

213
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,620
metaphorically,

214
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,110
that,

215
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,220
uh,

216
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,430
he's not really doesn't mean bowling
leagues and because you use it using it as

217
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:03,210
a metaphor,

218
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,640
but let's take him at his
word and let's find out a,

219
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,910
if bowling leagues are in
fact the ideal transmitter,

220
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:11,251
uh,

221
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,130
for democratic mores and values.

222
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,100
And I want to take an example
from a movie that I have,

223
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:21,030
which I'm very fond by the Cohen
brothers called the big Lebowski,

224
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,120
which is a movie about a bowling league,

225
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,310
or at least three gentlemen who take
their bowling in their bowling league very

226
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:30,144
seriously.

227
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:30,480
Uh,

228
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,190
the three of them are the
dude who is a stone Hippie,

229
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,220
uh,

230
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,053
Walter,

231
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,120
who's kind of a whacked out Vietnam vet
and Danny who's a last wave and they are

232
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:42,481
very,

233
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,630
very concerned with
getting in to the finals,

234
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:47,220
into the bone bowling tournament.

235
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,400
And in their way stands a man named Hayes
who's Cantana who it happens also to

236
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,360
be a sex offender.

237
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,680
And we're going to show,

238
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,850
I want to show a couple of clips from
this movie and I should warn you that

239
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:02,820
there is some very bad
language being used here.

240
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,970
So if you think that is
going to be offensive to you,

241
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,223
you should leave.

242
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:07,570
Uh,

243
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,180
we won't take more than about four,

244
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,770
four minutes or so.

245
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,040
And we're going to show a couple of
clips about the ethos of men bowling,

246
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,533
do

247
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,130
civic association,

248
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:23,831
the Eith,

249
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,610
the democratic ethos of Bowling Leagues.

250
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,990
And I would assume three
ideal democratic citizens.

251
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,060
Well,

252
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,390
I,

253
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,580
I did that as a little bit of a joke
at Professor Putnam's expense maybe,

254
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:38,971
but,

255
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,300
uh,

256
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,133
you know,

257
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,510
and I also really liked the movie

258
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,190
and it's also really hard to
follow something like that too,

259
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:48,024
I have to say.

260
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,320
But,

261
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,153
um,

262
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,213
uh,

263
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,500
obviously it seems,

264
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,830
it goes to show that civic
association alone is not enough,

265
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,280
uh,

266
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,980
to,

267
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,600
uh,

268
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,030
create a democratic citizens again,

269
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,810
otherwise smokey and the
dude and Walter would be,

270
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,350
uh,

271
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:04,860
you know,

272
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,290
perfect example of democratic citizens.

273
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,680
Tocqueville focuses on a third and other,

274
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,130
uh,

275
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,130
leg of the stool of democratic life and
that that is what he calls the spirit of

276
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:20,540
religion central again,

277
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,670
as the third and I,

278
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,700
and in in many ways very important prop
of the American democratic experience

279
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,490
and my Ra on my arrival
in the United States,

280
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,091
he observes,

281
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:38,091
it was the religious aspect of the
country that struck my eye first.

282
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,650
Very impressed with that.

283
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,940
And like other European visitors to the
United States both then as well as now

284
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,710
it's Tocqueville was deeply struck with
how democracy and religion walk seemed

285
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:53,980
to walk hand in hand with each other.

286
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,730
Precisely the opposite of
what has occurred in Europe,

287
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,540
where religion in democracy
or religion inequality,

288
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,030
we're long on a collision course.

289
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,013
What made,

290
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,320
uh,

291
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,310
the American,

292
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:06,671
uh,

293
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:08,650
encounter with democratic life?

294
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,693
A unique,

295
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,000
that is one of
Tocqueville's big questions.

296
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,430
In the first instance you could say,

297
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:15,900
uh,

298
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,900
or as Tocqueville notes that American
America is primarily a puritan democracy.

299
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,060
I see the whole destiny of America
contained in the first puritan who land on

300
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:30,070
its shore landed on its shores.

301
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:33,940
He says like the whole
human race in the first man.

302
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,230
Uh,

303
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,650
our experience was determined in,

304
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,750
in crucial ways by those are the,

305
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,430
by early puritanism.

306
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,090
Uh,

307
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:48,040
America was created by people with
strong religious beliefs and habits who

308
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:53,041
brought to the new world a suspicion
of government and a strong desire of

309
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:54,040
independence.

310
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,450
And this has set,

311
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,280
this has been the foundation
of the separation of church
and state that has done

312
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:03,970
so much both for religious
and political liberty.

313
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,280
And toke though drew from this
two very important consequences,

314
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:10,110
I think,

315
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,470
uh,

316
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,940
about religious life in America.

317
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,571
Uh,

318
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:14,404
the first,

319
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,340
uh,

320
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,340
is that the thesis has propounded by the
great philosophers of the enlightenment

321
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:24,850
of the 18th century and
still advanced in many,

322
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,390
uh,

323
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,910
you might say enlightened quarters today,

324
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,450
uh,

325
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,820
that religion will disappear,

326
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,630
uh,

327
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,000
as with the advance of modernity.

328
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:35,160
That is modernity,

329
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,040
advances,

330
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,520
uh,

331
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,030
religious life will disappear
I suppose in the 20th Century,

332
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:40,960
Mocks Vapor,

333
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,380
uh,

334
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,040
gave,

335
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,610
uh,

336
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,443
voice,

337
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:43,720
uh,

338
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,340
most prominently to that point of view
that would be a process of secularization

339
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,390
with maternity.

340
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:51,760
And it sort of gradual withering away,

341
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,260
uh,

342
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,470
of religious belief.

343
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,250
Tocqueville shows that
to be demonstrably false,

344
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,061
uh,

345
00:13:58,061 --> 00:14:01,090
that religion will not simply disappear,

346
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:01,510
uh,

347
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,500
as modernity,

348
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:02,980
uh,

349
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,810
move moves forward and that the
enlightenment and it's contemporary heirs,

350
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,080
theorists of development and modernization
and so on have been altogether wrong

351
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:18,270
about their confident predictions
about the decline and withering away of

352
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:19,330
religious faith.

353
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,003
And secondly,

354
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:21,431
uh,

355
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:26,431
Tocqueville takes it to be a terrible
mistake to try to eliminate religion or

356
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,270
just secularized society altogether.

357
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,270
This is in fact,

358
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,010
probably a more controversial,

359
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:33,380
uh,

360
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,960
a very controversial claim.

361
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:36,370
It was his belief,

362
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,330
and again,

363
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,330
perhaps here he's influenced by Roussell
and the chapter on the civil civil

364
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:47,290
religion at the end of the social contract
that free societies rest on public

365
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:52,100
morality and morality cannot
be effective without religion.

366
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,580
It may be true that individuals can
derive moral guidance from reason alone,

367
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,100
but society's can't.

368
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,701
Uh,

369
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:06,620
and the danger of attempting to eliminate
religion from public life is that the

370
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:11,650
need or desire to believe will therefore
be transferred to other and far more

371
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,170
dangerous outlets.

372
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,820
Despotism he says,

373
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:18,320
can do without faith,

374
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,240
but freedom cannot,

375
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,020
uh,

376
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,580
very arresting sentence.

377
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:25,430
Despotism can do without faith but reason.

378
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:25,940
But,

379
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,200
but freedom cannot.

380
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Religion is more necessary in a republic
and in a democratic country than any

381
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:34,184
other.

382
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,053
He says,

383
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,780
but why is religion
necessary to a republic?

384
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:41,510
Why does democracy require religion?

385
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:41,931
And here,

386
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:44,420
Tocqueville gives a variety of answers.

387
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:50,690
One persistent theme running throughout
his book as a whole is that only

388
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:55,691
religion can resist the tendency toward
materialism and to kind of low self

389
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:02,000
interest that he believes is
intrinsic to democratic ages.

390
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,110
And societies.

391
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:05,540
The principal business of religion,

392
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,470
he frequently,

393
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,310
uh,

394
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,400
rights,

395
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,050
uh,

396
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,540
is to purify as to regulate,

397
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:16,541
is to restrain the kind of ardent
desire for a wellbeing and particularly

398
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:23,291
material wellbeing that
becomes particularly prominent
during ages of equality.

399
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,310
It's one,

400
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,143
one reason,

401
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,110
but secondly,

402
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,011
or an addition,

403
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:29,300
Tocqueville operates,

404
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:29,961
uh,

405
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:31,970
I find it with a very interesting,

406
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:32,640
uh,

407
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,050
I might even call it
a metaphysic of faith,

408
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,770
uh,

409
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,810
that regard to religious belief as,

410
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:42,590
as a necessary component for human action.

411
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,210
Uh,

412
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,820
when religion is destroyed in a people,

413
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,690
this is Tocqueville.

414
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,180
When religion is destroyed
in a people doubt,

415
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:55,181
takes hold of the higher portion of the
intellect and half paralyzes all the

416
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:57,284
others.

417
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,220
Uh,

418
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,820
when,

419
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,030
uh,

420
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,040
religion is destroyed,

421
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,740
doubt takes over and it had,

422
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:08,741
it has a kind of paralyzing effect on
the will and our capacity for action.

423
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,780
And this paralysis of the will,

424
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,870
this inability to act as a condition
that later writers would choose to call

425
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,103
nihilism.

426
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:24,310
Faith is a necessary component for our
belief that we are free agents and not

427
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:30,521
simply the play thing of blind
forces and random causes.

428
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:31,790
Uh,

429
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,660
so to speak,

430
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,270
our beliefs about freedom.

431
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:40,271
And the dignity of the individual are
inseparable for him from religious faith

432
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,421
and it is light.

433
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:46,400
It is unlikely that these beliefs
about the dignity of the individual,

434
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,760
uh,

435
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,070
can survive without religion.

436
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,800
Uh,

437
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,140
just to take a contemporary
example of that,

438
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,730
think about the debates.

439
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,710
We have had a over such
things as cloning and uh,

440
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,280
the sense that many people have that,

441
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,030
uh,

442
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,830
the dignity of the individual,

443
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,020
which is often connected with,

444
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,190
uh,

445
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,920
a kind of religious belief,

446
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,413
uh,

447
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,930
sanctity of life.

448
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,980
The dignity of the individual is,

449
00:18:14,981 --> 00:18:19,370
is somehow deeply violated
by these advances of,

450
00:18:19,371 --> 00:18:21,930
of sort of scientific technology.

451
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:22,380
Uh,

452
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,160
that these are,

453
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,160
that religion remains a crucial
prop for our beliefs about,

454
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,310
uh,

455
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:29,910
human,

456
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,900
human dignity.

457
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,800
No more powerful challenge to the
enlightenment's faith in science and

458
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:38,670
scientific progress,

459
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:39,510
uh,

460
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,850
is can be found then in Tocqueville.

461
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,540
And one,

462
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,430
one final issue remains.

463
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:46,680
I would say Tocqueville often writes,

464
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,420
and I would say this is the dominant
tone of his writing on religion.

465
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,690
He often writes is if religion is only
valuable or valuable primarily for this

466
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:58,800
social function it serves.

467
00:18:59,250 --> 00:18:59,790
Uh,

468
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,390
this is certainly consistent with
lots of things he says about religion.

469
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:08,460
He's only concerned about religion for
its social and political consequences

470
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:12,150
rather than from the deeper
truths of religious belief.

471
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,320
I view religion.

472
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:17,160
He says only from a purely
human point of view.

473
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,850
He says he's only looking
for its effect on society.

474
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:26,060
But I would ask how accurate is that
statement or does it describe a or

475
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:30,030
characterize all of Tocqueville's
views about religion?

476
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,920
I think not a,

477
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,780
let me just say why for a minute.

478
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,680
I think that sort of sociological or
functionalist reading of a religion that

479
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,450
he's interested only in it only for
its social effect is only part of

480
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,200
Tocqueville's very complex
attitude towards the subject.

481
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:49,710
Uh,

482
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,290
maybe you'll have a chance to
talk about this in your section.

483
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,880
Maybe you'll have an opportunity to
write about it at some other time.

484
00:19:56,881 --> 00:20:00,210
But remember that Tocqueville was
not only a student of Roussel,

485
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,020
as he said in that letter to Louis De
[inaudible] that I mentioned last time,

486
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:09,021
his other two great sources of inspiration
or a Monte scare and a 17th century

487
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,630
French philosopher named Blaise Pascal.

488
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:18,140
A Pascal was a religious
philosopher who more than any other,

489
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,051
uh,

490
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:23,460
emphasize the emptiness of
knowledge without faith,

491
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,700
a man may be the rational animal,

492
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,270
uh,

493
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:32,270
but reason is somehow unable
to plum or reason is unable to,

494
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,650
to grasp the unfathomable
depths of the universe.

495
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,660
In one of his most famous statements,

496
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,910
Pascal said a vapor,

497
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:42,580
he says,

498
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,321
a vapor,

499
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:46,260
a drop of water is enough to kill him.

500
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,441
Speaking of,

501
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:49,660
speaking of here of us human humans,

502
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,030
a drop of water is enough to kill us.

503
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,970
Man is a read or read,

504
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,980
the weakest in nature.

505
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,410
But he is a thinking read.

506
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,450
We are,

507
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,320
we are weak.

508
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,183
We are,

509
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:03,760
we,

510
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,070
we,

511
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,871
we think,

512
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:05,170
but,

513
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:05,860
but we are.

514
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,400
We are.

515
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,660
It is our weakness.

516
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:09,130
It is our dependence,

517
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:13,630
a sense of dependence that that
struck Pascal and Tocqueville.

518
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,260
You can find this in many,

519
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,010
several passages throughout the democracy.

520
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,920
Talk though I think discovered in Pascal,

521
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:26,610
a sense of kind of existential emptiness
and the incompleteness of life that

522
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:31,180
cannot be explained in
terms of reason alone.

523
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,081
There was also,

524
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:35,440
he felt something deeply hubristic uh,

525
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:36,220
about,

526
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:36,610
uh,

527
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,790
the way in which a conditions of equality,

528
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,360
uh,

529
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,680
foster,

530
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,160
uh,

531
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,660
this idea of,

532
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:43,961
of,

533
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:44,231
of,

534
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:44,471
of,

535
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:44,801
of,

536
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:49,801
of rational self sufficiency Tocqueville's
purpose in many ways was to limit

537
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:53,650
reason to make room for faith.

538
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,420
And this is one of my favorite passages.

539
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:59,470
Let me just read it or sentenced
her to the short space of 60 years.

540
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:02,080
He writes almost as an aside,

541
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:03,880
the short space of 60 years,

542
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:06,760
we'll never confine the
whole imagination of man.

543
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,920
The incomplete joys of this world
will never suffice for his heart.

544
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:18,670
Incomplete joys of this world
will never suffice for his heart.

545
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,301
In other words,

546
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:20,860
there is something we desire,

547
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:26,060
but beyond the here and now that only
faith can supply the sole exhibits a kind

548
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:32,521
of longing and desire for eternity and
to kind of discussed with the world and

549
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:36,250
the limits of physical existence.

550
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:40,120
Religion he goes on is only
a particular form of hope.

551
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,840
And it is as natural to the human
heart is hope itself only by a kind of

552
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:50,560
aberration of the intellect and with
the aid of a sort of moral violence

553
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,480
exercised on their own nature.

554
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:57,870
Do men stray from religious belief and
invincible inclination leads them back to

555
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:00,184
religion?

556
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,350
Disbelief is an accident.

557
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,550
Faith alone is the
permanent state of humanity.

558
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,470
Uh,

559
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,650
if anyone's interested,

560
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:10,210
that's on page two 84,

561
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:15,390
but no one can possibly read that
section and come away from Tocqueville by

562
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:17,860
thinking he had a,

563
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,990
had only a kind of functionalist
sociological view of religion,

564
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,800
concern with its effects on
human behavior and society,

565
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,970
uh,

566
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,830
disbelief as an accident.

567
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Faith is the permanent condition of
humanity and only to a kind of moral

568
00:23:35,471 --> 00:23:38,050
violence through the moral violence.

569
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,183
Uh,

570
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,780
Ken,

571
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,060
uh,

572
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,340
religious faith be,

573
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:42,940
uh,

574
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,280
be eliminated.

575
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,470
I think these passages show a much deeper,

576
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:53,090
almost metaphysical dimension
to Tocqueville start,

577
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:53,430
uh,

578
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:58,430
shows him to be a thinker like Plato
in many ways of enormous psychological

579
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,460
depth and subtlety,

580
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,090
uh,

581
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:02,321
and,

582
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:03,200
and insight.

583
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,020
But these are the three
features or three of the future.

584
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,660
I think the three central features that,

585
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,200
uh,

586
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,400
remain for him,

587
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,200
crucial to democracy,

588
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:12,740
uh,

589
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,760
local government,

590
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,880
civil association in what he
calls the spirit of religion

591
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,560
and yet obviously or is not well,

592
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,853
uh,

593
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,860
or as far from being well,

594
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,023
uh,

595
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:29,923
too often,

596
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,580
way too often we read,

597
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,060
uh,

598
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:37,060
democracy in America is if it were
simply a celebration of the democratic

599
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:38,720
experience in America.

600
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,240
It is not a,

601
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,120
and Tocqueville,

602
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:41,541
uh,

603
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:46,130
among other things is deeply
worried about the potential.

604
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,740
Mentioned briefly about this last time,

605
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,100
uh,

606
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,300
the,

607
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:49,620
the,

608
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,130
the potential of democratic tyranny.

609
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:52,820
Uh,

610
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,710
why is there a belief or why,

611
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,480
why would one believe,

612
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:57,930
uh,

613
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:58,590
that,

614
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:58,900
that,

615
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,390
that,

616
00:24:59,390 --> 00:24:59,720
that,

617
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,220
that democratic government,

618
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:01,720
uh,

619
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,720
alone will eliminate various forms of
arbitrary rule in tyrannical government.

620
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,570
In fact,

621
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,300
it might create new forms of tyranny,

622
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,470
democratic tyranny of which
previous societies had been,

623
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:15,890
uh,

624
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,510
perhaps unaware.

625
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,670
This is an issue that he treats
twice in two important parts,

626
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,091
uh,

627
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:23,540
in,

628
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:23,930
in,

629
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:24,770
in his work,

630
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:26,090
one in volume one,

631
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,020
the other,

632
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,950
in volume two.

633
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:28,551
I'm only going to,

634
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:31,310
I'm going to talk for a
little bit today about,

635
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:31,850
uh,

636
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,730
his account of tyranny of
the majority and volume wine.

637
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,880
And I'm going to save a part of the other
rest of the discussion for next week

638
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:45,200
when he talks about what he
calls democratic despotism
and the second part of

639
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,350
democracy in America and volume one,

640
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,640
he treats the,

641
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,950
what he calls the tyranny of the majority,

642
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:54,470
largely in terms you might say,

643
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:57,440
that are derived or
inherited from Aristotle.

644
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,120
And even the authors of the federalist
papers you remember in Aristotle's

645
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:02,990
politics,

646
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:03,620
uh,

647
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,620
Aristotle associated democracy with the
rule of the many rule of the many for

648
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,110
all kinds of peer purposes,

649
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,430
generally means rule of the poor,

650
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,120
uh,

651
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,670
and rule of the poor
for their own interest.

652
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,120
The danger with democracy
for Aristotle was it did,

653
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,990
it still represented a,

654
00:26:21,991 --> 00:26:26,991
the tyranny of one class a of
society over the society of a whole,

655
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:29,960
the largest class ruling,

656
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,300
uh,

657
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:35,300
in its interests over the
minority democracy for the
ancients was always a form

658
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:40,010
of class struggle between
the rich and the poor.

659
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,990
And that was in many respects,

660
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:46,680
the way in which democracy came to be
viewed even by the federalist authors who

661
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:51,390
came up with their own solution to the
problem of democracy or what they called

662
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,770
a Republican government.

663
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,630
The problem of Republican government was
this problem of you might say majority

664
00:26:57,631 --> 00:27:02,631
faction and their answer to the problem
of majority faction was in Madison's

665
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:05,940
term to enlarge the orbit
of government to make,

666
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:10,941
make societies and polities much
larger in order not to try to eliminate

667
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:11,731
faction,

668
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,320
but to increase them.

669
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:13,830
Uh,

670
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,830
by increasing the number of factions you
decrease the possibility that any one

671
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:24,441
of them will be able to represent or
exercise a kind of permanent majority,

672
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:25,980
uh,

673
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,711
control,

674
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:27,600
a kind of permanent,

675
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,520
a tyranny of the majority.

676
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:31,320
The greater the number of factions,

677
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,500
the less likelihood that any one of them
will be able to exercise despotic power

678
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,180
over national politics.

679
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:44,670
And this is a question that Tocqueville
returns to or turns two in that very

680
00:27:44,671 --> 00:27:48,390
important chapter from book one called
the omnipotence of the majority in the

681
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:50,460
United States into f and its effects,

682
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,640
which is in many respects a response or
a re provides his reading and critique

683
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,110
of the classical or traditional
theory of democratic tyranny.

684
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,870
The U s constitution,

685
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,060
he talks about his enshrined,

686
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:06,960
the majority,

687
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,790
and it's opening preamble.

688
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:11,610
We the people it has
enshrined the majority,

689
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,530
even as it has sought to limit
the powers of the people.

690
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:21,531
And although Tocqueville devotes a
great deal of attention in volume one,

691
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:23,970
we're not really reading these sections.

692
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:26,670
I don't think they're all that
important for our purposes.

693
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:30,330
He spends a great deal of attention
simply sort of describing,

694
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:30,991
uh,

695
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:31,291
the,

696
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:31,471
the,

697
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:34,530
the makeup of the federal constitution,

698
00:28:34,531 --> 00:28:37,010
the structure of the
houses of governments.

699
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:42,011
So on one has to say he is far less
impressed than Madison or the federalist

700
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:48,171
authors were that the problem of
majority faction has been solved in,

701
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,710
in America.

702
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,500
Again,

703
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,730
the federalist authors following lock
and Montesquieu believed all that was

704
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:59,820
unnecessary or was separation of powers,

705
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,740
a system of representation,

706
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,950
a system of checks and balances that
this could serve as an effective check on

707
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,910
majority rule.

708
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,970
But Tocqueville was less certain of that.

709
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,830
It was less certain that these,

710
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,491
as it were,

711
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:19,491
institutional devices alone could
check what he calls the empire of the

712
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:20,574
majority,

713
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,410
the empire of the majority,

714
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:23,910
a term that he uses,

715
00:29:23,911 --> 00:29:28,911
that he clearly has kind of theological
connotations denoting a kind of divine

716
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:30,210
omnipotence,

717
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:35,420
that the people have come to be
the ultimate or final authority.

718
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,110
And rather than regarding,

719
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,153
as it were,

720
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,380
the people in Madisonian terms,

721
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:44,350
simply as a kind of ongoing
shifting coalition of interests,

722
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:50,430
Tocqueville regarded the majority in
democratic societies as the power of the

723
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:52,960
majority is unlimited,

724
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:58,020
is unlimited and unstoppable legal
guarantees of minority rights,

725
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,420
he thought were unlikely to be effective,

726
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:01,900
uh,

727
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,080
in the face of mobilized public opinion.

728
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,750
Why does Tocqueville believe that or what,

729
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:08,380
what,

730
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:08,710
uh,

731
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,850
what led him to express
such skepticism about,

732
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,300
uh,

733
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,450
even American democracy's
inability to check?

734
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:16,790
Uh,

735
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:21,790
the prospect of democratic tyranny in
part I think talks to us answer was that

736
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:27,690
majority tyranny was inseparable from
the threats of revolutionary violence and

737
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:33,991
particularly charismatic demagogues in
military leaders like Napoleon in France.

738
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,100
Uh,

739
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,490
and,

740
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,010
uh,

741
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:41,440
and America's a counterpart
to Napoleon Andrew Jackson,

742
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,340
uh,

743
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,240
Napoleon,

744
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:43,810
uh,

745
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,830
was in France,

746
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:47,420
the man capable of mobilizing a,

747
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:52,510
the masters into fits of patriotic
zeal and to carry on a war.

748
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,200
And Jacksonian ism for him was simply,

749
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:56,650
uh,

750
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,180
looked like sort of the,

751
00:30:58,181 --> 00:30:58,540
uh,

752
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:03,540
an American fault farm of Bonaparte
partism a military commander writing to

753
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:09,190
political power on the wings of popular
support more than anything else.

754
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:09,791
Tocqueville,

755
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:14,791
feared militarism combined with a
kind of unlimited patriotic fervor.

756
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:17,890
And it is in these respects,

757
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:19,270
you can begin to see,

758
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,660
uh,

759
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,890
some of the less,

760
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,260
the less ennobling features,

761
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:23,610
uh,

762
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:28,610
of the democratic experience and the
more ominous possibilities of democratic

763
00:31:28,811 --> 00:31:29,644
rule.

764
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,870
The power of the majority says,

765
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:33,250
makes itself feared,

766
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:35,980
especially to the dominance
of the legislature.

767
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,540
He believed,

768
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,230
uh,

769
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,250
we could talk about whether this
belief is still valid or true.

770
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,230
He believed that the most,

771
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,273
again,

772
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:50,670
that democracy tends towards a kind of
legislative dominance of the legislatures

773
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:53,470
were the people's voice makes it's,

774
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:56,020
it's will most clearly known.

775
00:31:56,021 --> 00:31:58,750
And by having short elections are short,

776
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,670
short cycles every two years,

777
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,121
uh,

778
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:02,560
in the House of Representatives,

779
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,280
it was a way of making sure
that the legislature's,

780
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:07,114
the house,

781
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,953
the houses,

782
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,280
uh,

783
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,610
are,

784
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:08,841
are,

785
00:32:08,841 --> 00:32:09,120
are,

786
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,900
are very close to public
opinion and public control.

787
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:14,980
And he sees this,

788
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:15,670
uh,

789
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:15,851
these,

790
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:16,001
these,

791
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,290
this is a dangerous thing.

792
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,510
This kind of legislative dominance,

793
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,613
uh,

794
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,330
that he sees is one farm,

795
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:22,840
uh,

796
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,800
in the way in which the tyranny
of the majority expresses itself.

797
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:31,660
But the most important and
the most memorable aspects
of tyranny of the majority

798
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,460
have less to do with these,

799
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:34,294
um,

800
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,130
institutional,

801
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,300
uh,

802
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,530
institutional,

803
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,170
uh,

804
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,520
forms you might say.

805
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,200
Then it has to do with,

806
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,153
uh,

807
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,890
the way in which the empire,

808
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,251
again,

809
00:32:46,251 --> 00:32:47,001
I'll use his term,

810
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:51,770
the empire of the majority makes
itself felt in the realm of thought and

811
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:52,604
opinion.

812
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,021
Uh,

813
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:58,750
the influence of the
majority over-thought.

814
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:00,910
Okay.

815
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,880
In an always startling
passage from the book,

816
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:04,930
Tocqueville remarks.

817
00:33:04,931 --> 00:33:07,510
I know of no other country,

818
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:12,990
we're in general less independence of
mind in genuine freedom of discussion rain

819
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,550
than in America,

820
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:20,830
have no country where there was less
independence of mind and freedom of

821
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:21,664
discussion.

822
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,090
He is,

823
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,280
I suspect overstating the case.

824
00:33:27,281 --> 00:33:27,761
But,

825
00:33:27,761 --> 00:33:28,594
uh,

826
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,720
his argument here is that the dangers
to freedom of thought in a democracy do

827
00:33:34,511 --> 00:33:37,660
not come from the threat
of an inquisition.

828
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,800
They do not come from
a something like that,

829
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:46,801
but they are exercised in more subtle
forms of exclusion and ostracism.

830
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,420
Tocqueville is perhaps in that passage,

831
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:57,421
one of the first and most perceptive
analysts of what today might be called the

832
00:33:58,301 --> 00:34:03,301
power of political correctness to
control and to eliminate certain kinds of

833
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:10,410
ideas and opinions from being
thought it is the fear of ostracism.

834
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:11,561
In some sense,

835
00:34:11,561 --> 00:34:14,440
the fear of being socially ostracized,

836
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:14,980
that,

837
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,200
uh,

838
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,200
the majority to through which the
majority exercises it's control and talk.

839
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:23,140
Those statement here,

840
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:23,690
uh,

841
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,500
is of course the persecution
can take many forms,

842
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,633
uh,

843
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,020
under a democratic,

844
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:29,770
uh,

845
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:30,490
people,

846
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:30,791
uh,

847
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:31,960
from the cruelest,

848
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:32,350
uh,

849
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,550
to the most mild.

850
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,330
Uh,

851
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:39,330
he gives various examples of the crueler
forms of the way in which the majority

852
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:41,320
has expressed itself itself.

853
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,150
In a lengthy footnote to the book,

854
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:43,690
uh,

855
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,530
for example,

856
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:44,920
he,

857
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,480
in this,

858
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:45,681
in,

859
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:47,920
in some of this these
parts he talks about,

860
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:48,530
uh,

861
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,810
he gives two examples.

862
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:50,644
One in which,

863
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:51,070
uh,

864
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,780
during the war of 1812,

865
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,070
he says there were,

866
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:54,730
uh,

867
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,480
there were some antiwar
journalists in Baltimore.

868
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,700
Maybe you read that passage who were,

869
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,543
uh,

870
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,550
who were taken out,

871
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,130
uh,

872
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,400
their,

873
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:04,671
their,

874
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:05,010
their,

875
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,270
their newspaper pressed was burned down.

876
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:07,961
And,

877
00:35:07,961 --> 00:35:08,560
uh,

878
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,130
and they were,

879
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,150
I think they were hung.

880
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:10,900
He says,

881
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,980
this is the way in which kind of
Ma that mob mentality took over.

882
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:20,100
And he also uses the example of the way
in which black voters in the state of

883
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:24,400
Pennsylvania and in petite focuses
on this particularly have been

884
00:35:24,401 --> 00:35:25,490
disenfranchised.

885
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:30,310
And he mentions Pennsylvania in particular
because Pennsylvania is a Quaker

886
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:31,144
state.

887
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,750
Uh,

888
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,220
that is to say a state where we're,

889
00:35:33,221 --> 00:35:38,221
one would've thought liberal opinion
towards questions of racial justice would,

890
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:40,080
would have been most advanced.

891
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,040
And even there,

892
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:41,874
he says,

893
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:42,301
uh,

894
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:43,470
the majority,

895
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:43,970
uh,

896
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:44,880
constrain,

897
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:45,740
uh,

898
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,410
uh,

899
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:51,330
African American voters from
a free blacks from voting.

900
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:53,250
So these are ways in which,

901
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,940
uh,

902
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,331
again,

903
00:35:54,331 --> 00:35:54,750
some,

904
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,583
some,

905
00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:00,650
some overt and cruel and
persecute persecutory others
milder and in through the

906
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:03,540
form of ostracism that
he wants to say that,

907
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,290
uh,

908
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,060
that the,

909
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,780
that the democratic,

910
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:07,770
uh,

911
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,890
sovereignty can exercise itself,

912
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,370
chains and executions or
the course instruments.

913
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:16,950
He writes that tyranny formerly employed.

914
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,151
But in our day,

915
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:21,900
civilization has perfected
despotism itself,

916
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,300
which seemed to have
nothing more to learn.

917
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:26,520
We have deaf perfected despotism.

918
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:29,280
He says under the absolute
government of one man,

919
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,580
despotism struck crudely at the body.

920
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,710
So to reach the soul,

921
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:35,281
no doubt,

922
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:40,080
thinking about the inquisition and
things like this in Spain and in parts of

923
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:41,040
Catholic Europe,

924
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,690
and he writes in the soul,

925
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:46,140
escaping from those blows
rose gloriously above it,

926
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,080
but he goes in democratic republics,

927
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,660
tyranny does not proceed in this way.

928
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,760
It leaves the body alone and
goes directly for the soul.

929
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,510
Well,

930
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,670
there's a wealth of,

931
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,850
of commentary.

932
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,211
Uh,

933
00:37:00,211 --> 00:37:00,871
you might,

934
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:01,410
uh,

935
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,250
think about when you,

936
00:37:02,251 --> 00:37:02,700
when you,

937
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,570
when you read that,

938
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,280
when you read that passage,

939
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,630
that's an implied there.

940
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,423
Um,

941
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,421
Oh God,

942
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:11,100
the terms moving so quickly,

943
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,631
so much more.

944
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:13,640
So those are the three f.

945
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,400
Uh,

946
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,233
so that's,

947
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:15,690
that,

948
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,460
that for Tocqueville is the,

949
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:18,241
is the,

950
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:20,340
is one of the other sides of,

951
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:20,911
uh,

952
00:37:20,911 --> 00:37:21,540
of,

953
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,070
of the democratic experience.

954
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:23,241
And I,

955
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:23,521
again,

956
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:26,730
I want to return to a
piece of that on Wednesday,

957
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,470
next week rather Monday,

958
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:33,650
because I think you will see in volume
to Tocqueville has something of a change

959
00:37:33,661 --> 00:37:34,260
of heart.

960
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,120
He doesn't become more optimistic.

961
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:36,571
In fact,

962
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:38,880
he becomes far more
pessimistic about this,

963
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,310
but there's certainly a change of tone,

964
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:41,910
uh,

965
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:46,830
in what Tocqueville has to
say about the potentiality of,

966
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:47,570
of,

967
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:47,830
uh,

968
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:48,151
of,

969
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:49,440
of majority tyranny.

970
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:49,801
Well,

971
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,660
we had so much fun watching the movie.

972
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,090
Uh,

973
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,310
I didn't get a chance to,

974
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:53,501
there's,

975
00:37:53,501 --> 00:37:54,960
there's a little more I wanted to say,

976
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:58,320
but it seems like a
good note to break on a,

977
00:37:58,321 --> 00:38:03,321
I try to finish whatever I can with
Tocqueville on Monday and Wednesday and

978
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:03,770
going,

979
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,910
go try to wrap things up and tell you,

980
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:06,480
uh,

981
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,830
what you should be thinking about.

982
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,640
So,

983
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:08,820
uh,

984
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,510
anyway,

985
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:09,661
uh,

986
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:11,910
enjoy yourselves and
I'll see you next week.
