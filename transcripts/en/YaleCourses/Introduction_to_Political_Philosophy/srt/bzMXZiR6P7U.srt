1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:01,890
Uh,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,730
last time,

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:03,500
uh,

4
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,060
I ended by talking about,

5
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,350
about Machiavelli,

6
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:09,720
uh,

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,720
as a both a revolutionary in many ways
and a reformer of the moral vocabulary

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,360
about virtue and vice good and evil.

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,200
Machiavelli seeks to replace,

10
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:33,201
to transfer to transpose and older
vocabulary associated both with Plato in

11
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:35,754
certainly most,

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,550
perhaps more importantly
with biblical sources,

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,030
wants to transform all
together the language of virtue
to give it a new kind of

14
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:49,611
meaning to change it from
either platonic or Christian,

15
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,950
other worldliness to a greater
sense of worldly power.

16
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:58,920
Virtual is for him or to use his term.

17
00:00:58,921 --> 00:00:59,221
Again,

18
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:01,680
veer too is related with manliness,

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,791
with force,

20
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:03,630
with power.

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:04,831
Uh,

22
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,500
he tells us in chapter 25 of the,

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,393
of the prints,

24
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,623
uh,

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,720
the ethic of the prints must be one of
audacity and even more audacity and that

26
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:16,620
famous,

27
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,790
uh,

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,141
and,

29
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:18,411
and,

30
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,310
and very [inaudible] image.

31
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:25,311
He uses fortunate as a woman and you
must know how the prince must know how to

32
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,010
conquer.

33
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,010
The woman must be used through
policies of force brutality or Udacity.

34
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,270
Uh,

35
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,340
this is the language of Machiavelli.

36
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:36,200
Virtual,

37
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:36,930
uh,

38
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,440
is associated with the
quest for worldly glory,

39
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:41,550
with ambition,

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,390
with the desire to um,

41
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,440
uh,

42
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,000
achieve success.

43
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,540
And that's what I want to
talk about at greater length.

44
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,550
Today I want to talk about what in a
political and philosophical literature

45
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,870
about this is called the
problem of dirty hands.

46
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,690
If you want to join the political game,

47
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,950
you must be prepared to
get your hands dirty.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,070
And what Machiavelli means by that,

49
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:15,060
how he,

50
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,680
uh,

51
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,850
comes to,

52
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,050
comes to this problem

53
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,343
in order,

54
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,380
he argues to affect a
transformation of European morality.

55
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,330
It is,

56
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:30,571
you know,

57
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:33,480
their words to teach the prince
as he says in Chapter 15,

58
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:34,980
how not to be good,

59
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,450
you have to go to the
source of the morality.

60
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,410
You have to go to this source of
morality to effect the maxims,

61
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,470
to affect the standards
that govern our lives.

62
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,150
It is necessary to go to the source
of those standards and those maxims.

63
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,910
And that can only be found in religion.

64
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,453
Oddly,

65
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,550
it seems in some ways religion does not
seem to be a major theme of the Prince,

66
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,440
uh,

67
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,060
in a,

68
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,350
in a memorable passage.

69
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,184
God bless you.

70
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,980
In a memorable passage from chapter 18,

71
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,380
Machiavelli advises the prince always
to cultivate the appearance of religion.

72
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,700
The prints he writes should
appear all mercy or faith,

73
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,511
all honesty,

74
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:21,430
all humanity in all religion.

75
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,713
He writes,

76
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,230
adding nothing is more necessary to
appear to have this last quality.

77
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,400
Uh,

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,160
the point is clear the
appearance of religion,

79
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,220
but by which you clearly
means Christianity is good.

80
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,870
Why are the actual
practice of it is harmful?

81
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,090
Think about the way in
which that transforms,

82
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,373
uh,

83
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,420
what Plato says about justice.

84
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:46,960
Uh,

85
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,670
in his answer to Glau Conan book,

86
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:49,420
two of the,

87
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,710
of the republic where,

88
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,820
or Thrasymachus where they both
say it is more important is,

89
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,870
is it not more important to have
the appearance of being just then,

90
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,400
then the reality of it.

91
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,550
And here you see Machiavelli in a way,

92
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:05,380
adding his voice to that chorus.

93
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:09,280
It is much better to have the
appearance than the reality of religion.

94
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,850
But in order to understand or to discover
the core of Machiavelli's teachings

95
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,090
about religion,

96
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,140
I have to make a slight detour away
from the prints and to his discourses

97
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:27,160
unliving and in maybe the most
important chapter of that book,

98
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:32,020
book two chapter two called concerning
the kinds of people the Romans had to

99
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:36,070
fight and how obstinately
they defended their freedom.

100
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,720
Long title for a chapter to be sure.

101
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:45,721
But here Machiavelli developed a
powerful contrast between two opposed in

102
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:49,240
mutually incompatible moral codes,

103
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,820
the Christian and the Pagan.

104
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,810
If one asks oneself,

105
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:56,980
Machiavelli writes,

106
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:59,470
if one asks oneself how it came about,

107
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,180
that people have old people of old and
older in the ancient world were more fond

108
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:06,010
of liberty than we are today.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I think the answer he says is due to
the same cars that makes men today less

110
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,530
bold than they used to be.

111
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,911
Less bold.

112
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:17,050
And this is due,

113
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:17,884
I think,

114
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,140
to the difference between our
education and that of bygone days.

115
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:29,370
So what precisely is the difference that
Machiavelli refers to here between our

116
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:35,551
education and the education of
bygone days that makes people,

117
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:40,870
or that made people in the ancient
world more fond of liberty as he says,

118
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:44,140
then those of our contemporaries
are Machiavelli's contemporaries.

119
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,070
Machiavelli's emphasis here on education,

120
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,100
particularly moral and religious education
is the key difference between the

121
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:55,960
ancient times and his own.

122
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,450
These two different ages.

123
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,120
He believes advanced two very different
systems of moral and religious

124
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:05,954
education.

125
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:11,380
One based on Pagan worldliness and the
other based on Christian innocence.

126
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,630
And it is that conflict as it were
between what we might call worldliness and

127
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:18,464
innocence.

128
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,600
That is the car,

129
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,170
uh,

130
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,110
of Machiavelli's a moral code.

131
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,353
Let me quote,

132
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,310
Machiavelli is passage from the discourses
at some length because I think it's

133
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:34,730
very revealing our religion.

134
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:39,470
He writes obviously thinking of the
Catholic Christianity of his time,

135
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,791
our religion.

136
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,361
He writes,

137
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:42,380
his glorified,

138
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:44,720
humble and contemplative men,

139
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,490
monks,

140
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,570
priests,

141
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,480
uh,

142
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,951
you know,

143
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,700
humble and contemplative men
rather than men of action.

144
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,900
It is assigned as man's
highest good humility,

145
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,010
abnegation and contempt
for mundane things.

146
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,090
Whereas the other that is to
say be ancient moral code.

147
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:10,091
Whereas the other identified it with
magnanimity bodily strength in everything

148
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:13,700
that conduces to make men very bold.

149
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,830
And if our religion he says demands
that in you there'd be strength.

150
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,370
What it asks for is the strength to
suffer rather than to do bold things.

151
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,051
In other words,

152
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:28,610
he says Christian strength,

153
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,440
the strength of the Christian
is the strength to suffer
thinking of Jesus on the

154
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:35,900
cross rather than to as he puts it,

155
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:37,070
do bold things.

156
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,850
And it is not for Machiavelli simply
the existence of these two different

157
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:48,590
moralities that is at
stake by softening morals.

158
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:51,410
He believes by making us gentler,

159
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,490
uh,

160
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,260
Christianity has had some deeply
perverse effects upon politics.

161
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,370
So he claims this pattern of life.

162
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,930
Machiavelli continues,

163
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:07,931
appears to have made the world week and
to have handed it over to the prey of

164
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:09,194
the wicked.

165
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,660
This pattern of life,

166
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:13,430
this pattern of education,

167
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,460
moral education introduced by the Bible
and Scripture and Christianity has made

168
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,800
the world week.

169
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,701
In other words,

170
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:24,350
by teaching humility,

171
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,360
self abnegation,

172
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:27,530
purity of heart.

173
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,720
Christianity has made it difficult
to develop qualities necessary.

174
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,060
For the defense of political liberty.

175
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,980
Christianity has made the world
week or if you want to use his,

176
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:40,401
again,

177
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:42,650
highly charged word for that,

178
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,240
it has made the world.

179
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,460
If Feminine Machiavelli would no doubt
be taken up against some board of offense

180
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:55,830
today for using such a term,

181
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:57,480
but that's his language.

182
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:58,314
What can I say?

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,980
This is why he concludes there are fewer
republics today then in the time of the

184
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:09,780
ancients because we do not have the
same love of freedom that they did.

185
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:11,941
Now,

186
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:13,800
Machiavelli's explicit,

187
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,780
explicit referencing of the
ancient civil religions,

188
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:21,300
the ancient Civ off theology is it direct,

189
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:26,330
is a direct tribute to the role of Numa
Numa and Uma pneuma in Libby's famous

190
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,010
history of the Roman republic,

191
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,261
Justin,

192
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:36,330
who was an authority on this text,

193
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,280
can tell you more about it if you like,

194
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,820
but in the opening books of Livy,

195
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,000
he tells the story of how Rome was
founded by Romulus who had murdered his

196
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,210
brother Remez.

197
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,680
But after this it required a second
founding and the second founding was the

198
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:57,780
work of a man named Numa who live.

199
00:09:57,781 --> 00:09:58,441
He writes,

200
00:09:58,441 --> 00:09:59,970
determined that Rome,

201
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,150
which had originally been
established through force of arms,

202
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:08,151
should be reestablished through
justice laws and proper observances.

203
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,061
In other words,

204
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:09,894
religion,

205
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,990
in order to complete the
founding of the city,

206
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,140
it was necessary to establish it's God's
and ensure proper respect for the law.

207
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,590
PNEUMO was,

208
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,040
uh,

209
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,420
the bringer of the,

210
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:21,870
uh,

211
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,703
of the Roman,

212
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,580
uh,

213
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,870
legal codes,

214
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,310
respecting religion,

215
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,560
proper observances and the like.

216
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,390
So,

217
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,380
but Machiavelli,

218
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,210
Machiavelli uses living and live in,

219
00:10:35,211 --> 00:10:40,211
in the story about Rome's second founding
to bring home an important lesson

220
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,050
about the utility of religion.

221
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,201
Religion.

222
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:50,970
He tells the reader is not to be
evaluated by its truth content,

223
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,060
but for its consequences for society.

224
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,100
But the story of Numa or his
use of that story tells us more,

225
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,480
more than just a lesson about
cause social utility of religion.

226
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,750
At the time of the founding of Rome,

227
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,220
Machiavelli writes,

228
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,370
religion was necessary to temper
and control the warlike character,

229
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,180
uh,

230
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,170
of the Romans.

231
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,583
Um,

232
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,080
religion had had to bring
a softening effect upon,

233
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:24,381
again,

234
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:25,840
the violent and,

235
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:29,000
and be steel character of the,

236
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:30,170
of the early Romans.

237
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,690
But for us today,

238
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,430
Machiavelli writes,

239
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:37,790
religion has to serve
the opposite purpose.

240
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,420
It must instill something of a fighting
spirit into people who have lost their

241
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:47,810
instinct to resist
encroachments on their liberty.

242
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,011
I mean,

243
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:49,791
in many ways,

244
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:54,791
this is the deeper meaning a of
Machiavelli's one's own arms.

245
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:56,770
Uh,

246
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,060
he uses in a,

247
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,770
in a variety of passages,

248
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,780
the formula that had good republic
depends upon one's own arms and laws.

249
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,730
And in a deeper sense,

250
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:11,731
this idea of one's own arms means
developing the capacities to resist

251
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:14,380
encroachments on your freedom.

252
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:15,941
The prince,

253
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:16,451
in other words,

254
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:21,310
test to use religion to encourage his
subjects to rely upon their own arms

255
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,310
rather than on divine promises.

256
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,230
And that again,

257
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,260
is that teaching of his retelling
of the story of David and Goliath,

258
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,580
the biblical story of David and Goliath.

259
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,260
And chapter 13 of the prints,

260
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:40,510
you remember how Machiavelli retails
and also rewrites that story.

261
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,161
He tells,

262
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:46,270
he writes the story saying
that David went armed,

263
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:46,920
uh,

264
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,140
went,

265
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,140
went into battle with Goliath armed
only he says with a sling and a knife,

266
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,550
a knife.

267
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,000
Those of you who know the story

268
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,420
checked against the biblical
account of the story,

269
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,740
knows that David only went
into battle against Goliath.

270
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,860
Armed with Saul's armor and his sling,

271
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,610
Machiavelli gives him a knife.

272
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,160
Where did this come from?

273
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,830
Why does he add this?

274
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,040
His subtle alteration
of the biblical story.

275
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,160
Okay.

276
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,420
It's hugely revealing.

277
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:33,030
Its moral seems to be
trust in God's promises.

278
00:13:33,031 --> 00:13:33,864
Yes,

279
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,730
but bring a knife just in case.

280
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,440
It's like the old joke.

281
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:45,930
You know about the fighter who went into
the ring before going into the ring and

282
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,783
uh,

283
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:47,630
yes,

284
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,970
the priest to pray for him.

285
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:49,691
He said,

286
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:50,471
I'll pray for her,

287
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:51,460
but if he can punch it,

288
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:52,294
it'll help

289
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,490
in the smallest respect.

290
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:00,760
That's,

291
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,760
that's Machiavelli Machiavelli's sense
that his own country was deeply deficient

292
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:08,880
in these martial virtues,

293
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,360
a necessary to reassert greatness.

294
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,650
And this was a theme of
a lengthy poem he wrote.

295
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,160
Yes.

296
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,941
You'd surprised.

297
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:18,230
Yes.

298
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,310
Machiavelli wrote poetry and plays play.

299
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,120
The men Dragila still performed.

300
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,640
But he wrote an interesting poem,

301
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:30,030
a lengthy poem called
Ambit Siyani ambition,

302
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,550
something like platonic,

303
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,493
most,

304
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,160
which lamented his countrymen.

305
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:39,220
Countrymen's lack of civic spirit.

306
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,090
And there need to be
reeducated and the art of war.

307
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,440
I only want to read a small
section to you from that poem.

308
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,420
If you attempted

309
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,230
to accuse nature,

310
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,200
if Italy so wary in wounded,

311
00:14:57,201 --> 00:15:00,410
does not produce hard
and bellicose people,

312
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,580
this I say is not sufficient to erase our
cowardice for education can supplement

313
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:09,590
where nature is deficient.

314
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:15,550
Stern education made Italy bloom in
ancient days and made her rise and conquer

315
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:20,150
the entire world and
for herself make room.

316
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,440
But now she lives if tears can be called
life beneath the ruins and unhappy fate

317
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,340
that she has reaped from
her long lack of strife.

318
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,360
Okay,

319
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,190
but now she lives if tears can be called
life beneath the ruins and unhappy

320
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:41,340
faith that she has reaped
from her long lack of strife.

321
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,240
And just from this little
section of the poem,

322
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:50,241
you can see that the theme of a new kind
of education and only that can remedy

323
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,430
nature's defects that Mackie,

324
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,960
Ms Machiavelli calls them.

325
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,900
It is this lack of strife,

326
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,200
this long lack of strife
that makes people weak.

327
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:06,480
People are weakened by prolonged
piece and they are made strong,

328
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,201
fierce,

329
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:08,880
and independent through war,

330
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,610
only by hardening themselves.

331
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:12,061
He says,

332
00:16:12,061 --> 00:16:12,271
well,

333
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:17,271
it'd be possible for Italy as he puts it
to rise and conquer the entire world in

334
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:21,060
ancient days again,

335
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:26,061
and made her rise and conquer the
entire world and for herself make room.

336
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,240
His point seems to be this.

337
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:31,440
If you want liberty,

338
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,600
you have to know how not to be good.

339
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,590
At least as Christianity
has defined goodness,

340
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,070
the Christian virtue of humility,

341
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:42,300
turning the other cheek,

342
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:47,301
forgiveness of sins must be rejected if
you want to do good as opposed to just

343
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:50,664
being good,

344
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,950
you have to learn.

345
00:16:52,951 --> 00:16:53,850
In other words,

346
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,350
how to get your hands dirty.

347
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,580
Between the innocence of the Christian
and the worldliness of Machiavelli's new

348
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:02,911
morality,

349
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:05,490
there can be no reconciliation.

350
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:12,170
These are just two incompatible moral
positions that Machiavelli states,

351
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:13,710
but he goes further than this.

352
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,650
The safety and security
enjoyed by the innocent,

353
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,500
enjoyed by the innocence,

354
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:27,530
our freedom to live blameless lives and
to have untroubled sleep depends upon

355
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:33,450
the princess clear eyed and
even ruthless use of power.

356
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,760
The true statesman,

357
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,320
the true prints for Machiavelli must
be prepared to mix a love of the common

358
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:42,154
good,

359
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,490
a love of his own people with a streak
of cruelty that is often regarded as

360
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:52,410
essential for a great ruler in general.

361
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,680
In another part of knowing
how not to be good,

362
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:01,710
knowing when and how to use cruelty
or what Machiavelli telling me calls

363
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:03,290
cruelty,

364
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,210
well-used.

365
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,700
It's well used.

366
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:07,534
It's a virtue.

367
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:15,220
This is simply another example of how
moral goodness grows out of an even

368
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:18,700
requires a context of moral evil.

369
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,720
Machiavelli's advice to you is clear.

370
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,340
If you cannot accept the
responsibilities of political life,

371
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,970
if you cannot afford to
get your hands dirty,

372
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,570
if you cannot accept the harsh
necessities that may require cruelty,

373
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:37,900
deceit,

374
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,950
and even murder,

375
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:40,900
then get out of the way,

376
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,150
and this is not for you.

377
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,690
Don't seem to impose,

378
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,400
don't seek to impose your
own high minded innocence,

379
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,860
sometimes called justice,

380
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,170
your own highminded innocence.

381
00:18:56,171 --> 00:19:00,970
On the requirements of state craft
because it will only lead to ruin

382
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,170
in the modern era.

383
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,600
The presidency of Jimmy Carter,

384
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:08,434
for example,

385
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,430
uh,

386
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:14,430
it's usually taken as exhibit a
of the confusion between Christian

387
00:19:14,531 --> 00:19:19,270
humanitarianism and the necessities
of raising reason of state.

388
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,090
You can't do the tough thing if
you can't do the harsh thing.

389
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,800
Machiavelli says,

390
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,270
then stay out of politics

391
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:36,070
and don't attempt to impose your
high minded morality on the state.

392
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,400
In,

393
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,250
as I said at the beginning in
the philosophical literature,

394
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,190
this has become known as the
problem with dirty hands.

395
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:52,060
So named after a famous play written by
the French philosopher John Paul Sartre,

396
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,100
the problem of dirty hands
refers to the conflict of duties.

397
00:19:58,101 --> 00:19:58,611
Again,

398
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:03,611
conflict of moralities between the
harsh requirements of politics and the

399
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:09,340
equally demanding desire for moral
purity to keep the world at a distance.

400
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,470
Machiavelli doesn't deny that there is
something deeply admirable about the

401
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:17,720
desire to remain morally pure,

402
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:18,860
morally decent,

403
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,480
morally innocent,

404
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,430
but he just wants to say this is a very
different morality from the morality of

405
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:26,031
politics.

406
00:20:26,031 --> 00:20:27,200
In Sartre's play.

407
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:28,670
Uh,

408
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:33,670
the action takes place in a fictional
eastern European country during World War

409
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,190
II.

410
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:39,190
Probably something like Yugoslavia
were a communist resistance fighter.

411
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,160
Reproaches an idealistic young recruit
to the resistance who is resisting is

412
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,950
barking at the order to carry
out a political assassination.

413
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,780
Why did you join us?

414
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,640
The communist resistance fighter asks
purity as an idea for the Yogi or the

415
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:00,474
monk.

416
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,970
Do you think anyone can govern innocently.

417
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,210
Okay.

418
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,400
Do you think anyone can govern innocently?

419
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,500
The phrase taken of course,

420
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,610
from San juiced,

421
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,380
the,

422
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,380
the one of the leaders of the Jacobin
reign of terror in the French level during

423
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:16,750
the French revolution.

424
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,033
What do you think,

425
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,780
what do you think politics is?

426
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,200
You know,

427
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,430
a game of moral purity.

428
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,470
The same kind of conflict,

429
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,490
uh,

430
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,650
is really very much at the car,

431
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:27,340
uh,

432
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,560
of the great political fiction,

433
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,281
uh,

434
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:31,540
of John Le Carre.

435
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:32,770
Uh,

436
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,391
the great,

437
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:33,670
uh,

438
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:33,880
you know,

439
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,960
novelist of the,

440
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,700
of the Cold War and the,

441
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:37,860
and so on and in,

442
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:38,071
in,

443
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:39,010
in his great,

444
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,001
uh,

445
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:42,570
one of his early political thrillers,

446
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,100
a book called the spy who
came in from the cold.

447
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,480
He depicts,

448
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:50,590
they're a British agent
who was working undercover,

449
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,761
uh,

450
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:56,530
and who at the same time as carrying on
a love affair with an idealistic young

451
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:59,680
English librarian who has
joined the Communist Party,

452
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,050
in this case a sh she,

453
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:03,310
the communist is the,

454
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:04,750
is the idealistic one.

455
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,580
She's joined the party because it will,

456
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,720
she believes it will aid the cause of
nuclear disarmament and we'll bring

457
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,280
international peace.

458
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,490
And when Lima's the spy a
reveals to her that he is a spy,

459
00:22:17,831 --> 00:22:22,120
he tells her his view of what politics
is really the nature of politics.

460
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:24,070
There's only one law in the game.

461
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,220
Uh,

462
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,010
Lima says the expediency
of temporary alliances,

463
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,100
the expediency of temporary alliances.

464
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,640
Who Do you think spies are?

465
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:34,301
Priests.

466
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:34,961
Saints.

467
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:35,794
Martyrs.

468
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,681
There's squall,

469
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:37,570
a little men,

470
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:38,230
fools,

471
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,980
queers,

472
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,731
sadists,

473
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:40,564
drunkards,

474
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,260
people who play cowboys and Indians
to brighten their rotten lives.

475
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,800
You think they sit like monks
weighing up right and wrong.

476
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,380
So both of these cases,

477
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:54,490
the Satya case,

478
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:56,590
the John Le Carre case in a way,

479
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,581
uh,

480
00:22:57,581 --> 00:22:59,320
are interesting,

481
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:04,210
but they're also sort of cases of what
I think of his full machiavellianism,

482
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,400
uh,

483
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,370
kind of foam intellectuals
engaging in tough talk,

484
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,030
uh,

485
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,000
to show that they have
really lost their innocence,

486
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:13,840
which is the sort of,

487
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:14,110
you know,

488
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,010
intellectual,

489
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:15,410
uh,

490
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,270
equivalent of,

491
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:16,451
of,

492
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:17,950
of losing your virginity.

493
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:18,161
You know,

494
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:19,060
showing you're not,

495
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,100
you're not really
innocent about the world.

496
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,941
Machiavelli,

497
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:22,720
of course,

498
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,720
likes to play that game and it suggests
that the world is divided between the

499
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:33,541
weak and the strong between the realists
who see things the way they are and the

500
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:38,980
idealists who require the
comfort of moral illusions.

501
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,810
Uh,

502
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,300
yes,

503
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,290
Machiavelli's sometimes seems to
corroborate this point of view.

504
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,560
Does he not say that
armed profits always win?

505
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,690
The unarmed profits lose?

506
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:51,291
Did he not?

507
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,124
Right.

508
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,053
Did he,

509
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,560
did he not say that he wrote to reveal
the effectual truth of things and not

510
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,020
just what people have
imagined the case to be?

511
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,420
Yet it seems inconceivable
that Machiavelli wrote an
entire book simply to prove

512
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:06,260
the obvious.

513
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,820
That is to say that the strong will
always crush the week and that politics is

514
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:13,610
left to those who leave their scruples,

515
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,240
uh,

516
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,073
at the door.

517
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,290
Yeah.

518
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,011
The question is,

519
00:24:18,011 --> 00:24:19,270
was Machiavellian,

520
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:23,200
was Machiavelli really
that kind of Machiavellian?

521
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,380
Was Machiavelli a Machiavellian?

522
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,710
Let's,

523
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,543
let's see.

524
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,840
What kind of government
did Machiavelli think best

525
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,760
as he indicates at the
beginning of the prince,

526
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:45,320
there are two kinds of regimes.

527
00:24:45,321 --> 00:24:47,330
There are principalities and republics,

528
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:53,590
but each of these regimes he says is
based on certain contrasting dispositions

529
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:55,670
or what he calls humors,

530
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,781
humors.

531
00:24:56,781 --> 00:24:56,961
You,

532
00:24:56,961 --> 00:25:00,380
Maury humors in every society he writes,

533
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:05,381
this is chapter nine of the prints in
every society to diverse humors are found

534
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:10,640
from which this arise that the people
desire neither to be commanded nor

535
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:15,641
oppressed by the great and the great
desire to command and oppress the people.

536
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,800
These are the two great political,

537
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,750
psychological dispositions,

538
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:25,751
the popular desire not to be oppressed
and the disposition of what he calls the

539
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:28,580
great uh,

540
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,470
to command and oppress.

541
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,460
Machiavelli uses these two psychological
and even in some ways cuase I medical

542
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:42,401
terms humors to designate two classes of
people on which every society is based.

543
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:51,710
His theory of the humors in chapter
nine seems in some ways to be rep

544
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,420
reminiscent of Plato's account of the
three classes of the soul or the three

545
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:59,960
parts of the soul with
one vivid exception.

546
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,140
Each class of the city he says,

547
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:05,540
is bound or determined by a humor,

548
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,090
but neither humor is anchored
in reason or rationality.

549
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:16,180
Every state is divided into two
classes expressing these two qualities,

550
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:18,560
these two psychological qualities,

551
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:19,520
the Grandy,

552
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,500
the rich and powerful,

553
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:24,290
who wished to dominate and the popular,

554
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,110
the common people who wish
merely to be left alone,

555
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,770
who wish neither to be
route to rule nor be ruled.

556
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:32,541
Now,

557
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:37,541
one might expect that the author of a
book entitled the prints would favor the

558
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:38,414
great,

559
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,480
would favor the grand [inaudible].

560
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,350
Those who desire to rule our,

561
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:46,890
these are not these aristocratic
goals of honor and glory.

562
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:49,950
Precisely what Machiavelli
seems to be advocating,

563
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:51,870
okay.

564
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,750
Yet in many ways,

565
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,780
Machiavelli proceeds to deprecate
the virtues of the nobility.

566
00:26:58,990 --> 00:26:59,650
Okay.

567
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,030
Perhaps to our surprise,

568
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,820
the ends of the people,

569
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:04,901
the ends,

570
00:27:04,901 --> 00:27:09,901
the purposes of the people is more decent
than that of the great since the great

571
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:13,560
one to oppress and the people
want not to be oppressed.

572
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,403
He says

573
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:22,030
his advice is that the prince should seek
to build his power base on the people

574
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,920
rather than on the nobles because
of their ambition for power.

575
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,520
The nobles will always be a threat to
the prince and an interesting reversal of

576
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:38,570
the platonic and Aristotelian
conception of politics.

577
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:43,040
It is the nobles here who are said to
be the more fickle and unpredictable,

578
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,920
while the people are more
constant and reliable.

579
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:50,420
Remember in the platonic and
Aristotelian view of politics,

580
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,910
the democracy that rule of the people,

581
00:27:52,911 --> 00:27:57,911
the Deimos was always criticized for it
being fickle and unstable and subject to

582
00:27:59,991 --> 00:28:02,000
whim and passion and so on.

583
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:07,180
Here in Machiavelli tells us to just the
great who are subject to this kind of

584
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:10,100
inconstancy and the
people are more reliable.

585
00:28:10,101 --> 00:28:10,920
The worst,

586
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,230
the worst he writes to
the prince can accept,

587
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,870
expect from a hostile people
is to be abandoned by them.

588
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,610
But from the great,

589
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,200
when they are hostile,

590
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,450
he must fear not only being abandoned,

591
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,120
but also that they may move against him.

592
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,150
The pop,

593
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,013
the

594
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,490
Grandy are more dangerous and fickle.

595
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,500
So the main business of government
consists and knowing how to control the

596
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:43,501
elites because they are always a
potential source of conflict and ambition.

597
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:50,040
The prince must know how to chase in the
ambition to humble the pride as it were

598
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:52,420
of the great and powerful.

599
00:28:52,421 --> 00:28:53,950
And this we will see,

600
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:54,970
uh,

601
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,970
as early as Wednesday becomes a major
theme in the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes,

602
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,430
humbling or chastening
the pride of the few.

603
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:12,750
The rule of the prints are sovereign
requires the ability to control the

604
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:19,951
ambition and to do so through selective
policies of executions of public

605
00:29:21,881 --> 00:29:24,250
accusations and political trials.

606
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,730
Remember the example that we read,

607
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,201
uh,

608
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:30,400
at the end of class on Friday,

609
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:31,930
I believe from chapter seven,

610
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,470
the example of Cesare
Borgia and Ramiro d Marco,

611
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,930
and how his execution,

612
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,080
his bloody execution left the people.

613
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:46,110
Machiavelli says stupefied and satisfied
here is a perfect example of how to

614
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:51,970
control the ambitions of the
nobles into when the people,

615
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:52,450
uh,

616
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,290
to your side.

617
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,830
So Machiavelli's Prince Wa,

618
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,071
well,

619
00:29:57,071 --> 00:29:58,840
not exactly a Democrat,

620
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,640
uh,

621
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,590
recognizes the essential decency of the
people and the need to keep their faith.

622
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,030
And by decency he seems to
mean their absence of ambition,

623
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:14,050
the absence of the desire
to dominate and control.

624
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,640
But this kind of decency is
not the same as goodness.

625
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:24,790
For there is also a tendency on the
part of the people to descend into what

626
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:29,560
Machiavelli calls idleness or license.

627
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,310
The desire not to oppress
others may be decent,

628
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,930
but at the same time that people have
to be taught or educated how to defend

629
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:38,764
their liberty.

630
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,770
1500 years of Christianity,

631
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:42,191
he says,

632
00:30:42,191 --> 00:30:43,570
have left people weak,

633
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:48,340
have left the people week without
their capacities to exercise political

634
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:53,020
responsibility and the resources
to defend themselves from attack.

635
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:58,530
So just as princess must know how to
control the ambitions of the multitude,

636
00:30:59,220 --> 00:30:59,470
uh,

637
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,540
how to control the
ambitions of the nobles.

638
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:02,374
Excuse me.

639
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,760
They,

640
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,510
the prince is must know how to strengthen
the desires of the common people.

641
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,710
Some readers of the prints,

642
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:17,310
even some very astute readers of the
prince has thought that Machiavelli's work

643
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,810
is really,

644
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,840
or Machiavelli's prince is really a kind
of Democrat in disguise and that the

645
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:30,361
prince is intended precisely to alert
the people to the dangers of a use of a

646
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:33,251
user pay.

647
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:34,420
Terry prints,

648
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,660
this is for example what the great 17th
century political philosopher Spinoza

649
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:46,290
believed about Machiavelli in his book
called the political simply called the

650
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:48,190
political treatise Spinosa road.

651
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:54,030
Machiavelli wished to show how how
careful of people should be before

652
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,800
interesting its welfare
to a single prince.

653
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,850
I am led.

654
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,880
Spinosa continues to this
opinion concerning that most
far seeing man because it

655
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,950
is known that he was favorable to liberty,

656
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,910
that spinosa on machiavellian because
it was favor he was favorable to liberty

657
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,780
and that the book he says,

658
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:18,781
it's kind of a satire on princely
rule or if you don't believe Spinosa,

659
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,430
if you don't believe his
authority is sufficient,

660
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:24,070
consider someone who you'll be
reading in a couple of weeks.

661
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:24,361
John,

662
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:27,070
Jack Roussel from this social contract,

663
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,120
Machiavelli was an honorable
man and a good citizen.

664
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,071
Rousseau says,

665
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:37,060
an honorable man and a good citizen who
being attached to the house of medicine.

666
00:32:37,061 --> 00:32:40,700
[inaudible] was forced during
the oppression of his homeland,

667
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,650
disguise his love of freedom

668
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:49,210
so that the prince was written in a way
that disguise the real teaching of the

669
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:49,911
book,

670
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:51,280
which is the love of,

671
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,070
of freedom and presumably
the freedom of the people.

672
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,720
Something of the type that
Rousseau himself spoke about.

673
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,390
Maybe these comments go too far.

674
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:04,781
I mean,

675
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:06,790
maybe they are exaggerations and I,

676
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,430
I think to some degree they are.

677
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:15,070
But it's revealing at both of these very
serious readers of Machiavelli took him

678
00:33:15,071 --> 00:33:17,800
to be an apostle of freedom.

679
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,720
Spinosa taking him,

680
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,130
taking his book to be a warning to the
people about the dangers of princely

681
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:24,964
rule.

682
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Roussel believing that he had deliberately
disguised his love of freedom because

683
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:34,450
he had to appeal to the
tyrannical nature of the,

684
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:35,650
of the Medici family.

685
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,470
In either case,

686
00:33:38,471 --> 00:33:42,550
they regard him as surreptitiously
taking the side of the people against the

687
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:43,384
nobles.

688
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,820
In any case,

689
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,400
whatever one makes up those examples.

690
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,090
Uh,

691
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:56,090
Machiavelli seems to be challenging
important aspects of the classical

692
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,970
conceptions that we've been talking
about up to this point in the classical

693
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:06,300
republic for the ancient
republic of Plato and Aristotle.

694
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,690
This repo,

695
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:08,970
this,

696
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,690
these republics were ruled by Nobilities,

697
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,670
uh,

698
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:18,670
gentlemen possessed of wealth and leisure
who were therefore capable of forming

699
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,240
sound political judgment.

700
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,860
Who will dominate well,

701
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,500
in Machiavelli's state,

702
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:29,640
it is the people who are going to be
the dominant social and political power.

703
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,960
Machiavelli wants to redirect power to
some degree away from the nobles and

704
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:37,140
toward the people.

705
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,850
One wants to know why.

706
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,570
Why does he want to do
that in the first place?

707
00:34:42,571 --> 00:34:45,750
He judges the people to be
more reliable as he tells us.

708
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:49,230
Then the great once the people have
been taught to value their liberty,

709
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,820
have learned to oppose encroachments on
their freedom to be fierce in vigilant.

710
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,990
Watch dogs read it in humble
and subservient underlings,

711
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:03,030
they will serve as a reliable basis
for the greatness and power of a state.

712
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,520
With the people on his side,

713
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:10,521
the prince is more likely to achieve
his goals of a robust civil life for his

714
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:15,450
people and eternal glory for himself.

715
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:18,191
And does.

716
00:35:18,191 --> 00:35:21,910
Machiavelli likes to say the prince
must know how to adapt to the times.

717
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:28,080
What is true for princes is no less
true for advisors to princes like

718
00:35:28,601 --> 00:35:30,010
Machiavelli himself.

719
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,710
One must know the times and character
of a people and the ancient republic.

720
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:41,130
It may have been necessary
to find restraints on the
pat to defined and imposed

721
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:43,530
restraints and the passions of the Deimos.

722
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,690
But in the modern world he says,

723
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:47,700
we're republics of become
a thing of the past.

724
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:51,360
The people need to be taught how to
value their liberty above all else,

725
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,530
the most excellent princes of
the past were those like Moses.

726
00:35:55,531 --> 00:36:00,531
He tells us who brought tables of law
and prepared people for self government.

727
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:05,640
It is fitting and proper that the
prince concludes the last chapter.

728
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:10,641
Chapter 26 concludes with a patriotic
call to his countrymen to emancipate

729
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:15,870
themselves and liberate
Italy from foreign invaders.

730
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:22,310
So what did Machiavelli achieve?

731
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,950
What were his actual accomplishments?

732
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,960
Did he accomplish all he set out to do,

733
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:36,650
to rewrite or to write a new moral
code for political life to found a new

734
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:43,281
political continent as he speaks about
just fine to found new modes and orders a

735
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,910
along the lines of Columbus.

736
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,730
Did he achieve this one?

737
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,281
First of all,

738
00:36:53,281 --> 00:36:58,281
one should not and cannot underestimate
his unprecedented break with both

739
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:00,900
classical and biblical antiquity

740
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,640
more than anyone else before him and
perhaps more than anyone else since he

741
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:11,520
sought to liberate politics
from ecclesiastical control.

742
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,890
The new prints is we've seen
must know how to use religion,

743
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,513
but,

744
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:22,170
but needs to learn how not
to be used by religion.

745
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,340
Must not become a dupe of the religious.

746
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,360
He must know how to use religious
passions and sentiments,

747
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,040
but not be used by them.

748
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,510
Politics must become a
purely worldly affair.

749
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,180
It should not be limited or constrained
by any transcendent standards or moral

750
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:46,170
laws that do not derive
from politics itself.

751
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,620
Why there a law of God or some kind
of transcendent moral order or code?

752
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:58,690
Machiavelli's warning,

753
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,880
we might say today to the religious right?

754
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:01,723
Yeah.

755
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,670
Res Critique of the
religious right cannot be,

756
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:11,710
cannot make politics conform
to a transcendent moral law.

757
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,830
But not only did Machiavelli bring
a new worldliness to politics,

758
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:20,380
he also introduced a new kind of populism.

759
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,993
You might say,

760
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:27,510
Plato and Aristotle imagined aristocratic
republics that would invest power in

761
00:38:28,331 --> 00:38:31,480
an aristocracy of education and virtue.

762
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,120
Machiavelli deliberately seeks to
enlist the power of the people,

763
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:37,271
uh,

764
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:42,220
grants the grant against
aristocracies of education in virtue,

765
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:47,221
he is a kind of pro Democrat almost who
sought to recreate not through accident

766
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:48,994
and chance,

767
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:53,170
but to planning and design
a new kind of republic.

768
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,030
In the modern world,

769
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:01,730
there are public that Machiavelli imagined
and it's interesting while he tells

770
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:07,030
us he's only going to the effectual truth
of things and not the imagination of

771
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:07,780
it.

772
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,411
Nevertheless,

773
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:12,910
and Machiavelli does himself
imagine a new kind of regime,

774
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:17,410
a new kind of republic in the modern
world that would not be a city at peace,

775
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,470
but would be a city at war.

776
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,650
It would be armed and expansive.

777
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:30,150
Machiavelli's republic feeds on
conflict and war and conquest.

778
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,960
It is aggressive and imperialistic,

779
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,090
does it sound familiar?

780
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,443
Is it us?

781
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:43,771
In fact,

782
00:39:43,771 --> 00:39:45,720
if you look at a brilliant article,

783
00:39:45,721 --> 00:39:50,721
I think in this week's new republic
by Robert Kagan called Cowboy nation,

784
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,840
Kagan demonstrates,

785
00:39:54,841 --> 00:39:59,841
I think with a great deal of conviction
that the American republic from its

786
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,080
onset has been expansive,

787
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:09,170
aggressive imperialistic family
conquest of the territory's,

788
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:12,240
the expropriation of the native Americans,

789
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,780
the acquisition of Louisiana,

790
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:19,770
wars of liberation
against Mexico and Spain,

791
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:20,491
and so on,

792
00:40:20,491 --> 00:40:21,240
well into the,

793
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,620
into the 20th and now the
21st century in aggressive,

794
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:30,650
expansive imperialistic republic that
he says has been our history and what it

795
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:33,840
should say.

796
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,070
What it doesn't quite say,

797
00:40:35,071 --> 00:40:38,070
I think is that this,

798
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,210
it has been this history,

799
00:40:39,211 --> 00:40:40,650
not because it is American,

800
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:45,330
but because it is a republic
because of its regime type.

801
00:40:45,331 --> 00:40:46,800
It's regime character.

802
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:52,670
That kind of behavior seems perhaps to
be built in to the natures of republic.

803
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:58,551
It was Machiavelli's admiration for the
politics with someone once called the

804
00:40:58,771 --> 00:41:00,420
lupine politics,

805
00:41:00,421 --> 00:41:03,300
though wolf like politics of,

806
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,560
of Republican,

807
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:05,394
wrong,

808
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,990
that led him to understand that
all social and moral goods,

809
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,400
uh,

810
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,550
have been established by
morally questionable means.

811
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:22,170
Have we become or have we always
been Machiavelli's republic?

812
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,210
Machiavelli's desire.

813
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,130
Think about that.

814
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:29,070
When you're in your sections
are writing your papers

815
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:33,650
and you will get those
paper topics on by the way.

816
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,890
And finally,

817
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,130
Machiavelli is the author of the new,

818
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,910
a moral realism

819
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:47,210
by whatever means necessary,

820
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:52,640
I think is his motto or should be his
model by whatever means necessary.

821
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,070
And I believe he claims to
be merely stating out loud,

822
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,720
merely stating,

823
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:02,180
allowed what all writers
have known all along.

824
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,173
Bless you.

825
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,770
It is necessary.

826
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:07,281
He says,

827
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:11,090
for the prince to know well how
to use the beast and the man

828
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,540
he writes,

829
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,201
this role,

830
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:14,681
he says,

831
00:42:14,681 --> 00:42:17,350
was taught covertly by ancient writers.

832
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,430
It was taught covertly by ancient writers.

833
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:25,960
He says in chapter 18 the idea then
that Machiavelli is doing no more than

834
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:30,961
saying openly and overtly what ancient
writers had wrapped in parable and enigma

835
00:42:32,111 --> 00:42:36,790
in myth says something about
Machiavelli's new political science,

836
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:41,791
what was previously taught only subtly
and in private will now be taught openly

837
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,620
and in public.

838
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:50,410
What was once available only to a
few will now be available to all,

839
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,020
perhaps more than anything else.

840
00:42:53,021 --> 00:42:57,250
Machiavelli's new openness
is readiness to challenge,

841
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,480
received authority,

842
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:03,780
and his willingness to consider authority
is self created as self made rather

843
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:08,781
than bestowed by either nature or grace
is what fundamentally constitutes his

844
00:43:10,451 --> 00:43:11,284
modernity.

845
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,590
So I'm going to leave it on that note.

846
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:20,310
And on Wednesday we will begin the study
of one of Machiavelli's greatest and

847
00:43:21,251 --> 00:43:24,190
most profound disciples
in the modern world.

848
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,560
A man by the name of Thomas Hobbes.
