1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:01,800
Today,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,730
last class,

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,150
uh,

4
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,290
I had on the syllabus,

5
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:08,310
I think it was called a globalization
and political theory or something,

6
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:09,510
something to that effect.

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,580
And I guess since writing that,

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,480
I've changed the theme of
this final lecture a bit.

9
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:15,901
Uh,

10
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:16,560
and I want to,

11
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,670
I want to talk about,

12
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,803
uh,

13
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,520
defending politics or
in defense of politics.

14
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:28,470
And I'll try to explain what I mean
by that is kind of a wrap up and a

15
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,980
exhortation for this last class.

16
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,280
Uh,

17
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,840
in 1962,

18
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,601
uh,

19
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,830
an English political
scientists in journalist,

20
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,340
uh,

21
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,140
by the name of Bernard Crick,

22
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,490
uh,

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,780
wrote a short,

24
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,590
uh,

25
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,590
and very polemical and influential a
little book called in defense of politics

26
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,330
and by politics,

27
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,480
a crick mount,

28
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,720
a distinctive type of human activity
where conflicts of interests,

29
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:58,300
uh,

30
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,040
among groups are
adjudicated by discussion,

31
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,960
persuasion in debate,

32
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,470
uh,

33
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,200
rather than by force or by fraud.

34
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,910
A political society,

35
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:09,340
uh,

36
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,950
is crikey understood.

37
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:15,330
It is one where individuals
in groups played by certain,

38
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:20,331
agreed upon rules that will determine
how conflicts of interests are to be

39
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:21,594
decided.

40
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,730
And Crick called this little
book very lively and still,

41
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,330
uh,

42
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,650
definitely worth reading.

43
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,281
Uh,

44
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:33,720
he called his book in defense of
politics because he regarded the proper

45
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:38,721
understanding of politics is being
distorted by certain current currents of

46
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:44,280
thought and practice in his
own day among which were,

47
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,180
for example,

48
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,740
the highly ideological
style of politics found,

49
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,581
for example,

50
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:53,820
in the Soviet Union and its clients state,

51
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,300
uh,

52
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,300
the kinds of nationalist politics emerging
in the developing world and even in

53
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:05,691
some aspects of the conservative politics
of contemporary Britain of his time

54
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,440
where,

55
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:07,710
uh,

56
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,710
that meant a kind of unreflective
deference to customs and tradition.

57
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,970
I think today it's
important to try to reprise,

58
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,580
uh,

59
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,440
cricks plea for a defense of politics,

60
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,190
uh,

61
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,140
although in a slightly different way,

62
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,690
politics,

63
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,370
again as crick understood it is something
that takes place within a certain

64
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,510
territorially defined unit called a state.

65
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,500
Uh,

66
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,500
this may seem almost too obvious to
bear reprieve repeating for centuries,

67
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,381
uh,

68
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:48,381
what is called the race publica has
been regarded as the proper locus of the

69
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,280
citizens loyalty.

70
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,040
And it was thought to be the task,

71
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,570
uh,

72
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:58,570
of political philosophy or political
science in its original sense to teach or

73
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:02,890
to give reasons for the
love of one's own country,

74
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,010
classical political philosophy,

75
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,240
regarded patriotism as
an ennobling sentiment,

76
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:10,930
uh,

77
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,930
considered just a few of
the pallet following passage
passages that I had asked

78
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:18,820
Justin to put on the board from Cicero,

79
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,780
from Burke,

80
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,890
from Machiavelli,

81
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,850
from Rousseau,

82
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,810
and from Lincoln,

83
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,660
writers from the ancient
and the modern world,

84
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,840
from many different
countries and job times,

85
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,410
ah,

86
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,120
make important expressions,

87
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:31,570
uh,

88
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,640
some more extreme than others.

89
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,240
Like Machiavelli's what,

90
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:35,420
what,

91
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,840
what else would one
expect from an extremist,

92
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:38,890
like Machiavelli's,

93
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,940
just simple,

94
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,680
just simpler and more dignified
statements like that of Burke or Lincoln.

95
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,610
Uh,

96
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,430
but anyway,

97
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,430
all expressing the view that politics has
something to do with providing reasons

98
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,760
for the love of country,

99
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,290
uh,

100
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:56,711
today.

101
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:57,544
However,

102
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:57,850
uh,

103
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,040
the idea of patriotism a,

104
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,870
at least among philosophers,

105
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:05,230
seems to have fallen upon hard times.

106
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:05,860
Uh,

107
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,030
this isn't to say,

108
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:07,870
uh,

109
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,340
that patriotism is a
phenomenon of political life,

110
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:12,790
uh,

111
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,850
is likely to disappear to the contrary,

112
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,780
uh,

113
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,780
go drive 20 miles or so
outside of any urban area.

114
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,570
And one is likely to see
a flags being waived.

115
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,980
A bumper stickers on cars proclaiming
the drivers love of country,

116
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,280
a country music stations playing music
that tells us to support our troops and

117
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:37,350
keep driving our SUV.

118
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,380
These are signs of American
patriotism to be sure,

119
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,270
but,

120
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:42,660
um,

121
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,420
the [inaudible] but the issue seems
quite different in universities.

122
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,180
In an educated circles you might say,

123
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,240
where patriotism has come to appear to
be a morally questionable phenomenon.

124
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,390
Tell someone at any Ivy League University,

125
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:58,720
uh,

126
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,740
that you are interested in patriotism
and you will be treated as if you have

127
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:06,460
just expressed a kind of
interest in child pornography.

128
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,713
Uh,

129
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,490
raise the issue,

130
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:09,970
uh,

131
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,970
in one is likely to here very quickly
repeated Samuel Johnson's famous Barb,

132
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,350
that patriotism is the
last refuge of a scoundrel.

133
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,340
Uh,

134
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,030
or you might even hear a,

135
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,820
if the person's red a little bit more.

136
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:25,270
Uh,

137
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,270
Ian Forester's famous statement that if
he had to choose whether to betray his

138
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:32,440
friend or his country,

139
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,150
that he Forrester wished he had
the courage to betray his country.

140
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,060
Forrester,

141
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,340
you know,

142
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,800
the famous English novelist authors,

143
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,820
authors of Howard's and
in other important books,

144
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,180
uh,

145
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,770
foster presents the choice
between friendship over country,

146
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:51,401
uh,

147
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:54,010
of private over public goods.

148
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:59,170
It's a kind of tragic and even
noble that one has to make.

149
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,220
But Forrester,

150
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,630
Forrester in some respects,

151
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:03,380
has given us,

152
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,750
I would suggest a false dilemma.

153
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:06,590
Uh,

154
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,750
loyalty is a moral habit.

155
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,410
Uh,

156
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,560
just as betrayal is a moral vice.

157
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,410
People who practice one,

158
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:15,850
uh,

159
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,530
are less likely to indulge in the other.

160
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:20,330
Consider the following example,

161
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,950
a few years after Forster made
his statement at Cambridge,

162
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,760
I believe,

163
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,760
three young Cambridge undergraduates in
the 1930s by the names of Kim Philby,

164
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,820
Donald Maclean and guide Burgess.

165
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,270
I don't know if those are names that
are familiar to people here any longer,

166
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:39,170
but they were very,

167
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:40,250
very famous names.

168
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,084
At one point.

169
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,630
They chose to betray their own country.

170
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,900
That is to say they acted for many years
as Soviet agents and for years passed

171
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:52,370
on vital secrets,

172
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:52,880
uh,

173
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,880
English secrets to Moscow as they
are ascended up the ladder of British

174
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:03,341
intelligence services until they were
finally exposed in the 1950s and it was

175
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:09,650
not long after they were exposed
and they had all fled to Moscow.

176
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,010
Uh,

177
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,560
did they began to betray one another.

178
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,280
Uh,

179
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,061
loyalty,

180
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:19,061
it seems like betrayal a is not a bus
that one can simply get off at will rather

181
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:23,660
people who betray others
in one area of life,

182
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,010
uh,

183
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,170
are likely to do so as well in others.

184
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,660
So Forrester has given us a false
choice between choosing friendship over

185
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:36,890
country or country over friendship.

186
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,430
Uh,

187
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,750
indecision most matters.

188
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,340
I think it probably makes greater sense
to examine the problem through the

189
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:48,341
lenses of Aristotle who
tells us everything we need
to know about most questions

190
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,890
and the McCain ethic.

191
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,740
Aristotle taught us that all virtues,

192
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,430
that is to say,

193
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,130
aw excellence's of mind and heart,

194
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:58,700
uh,

195
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,700
are best understood as means as a
mean along a continuum of excess and

196
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:06,164
deficiency.

197
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,230
It is a matter of finding a balance,

198
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:12,170
the proper balance between extremes.

199
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,320
So it might be useful to regard patriotism
in this light if patriotism is a

200
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:18,621
virtue.

201
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:19,220
And I,

202
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,570
I asked the question,

203
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:21,830
if it is a,

204
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:26,831
it would be important to see it between
as a mid point between two contending

205
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,070
extremes,

206
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,900
two contending vices.

207
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,290
Uh,

208
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,740
what are these devices you
might say that obscure from us,

209
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,670
the meaning of the proper
meaning of the political,

210
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,001
uh,

211
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:38,834
today.

212
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,430
Uh,

213
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:45,430
on one side you could say the excess of
patriotism is a kind of nationalistic

214
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:51,761
zeal that holds absolute attachment to
one's country and one's way of life as

215
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,410
unconditionally good.

216
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,450
This is the kind of loyalty,

217
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,500
uh,

218
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,630
expressed in sentiments like,

219
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,110
uh,

220
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,070
my country,

221
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,150
right or wrong,

222
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:03,720
uh,

223
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,910
but was given powerful expression,

224
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,980
perhaps the most powerful expression.

225
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,000
Uh,

226
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,350
in a short book,

227
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:10,711
a,

228
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:11,760
another short book,

229
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,181
uh,

230
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:12,930
in this,

231
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,930
in this case by a German legal philosopher
of the early 20th century named Carl

232
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,943
Schmitt.

233
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,690
Carl Schmidt wrote a short book
called the concept of the political,

234
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,111
uh,

235
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:30,111
in 1921 and here Schmidt
drew extensively on Hobbs.

236
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,793
Uh,

237
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,730
but rather to defend a
view of the political,

238
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,370
but rather than tying,

239
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,383
uh,

240
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,910
the state of war,

241
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,380
a Hobbs is state of war to a
pre political state of nature.

242
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,590
Schmidt saw war and also,

243
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,830
which includes the preparation for war
is the inescapable condition of human

244
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,094
life,

245
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:56,610
uh,

246
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,780
of political life.

247
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,530
Man,

248
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:03,530
he believed is the dangerous animal
because we can kill one another and

249
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,120
individuals in more importantly,

250
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:11,121
groups of individuals stand to one
another in a virtually continual state of

251
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:13,620
conflict and war.

252
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,260
Schmidt believe hub's was
right in many important,

253
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:19,110
crucial respects,

254
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:23,970
but where he fell down was in believing
that the social contract could create a

255
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:27,600
sovereign state that
would put an end to war.

256
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,220
Quite the contrary.

257
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:34,221
He thought the inescapable political
fact is therefore the distinction between

258
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:36,930
what he called friend and enemy,

259
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:42,290
those who are with us and those who
are against us to misunderstand that

260
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:46,710
distinction distinction that goes all
the way back to Paula Marcus's view and

261
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:50,820
the republic where he talks about justice
being doing good to friends and harm

262
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:51,451
to enemies.

263
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:55,620
But my obviously go on much
deeper further than that.

264
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,670
For Schmidt.

265
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,080
That distinction was central to
what he called the political,

266
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,190
the political.

267
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,761
He says,

268
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:04,830
and he uses that word as a noun.

269
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,780
A we tend to think of political
largely is in its edge of tival farm,

270
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:11,070
but in Germany,

271
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,700
uh,

272
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,070
you all can often use
it as a noun as well.

273
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:19,071
The political he wrote is the most
intense and extreme antagonism become,

274
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,440
becomes that much more political.

275
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,590
The closer it approaches to the extreme
point that of the friend enemy grouping,

276
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,243
he says,

277
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,540
friend and enemy are the
inescapable categories through
which we experience what

278
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:40,101
he calls the political life consists
of that fundamental distinction.

279
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,570
Athens and Sparta,

280
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,260
red sox and Yankees,

281
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,970
Harvard and Yale,

282
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,640
these are fundamental groupings,

283
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,540
enemies,

284
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,980
friends and friends and enemies.

285
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,950
All humanitarian appeals.

286
00:11:56,951 --> 00:12:01,951
He believed appeals to the concept of
human rights to free trade or so on.

287
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:03,610
All of these are,

288
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,331
as it were,

289
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:09,331
attempts to avoid the fundamental fact
of conflict in the need for a politics of

290
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:11,950
group solidarity.

291
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,850
The politics of the future he hoped
would be determined by those who have the

292
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:22,570
courage to recognize this fundamental
distinction and to act upon it.

293
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,090
At the other end,

294
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:25,924
however,

295
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,380
of the continuum of excess and deficiency,

296
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:29,950
uh,

297
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,800
the defect you might say of patriotism,

298
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,340
uh,

299
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,020
comes to light as a kind of today
what we might call trans political

300
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:39,430
cosmopolitanism

301
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,000
present gay cosmopolitanism
is two very large degree,

302
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:51,090
a product of another German philosopher
named Emmanuel Kant at writing at the

303
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,170
end of the 18th century.

304
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:59,490
Comte stressed on the other hand that
our moral duties and obligations respect

305
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,600
no national or political or other
kinds of parochial boundaries,

306
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,060
whatever boundaries such as race,

307
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,720
class,

308
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,553
ethnicity,

309
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,790
political loyalty,

310
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,800
and the like on this view,

311
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,790
on const view,

312
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,820
that is we oh no greater moral obligations
to fellow citizens than to any other

313
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,400
human beings on the face of the planet.

314
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,290
Citizenship,

315
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:28,380
if I can use language that is not
exactly conc owned but is largely sort of

316
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:32,350
identified with the kind of
conti and move in philosophy.

317
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,470
Citizenship is simply an arbitrary fact
conferred on individuals through the

318
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:38,950
accident of birth.

319
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,520
But since birthright citizenship
is an artifact of you,

320
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,980
what you might call a pure
sort of genetic lottery,

321
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,180
there are no moral or special
obligations attached to it.

322
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,940
The continent emphasis on universality.

323
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,970
That is to say that there is a moral
law that that can be universalized in,

324
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:59,740
held to be true for all human beings,

325
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,920
stressed for content that we are all
parts of what he called a kingdom of ends,

326
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,410
a universal kingdom of ends where every
individual is do equal moral value and

327
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:15,970
respect because simply
of their humanity alone,

328
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:22,240
that idea of a cosmopolitan
ethic of humanity can't believed,

329
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,340
could only be realized in a Republican
form of government today what we might

330
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:31,780
call a democracy or just speak
more precisely what con believed.

331
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,740
It could only hold true in a
confederation of Republics,

332
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,131
uh,

333
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:39,610
overseen or ruled by international law.

334
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,440
Current was perhaps,

335
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,910
I don't know if he was the first,

336
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:43,990
but he gave the first,

337
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:49,020
he gave the most powerful early expression
to the idea of a League of nations,

338
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:49,690
uh,

339
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,690
a League of nations that would put an
end to war altogether between states for

340
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:58,580
the sake of achieving what
he called perpetual peace.

341
00:14:58,810 --> 00:14:58,940
Uh,

342
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,680
the title of a famous essay
of his Hobbes and Locke,

343
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,250
he believed were wrong in
attributing sovereignty,

344
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:07,880
uh,

345
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,880
absolute sovereignty to the individual
nation state for con the state,

346
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:18,190
the individual state is merely a kind of
developmental stage along the path to a

347
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:20,210
world republic,

348
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:20,750
uh,

349
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,750
a World Republic of states organized
around the idea of international law and

350
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:32,081
peace only in he believed a league of
republics would peace among the nations

351
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:39,101
finally be realized and would individuals
be able to treat one another as ends

352
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,510
rather than means?

353
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,530
If you don't,

354
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:47,480
if you want just some indication of
how influential costs view has been.

355
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:47,931
A,

356
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:52,250
you can think that his idea for an
international league of nations came to

357
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,084
fruition,

358
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,540
uh,

359
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,340
over a century after his life.

360
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:58,310
And Woodrow Wilson's famous 14 points,

361
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:58,730
uh,

362
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:03,730
issued after the first World War and
elaborated more fully in the U United

363
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,020
Nations Declaration of
Human Rights of 1948,

364
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:14,140
all of which bear the unmistakable
imprint of a manual count.

365
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:17,780
Now,

366
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,190
neither of these views,

367
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,660
let me argue either either of these views,

368
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:28,250
Schmidt's or cons really captures
the nature of the political.

369
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,950
Let me start with adequately.

370
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:32,720
So at least let me start with,

371
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,010
she returned to Schmidt.

372
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:34,760
Again.

373
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,660
Schmidt's view,

374
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,171
uh,

375
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:36,831
is rooted,

376
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:39,740
I believe in a very important human truth.

377
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,770
Namely the world is a dangerous,

378
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,460
in fact,

379
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,960
very dangerous place.

380
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,530
Uh,

381
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:50,530
like in many ways Hobbs or Machiavelli
Schmidt takes the extreme situation that

382
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:56,621
is to say the situation of war and
mobilization for war and turns it into the

383
00:16:57,501 --> 00:16:58,220
norm,

384
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,680
turns it into the normal situation.

385
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,550
And extreme situation is
one where the very survival,

386
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:05,001
in fact,

387
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:08,720
the very independence
of society is at stake.

388
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,770
And for Schmidt,

389
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,800
every situation is potentially a life
and death struggle against a kind of

390
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:20,230
existential enemy where one must decide
to choose to choose up sides between

391
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:21,950
friends and enemies.

392
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,330
Politics for him is a kind of
endless struggle for power,

393
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,320
guided by national self interest alone.

394
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,020
And yet it would seem to me,

395
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:33,330
uh,

396
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:38,330
a politics of unremitting
war and preparation for war
would be have to be self

397
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:40,460
defeating.

398
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,650
Even Anne Schmitz own terms.

399
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,130
Uh,

400
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,120
for example,

401
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:44,660
uh,

402
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,120
why should the struggle
between friend and enemy,

403
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:47,510
uh,

404
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,510
be exclusively what might call
an inter an interstate rivalry?

405
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,710
Wouldn't competition between individuals
and groups just as easily become a

406
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:02,130
feature of domestic politics as well.

407
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,410
Why is it war?

408
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:08,430
Something that takes place exclusively
between states rather than within them is

409
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:14,991
the logic of bitter rivalry
and competition and friend
and enemy cuts all the

410
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:16,770
way,

411
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,880
all the way down,

412
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,043
so to speak.

413
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:19,351
Uh,

414
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:21,300
the logic of Schmidt's argument,

415
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:21,640
uh,

416
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,130
at least as I understand it,

417
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,620
points not only to war between states,

418
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,540
but ongoing civil war and
civil conflicts within states,

419
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,550
within between rival groups,

420
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,600
uh,

421
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,600
expressing their own desire for power
and their own loyalty to their individual

422
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:39,870
groups.

423
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,110
Uh,

424
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,140
the result of this logic of conflict,

425
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:45,840
it seems to me would be
the negation of politics.

426
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:49,050
That is to say the destruction
of the sovereign state,

427
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,010
uh,

428
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,590
as the locus of political power.

429
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,751
Why should,

430
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:55,380
again,

431
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:55,740
uh,

432
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,450
the choice of friend and enemy as choice
between states rather than individuals?

433
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,820
But let me then turn to console view
cosmopolitanism because if the effect of

434
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:08,310
Schmidt's distinction
between friend and enemy,

435
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:08,870
uh,

436
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,510
is to make politics a identical with war,

437
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:12,960
uh,

438
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,260
the effect of Co commenting
and cosmopolitanism,

439
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:16,810
uh,

440
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,920
is to confuse politics with morality.

441
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:21,620
Uh,

442
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,420
current in his present day followers,

443
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:24,890
uh,

444
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:29,890
wish to transcend the sovereign
state and replace it with known,

445
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:30,420
uh,

446
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,420
international rules of justice if Schmidt
believed that man is the dangerous

447
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:37,290
animal.

448
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:37,620
Uh,

449
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,850
current believes man is simply
the rule following animal,

450
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,560
but con desire,

451
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,590
it seems to me to transcend
the international to transcend
the stage with a kind

452
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:53,811
of international forum is
both naive and anti-political.

453
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:00,380
If Hobbs was right when he said that
covenants without the sword are but words,

454
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,020
the question is who will enforce
these international norms of justice?

455
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:11,570
[inaudible] conception of a kind of global
justice is a wish is to wish a world

456
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,650
without states,

457
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,390
a world without boundaries,

458
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,330
a world in short without politics,

459
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,380
international bodies like the United
Nations have been notoriously ineffective,

460
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,140
uh,

461
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,140
in curbing or restraining the aggressive
behavior of states and international

462
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:35,721
courts of justice like that in the Hague
have been highly selective in what they

463
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,440
choose to condemn.

464
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,460
Uh,

465
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,870
it would seem that reliance on such
bodies would have the further disadvantage

466
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:46,140
of uprooting people from their traditions,

467
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,200
from their local arrangements that most
people find as a source of reverence or

468
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:57,721
are there seems to be little room for
reverence in the sake or the sacred in the

469
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:00,610
cosmopolitan ideal.

470
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,310
The logic of this view,

471
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,520
the logic of concert view for perpetual
peace necessarily leads to a world state

472
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,320
world government.

473
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:11,770
Uh,

474
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:16,300
even contact admitted that a world state
would be what he called a soulless as

475
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:17,200
despotism.

476
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,930
He was opposed to the
idea of a world state.

477
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,460
But the logic of his argument leads
him in escapable in that view.

478
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:24,940
In that,

479
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,810
in that vein,

480
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:31,050
the under the idea underlying perpetual
peace is that human life as such human

481
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:37,321
life indepen independent that is of the
kind of life one leads is an absolute

482
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:38,794
good.

483
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:44,370
Such an idea I think can only lead
in the long run to moral decay.

484
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:49,690
That is to say to a kind of inability or
unwillingness to dedicate one's life to

485
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:50,524
ideals,

486
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,710
to the relatively few things that
give life wholeness and meaning.

487
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,300
The cosmopolitan stage would be the,

488
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,270
the world state would be the home
of what Nisha called the last man.

489
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,580
A world where nothing really matters,

490
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,040
where there is nothing
really of importance,

491
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,590
less to do a world of entertainments,

492
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,790
a world of fun,

493
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,450
uh,

494
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,060
world void of moral seriousness.

495
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,200
So these two extremes,

496
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:23,620
nationalism and cosmopolitanism are today.

497
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,650
The two doctrines are tendencies that
tend to obscure the true nature of the

498
00:22:30,461 --> 00:22:31,294
political.

499
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,880
Each of these extremes contains
at best a part of the truth,

500
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:37,340
uh,

501
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,680
a partial truth.

502
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:39,190
Uh,

503
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,100
the nationalist is surely
correct in some respect.

504
00:22:42,101 --> 00:22:43,360
Just see that politics,

505
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,560
is it always a matter of the
particular particular states,

506
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:48,880
particular nations,

507
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,570
particular peoples and
traditions for the nationalists,

508
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,800
the particular stands for something
infinitely higher and more noble than the

509
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:02,140
cosmopolitan or the universal.

510
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:07,120
We enter the world as members of a
particular family in a particular

511
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:07,954
neighborhood,

512
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,340
in a particular state,

513
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,250
in a particular part of
the country and so on.

514
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,350
We are a composite of particularities
and these attachments,

515
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,240
these particularities are not something
extraneous or accidental to our

516
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:22,630
identity,

517
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,650
to our identities.

518
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:26,350
They are what make us who we are.

519
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,740
The demand that we give up our particular
identities and assume a kind of

520
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:36,160
cosmopolitan point of view would
be the same thing to ask us,

521
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:36,520
uh,

522
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,290
at least to those who
are English speakers,

523
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,550
native English speakers,

524
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,270
to give up speaking English
and adopt Esperanto.

525
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,500
The artificial false language.

526
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:49,460
I would ask who was the
Shakespeare or Milton of Esperanto?

527
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:50,421
In other words,

528
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:54,590
everything great derives from
something rooted in particular.

529
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,210
This is the morality of what
you might call common ties,

530
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,160
but there is also some truth
and the cosmopolitan side.

531
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,030
On the other hand,

532
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,920
are we simply a determined or
condemned by the accident of birth,

533
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:15,170
a to live by the traditions
of the particular nation
in which we happen to have

534
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:16,004
been born?

535
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:16,670
Uh,

536
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,420
doesn't this deny what is
seems to be highest in us?

537
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:25,280
That is to say our capacity for
choice to detach ourselves from our

538
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:26,120
surroundings,

539
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:31,070
to determine for ourselves how
we will live and who we will be.

540
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,150
Uh,

541
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,770
this idea of choice,

542
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,310
uh,

543
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:39,310
of being able to choose for oneself is
I think at the bottom of our experience

544
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,000
of human dignity.

545
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:47,050
We experience our moral worth as human
beings through our ability to choose how

546
00:24:47,481 --> 00:24:52,100
we will live with whom to live
and under what conditions.

547
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,560
This kind of ideal,

548
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:59,561
this cosmopolitan ethic has the virtue
of allowing us to stand outside of our

549
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:04,961
particular situation and view ourselves
from what you might call the standpoint

550
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
of the disinterested spectator from a
higher or more general point of view.

551
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,890
And clearly such a morality,

552
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,610
uh,

553
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,610
gives us a kind of critical distance
or vantage point on how we can judge

554
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:22,070
ourselves and our society
from this point of view.

555
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:25,670
Our local and particular
attachment to family,

556
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:26,360
friends,

557
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,100
fellow citizens again carries
no overwhelming moral weight.

558
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:36,050
We must view them as we would
view any one or anything else.

559
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,840
Just interestedly objectively.

560
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,890
And this one might call the
morality of cosmopolitanism.

561
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,973
Each of these,

562
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,670
uh,

563
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,360
ethics,

564
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,130
the ethic of communal ties,

565
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:53,180
the ethic of cosmopolitan
individualism express,

566
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:53,830
uh,

567
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,261
again,

568
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:58,070
an important piece of
the truth of politics,

569
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,130
although neither is
alone complete in itself,

570
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,330
how to combine them or what should we do?

571
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,130
Uh,

572
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,280
in many respect,

573
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:07,750
uh,

574
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,710
I think these two ethics,

575
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:10,544
these two,

576
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,720
these two forms of ethos are
very much combined already,

577
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,200
uh,

578
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,200
in the American regime and how the
American way of life should be properly

579
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:21,794
understood,

580
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,050
considered the following.

581
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,443
Uh,

582
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:31,450
American regime is the first truly
modern nation that has to say a nation

583
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,810
founded upon the principles
of modern philosophy,

584
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,610
our founding document,

585
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,880
the Charter of American liberties,

586
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:45,881
the declaration of independence
is dedicated to the
proposition that all men are

587
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:47,580
created equal.

588
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,010
It is fair to say that the American
regime requires more than loyalty.

589
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:53,581
That is to say,

590
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:55,110
it requires understanding.

591
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,320
It requires understanding of that
founding principle or that proposition,

592
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:00,770
uh,

593
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:05,770
and the various texts and debates
in which that proposition was later

594
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,810
articulated,

595
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,700
as well as the range of responses
and alternatives to it to believe,

596
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:12,570
for example,

597
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:14,070
as you all now know,

598
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,220
to believe that all men are created equal
and endowed with unalienable rights,

599
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,130
uh,

600
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:25,130
requires us to consider
the opposite proposition
contained in books like Plato's

601
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,570
Republic or Aristotle's politics that
believed that human beings are not equal

602
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,690
and that the best regime is one
governed by a philosophical aristocracy.

603
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:40,970
So to consider our regime means in some
ways to consider it in the light of

604
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:42,960
these universal alternatives.

605
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:49,160
But ours is also a regime that contains
elements of both the universal and the

606
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,124
particular.

607
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:51,271
Again,

608
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:56,271
the American regime is one founded on
what Jefferson called a self evident

609
00:27:56,311 --> 00:27:57,090
truth.

610
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:57,271
Uh,

611
00:27:57,271 --> 00:28:01,440
the truth that there are
certain unalienable rights
that these principles are

612
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:03,330
not simply true for Americans,

613
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:08,450
but believe to be good for
all human beings always and
everywhere considered Tom

614
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:10,650
pain in the rights of man.

615
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,330
We're t we're paying rights.

616
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:17,331
The independence of America
was accompanied by a
revolution in the principles.

617
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:22,050
And practice of government
government founded on a moral theory.

618
00:28:22,051 --> 00:28:27,051
He says on the indefeasible hereditary
rights of man that is now revolving from

619
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:28,680
west to east.

620
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,211
In other words,

621
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:34,170
far from suggesting a traditional
form of communal morality,

622
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,040
uh,

623
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,710
American politics is pain,

624
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,010
suggests there requires a
commitment to the highest,

625
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:46,011
most universal moral principles that seems
to be the cosmopolitan dimension upon

626
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:50,880
which the very nature of
the American regime rests,

627
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,740
but the regime.

628
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,450
But the question does not.

629
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,433
And there,

630
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,920
the principles of Jefferson and pain,

631
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,611
once again,

632
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:00,690
did not arise.

633
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:01,620
Sui Generous.

634
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,190
Uh,

635
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,210
anyone knows,

636
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:03,660
uh,

637
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:08,100
Jefferson's principles about equality
and rights have their profound source.

638
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:11,700
They're profound source in
the philosophy of John Locke,

639
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,000
and particularly in his
second treatise of government.

640
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,640
Recall that lock,

641
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,450
uh,

642
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,400
occupies a central moment,

643
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:20,850
uh,

644
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,760
in the development of the
modern state and his idea,

645
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:28,790
new idea of a kind of industrious and
rational citizen locks philosophy emerge

646
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,340
not only in conversation with the
other great founders of modernity like

647
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:36,810
Machiavelli and Hobbs,

648
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,820
but in some important sense,

649
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,000
it emerge in opposition to the
tradition of the classical republic,

650
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:43,450
uh,

651
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:47,560
whose greatest representatives were Plato,

652
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:47,560
Aristotle,

653
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:47,680
Cicero,

654
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,610
and [inaudible].

655
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,350
It would seem then,

656
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,011
in other words,

657
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:55,150
to be an American citizen in the
fullest sense of the charm requires an

658
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:55,984
immersion,

659
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,470
uh,

660
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:01,470
in the philosophical tradition because
only in America of all the countries in

661
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:02,140
the world,

662
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,890
I believe,

663
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:07,890
does the philosophical tradition
remain most deeply and truly alive.

664
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,960
And yet at the same time,

665
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,680
uh,

666
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,400
the American regime requires an
understanding and appreciation,

667
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,180
uh,

668
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,950
not only for a set of abstract
philosophical ideas and debates,

669
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,780
but for a constitution,

670
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,990
it's history and a
distinctive way of life.

671
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,110
A regime is obviously more than a
catalog of philosophical doctrines and

672
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:33,700
abstract propositions,

673
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,270
but it's embedded within
a particular set of moral,

674
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,080
legal,

675
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,890
political,

676
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,600
constitutional practices.

677
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,470
They'd give it color and
distinguish it from all others.

678
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,480
A proper understanding of the particular
regime requires today or it requires at

679
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:53,110
any time in immersion,

680
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:53,944
in history,

681
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,090
not only philosophy but in
history and I mean by history,

682
00:30:58,091 --> 00:30:59,560
none social history,

683
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,680
economic history or even cultural history,

684
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,860
but history in the proper sense of
the term that is political history.

685
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Political history presupposes
the centrality of politics
of how the constitution

686
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:19,830
and of any society and its
most fundamental laws shape
the character and choices

687
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,610
of its citizen body.

688
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,780
Political history concerns the struggle
of individuals and groups for power.

689
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:33,420
It concerns the political uses of power
or maybe to speak a little more clearly

690
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:37,450
of the two great ends to
which power can be put.

691
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,060
Namely freedom and empire.

692
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:46,150
Political philosophy is
related to political history.

693
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,651
In fact,

694
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:52,420
political history or political philosophy
presupposed one another in the same

695
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:52,960
way,

696
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,350
in the same relation of the
universal to the particular,

697
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,010
whether the political philosophers
studies the principles,

698
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,770
the underlying principles of the regime,

699
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:08,610
the political historian examines the way
those principles have been applied in

700
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,330
practice or the philosopher is
concerned with the best regime,

701
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,020
the regime that is best according
to unchanging principles.

702
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:22,060
The historian is concerned with what
is best for a particular people at a

703
00:32:22,061 --> 00:32:23,950
particular time and place.

704
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,910
Athenians,

705
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:25,803
Frenchmen,

706
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:26,380
uh,

707
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:26,801
uh,

708
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:28,210
Americans and so on.

709
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,720
And this is what the greatest
political historians,

710
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,760
facilities,

711
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,160
uh,

712
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,300
Theodore Momsen,

713
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:34,990
uh,

714
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,980
Lord Macaulay,

715
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:36,430
uh,

716
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,360
Henry Adams.

717
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,740
This is what they have done.

718
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:43,860
They have examined how different regimes
both extreme express but also depart

719
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,880
from fundamental principles.

720
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,691
When Adams,

721
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:48,471
for example,

722
00:32:48,471 --> 00:32:53,471
examines in painstaking detail the
acquisition of the Louisiana territory,

723
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,291
uh,

724
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:56,030
under the Jefferson administration,

725
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:01,150
he does so always against the backdrop
of Jeffersonian ideals about America,

726
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,550
about democracy and limited government.

727
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,580
But that leaves us to the final question
that I want to end with is the proper

728
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,500
understanding and appreciation of the
political is not something we inherit,

729
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,260
but obviously something we must be taught.

730
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:18,890
Uh,

731
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,840
like anything that must be taught,

732
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,550
it requires teachers.

733
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,850
But where are such teachers to be found?

734
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,260
At least today,

735
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,940
it appears it would seem only
very rarely in universities.

736
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,391
Uh,

737
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:35,450
and rarer still in departments of history,

738
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,030
political science or economics,

739
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,020
excuse my a polemic.

740
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,620
Uh,

741
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,150
modern professors of history,

742
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:44,984
for example,

743
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:50,110
often appear to teach everything
but a proper respect for tradition.

744
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:50,870
Uh,

745
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:55,610
one would get the impression from many
classes that America alone among the

746
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:58,790
nations of the world is
responsible for racism,

747
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,930
homophobia,

748
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,000
the d spoilation of the planet,

749
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,420
and every other evil moral
evil that one can imagine.

750
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,980
In my own field,

751
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:12,160
political science that once designated
this skill or art possessed by the most

752
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:18,101
excellent statesmen or politician civic
education has been replaced by something

753
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:24,041
called Game Theory that regards politics
as a marketplace where individual

754
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:30,371
preferences are farmed and utilities
are maximized rather than thinking

755
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:31,880
students,

756
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,840
rather than teaching students to
think of themselves as citizens,

757
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,920
as these members,

758
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,251
uh,

759
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:38,330
individuals did.

760
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:43,390
The new political science treats us as
something called rational actors who

761
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,440
exercise our preferences.

762
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,090
But the question is,

763
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,820
what should we have a preference for?

764
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:54,530
How should rational choice be
exercised on these questions?

765
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,330
That is to say the most fundamental
questions are political science is sadly

766
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,253
silent.

767
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:00,620
Uh,

768
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:05,620
it has nothing to offer and nothing to
say by reducing our politics to choice.

769
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,180
And our choice to preference,

770
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:08,750
uh,

771
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,750
the new political science is forced to
accord legitimacy to every preference,

772
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:17,200
however vial base or in decent,

773
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:17,570
uh,

774
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:22,570
it may be that kind of value neutrality
towards preferences is akin to the

775
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:27,620
philosophic disposition
that we know as nihilism.

776
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:32,660
That is to say the belief that our
deepest principles and convictions are

777
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:35,450
nothing more than blind preferences.

778
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,420
So the purpose of political science,

779
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,140
uh,

780
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,870
is not to stand above or outside
the political community as a,

781
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,500
as an entomologist,

782
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,220
uh,

783
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:47,520
uh,

784
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:47,820
you know,

785
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,610
observing the bay ant ant behavior,

786
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:50,971
uh,

787
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:55,971
but rather to serve as a civic minded
arbitrary and guardian of disputes in

788
00:35:56,011 --> 00:36:00,900
order to restore peace and stability
to conflict ridden situations,

789
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:05,700
we are in danger today of losing
touch with those questions.

790
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,110
And those insights,

791
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:07,570
uh,

792
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:12,570
that are the original motivation for
understanding politics and place of these

793
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,000
questions has arisen.

794
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:20,090
A kind of narrow minded
focus on methodology often
at the expense of the life

795
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:25,410
and death issues that make up
the substance of political,

796
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:26,663
of the political.

797
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,010
So I end with this question.

798
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:29,670
Uh,

799
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,181
what,

800
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:32,830
where should this study
of political science B.

801
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:37,470
Now you have sat through 13
weeks of an introductory course.

802
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,420
Where do you go from here?

803
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:39,990
Uh,

804
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,740
to ask a question posed
brilliantly by Karl Marx,

805
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,280
he asked who will educate the educators?

806
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:47,730
Uh,

807
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,980
the best question he ever asked,

808
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:55,100
how can we begin a comprehensive
reeducation of today's political science?

809
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:03,110
The only answer and the best answer I
can give you today is simply to read old

810
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,513
books.

811
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:11,510
These are our best teachers in a world
where real teachers are in short supply.

812
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,530
In addition to what you have read here,

813
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:17,101
uh,

814
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:22,101
I would include front and center and
your future reading books like Plato's

815
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:23,844
laws,

816
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:29,270
Machiavelli's discourses on Livy and
Monto skews in comparable spirit of the

817
00:37:30,511 --> 00:37:31,080
laws.

818
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:36,080
And of course the federalist papers to
read these books in the spirit in which

819
00:37:36,931 --> 00:37:41,931
they were written is to acquire an
education in political responsibility.

820
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:43,861
This,

821
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:48,861
of course are these should be supplemented
by a study of the deeds and writings

822
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,590
of the most important American
statesman from Jefferson,

823
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,160
Madison Lincoln through
Wilson and Roosevelt.

824
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,870
And these interns should be,

825
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:03,180
should be supported by this study of our
leading jurisprudential thinkers from

826
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,530
Marshall homes,

827
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,570
Brandeis and Frankfurter.

828
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,453
And finally,

829
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:13,410
this should be completed by an examination
of the most important statesman and

830
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:16,290
leaders from world history
from around the world,

831
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,420
from paraclese to Churchill.

832
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,140
Once you have completed those readings,

833
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,760
once you have done that.

834
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,820
And I would say only
when you have done that,

835
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:32,030
can you say that you are living up to
the highest offices of a Yale student?

836
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,010
Uh,

837
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,830
s aptly summarized,

838
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,730
uh,

839
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,180
a neat,

840
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:36,610
uh,

841
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:39,640
memorial gate outside of Branford College,

842
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,510
which says,

843
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,410
for God,

844
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,690
for country and for Yale.

845
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:50,580
Thank you for your time and
patients over this semester.

846
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,010
And good luck to you in the future.

847
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,960
