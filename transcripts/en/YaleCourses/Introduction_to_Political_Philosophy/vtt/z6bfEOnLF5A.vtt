1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.760
I wanted to begin by talking a little bit about what,

2
00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:08.761
what is the question or what is the problem to which this immense book,

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.720
uh,

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.280
of which you're only reading a,

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.090
I dunno,

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.000
a couple of hundred pages maximum.

7
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.760
What is the problem with which this huge book is concerned?

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.500
It's always an important question to ask when you begin a new book.

9
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:28.920
What question is the author trying to ask?

10
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:30.990
Or what problem is he trying to deal with?

11
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:33.960
Let me try to set up Tocqueville's problem,

12
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.470
uh,

13
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.711
in,

14
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:35.910
in the following way.

15
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.910
Uh,

16
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.560
in the 17th and 18th centuries,

17
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.940
the ideas of freedom and equality seemed to walk confidently hand in hand.

18
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.070
Uh,

19
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.780
Hobbs Loche who,

20
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:56.250
so who he's been reading all believed that in the state of nature,

21
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.580
remember we were all born free and equal as long as the enemy appeared to be the

22
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:10.611
entrenched hierarchies of power and privilege of the old regime,

23
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:12.930
of the old monarchical societies.

24
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.711
Freedom.

25
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:18.630
Inequality were taken to be mutually reinforcing aspects,

26
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.340
uh,

27
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.790
of the emerging,

28
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.070
uh,

29
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.170
democratic,

30
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.860
uh,

31
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.693
order

32
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.950
and it,

33
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.950
but it was not until the beginning of the 19th century with the emergence of the

34
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:36.780
democracies or Prodo democracies,

35
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.420
a of Europe and the new world,

36
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.091
uh,

37
00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:41.580
that political philosophers,

38
00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:42.510
political thinkers,

39
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:47.511
began to wonder where their freedom and equality did not in fact,

40
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:50.220
pull in different directions.

41
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.010
Tocqueville in particular,

42
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.900
although you could add the names like Benjamin Constante or,

43
00:01:57.901 --> 00:01:58.131
or,

44
00:01:58.131 --> 00:01:59.430
or John Stuart Mill,

45
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:03.840
but Tocqueville in particular saw the new democratic societies,

46
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.340
is creating new forms of social power,

47
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
new types of rule that represented in some ways organized threats to human

48
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:16.344
liberty.

49
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.440
What were these new forms of social power?

50
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:21.240
These were for Tocqueville,

51
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.430
the new middle class,

52
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.920
or what we might call bourgeois democracy is the new middleclass democracies

53
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.630
emerging in countries like France,

54
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.613
England,

55
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.371
and of course,

56
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:33.420
the United States.

57
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.820
And the problem for Tocqueville,

58
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:39.600
or his question as it was for Locke and others before him,

59
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.340
was how to mitigate the effects of political power.

60
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:45.540
How does one,

61
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.170
uh,

62
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.850
control or mitigate,

63
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.360
uh,

64
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.950
for political power?

65
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:50.610
Yes.

66
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.000
Right.

67
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.080
You can see that,

68
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.160
uh,

69
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.160
lacks answer you recall to this problem was to divide and separate the separated

70
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:01.661
powers.

71
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:06.661
A theme clearly taken up and endorsed by the American constitutional framers,

72
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.120
but Tocqueville was less certain that this kind of institutional device,

73
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:17.200
so to speak,

74
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:22.201
of checks and balances are separated powers could be ineffective or truly

75
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:24.220
effective check,

76
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.730
uh,

77
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.730
in a democratic age where you might say the people as a whole had become king.

78
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.040
He was less certain that institutional remedies alone could work.

79
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:38.950
Was 75 years before talk though,

80
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:39.610
right?

81
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.230
Wrote democracy in America,

82
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.600
Russo had taken up the doctrine of popular sovereignty to be an ideal to be

83
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:53.770
worked for taking men as they are and laws as they might be.

84
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.570
He looked to the doctrine of popular sovereignty is something that could be,

85
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.060
but Tocqueville again,

86
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:06.061
writing seven approximately 75 years after Rousseau saw this doctrine,

87
00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:11.731
this doctrine of popular sovereignty that far mid 18th of mid 18th century

88
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:17.611
Frenchmen had looked like a far flung utopian ideal for Tocqueville.

89
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:24.241
This ideal had become an altogether a political reality that had taken shape in

90
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:31.801
the backwoods of Jacksonian America considered just the following passage from

91
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:35.230
the democracy in the United States.

92
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:36.041
Tocqueville writes,

93
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:36.610
the Democ,

94
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.450
the dogma,

95
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:37.931
he says,

96
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:42.130
he calls it the dogma of the sovereignty of the people is not an isolated

97
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:45.220
doctrine that is joined neither to habits,

98
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:47.650
nor to the sum of dominant ideas.

99
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.180
On the contrary,

100
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:49.751
he says,

101
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:54.751
one can view it as the last link in a chain of opinions that envelops the Anglo

102
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.090
American world as a whole.

103
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.250
And he goes on to say that extended to the entirety of the nation,

104
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.770
it becomes it.

105
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.550
That is,

106
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.510
this opinion becomes the dogma of the sovereignty of the people.

107
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.440
So here you have Tocqueville's view that,

108
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.860
uh,

109
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.240
this roo in concept of popular sovereignty has become,

110
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.810
uh,

111
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.520
an existence reality.

112
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.350
And for Tocqueville,

113
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:27.460
there was no reason to believe that the new democratic states,

114
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.120
uh,

115
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.780
emerging again in America and in Europe.

116
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.900
These new democratic states ruled by the people.

117
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:39.901
There was no reason to believe that they will be more just or less arbitrary

118
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.110
than any other previous kind of regime.

119
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:45.880
For Tocqueville,

120
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:46.601
no one,

121
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:51.601
no person or body of persons can be safely and trusted with political power.

122
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.110
And the United Power of the people do.

123
00:05:57.111 --> 00:06:00.470
United sovereignty of the people is no more for him.

124
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:05.471
A reliable guarantor of freedom than any other kind of regime.

125
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.220
So the problem of politics you might say in,

126
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.250
in age of democracy is the problem of how to control the sovereignty of the

127
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:18.524
people.

128
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.521
For Roussel,

129
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:23.360
you remember that was never really seriously a problem.

130
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.680
The general will,

131
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:25.281
he says,

132
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:26.300
cannot err.

133
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:26.960
Uh,

134
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.830
the people,

135
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.310
uh,

136
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.810
when they are ruling in their collective capacities cannot be wrong.

137
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.430
Uh,

138
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.580
but Tocqueville was less certain about this,

139
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.070
whether or not the people,

140
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.610
uh,

141
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.460
in their collective capacity as sovereign,

142
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.150
uh,

143
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.710
are,

144
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.860
uh,

145
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.460
an infallible guide.

146
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.030
The question is what can be done about that?

147
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.500
Uh,

148
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.660
in an aristocratic ages,

149
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:55.610
you might say the answer was simple.

150
00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.640
Tocqueville believed that in aristocratic times there were always countervailing

151
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.750
centers of power,

152
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.570
a king's no matter how powerful,

153
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.750
always had to contend with,

154
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.170
uh,

155
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.710
a fractious and warlike a nobilities.

156
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.271
But again,

157
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:19.271
who or what can exercise that countervailing power in a world where the people

158
00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:23.570
in their collective capacity have to repeat,

159
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.100
become the king,

160
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.870
uh,

161
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.870
who or what has the power to check the popular will or the general will.

162
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.140
This is the problem.

163
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.900
How to check democratic power.

164
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:39.320
This is the problem that Tocqueville's new political science.

165
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.650
What he boasts in the introduction to the book is a new political science for a

166
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:46.100
world itself.

167
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:47.420
Quite new.

168
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.230
Uh,

169
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.690
this is the problem that he sets out to answer.

170
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.820
And to this extent,

171
00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:56.540
I would also say we are all Tocqueville's children.

172
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.150
We are all disciples of Tocqueville.

173
00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:01.200
In so far as we all are,

174
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:06.310
political science continues to deal with the problem of the guidance and control

175
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.870
of democratic government.

176
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.070
How to,

177
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:10.851
you might say,

178
00:08:10.851 --> 00:08:15.140
combine popular government with political wisdom,

179
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.800
how to do that remains a problem.

180
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:19.461
You might say,

181
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:21.530
akin to squaring the circle,

182
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.670
but it remains the fundamental problem for democracies.

183
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:28.850
How to combine popular rule with political wisdom.

184
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.140
That was really what Tocqueville was concerned about.

185
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

186
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.300
<v 0>But before going on.</v>

187
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.110
Okay.

188
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.310
But before going on,

189
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.173
let me

190
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:42.391
ask,

191
00:08:42.391 --> 00:08:43.020
who was,

192
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.550
who was Alexi de Tocqueville?

193
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:45.571
Let's say?

194
00:08:45.571 --> 00:08:46.980
Let me tell you something about him.

195
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:49.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

196
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.730
<v 0>Tocqueville was born in 1805 into a Norman family from the north of France,</v>

197
00:08:56.791 --> 00:09:00.300
from Normandy with an ancient lineage.

198
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.040
The Tocqueville is state,

199
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:09.070
still stands today and his own still in the hands of members of the Tocqueville

200
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.353
family.

201
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.710
I know because I visited it a couple of summers ago and met and met his heirs,

202
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.330
although they are not actually the heirs of his,

203
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.740
of him directly.

204
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.040
Uh,

205
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.410
Tocqueville and his wife had no children.

206
00:09:26.411 --> 00:09:30.130
They belong to one of the brother's side of the family,

207
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.980
but absolutely charming people.

208
00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.320
Exactly what you think French aristocrats would be like.

209
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.680
Our charm and grace.

210
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:43.730
<v 1>Okay,</v>

211
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:44.840
<v 0>wonderful hosts.</v>

212
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.510
And Tocqueville was deeply attached to his ancestral home.

213
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:52.100
Uh,

214
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.310
in a letter from 1828,

215
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.170
one of my favorite Tocqueville letters he wrote to a friend.

216
00:09:57.171 --> 00:10:01.010
Here I am after returning from a trip abroad trip away,

217
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.620
here I am finally at Tocqueville,

218
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.680
referring to the home simply by the family name.

219
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.300
I am finally at Tocqueville.

220
00:10:08.301 --> 00:10:10.490
And my family's old broken down,

221
00:10:10.491 --> 00:10:13.310
ruined it'll leagues distance.

222
00:10:13.311 --> 00:10:17.420
I can see the harbor where William the conqueror sets sail for England.

223
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.900
I am surrounded by Norman Norman's,

224
00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:24.080
whose names figure among the conquerors.

225
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.900
All of this I have to confess,

226
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.340
tickles my heart.

227
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.571
So he,

228
00:10:31.571 --> 00:10:36.571
he comes from a line of people who trace their ancestry back to the Norman

229
00:10:36.801 --> 00:10:41.420
conquest and have been in that part of France for centuries,

230
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.313
for centuries.

231
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:42.861
In fact,

232
00:10:42.861 --> 00:10:43.820
the Tocqueville home,

233
00:10:43.821 --> 00:10:48.821
it's a short drive away from the Normandy beach where the big d day invasion

234
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:51.981
took place.

235
00:10:51.981 --> 00:10:52.400
You know,

236
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.270
during World War Two,

237
00:10:53.271 --> 00:10:55.640
it's a miracle that the home still survives.

238
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:02.120
Tocqueville's parents had been arrested during the French revolution and were

239
00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:05.630
held in prison for almost a year and only the fall,

240
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.070
uh,

241
00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.310
of Robespierre and 1794 saved them from execution.

242
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:11.540
Uh,

243
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.670
the young Tocqueville was born,

244
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.271
uh,

245
00:11:14.271 --> 00:11:19.180
under the Napoleonic dynasty and spent his formative years is,

246
00:11:19.181 --> 00:11:24.181
is adolescence in his school years under the most conservative,

247
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:25.520
uh,

248
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.520
if not to say reactionary circles of post revolutionary France.

249
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:32.900
Tocqueville,

250
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.580
studied law in Paris,

251
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.220
and during this time he made the acquaintance and friendship of another young

252
00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:45.221
Aristocrat by the name of Gustaf to Beaumont and an 1830 for reasons that are

253
00:11:46.911 --> 00:11:48.740
not altogether clear when he was,

254
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.720
when he was 25 or so.

255
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.250
In 1830,

256
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.560
the two men received a commission from the new government of Louis,

257
00:11:56.561 --> 00:11:57.490
Felipe King,

258
00:11:57.491 --> 00:12:02.491
Louie Felipe to go to the United States to study the prison system there.

259
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.360
The trip to the u s was occasioned by a of grant,

260
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:08.081
you might say,

261
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:12.520
a fellowship to study the American prison system.

262
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.513
Uh,

263
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.680
talk thoughts journey to America,

264
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.830
which has been extensively documented.

265
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:25.840
Lasted for just under a year from May,

266
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.120
1831 to February,

267
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:33.120
1832 and during that time he traveled as far north as New England south to New

268
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:34.750
Orleans.

269
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.290
Yes,

270
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:39.460
he was in New Orleans and went to the outer banks of Lake Michigan.

271
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.200
Uh,

272
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.200
the result of this visit was of course the two large volumes that he called

273
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.370
democracy in America,

274
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.070
democracy on a Merrick.

275
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:50.860
Uh,

276
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.830
the first volume appeared five years,

277
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.130
four years or so after his trip in 1835,

278
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.811
uh,

279
00:12:57.811 --> 00:12:59.980
when it's Arthur was only 30 years old.

280
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.300
The second volume appeared five years later in 1840.

281
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:09.350
And both of those volumes are contained within the single volume that you have.

282
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.233
Uh,

283
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.620
Tocqueville's trip has been much studied and much admired.

284
00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:15.460
Even just,

285
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.030
uh,

286
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.361
in,

287
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:16.560
uh,

288
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:16.810
in,

289
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:17.501
in recent,

290
00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:18.910
very recent times,

291
00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:19.540
uh,

292
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:24.540
a French philosopher by the name of Bernard Henri Levy came over,

293
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.650
didn't exactly follow Tocqueville's journey,

294
00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:32.320
but traveled throughout America,

295
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:33.220
uh,

296
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:33.881
kind of,

297
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:34.240
uh,

298
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.650
Frenchmans Guide,

299
00:13:35.651 --> 00:13:40.651
a sort of barrettes America or most going to lots of vague going to Las Vegas

300
00:13:40.931 --> 00:13:44.620
and evangelical churches and all this stuff,

301
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.310
and wrote a very interesting book called American Vertigo.

302
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:49.923
Uh,

303
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.660
the most charitable thing I can remark is that he was no Tocqueville,

304
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.210
but leaving that aside,

305
00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.133
it was a,

306
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.150
an admirable effort,

307
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.263
uh,

308
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:09.570
democracy in America to put it simply is the most important work about democracy

309
00:14:10.301 --> 00:14:11.500
that you will ever read.

310
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.713
Uh,

311
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.420
to compound the irony,

312
00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:17.351
uh,

313
00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:22.030
the most famous book on American democracy was written by a French aristocrat

314
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.850
who might've been deeply foreign,

315
00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:30.880
if not hostile to the manners customs habits of a democratic society.

316
00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.880
And from the time of its first publication in 1835,

317
00:14:37.881 --> 00:14:40.610
the book was hailed as a masterpiece.

318
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.480
John Stuart mill called the book a masterpiece that has,

319
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.500
once he says,

320
00:14:45.501 --> 00:14:49.370
taken it to rank among the most remarkable productions of our time.

321
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.730
Tocqueville has to take his side,

322
00:14:52.731 --> 00:14:55.580
his place alongside of Washington,

323
00:14:55.581 --> 00:14:57.020
Jefferson and Madison,

324
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.290
almost as if he were an honorary American.

325
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.300
And as if this were not enough.

326
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.000
A recent translation of the book,

327
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.540
uh,

328
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:10.540
was recently inducted into the prestigious library of America series a,

329
00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:14.870
which seems to put the stamp of naturalization,

330
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:15.560
uh,

331
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.620
and a book written in French for Frenchmen.

332
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.850
And yet yet it,

333
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.570
it is part of the prestigious library of America,

334
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:24.320
uh,

335
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.580
is Tocqueville might've said,

336
00:15:25.581 --> 00:15:25.881
you know,

337
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:26.714
go figure,

338
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.120
uh,

339
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.470
I don't want to say that in French actually,

340
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:30.800
but,

341
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.460
um,

342
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:36.460
but there is a textbook image of Tocqueville according to which he came to

343
00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:41.090
America is a kind of blank slate.

344
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:46.540
And the experience of American democracy had a profoundly transformative

345
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.820
influence over the young aristocrat.

346
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.710
But nothing I would suggest to you could be further from the truth.

347
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.440
In a letter to his best friend,

348
00:15:57.441 --> 00:15:59.150
a man named Louis decare Galle,

349
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.190
who's home,

350
00:16:01.191 --> 00:16:05.090
who's a state is actually directly next door to the Tocqueville estate.

351
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.020
Uh,

352
00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.860
in a letter to Tocqueville written just before the publication of the first

353
00:16:09.861 --> 00:16:12.800
volume of the democracy in 1835,

354
00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:17.540
Tocqueville describes his purpose in writing his book in these terms.

355
00:16:17.541 --> 00:16:18.740
Let me read from his letter.

356
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.180
Tocqueville writes,

357
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.670
it is not without having carefully reflected that.

358
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:24.200
I decided to write the book.

359
00:16:24.201 --> 00:16:25.910
I am just now publishing.

360
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.770
I do not hide from myself what is annoying in my position,

361
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.060
it is bound to attract active sympathy from no one.

362
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.060
Some will find that at bottom.

363
00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:41.540
I do not like democracy and them severe toward it,

364
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.140
but others will think I favor.

365
00:16:44.141 --> 00:16:46.640
It's develop development in moderately.

366
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.990
It would be most fortunate for me if the book were not red.

367
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.310
And that is a piece of good fortune that may perhaps soon come to pass.

368
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.650
I know all that,

369
00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.420
but here is my response.

370
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.850
Nearly 10 years ago,

371
00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:04.670
I was already thinking about part of the things that,

372
00:17:04.671 --> 00:17:06.290
how you've just now set forth.

373
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.340
I was in America only to become clear on this point.

374
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.430
The penitentiary system was a pretext.

375
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:20.890
So two points I think bear comment about this remarkable statement of his

376
00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:25.280
purpose to his friend [inaudible].

377
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:32.350
First is the Tocqueville indicates that his idea for the book,

378
00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:33.350
uh,

379
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:34.700
had already as he says,

380
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:38.990
Co begun to germinate five years before his trip to America.

381
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.000
He says the penitentiary system,

382
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:45.230
that penitentiary project for which he was sent over was only a pretext.

383
00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:50.231
He said he already had begun to speculate on these themes.

384
00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:53.400
He says 10 years before his trip,

385
00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:54.450
uh,

386
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.040
now if you do the math,

387
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:56.940
uh,

388
00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.800
when you consider that he was 30 years old in 1835 when the book was pub first,

389
00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:06.801
first volume was published and he said he was speculating on these themes

390
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.970
already 10 years before.

391
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.780
It would seem that the germ of the idea for the book,

392
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:13.890
the germ idea,

393
00:18:13.891 --> 00:18:18.891
that germ cell for the book had occurred to Tocqueville when he was only 20

394
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.580
years old.

395
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:25.730
That is to say about the age that most of you are here and he went to America

396
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:32.480
only to confirm what he had begun to suspect when he was at the age of

397
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.080
contemporary undergraduate.

398
00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:37.530
Uh,

399
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:38.430
think of that.

400
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:39.180
Uh,

401
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.010
get your idea now.

402
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:42.750
Get it quickly.

403
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.930
Then maybe you can write a famous book by the time you are 30.

404
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:48.960
Uh,

405
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.820
I have to tell you it is way,

406
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.130
way beyond that stage for me.

407
00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

408
00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.341
<v 0>Hobbes,</v>

409
00:18:57.341 --> 00:18:57.760
however,

410
00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.470
did not write his masterpiece,

411
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:00.040
uh,

412
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.770
until he was 63.

413
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.410
So there's still hope for some of us.

414
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.470
Nevertheless,

415
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.680
the second point I would make about that letter is that it is also clear that

416
00:19:14.081 --> 00:19:16.690
Tocqueville was writing his book,

417
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:21.750
not for the benefit of Americans who you will discover he thought had little

418
00:19:22.061 --> 00:19:23.590
taste for philosophy.

419
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.220
But for freshmen in particular,

420
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:32.250
he was hoping to persuade his fellow countrymen who was still devoted to the

421
00:19:32.381 --> 00:19:34.300
restoration of the monarchy,

422
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:38.980
that the democratic social revolution that he had witnessed in America

423
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.790
represented also the future of France.

424
00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.950
If John Locke had said in his second treatise when lock had said in the

425
00:19:47.951 --> 00:19:48.640
beginning,

426
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.290
all the world was America,

427
00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:54.670
Tocqueville's point appears to be in the future.

428
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.980
All of the world will be,

429
00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:57.670
uh,

430
00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:02.670
America is attitude towards what he saw,

431
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.690
what we would perhaps call today,

432
00:20:04.691 --> 00:20:07.720
Americanization democratization.

433
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.440
We,

434
00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.850
his attitude towards this was one of skepticism mixed with fear.

435
00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:14.411
I confess,

436
00:20:14.411 --> 00:20:15.760
he writes it in America.

437
00:20:15.761 --> 00:20:17.290
I saw more than America.

438
00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:21.070
I sought their in image of democracy itself.

439
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.240
Or it's pensions,

440
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.380
it's characters.

441
00:20:23.381 --> 00:20:25.390
It's prejudice is its passions.

442
00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:27.940
I wanted to become acquainted with it,

443
00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:32.820
if only to know at least what we ought to hope or fear from it.

444
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.290
That sentence is so typical of Tocqueville.

445
00:20:38.291 --> 00:20:38.791
The way he,

446
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:40.750
he piles on the,

447
00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:41.441
you know,

448
00:20:41.441 --> 00:20:42.340
the quality,

449
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.670
the quality that the descriptive labels,

450
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.580
it's pensions,

451
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:47.440
it's character,

452
00:20:47.441 --> 00:20:48.420
its prejudices,

453
00:20:48.421 --> 00:20:49.330
it's passions.

454
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.700
So there are embedded in that two questions too.

455
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:59.350
You might say subordinate clauses are two sub questions that Tocqueville set out

456
00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:01.270
to answer the first concerns,

457
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.460
the gradual replacement of the onsie on regime.

458
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.410
That is to say the French term for the old aristocratic order based on

459
00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:12.221
privileges,

460
00:21:12.221 --> 00:21:13.060
hierarchy,

461
00:21:13.061 --> 00:21:13.691
deference,

462
00:21:13.691 --> 00:21:18.691
and inequality with a new democratic society based on equality.

463
00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.140
How did this happen?

464
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.870
How did this happen?

465
00:21:22.871 --> 00:21:27.871
And what brought it about this immense transform social and political

466
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:31.030
transformation from the old regime,

467
00:21:31.031 --> 00:21:35.500
from an age of inequality to an increasing age of equality.

468
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.010
A huge example of what we might call today,

469
00:21:39.011 --> 00:21:41.950
regime change or regime transformation,

470
00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.950
and the second not expire.

471
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:46.450
How did that happen?

472
00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:47.230
And the second,

473
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.020
not perhaps explicitly ask question,

474
00:21:50.021 --> 00:21:55.021
but nevertheless a question on virtually every page of Tocqueville's book

475
00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.480
concerns the difference between the form democracy has taken in America and the

476
00:22:01.391 --> 00:22:06.070
form it took in France during their revolutionary period.

477
00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:07.930
Why Tocqueville asks,

478
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:12.010
has American democracy been relatively gentle or mild?

479
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.010
Those are two characteristic Tocqueville,

480
00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:15.820
union terms.

481
00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.010
Why has American democracy been,

482
00:22:18.011 --> 00:22:20.350
what we might call today a liberal democracy?

483
00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:25.890
And why did democracy in France veer dangerously close towards terror and

484
00:22:27.611 --> 00:22:30.070
despotism during its revolution?

485
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:30.790
Uh,

486
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.770
that was the second question.

487
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:34.390
Tocqueville set out to answer.

488
00:22:34.391 --> 00:22:39.391
Tocqueville believed it to be virtually a providential fact of history that

489
00:22:39.581 --> 00:22:43.120
societies were becoming increasingly democratic,

490
00:22:43.121 --> 00:22:45.220
increasingly egalitarian.

491
00:22:45.221 --> 00:22:46.054
We might say,

492
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:51.330
what is not certain you could say is what form democracy will take,

493
00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:56.880
whether democracy will be compatible with liberty or whether it will issue into

494
00:22:56.921 --> 00:23:00.940
a new kind of despotism remains a question that this,

495
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.990
that only the Statesman of the future we'll be able to answer.

496
00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.420
And from these two questions,

497
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:12.690
how did this transformation occur and what form will democracy take in the

498
00:23:13.871 --> 00:23:14.321
future?

499
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:15.430
From these two questions,

500
00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:16.930
we can see that Tocqueville wrote,

501
00:23:16.931 --> 00:23:19.510
his book is a political educator,

502
00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:25.410
that Tocqueville takes his place along with people like Plato,

503
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:26.570
Aristotle,

504
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:26.571
Machiavelli,

505
00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:30.370
and the others is a great political educator.

506
00:23:30.371 --> 00:23:35.371
He was more than a mere chronicler of American manners and customs,

507
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:41.430
but rather it was an educator of future European statesmen hoping to steer their

508
00:23:41.891 --> 00:23:46.891
countries between the shoals of revolution and reaction.

509
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.690
How did Tocqueville a attempt to accomplish this?

510
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:59.030
Let me try to talk for a moment about what he hoped to teach

511
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.510
because you have to admire the book.

512
00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.860
And have to understand it,

513
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:07.700
uh,

514
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.720
as an immense handbook almost as it were,

515
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.380
of the education of a democratic statesmen.

516
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.300
Slightly larger than Machiavelli's prince perhaps,

517
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:25.930
but nevertheless a handbook for states craft statecraft.

518
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:27.043
Nonetheless,

519
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:29.870
what did he hope to teach

520
00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:40.570
near near the end of the introduction and I pay a special attention to that,

521
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.840
that fascinating introduction to the book.

522
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:43.460
I don't,

523
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.390
I don't mean the translator's introduction.

524
00:24:45.391 --> 00:24:47.010
I mean Tocqueville zone introduction.

525
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.100
Near the end of the introduction,

526
00:24:50.101 --> 00:24:51.660
he writes the following sentence.

527
00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.410
I think those who want to regard it,

528
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.200
namely his bark who wants to regarded closely,

529
00:24:58.201 --> 00:25:02.600
we'll find in the entire work a mother thought that so,

530
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:03.750
so to speak,

531
00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:04.830
so to speak,

532
00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:09.860
links all the parts a mother thought his word sharing is an e De Mer,

533
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.870
a mother idea.

534
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.400
What is this mother idea or mother thought to which he refers there and the most

535
00:25:21.331 --> 00:25:23.860
likely candidate for it.

536
00:25:23.861 --> 00:25:26.700
Central idea is the idea of equality.

537
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:32.990
The opening sentence of the book reads among the new objects that attracted my

538
00:25:34.441 --> 00:25:36.960
attention during my stay in the United States.

539
00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.610
None struck my eye more vividly than the equality of conditions.

540
00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.460
The equality of conditions.

541
00:25:44.461 --> 00:25:47.100
What does he mean by that phrase?

542
00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.940
What does it mean by a quality here?

543
00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:57.530
Note in the first incidence that Tocqueville riff speaks of equality as a social

544
00:25:57.721 --> 00:25:58.554
condition.

545
00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.510
Uh,

546
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:01.170
an equality of conditions,

547
00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.020
not a form of government per se.

548
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:05.970
Uh,

549
00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:09.810
this is in part an expression of what you might think of is Tocqueville,

550
00:26:09.811 --> 00:26:12.450
sociological imagination,

551
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:17.970
equality of conditions precedes democratic government.

552
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.260
Uh,

553
00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:24.090
equality of conditions you might say is the cause from which democratic

554
00:26:24.091 --> 00:26:25.410
governments arise.

555
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:31.400
Equality of conditions were planted both in Europe and in America long before

556
00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.900
Democratic governments arose in either place.

557
00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:41.130
Democratic governments are only is old.

558
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:41.410
It,

559
00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:42.980
at least in France and America,

560
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:47.730
democratic governments are only as old as the American or French revolutions.

561
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:53.540
But equality of conditions had been prepared by deep rooted historical processes

562
00:26:54.991 --> 00:26:59.940
that began long before the dawn of the modern age.

563
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:04.350
So a quality of conditions refers to a social fact,

564
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.760
not a form of government in,

565
00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:07.603
in that intro,

566
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:12.270
which had in which precede democratic government,

567
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:12.930
uh,

568
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:14.820
by long periods of time.

569
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.130
And in the introduction to his book,

570
00:27:17.131 --> 00:27:17.521
again,

571
00:27:17.521 --> 00:27:19.020
Tocqueville gives a brief,

572
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:23.070
I would say very brief history of equality,

573
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.620
taking it as far back,

574
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:26.940
uh,

575
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.340
to the heart of the Medieval world.

576
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:30.240
Uh,

577
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.620
some 700 years.

578
00:27:31.621 --> 00:27:32.071
He says,

579
00:27:32.071 --> 00:27:33.780
unlike Hobbs or Russo,

580
00:27:33.781 --> 00:27:38.160
he does not invoke a state of nature as a way of grounding equality.

581
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.293
In fact,

582
00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:40.530
for Tocqueville,

583
00:27:40.531 --> 00:27:43.830
what Hobbes and Rousseau believed that we are by nature,

584
00:27:43.831 --> 00:27:47.220
free and equal in only over time,

585
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.910
they believe we're social hierarchies and inequalities introduced.

586
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:55.350
Tocqueville argues exactly the opposite point of view.

587
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.690
The historical process,

588
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:58.561
so to speak,

589
00:27:58.561 --> 00:28:03.561
has been moving away from inequality and towards greater and greater equality of

590
00:28:05.131 --> 00:28:06.270
social conditions.

591
00:28:06.271 --> 00:28:08.010
The historical process,

592
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:10.530
at least as Tocqueville traces it out here,

593
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.170
has been a process of gradual,

594
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:13.760
uh,

595
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.860
it equalization of social conditions.

596
00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:20.250
His equality is something like an historical force,

597
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:25.580
something that has been working itself out in history over a vast stretch of

598
00:28:26.401 --> 00:28:26.880
time.

599
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.500
And he often writes as if equality is not just one fact among others,

600
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.041
but his,

601
00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:36.570
what he calls a generative fact from which everything else derives.

602
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.390
As I studied America more and more,

603
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:40.283
he writes,

604
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:44.850
I saw an a quality of conditions I saw in the equality of conditions,

605
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
the generative fact from which each particular fact seems to issue.

606
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.970
He says in the second paragraph of his introduction,

607
00:28:53.971 --> 00:28:58.971
the generative fact from which each particular fact seemed to issue.

608
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.150
Tocqueville writes here about equality,

609
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:02.760
uh,

610
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:07.760
as an historical fact that has come to acquire an almost providential force,

611
00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:09.541
uh,

612
00:29:09.541 --> 00:29:10.500
over time.

613
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:15.650
And he uses this term providence here several times throughout the introduction.

614
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:21.200
He uses that term not so much to describe God as one might think,

615
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.840
ah,

616
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.840
but rather to describe a sort of universal historical process that is working

617
00:29:27.391 --> 00:29:28.380
itself out,

618
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:29.760
so to speak,

619
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:34.820
even against the intentions of individual social and political actors.

620
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:40.910
The gradual spread of the conditions of equality he believes has two characters,

621
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:44.790
uh,

622
00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:47.950
or two characteristics of Providence.

623
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.390
It is universal,

624
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.283
he says,

625
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:55.320
and it always escapes the power of the individual to control.

626
00:29:56.530 --> 00:30:00.070
If Machiavelli believed we can control for tuna,

627
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.440
we can control providence or chance.

628
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.550
Half the time.

629
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:08.410
Russ Tocqueville seems to believe that the process of equality,

630
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:09.040
uh,

631
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.080
always escapes the powers,

632
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.391
uh,

633
00:30:11.391 --> 00:30:12.760
of human control.

634
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:18.030
It is the very power of equality that makes it seem to be an irresistible force,

635
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:20.470
uh,

636
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.200
rather than the product of the modern age alone.

637
00:30:23.201 --> 00:30:23.591
Again,

638
00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:28.591
Tocqueville shows have the steady emergence of equality of conditions has been

639
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.990
the central dynamic of European history over several hundreds of years.

640
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.030
So this,

641
00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.010
he frames the book within a,

642
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:43.900
you might say a very large scale sort of philosophy of history in which

643
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:48.990
democracy equality and the gradual equalization of social conditions are the

644
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:52.630
sort of central motifs.

645
00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.633
<v 1>Okay.</v>

646
00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:03.140
<v 0>So it is in order to understand that process that Tocqueville turns to America</v>

647
00:31:03.901 --> 00:31:05.130
of the 1830s,

648
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.280
there was only one country in the world.

649
00:31:08.281 --> 00:31:13.281
He says where the great social revolution I am speaking of seems nearly to have

650
00:31:14.161 --> 00:31:16.440
attained its natural limits.

651
00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:20.490
One Country where the social revolution,

652
00:31:20.491 --> 00:31:23.370
the democratic transformations from the old

653
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:29.910
aristocratic order to the new democratic age seems to have reached its natural

654
00:31:29.911 --> 00:31:30.744
limits.

655
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.050
And that country is of course the United States.

656
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:34.913
Yeah.

657
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:38.400
In this context,

658
00:31:38.401 --> 00:31:43.401
I think it is very revealing that he chose to call his book democracy in America

659
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:49.140
and not simply American democracy.

660
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:53.790
Think about that choice of title for a moment.

661
00:31:55.590 --> 00:32:00.590
His point I take it is that is not that democracy is a peculiarly American

662
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.361
phenomenon,

663
00:32:03.361 --> 00:32:04.590
far from it.

664
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:09.390
His point is when he's describing democracy in America,

665
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:14.420
here is the form that the democratic revolution has taken in America.

666
00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:16.050
Uh,

667
00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:19.860
what form it will take elsewhere or it may take elsewhere,

668
00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.080
is by no means predetermined.

669
00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:26.100
Democracy is not a settled or fixed condition.

670
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.400
It is something more like a process.

671
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.030
And when we think of the way we speak today,

672
00:32:33.031 --> 00:32:35.490
when we talk about democratization,

673
00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:38.880
the process of democratization,

674
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:44.050
you can see that democracy seems to be less a settled or fixed or determine it

675
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:48.050
kind of regime than a kind of process.

676
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:53.230
It has the quality that Rousseau referred to in the second discourse as

677
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:56.030
perfectability tape perfectability.

678
00:32:56.031 --> 00:33:01.031
That is to say an almost infinite elasticity and openness to change.

679
00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:01.880
Uh,

680
00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.301
again,

681
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:04.340
it is less a determinant,

682
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:09.490
political or social order than a continual work in pro in progress.

683
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.430
And that is the way Tocqueville looks at,

684
00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:14.000
uh,

685
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.320
America in some ways.

686
00:33:15.321 --> 00:33:17.960
There looks at the future of democracy when he says,

687
00:33:17.961 --> 00:33:21.710
I look at the place where it seems to have attained it's natural limit,

688
00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:25.760
but what form it may take elsewhere is by no,

689
00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:30.710
that is by no means to say that the form it takes in America is the form it will

690
00:33:30.711 --> 00:33:31.670
take anywhere,

691
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:32.570
anywhere else.

692
00:33:32.571 --> 00:33:37.571
Democracy is the regime that seems to be almost infinitely elastic in terms of

693
00:33:38.391 --> 00:33:39.440
its possibilities.

694
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:45.100
And this I think is a profound and astute observation about the nature of

695
00:33:46.221 --> 00:33:47.360
democratic government.

696
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.040
We do not know,

697
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:49.550
uh,

698
00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:54.550
where the process of democratization will end any more today than we did in

699
00:33:55.701 --> 00:33:58.520
Tocqueville's time or that Tokyo new.

700
00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:03.560
It is a matter for statecraft and leadership and political thought.

701
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.240
Again,

702
00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:09.240
we'll future democracies be liberal and freedom loving or will they be harsh and

703
00:34:09.771 --> 00:34:10.610
rhubarb native.

704
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:15.880
That is a question that we are now seeing very upfront and close in various

705
00:34:17.031 --> 00:34:22.031
parts of the world today that are undergoing their own very tempestuous

706
00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.640
transitions to democracy as we was,

707
00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:26.211
we'll say.

708
00:34:26.211 --> 00:34:28.850
And it remains very much an open question.

709
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:31.880
What form those democracies will take.

710
00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:32.660
Uh,

711
00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:36.620
that question is at least as important for us,

712
00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:37.370
uh,

713
00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:39.920
if not more so than it was for Tocqueville.

714
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.290
What Tocqueville is sure about,

715
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:43.011
however,

716
00:34:43.011 --> 00:34:47.570
is that the fate of America is in some way the fate of Europe.

717
00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.520
And maybe for that matter,

718
00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.590
the fate of the rest of the world.

719
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.940
It appears to me,

720
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:57.080
he says beyond doubt that sooner or later we shall arrive,

721
00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.880
likely Americans at an almost complete equality of conditions.

722
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:07.190
He says in the introduction that we shall arrive speaking to his French

723
00:35:07.191 --> 00:35:07.701
audience,

724
00:35:07.701 --> 00:35:09.410
a shocking statement again,

725
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:12.100
two members of his class and of,

726
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:12.740
of,

727
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:17.740
of his family background that sooner or later we too will arrive at this

728
00:35:18.711 --> 00:35:20.400
complete equality is,

729
00:35:20.401 --> 00:35:21.740
seems to ask the reader,

730
00:35:21.741 --> 00:35:23.540
do you like what you see?

731
00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.020
Uh,

732
00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:29.020
what I describe what form democracy will take elsewhere will be very much

733
00:35:29.301 --> 00:35:32.600
dependent upon circumstance and statesmanship.

734
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:33.470
Again,

735
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:38.470
his is an attempt to educate a statesman for the future.

736
00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.050
Let me say a few words.

737
00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:48.771
Uh,

738
00:35:48.771 --> 00:35:49.604
and I will

739
00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.120
not finish this today,

740
00:35:53.121 --> 00:35:53.591
but we'll,

741
00:35:53.591 --> 00:35:58.100
we'll take it up to continue this a bit on Wednesday.

742
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

743
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:00.563
<v 0>About what,</v>

744
00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.290
what were the characteristics of American democracy demark?

745
00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.800
What constitutes,

746
00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:07.300
as it were,

747
00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.150
democracy,

748
00:36:08.151 --> 00:36:09.950
American style as,

749
00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:10.970
as Tocqueville?

750
00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:11.631
Uh,

751
00:36:11.631 --> 00:36:12.320
understood.

752
00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.550
Given that again,

753
00:36:13.551 --> 00:36:18.160
democracy has no single determinant farm but is characterized by a,

754
00:36:18.161 --> 00:36:21.890
by a considerable degree of elasticity and openness.

755
00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:27.820
What are the features that cons that are constitutive of American democracy?

756
00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:38.460
Condensing a vast amount of material from especially from value one of

757
00:36:40.121 --> 00:36:40.811
democracy.

758
00:36:40.811 --> 00:36:43.630
There are three features that I want to,

759
00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:44.120
uh,

760
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:44.953
emphasize,

761
00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:45.941
uh,

762
00:36:45.941 --> 00:36:47.750
about the characteristic,

763
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:51.550
the unique characteristics of American democracy that lead to,

764
00:36:51.551 --> 00:36:51.941
again,

765
00:36:51.941 --> 00:36:53.170
making it mild,

766
00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:53.950
gentle,

767
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:56.200
or what we might call a liberal democracy.

768
00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:01.620
These are local government civil associations and what Tocqueville calls the

769
00:37:03.401 --> 00:37:04.600
spirit of religion.

770
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:06.030
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

771
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.910
<v 0>And I want to talk about each of these three in turn out.</v>

772
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:11.160
I'll only probably talk about the first one here.

773
00:37:11.161 --> 00:37:11.520
Local,

774
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.450
local government,

775
00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:17.330
one of the parts of Tocqueville spoke for which he is most famous.

776
00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.210
The first and in many respects,

777
00:37:23.211 --> 00:37:27.500
most fundamental feature of American democracy is the importance that

778
00:37:27.501 --> 00:37:31.400
Tocqueville attributes to local government and local institutions.

779
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:34.040
The importance of localism,

780
00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.560
local democracies and this,

781
00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:40.460
and you might say the spirit that emanates from it is the spirit,

782
00:37:40.461 --> 00:37:42.050
is the key to the whole,

783
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:42.950
uh,

784
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:47.950
the cradle of democracy is to be found in what Tocqueville calls the commune or

785
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.000
what in our translation is called the township,

786
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.250
the township democracy.

787
00:37:55.251 --> 00:37:57.020
It is nonetheless in the township.

788
00:37:57.021 --> 00:38:01.160
He writes that the force of free peoples resides.

789
00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:06.640
The institutions of a township are to freedom what primary schools are to

790
00:38:06.891 --> 00:38:07.724
science.

791
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:11.000
They put it within the reach of the people.

792
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:14.790
Does that sound at all familiar?

793
00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:15.210
I mean,

794
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:16.230
I think it should,

795
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.071
uh,

796
00:38:17.071 --> 00:38:18.180
in some respect,

797
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:22.320
Tocqueville's description of the New England township,

798
00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.280
uh,

799
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.280
put within the reach of all the people clearly demonstrates the influence on

800
00:38:28.411 --> 00:38:33.060
Tocqueville Russo's account of the general will and his social contract,

801
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.810
right.

802
00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:35.770
It is the people organizing,

803
00:38:35.771 --> 00:38:39.520
legislating and deliberating over their common interests.

804
00:38:39.521 --> 00:38:41.590
That is the core of liberty.

805
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.610
Uh,

806
00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:47.610
Tocqueville very much views the American experience of local democracy through

807
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:49.930
the lenses.

808
00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.070
A shaped are crafted by Rousseau and this is hardly fortuitous.

809
00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:56.980
In a famous letter again to his friend Care Galle.

810
00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:02.670
Tocqueville admits that Rousseau was one of three writers with whom he spent

811
00:39:02.861 --> 00:39:04.570
some time every day,

812
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:06.123
every day.

813
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.740
You read Rousseau every day,

814
00:39:08.741 --> 00:39:10.410
the other two Monto,

815
00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.160
skier and Pascal,

816
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:18.120
but it was Russo more than any other figure who again helped him understand the

817
00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:21.410
democratic,

818
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:21.850
uh,

819
00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:25.990
experience and particularly this experience of the township.

820
00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.190
Yet in some ways,

821
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.030
Russo,

822
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:29.850
Tocqueville combines Roussel,

823
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:34.120
his reading of the township has Rusello and reading of the township with a kind

824
00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:35.920
of Aristotelian twist.

825
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.600
The township,

826
00:39:37.601 --> 00:39:38.231
he writes,

827
00:39:38.231 --> 00:39:42.580
he continues in that same passage is the sole association that is so much in

828
00:39:42.581 --> 00:39:43.300
nature.

829
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.920
He says that everywhere men,

830
00:39:44.921 --> 00:39:45.754
our guard,

831
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:46.840
we're everywhere.

832
00:39:46.841 --> 00:39:50.620
Men are gathered at township forms of itself.

833
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.780
That term in nature,

834
00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.690
it is the sole association.

835
00:39:54.691 --> 00:39:59.691
So much in nature should alert you to a kind of [inaudible] in what Rousseau?

836
00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:01.150
Uh,

837
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:02.350
in what Tocqueville is saying.

838
00:40:02.351 --> 00:40:05.410
The township is here said to be a product of nature.

839
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.880
It eludes,

840
00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:09.370
he writes the effort of man.

841
00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:12.640
The township exists by nature,

842
00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:16.210
but it's cause existence is far from being guaranteed.

843
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.850
It is fragile and it is uncertain.

844
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:22.240
It is continually threatened by invasions,

845
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:24.640
not necessarily by foreign powers,

846
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:27.490
but from larger forms of government,

847
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.530
state and federal government.

848
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:30.980
The township is concern,

849
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:35.800
continually threatened by federal and National Authority and Tocqueville ads

850
00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:39.310
with a definite hand of Rousseau that the more enlightened,

851
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:39.431
uh,

852
00:40:39.431 --> 00:40:40.390
people are,

853
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.310
the more enlightened they are,

854
00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.520
the more difficult it is for them to retain the spirit of the township.

855
00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.331
Think of that.

856
00:40:49.331 --> 00:40:51.220
The more enlightened they are,

857
00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:55.210
the township relies on a certain kind of spirit of,

858
00:40:55.211 --> 00:40:56.230
of local,

859
00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:57.070
uh,

860
00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:57.340
uh,

861
00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:00.130
sturdy and steady habits,

862
00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.140
uh,

863
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.270
not necessarily enlightened opinion.

864
00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:05.080
Uh,

865
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.030
that spirit of local freedom,

866
00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:07.871
again,

867
00:41:07.871 --> 00:41:09.520
it goes hand in hand with,

868
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.350
with a kind of Rustic,

869
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.760
even primitive,

870
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:13.210
uh,

871
00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:18.210
manners and customs that clearly Russo would have admired.

872
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.110
And for this reason,

873
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:24.370
he laments that the spirit of the township no longer exists in Europe,

874
00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:24.940
uh,

875
00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:29.830
where the process of political centralization and the progress of enlightenment

876
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:34.940
have virtually destroyed the conditions for local self government.

877
00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.473
<v 2>Uh,</v>

878
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.010
<v 0>I'm going to end on that note and,</v>

879
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.070
and Wednesday we're going to show a little movie again,

880
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:49.220
a little piece from a movie about just a very,

881
00:41:49.221 --> 00:41:50.270
very short clip,

882
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:54.650
which will illustrate the theme of Civil Associations and democracy.

883
00:41:55.310 --> 00:42:00.310
And we'll go on to talk about religion and then some other parts of himself.

884
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:00.831
Well,

885
00:42:00.831 --> 00:42:01.664
welcome back.

886
00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:02.990
It's nice to see you all here.
