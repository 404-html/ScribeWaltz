1
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:02.060
Good.

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.430
Let's,

3
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:02.821
let's do,

4
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:04.380
I want to begin today with,

5
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.263
um,

6
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.720
uh,

7
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.140
fit,

8
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.910
concluding Aristotle part three.

9
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:09.930
Before I do,

10
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.651
however,

11
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:11.970
could I just ask the,

12
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:12.500
uh,

13
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.060
the people?

14
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.500
Yes.

15
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.490
Thank you so much.

16
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:14.661
And,

17
00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:15.510
and your neighbor,

18
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.140
Joe,

19
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.973
would you mind?

20
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.170
Thank you.

21
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.190
Thank you so much.

22
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.053
Uh,

23
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.890
uh,

24
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.000
just out of respect to Mr Aristotle,

25
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.880
it's mister deal.

26
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.610
I want to talk today about Aristotle Aristotles discovery of America.

27
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.740
So probably come as a surprise to some of you that Aristotle discovered America,

28
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.390
but I will get to that in a minute.

29
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.571
In many ways,

30
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:50.490
for Aristotle as it is for every student of politics,

31
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.230
the most serious,

32
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:54.450
the most difficult issue,

33
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.170
uh,

34
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.260
one confront is the problem of faction,

35
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.890
how to control four factions,

36
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:06.891
how to control for a conflict between factions.

37
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:08.214
And that,

38
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.610
uh,

39
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.361
is the,

40
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:09.970
uh,

41
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.200
uh,

42
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.970
issue,

43
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.191
uh,

44
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:11.960
addressed,

45
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.210
uh,

46
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.590
especially in books.

47
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:18.591
Four in five of the politics were Aristotle goes on to describe,

48
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.850
uh,

49
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.290
by the term polity,

50
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.220
uh,

51
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.630
the regime that he believes most successfully controls,

52
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.260
uh,

53
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.390
for the theme of faction.

54
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.470
The essential feature of this regime,

55
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.730
the policy,

56
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.410
which in fact he gives,

57
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.543
uh,

58
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.000
he gives the name polity or the generic,

59
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.340
you might say Greek word for regime.

60
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.390
Uh,

61
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.960
the,

62
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.260
uh,

63
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.260
polity is the regime that represents for Aristotle a mixture of the principles

64
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:54.810
of oligarchy and democracy.

65
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.590
Uh,

66
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.590
and therefore he says avoids dominance by either extreme,

67
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.010
by combining elements as it were of the fuel.

68
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.023
And the many,

69
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.690
uh,

70
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.460
polity is characterized by the dominance of the middle class,

71
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.660
the middle group,

72
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.370
and the middle class he says is able to achieve the confidence of both extreme

73
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:18.204
parties,

74
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.601
uh,

75
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:21.600
where at least it is sufficiently numerous,

76
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.020
uh,

77
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.410
to avoid the problems of class struggle.

78
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.030
And factional conflict with a middling element is great.

79
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.330
Aristotle writes factional conflicts and splits over the nature of regimes occur

80
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.100
least of all.

81
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.880
Uh,

82
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.880
so Aristotle in a way has discovered a long before James Madison's famous

83
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.290
article in federalist number 10,

84
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.080
the remedy for the control and containment,

85
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.130
so to speak,

86
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.450
of faction.

87
00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.130
You remember,

88
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.431
many of you,

89
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.140
if not all of you who have read,

90
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.680
uh,

91
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.460
the first fat,

92
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.460
the 10th federalist paper that Madison outlines his scheme for an extended

93
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:09.611
republic,

94
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:10.151
he says,

95
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:13.150
were numerous factions in many ways,

96
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.760
check and balance one another,

97
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:17.260
compete with one another,

98
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.460
and therefore,

99
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.980
uh,

100
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.980
avoid the dominance of a single faction leading to the kind of tyranny of the

101
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:24.941
majority,

102
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:29.941
the tyranny of a majority class and Aristotle's proposal for a mixture of

103
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.370
oligarchy in democracy.

104
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.860
Sames in many ways to anticipate,

105
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.610
uh,

106
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.680
2000 years before the fact,

107
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.220
uh,

108
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.270
Madison's call for a government where powers must be separated.

109
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.150
And where he says in federalist 51,

110
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.541
uh,

111
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:51.430
ambition must be made to counteract ambition in order to avoid,

112
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.420
in other words,

113
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:56.260
the extremes of both tyranny and civil war.

114
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.520
So the inevitable conclusion that I reach and I believe any sensible a reader of

115
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:04.900
Aristotle would reach,

116
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.700
is that Aristotle in fact discovered the American constitution.

117
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.780
And we have 1500 or 2000 years before it was written.

118
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:16.450
This may seem surprising to you since of course,

119
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:18.490
Aristotle lived long before,

120
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:22.180
but that may simply be our own prejudice to think that,

121
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.140
uh,

122
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.260
my friend at the Cuny Graduate Center,

123
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:27.700
Peter Simpson,

124
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.850
has argued in a paper that I found quite convincing that Aristotle had in fact

125
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.920
discovered the American constitution.

126
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:36.401
And in fact,

127
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:36.771
I say it,

128
00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:38.860
it may simply be our prejudice that he didn't.

129
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.150
Aristotle writes,

130
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.080
um,

131
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.080
in book two of the politics that the world is eternal in everything in it has

132
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:47.800
been discovered,

133
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.820
uh,

134
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.650
in other the earth experiences.

135
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:55.651
He says certain periodic destructions and cataclysms civilizations are reduced

136
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:59.200
to barbarism only to recover and grow again.

137
00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.720
Uh,

138
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.900
if this theory you might say,

139
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:05.140
of sort of cataclysmic change is true,

140
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.290
we cannot rule out the possibility that a constitution like hours or even

141
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:15.100
identical to ours existed at some point in the ancient past,

142
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.550
uh,

143
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.340
in the far distant past that Aristotle knew about.

144
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.830
You think that's possible?

145
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.910
Well,

146
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.743
why not?

147
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.130
But Aristotle's mixed constitution differs from ours still in certain important

148
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.013
respect.

149
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.260
Aristotle understands the mixed constitution as a balance of classes.

150
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.731
The one,

151
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:40.720
the few and the many.

152
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.540
He doesn't sell much.

153
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:48.541
Insist as you will see in your reading on the actual separation of functions of

154
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:52.540
government putting them into separate hands.

155
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:53.560
It is enough for him.

156
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:58.561
He says if each class shares in some aspect of the governing power,

157
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.280
but that leads to a further difference.

158
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.930
Uh,

159
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.700
we tend to think of the separation of powers doctrine as necessary for the

160
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:13.610
security and liberty of the individual.

161
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.391
Don't,

162
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:15.170
don't we,

163
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:20.170
we usually think of individual freedom and security as the purpose of the

164
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.740
separation of power.

165
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:26.741
It is when political functions become concentrated into the hands of again,

166
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.430
too few hands,

167
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.220
uh,

168
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.220
that we risk arbitrary government and the endangerment to the liberty of the

169
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:35.354
individual.

170
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.670
But for Aristotle,

171
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.520
it is not the liberty of the individual.

172
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.610
So much is the functioning or functional wellbeing of the city that has the

173
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:48.410
highest priority.

174
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.340
Individual freedom may be at best,

175
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.630
a desirable biproduct of the Aristotelian mixed regime,

176
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.030
but individual freedom is not.

177
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:01.700
It's defining or principal goal.

178
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.370
And for anyone interested in this difference,

179
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.770
I suggest you contrast or compare Aristotle's account of mixed government,

180
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.420
uh,

181
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.850
to book 11 of Montesquieu Skews,

182
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:15.080
spirit of the laws,

183
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.350
or to some of the central federalists papers to see the way in which Mr

184
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:22.670
Aristotle revised.

185
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.210
Uh,

186
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.880
in some ways the wisdom of Madison.

187
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.660
And you could compare them in some way that I think would be valuable,

188
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.510
but not only did Madison or excuse me,

189
00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:37.511
not only did Aristotle understand the importance of the separation of powers

190
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:40.040
doctrine and the kind of balance of,

191
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:40.491
uh,

192
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:40.791
of,

193
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:41.624
of,

194
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.410
uh,

195
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:47.210
factions of as it's a way of controlling conflict and struggle,

196
00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:52.211
but he also understood the importance of property and private property in

197
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:55.940
commerce for a flourishing republic.

198
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.340
We didn't really pause,

199
00:07:58.341 --> 00:07:59.570
just talk much about this,

200
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:00.560
but in book two,

201
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.431
you remember,

202
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:03.920
he criticizes at considerable length,

203
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.060
Plato's republic for the excessive unity,

204
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.410
uh,

205
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.010
demands of its citizens.

206
00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:11.390
And Socrates is,

207
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.140
uh,

208
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.200
demands for common ownership of property,

209
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:15.630
uh,

210
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:16.490
at least among,

211
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:16.850
uh,

212
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.350
the auxiliary class.

213
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.190
But Aristotle claimed that the city is not naturally one.

214
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.700
That is to say a certain diversity,

215
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:26.780
uh,

216
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.140
is necessary to make up a,

217
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.750
a city where all property is held in common.

218
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:37.250
It is more likely to suffer from common neglect,

219
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.270
uh,

220
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.140
than it is,

221
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:39.620
uh,

222
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.250
from,

223
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:40.430
uh,

224
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:41.040
common,

225
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:41.600
uh,

226
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.433
ownership.

227
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.160
And he clearly understands in many ways the virtues of private property and of

228
00:08:48.381 --> 00:08:48.951
commerce.

229
00:08:48.951 --> 00:08:49.641
It is evident,

230
00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:50.420
he says,

231
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.620
Aristotle writes that as it becomes increasingly one,

232
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.000
as it becomes increasingly unified,

233
00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.200
it the city,

234
00:08:58.201 --> 00:08:59.640
it will no longer be a city,

235
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.030
but the city is in its nature a multitude.

236
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.160
And as it becomes more of a unity,

237
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:10.430
it will be like a household instead of a polis and a human being instead of a

238
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:11.454
household.

239
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.850
So there we see in book two Aristotle offering his criticism of the claims for

240
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:18.690
the sort of excessive,

241
00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:19.320
uh,

242
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.320
a unification of a centralization concentration of property.

243
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.873
Uh,

244
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.960
and yet despite his,

245
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.590
uh,

246
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.590
awareness of the importance of commerce and the importance of property,

247
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:35.040
the aim of the city,

248
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:36.900
he tells us is not wealth,

249
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.050
is not the production of wealth.

250
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:41.491
In that way,

251
00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:46.491
it would be useful to make a contrast between Aristotle and someone like Adam

252
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.120
Smith.

253
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.650
Uh,

254
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.950
the great law author of the wealth of nations.

255
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.443
Uh,

256
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.110
if wealth were the purpose of politics,

257
00:09:55.111 --> 00:09:57.180
Aristotle writes the Phoenicians,

258
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:57.801
uh,

259
00:09:57.801 --> 00:09:59.400
you might say in the ancient world,

260
00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:02.220
the Phoenicians where the commercial people,

261
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:02.820
uh,

262
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.180
par exsalonce the Phoenicians would be the best regime,

263
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.810
but he denies that Aristotle could,

264
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:11.790
could never endorse the view,

265
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.390
uh,

266
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.310
stated by a,

267
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.550
by a famous American president that the business of America is business.

268
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:18.960
Uh,

269
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.760
the political partnership he says,

270
00:10:20.761 --> 00:10:25.761
must be regarded for the sake of noble act performed well.

271
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.380
Wealth property he tells us exists for the sake of virtue,

272
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.290
not virtue for the sake of wealth.

273
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.203
<v 1>Okay.</v>

274
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.940
<v 0>And just as Aristotle would have been critical of the American tendency to</v>

275
00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:42.140
regard guard government,

276
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.041
uh,

277
00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:46.670
as for the sake of business or for the sake of the economy.

278
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:52.690
He also criticized beforehand the American tendency to organize into clubs,

279
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.200
uh,

280
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.150
what we call political parties,

281
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:01.010
which exacerbate rather than control political conflict,

282
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.400
these political clubs or parties use their influence to incense,

283
00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:12.401
the populace using their power to whip up dangerous passions that tend to make

284
00:11:13.461 --> 00:11:17.480
American politicians closer to demagogues than to statesman.

285
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.510
He would also regard the peculiar American practice of elections,

286
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:24.380
uh,

287
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.380
read it and the Greek practice of appointing political offices by lot you would

288
00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:34.481
regard elections is merely exacerbating the tendency to demagoguery where each

289
00:11:34.881 --> 00:11:39.110
person seeking office plays shamelessly to the mob,

290
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:44.380
promising all manner of things that they know they will not and cannot deliver.

291
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.253
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

292
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.080
<v 0>I think of almost anybody you like.</v>

293
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.871
And furthermore,

294
00:11:52.871 --> 00:11:53.740
by the regime,

295
00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.010
the American regime in many ways is in principle open to all and prides itself

296
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.570
on a belief in equality.

297
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.681
No doubt.

298
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:07.681
Aristotle would re remark that it's offices are in fact open only to the rich

299
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.910
and to leaders who can acquire the support of the rich,

300
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:18.130
making it rather an oligarchy in the guise of a republic.

301
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:24.030
So Aristotle was not without his own critique of the American constitution.

302
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:24.940
Uh,

303
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:25.270
and,

304
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.160
and American political culture.

305
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.040
There is obviously much,

306
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:30.760
uh,

307
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.120
in the American regime that Aristotle would have found admirable,

308
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:39.570
even though it does not conform to his idea of the best regime,

309
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:45.660
which is the subject of the last two books of the politics book seven and eight.

310
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.160
Aristotle is very sketchy here,

311
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.383
uh,

312
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:50.860
about the structure,

313
00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:52.450
the institutional structure,

314
00:12:52.451 --> 00:12:54.910
the makeup of the best regime,

315
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.190
acknowledging it is the one,

316
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:02.220
the best regime is one where the best men rule that is to say it an it is a kind

317
00:13:03.071 --> 00:13:04.240
of aristocracy,

318
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.760
a or an aristocratic republic.

319
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.730
And I want to talk about this regime,

320
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:10.190
uh,

321
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.200
a little bit now.

322
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.280
What Aristotle understands to be the requirements or the fulfillments,

323
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:16.270
the necessities,

324
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.810
a of this aristocratic republic.

325
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.800
In these parts of the politics,

326
00:13:23.801 --> 00:13:28.801
Aristotle offers a serious challenge to existing Greek traditions and patterns

327
00:13:31.451 --> 00:13:33.010
of political education.

328
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:37.390
Every bit in many ways is far reaching is Plato's republic.

329
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:39.521
In the first place,

330
00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:42.910
he tells us the purpose of the best regime.

331
00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:47.680
The purpose of Aristotle's republic is directed not to war,

332
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.930
but in fact to piece the citizen of the best regime.

333
00:13:52.931 --> 00:13:53.321
He says,

334
00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:57.430
must be able to sustain war if duty requires,

335
00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.660
but only for the sake of peace and leisure.

336
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:04.771
Again,

337
00:14:04.771 --> 00:14:07.060
a critique not only of Sparta,

338
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.160
but also of Athens,

339
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.950
and it's imperialistic ambitions.

340
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:13.990
And second,

341
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.630
Aristotle understands the purpose of leisure.

342
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.380
When he says the PR,

343
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.220
the end of the regime is paced and the purpose of pieces,

344
00:14:21.221 --> 00:14:24.550
leisure he doesn't understand by leisure,

345
00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:26.440
simply relaxation.

346
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:27.220
Uh,

347
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.430
enjoy enjoying your private moments,

348
00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:32.290
enjoying your vacation time.

349
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:33.820
Rest does not.

350
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.700
Leisure does not simply mean rest or inactivity,

351
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:42.180
but leisure is necessary for education or what he sometimes calls by the term

352
00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:43.324
philosophy.

353
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:45.880
And by philosophy,

354
00:14:45.881 --> 00:14:50.860
he seems to suggest not so much the capacity for abstract or speculative,

355
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:56.770
but rather a kind of liberal education that he regards to be the preserve of

356
00:14:58.101 --> 00:15:03.101
what he calls by the term the Mongarlowe coasts.

357
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.840
Literally the great soul person with a great soul man.

358
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.580
Mega Margallo being,

359
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:13.881
you know,

360
00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:18.560
our term for great and sue costs related.

361
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:19.670
I would psyche,

362
00:15:19.671 --> 00:15:20.120
salt,

363
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:20.691
soul,

364
00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:21.524
psyche,

365
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.450
the great soul person,

366
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.580
the great sold man.

367
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.390
The gentleman is in many ways before Aristotle,

368
00:15:29.391 --> 00:15:34.100
the ideal recipient of this form of education,

369
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.540
of liberal education.

370
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.720
And also in some respects the ideal or perfect audience or readership of the

371
00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:42.500
book itself.

372
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.720
And we can see here,

373
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:49.790
we can begin to see it is clear how Aristotle's best regime differs from Plato's

374
00:15:51.111 --> 00:15:54.020
intransigent demand for the rule of philosopher,

375
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:54.854
kings

376
00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:57.760
mcgallows to coast,

377
00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:58.460
the gentlemen,

378
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.440
whatever else he is is not,

379
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.930
it's not a philosopher in the strict sense.

380
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.150
Uh,

381
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:10.150
sociologically Aristotle makes clear that a [inaudible] unlike the philosopher,

382
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.080
is a person of some inherited wealth,

383
00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:16.130
uh,

384
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.840
chiefly landed property,

385
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.840
but whose way of life will be urban.

386
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.460
He will be a member of what we might call the Urban Patricia.

387
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.940
And in the Nikah McCain ethics,

388
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.840
Aristotle provides us with a vivid list of the psychological and even physical

389
00:16:36.801 --> 00:16:40.220
characteristics that such a person must possess.

390
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.200
This Magalia BSEE coasts,

391
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.431
such a person,

392
00:16:43.431 --> 00:16:48.431
he says exhibits I sort of lofty detachment to the more or less petty things

393
00:16:50.331 --> 00:16:51.860
that we most of us down.

394
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.770
<v 1>Okay?</v>

395
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:58.770
<v 0>Aristotle tells us he is slow to act unless something of great importance is at</v>

396
00:16:59.261 --> 00:17:00.094
stake.

397
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.640
<v 1>Okay?</v>

398
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.640
<v 0>He repays favor with interest so as not to be under any obligations to others.</v>

399
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:10.491
The gentleman,

400
00:17:10.491 --> 00:17:15.491
he says speaks his mind without fear or favor somewhat like the New York Times,

401
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.270
because to dissemble would be beneath him.

402
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.730
He may occasionally hurt others,

403
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.050
but this is not done out of deliberate cruelty.

404
00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:31.420
And in addition,

405
00:17:31.421 --> 00:17:36.421
Aristotle tells us such a person will possess beautiful but useless things

406
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.940
suggesting the possession not only of wealth,

407
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:43.810
but of a kind of cultivated aesthetic sense

408
00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.520
as if that weren't enough.

409
00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:53.450
Aristotle us that the [inaudible] gallops Yukos walk slowly because to hurry is

410
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:55.260
undignified,

411
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:56.910
is tall,

412
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.310
and speaks with a deep voice,

413
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.910
very clear about who,

414
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:08.451
uh,

415
00:18:08.451 --> 00:18:08.901
again,

416
00:18:08.901 --> 00:18:12.380
the ideal statesmen or reader,

417
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:12.740
uh,

418
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:16.460
potential statesman of a reader of this book would be.

419
00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.950
But most importantly,

420
00:18:18.951 --> 00:18:19.461
you might say,

421
00:18:19.461 --> 00:18:24.461
what distinguishes the gentleman as a class from the philosophers is a certain

422
00:18:26.181 --> 00:18:29.180
kind of knowledge or practical intelligence.

423
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.900
The gentleman may lack the speculative intelligence of a Socrates,

424
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:41.750
but he will possess that quality of practical rationality,

425
00:18:41.751 --> 00:18:46.751
of practical judgment necessary for the administration of affairs.

426
00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.650
Aristotle calls this kind of knowledge,

427
00:18:51.651 --> 00:18:54.050
this kind of practical judgment.

428
00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:59.410
He calls it by the term for nieces that I have on the blackboard and the person

429
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:04.010
who possesses it is the front of most,

430
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.070
a person of practical judgment.

431
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:07.871
Uh,

432
00:19:07.871 --> 00:19:08.271
again,

433
00:19:08.271 --> 00:19:13.271
a term that captures something of our meaning of common sense,

434
00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.740
practical wisdom,

435
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.950
the capacity for judging

436
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.520
the capacity for judgment,

437
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.010
which is not the same thing,

438
00:19:25.011 --> 00:19:29.000
obviously is speculative or philosophic intelligence.

439
00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:34.001
The thrown of most is the person who is able to grasp the fitting or the

440
00:19:35.301 --> 00:19:36.134
appropriate,

441
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:41.810
the appropriate thing to do out of the complex arrangements that make up any

442
00:19:41.811 --> 00:19:46.811
situation and above all such a person embodies that special quality of insight

443
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:54.310
and discrimination that distinguishes him or her from people.

444
00:19:54.561 --> 00:19:59.450
Again of more theoretical or speculative cast of mind.

445
00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:05.720
How is this quality of for nieces of judgment,

446
00:20:05.721 --> 00:20:08.750
of practical wisdom of horse sense?

447
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.270
How was it acquired?

448
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:19.520
Aristotle tells us that this kind of knowledge is appropriate,

449
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.180
is a kind of knowledge most appropriate to politics.

450
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.770
Again,

451
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.870
it is neither and he's clear about,

452
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.430
he wants to be clear about this.

453
00:20:29.431 --> 00:20:34.431
It is neither the theoretic knowledge and simply an abstract truth,

454
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.120
nor is it the productive knowledge.

455
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:45.140
What he calls tech the productive knowledge used in the manufacture of use for

456
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:47.340
artifacts.

457
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.220
What is it then?

458
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:54.660
It is a knowledge of how to act with the purpose of action is acting well.

459
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.840
You might say it is less a body of true propositions.

460
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.330
Then a shrewd sense of knowhow or political savvy.

461
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:14.770
It's kind of knowledge entails judgment and deliberation.

462
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.210
The deliberative skill or the deliberative art.

463
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.460
We only deliberate.

464
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.780
Aristotle says over things where there is some choice,

465
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:26.980
uh,

466
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.980
we deliberate with an eye to preservation or change to making something better

467
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.010
or to preserve it from becoming worse.

468
00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:41.011
This kind of knowledge will be the arch or craft of the statesman concerned

469
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:46.450
above all with what to do in a specific situation.

470
00:21:46.451 --> 00:21:49.240
It is the skill possessed by the greatest statesman,

471
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:50.111
you might say,

472
00:21:50.111 --> 00:21:54.220
the fathers of the constitutions as it were,

473
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:59.221
who create the permanent framework in which allows later in Leicester figures to

474
00:22:00.671 --> 00:22:02.740
handle a change.

475
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:07.540
This is the kind of political skill and wisdom,

476
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:08.231
again,

477
00:22:08.231 --> 00:22:11.800
possessed of the founders of cities.

478
00:22:11.801 --> 00:22:12.100
The,

479
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.960
the legislative founders of,

480
00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:14.380
of,

481
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:19.380
of regimes in Aristotle's politics is a book about the kind of knowledge

482
00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.260
requisite for those con,

483
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:24.850
that kind of skill.

484
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:30.820
This quality of practical judgment for nieces.

485
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.800
Practical Wisdom,

486
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:34.060
uh,

487
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:34.930
was developed,

488
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.520
I think in a beautiful essay,

489
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.180
uh,

490
00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:42.180
without any explicit reference to Aristotle by the English political

491
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:43.001
philosopher,

492
00:22:43.001 --> 00:22:43.930
Isaiah Berlin.

493
00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.350
Anyone here ever heard of Isaiah Berlin?

494
00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:54.330
Not One of your famous famous English philosopher died a number of years ago in

495
00:22:55.061 --> 00:22:55.990
the late nineties.

496
00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:57.250
Uh,

497
00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.083
okay.

498
00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.260
But that's,

499
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:00.130
this will,

500
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.550
this I hope will be an inspiration to you should read Isaiah Berlin.

501
00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:04.751
In any case,

502
00:23:04.751 --> 00:23:08.430
he wrote a wonderful essay called political judgment.

503
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:10.750
Uh,

504
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.100
and in it he asks,

505
00:23:12.101 --> 00:23:17.101
what is the intellectual quality that successful statesmen possess that

506
00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:22.390
distinguishes them from all other,

507
00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:27.490
the distinguishes their knowledge from all other forms of rationality and

508
00:23:27.491 --> 00:23:27.971
knowledge.

509
00:23:27.971 --> 00:23:30.660
And he writes as follows on a quote him,

510
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.320
the quality that I am attempting to describe Berlin rights is that special

511
00:23:37.511 --> 00:23:39.250
understanding of public life,

512
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.290
which successful statesmen have,

513
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.630
whether they are wicked or virtuous,

514
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.070
which Bismarck had,

515
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.270
or tail around,

516
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.130
or Franklin Roosevelt,

517
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:50.511
or for that matter,

518
00:23:50.511 --> 00:23:52.670
men such as Cavour or Disraeli,

519
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:57.700
Gladstone or Ataturk in common with the great psychological novelists and

520
00:23:58.521 --> 00:24:03.521
something which is conspicuously lacking in men have more purely theoretical

521
00:24:03.621 --> 00:24:08.621
genius such as Newton or Einstein or Bertrand Russell or even Freud.

522
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:11.090
So there too,

523
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.160
like Aristotle,

524
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:17.960
he distinguishes a kind of practical skill possessed by the greatest minds,

525
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:19.310
political minds at least,

526
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:25.030
and says it's quite different in and from what he calls the great psychological

527
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:31.121
novelist from that possessed of the greatest philosophers and scientists.

528
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.220
What are we to call this capacity?

529
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.300
Uh,

530
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.960
Berlin continues and he writes again as follows,

531
00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:43.610
practical reason perhaps you said as a sense of what will work and what will

532
00:24:43.611 --> 00:24:44.444
not.

533
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:50.230
It is a capacity for synthesis rather than analysis for knowledge in the sense

534
00:24:51.231 --> 00:24:54.170
in which trainers know their animals or parents,

535
00:24:54.171 --> 00:24:56.330
their children or conductors,

536
00:24:56.331 --> 00:25:01.331
they're orchestras as opposed to that in which chemists know the contents of

537
00:25:02.031 --> 00:25:05.480
their test tubes or mathematicians know the rules,

538
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.170
they're symbols obey those who lack.

539
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.390
He says this quality of practical wisdom,

540
00:25:11.391 --> 00:25:13.520
whatever other qualities they may possess,

541
00:25:13.521 --> 00:25:16.160
no matter how clever it imaginative,

542
00:25:16.161 --> 00:25:16.521
kind,

543
00:25:16.521 --> 00:25:16.911
noble,

544
00:25:16.911 --> 00:25:17.744
attractive,

545
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.420
gifted in other ways they may be,

546
00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.350
are correctly regarded as politically inept.

547
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:31.210
So they're Berlin tells us something about the character of this political

548
00:25:32.301 --> 00:25:35.030
knowledge that Aristotle described is furnished us.

549
00:25:35.031 --> 00:25:35.481
But again,

550
00:25:35.481 --> 00:25:39.170
how is this knowledge acquired or are we just born with it?

551
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:44.990
Do some people just have it or is it a product of experience?

552
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.740
Aristotle doesn't say,

553
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.310
uh,

554
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:52.340
but I think the answer is clearly some of both.

555
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.600
It is a quality as I agree with Berlin possessed by some of the great

556
00:25:59.151 --> 00:26:00.800
psychological novelists.

557
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:06.640
I mentioned the names of Tolstoy and read James and perhaps the greatest of all

558
00:26:07.881 --> 00:26:08.750
Jane Austin,

559
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.820
if you want to know or novelist who employs this great,

560
00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:14.853
uh,

561
00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.630
skill of judgement,

562
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.120
discrimination and practical reason,

563
00:26:20.121 --> 00:26:23.060
but it is also a virtue of great statesman.

564
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.340
Principally Berlin mentions Bismarck,

565
00:26:25.341 --> 00:26:27.920
Disraeli Franklin Roosevelt.

566
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.810
I would also add the names of Paraclese.

567
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.720
Lincoln and Churchill read their works,

568
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:37.850
study their histories.

569
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:43.480
They provide a virtual education in state craft and how to negotiate a fares in

570
00:26:45.601 --> 00:26:49.290
precisely the way Aristotle would have us do.

571
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.880
And that leads me to the larger question you might say,

572
00:26:55.891 --> 00:27:00.300
which is post throughout the work is all Aristotle's work as a whole.

573
00:27:00.301 --> 00:27:03.150
What is Aristotle's political science?

574
00:27:03.151 --> 00:27:04.170
What is it for?

575
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:06.840
What is he attempting to do

576
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:13.490
already you could say to ask this question is to stake a claim.

577
00:27:14.041 --> 00:27:16.860
Does Aristotle have a political science?

578
00:27:16.861 --> 00:27:18.360
Is Science of politics?

579
00:27:18.361 --> 00:27:19.020
And again,

580
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:19.441
if so,

581
00:27:19.441 --> 00:27:20.460
what is it about

582
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:24.390
to begin to answer this question?

583
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:29.670
You might say even begin to think about it in the right way requires that we

584
00:27:29.671 --> 00:27:34.671
stand back from Aristotle's texts for a while and ask some fundamental questions

585
00:27:34.981 --> 00:27:35.814
about it.

586
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.820
What does Aristotle mean by the political?

587
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.920
What is the goal or purpose of the study of politics and what is distinctive

588
00:27:43.921 --> 00:27:47.280
about Aristotle's approach to the study of political things?

589
00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:50.883
<v 1>Okay.</v>

590
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:57.270
<v 0>Today the term political science stands for one among,</v>

591
00:27:57.271 --> 00:27:57.480
uh,

592
00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:02.310
among a number of different disciplines that we call collectively to social

593
00:28:02.311 --> 00:28:03.144
sciences.

594
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.450
This not only includes political science,

595
00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:08.610
but you can now mix sociology,

596
00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:09.720
anthropology,

597
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.940
psychology among others.

598
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.960
Each of these disciplines seeks to give us a handle on a distinctive set of

599
00:28:18.211 --> 00:28:20.940
human actions and interactions.

600
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.860
Economics deals with the transactions involving the production and distribution

601
00:28:25.861 --> 00:28:26.694
of wealth,

602
00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:32.390
sociology with transaction governing status and class anthropology with the

603
00:28:33.331 --> 00:28:35.580
domain of culture and so on.

604
00:28:35.581 --> 00:28:40.581
What is it that political science studies and what is it relation to the other

605
00:28:41.071 --> 00:28:41.904
disciplines.

606
00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:44.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

607
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:47.030
<v 0>The car of political science,</v>

608
00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.520
at least according to Aristotle,

609
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.170
into this degree,

610
00:28:51.171 --> 00:28:51.650
I,

611
00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:53.330
I'm very much an Aristotelian.

612
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:59.410
What distinguishes from our other studies is the concept of the regime of the

613
00:28:59.631 --> 00:29:04.631
polity or the regime for him is not one branch of human activity.

614
00:29:05.511 --> 00:29:06.380
Among others,

615
00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.860
it is the fundamental principle or ordering principle that makes all the others

616
00:29:12.051 --> 00:29:13.010
even possible.

617
00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:19.060
This is why Aristotle does not regard the study of politics is one social

618
00:29:19.061 --> 00:29:19.571
science.

619
00:29:19.571 --> 00:29:20.440
Among others,

620
00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:26.370
it is rather what he calls the master science that determines the rank and place

621
00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.510
of all the others within the polity is study of the regime.

622
00:29:31.511 --> 00:29:35.620
That is to see the underlying constitutional principles that govern each order

623
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:41.070
is what distinguishes Aristotle's from from the other social sciences.

624
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:46.090
So when you came into this class in the beginning of the semester,

625
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.890
you may have thought you were just signing up for a class in political science

626
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:56.520
who did not know perhaps that you were coming in to study what he calls the

627
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:57.783
Masters Science,

628
00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.560
the science of Sciences.

629
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:01.060
In some respects,

630
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:07.000
it is that priority that Aristotle attributes to the regime did I think is what

631
00:30:07.001 --> 00:30:10.660
distinguishes his kind of political science from that of today.

632
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.241
Today,

633
00:30:13.241 --> 00:30:16.300
you might say political scientists and social scientists,

634
00:30:16.301 --> 00:30:21.301
they're more modest in describing priority to any particular branch of knowledge

635
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:26.740
with I should say the possible exception of the economists who often will

636
00:30:26.741 --> 00:30:30.280
believe that economic motives and transactions provide the,

637
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:34.360
provide the key to all possible human behaviors.

638
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:36.431
Who knows,

639
00:30:36.431 --> 00:30:37.300
maybe they're right,

640
00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.220
but Aristotle would deny it.

641
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.350
For Aristotle.

642
00:30:41.351 --> 00:30:41.771
However,

643
00:30:41.771 --> 00:30:46.771
politics has a priority to all the others because as he has argued,

644
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.170
man is the political animal.

645
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:56.520
To be a political animal means first possess speech or reason that allows us to

646
00:30:57.821 --> 00:31:02.800
participate in a community or a way of life governed by shared standards of

647
00:31:02.801 --> 00:31:04.720
justice and injustice.

648
00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.820
Aristotle's political science presupposes and are there were just certain

649
00:31:09.821 --> 00:31:14.821
conception of human beings is linguistic animals who are capable not only of

650
00:31:15.101 --> 00:31:16.060
living together,

651
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.820
so do a range of other species,

652
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.330
but rather sharing in the arrangements of rule.

653
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:28.690
It is our logos are reason that makes a community possible and also expresses or

654
00:31:29.831 --> 00:31:30.610
create,

655
00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:35.610
you could say a certain latitude or indeterminacy in how our behavior,

656
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:38.500
uh,

657
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.470
distinguishes us from other species.

658
00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:44.980
It is precisely.

659
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:50.080
He believes this latitude that makes political communities not only sites of

660
00:31:50.081 --> 00:31:53.050
agreement over shared standards,

661
00:31:53.051 --> 00:31:53.771
but also was,

662
00:31:53.771 --> 00:31:54.370
he says,

663
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:59.230
sites of moral contestation over justice and injustice.

664
00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:04.210
Politics is about conflict and conflict's over justice.

665
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:10.170
To be a political animal for him is to engage or to be engaged in this ongoing

666
00:32:10.901 --> 00:32:15.880
conversation and debate over the very nature of justice.

667
00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:19.990
To refuse to participate in that conversation.

668
00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.840
To declare oneself an outsider to it,

669
00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:27.520
he says is either to be below humanity or above it.

670
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.870
To be human is to be part of that conversation.

671
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:36.543
<v 1>Okay,</v>

672
00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:42.540
<v 0>so does [inaudible] Aristotle ascribes to politics forces us to consider another</v>

673
00:32:43.551 --> 00:32:44.384
question.

674
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:45.561
Namely,

675
00:32:45.561 --> 00:32:48.080
what is the purpose of this study?

676
00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.150
Why do we engage in it?

677
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:53.600
At first glance,

678
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:56.270
this seems to be overwhelmingly obvious to,

679
00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.470
to gain knowledge,

680
00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.060
to gain more knowledge,

681
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.450
but knowledge of what and for what.

682
00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.850
Most people today are attracted to the study of politics because they are

683
00:33:07.851 --> 00:33:12.851
interested in things they've read about in newspapers or seen on TV,

684
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:15.110
things like elections,

685
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.940
political leaders in parties,

686
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:20.840
different causes to which they may feel some attraction,

687
00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:22.010
uh,

688
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:23.270
interested in wars.

689
00:33:23.271 --> 00:33:26.000
And revolutions that they see or have heard about.

690
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:30.500
And it is to learn more about these things that we come to.

691
00:33:30.501 --> 00:33:31.790
This study of politics.

692
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:32.391
This is true.

693
00:33:32.391 --> 00:33:37.391
It's true now is it was in the time of Aristotle and Aristotle certainly

694
00:33:38.151 --> 00:33:42.170
recognize that the accumulation of political knowledge,

695
00:33:42.171 --> 00:33:44.060
you might say the gathering of data,

696
00:33:44.061 --> 00:33:47.510
the Organization of facts is very important.

697
00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:48.500
Books three,

698
00:33:48.501 --> 00:33:48.890
four,

699
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:53.890
five of the politics shows the empirical side of Aristotle's politics.

700
00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:55.401
But again,

701
00:33:55.401 --> 00:33:56.960
let me just pose the question,

702
00:33:56.961 --> 00:33:58.370
what is this knowledge for?

703
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.360
What does Aristotle intend to do with it or want us to do with it?

704
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:05.511
Politics,

705
00:34:05.511 --> 00:34:06.500
political science,

706
00:34:06.501 --> 00:34:08.210
he tells us in the ethics,

707
00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:09.681
again,

708
00:34:09.681 --> 00:34:14.330
it's not a theoretical subject in the matter of physics or metaphysics or

709
00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.530
mathematics.

710
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.150
There is to say it's purpose is not knowledge for its own sake.

711
00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:22.410
Uh,

712
00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:24.710
however important to study of politics may be.

713
00:34:24.711 --> 00:34:27.080
It exists not for the sake of knowledge,

714
00:34:27.081 --> 00:34:32.081
but for action as he tells us for Praxis is his word for action.

715
00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:37.130
Political science exists for the sake of the human good.

716
00:34:37.131 --> 00:34:40.220
And the opening sentence of the politics confirms this.

717
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.331
He says,

718
00:34:41.331 --> 00:34:42.164
we see,

719
00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:43.010
uh,

720
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.790
everyone does everything for the sake of some apparent good.

721
00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:52.780
All action or human behavior is aimed at achieving some type of good is are

722
00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:56.390
aimed,

723
00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:57.560
aimed at action

724
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:02.660
or political action aims at preservation or change.

725
00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:03.471
When we act,

726
00:35:03.471 --> 00:35:08.471
we seek to preserve or to change our political action,

727
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.170
you might say is guided by the idea of better or worse.

728
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.380
It implies a standard or better and worse.

729
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:20.270
And this implies some idea of the good by which we judge.

730
00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.880
So it follows,

731
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.800
at least Aristotle believes so that the study of politics is not again for the

732
00:35:27.801 --> 00:35:30.500
sake of knowledge for its own sake,

733
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:35.990
but knowledge that serves the regime there helps to make it better or prevent it

734
00:35:35.991 --> 00:35:37.070
from becoming worse.

735
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.330
It's goal is not just to know more,

736
00:35:39.331 --> 00:35:40.560
but to know how,

737
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:46.550
and this requires not only theoretic acumen but political judgment and a kind of

738
00:35:47.821 --> 00:35:52.320
practical knowledge that Aristotle discusses at length.

739
00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:00.500
This quality of practical judgment and reflection is against somehow unique to

740
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:04.500
the political arch or the political skill.

741
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:10.190
Aristotle tells us it is the ability not only to keep the ship of state afloat,

742
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.610
but allows the greatest statesmen to guide the ship,

743
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.160
to steer it safely to port.

744
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:21.390
That is to say the kind of knowledge needed by the statesmen

745
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:28.370
and Aristotle's political science then is ultimately the supreme science of

746
00:36:29.281 --> 00:36:30.420
state craft.

747
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:32.790
A term that again,

748
00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:37.791
we don't hear much about craft or statesman ship.

749
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:45.050
It's regarded perhaps by today's political science is to value Laden to uh,

750
00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:47.190
to uh,

751
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:50.990
subjective to speak of statesmanship or statecraft.

752
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:52.800
And this too,

753
00:36:52.801 --> 00:36:53.161
again,

754
00:36:53.161 --> 00:36:56.970
it's a word that carries distinctive and strong connotations.

755
00:36:56.971 --> 00:37:01.560
Who was a statesman and what are the attributes of the Statesman?

756
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:06.590
I've spoken a little about the attributes that Aristotle believes are central to

757
00:37:07.141 --> 00:37:07.590
the state,

758
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.200
to the McGall ups you coast,

759
00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.280
the greatest of the Statesman.

760
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.660
This will be quite different.

761
00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:13.770
For example,

762
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:18.000
from the qualities we will see beginning on Friday and next week that

763
00:37:18.001 --> 00:37:23.001
Machiavelli and later Hobbes or Locke believe are necessary for the great

764
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:26.460
founders or statesman.

765
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.150
Plato and Aristotle give their own visions.

766
00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:31.291
The philosopher,

767
00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:32.124
king,

768
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:33.030
uh,

769
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:35.490
the great soul man or medical ops two coasts.

770
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:41.400
But the statesmen again is the founder to the highest degree is the founder of

771
00:37:41.401 --> 00:37:42.121
regimes,

772
00:37:42.121 --> 00:37:43.710
laws and institutions.

773
00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:50.240
They provide the constitutional framework within which we later figures,

774
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:52.530
uh,

775
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:53.363
operate.

776
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.400
So of Aristotle's state.

777
00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.970
Political science is an education for statesmanship.

778
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.411
You might say,

779
00:38:01.411 --> 00:38:02.700
what are its methods?

780
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.040
What are its distinctive methods?

781
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:08.430
How do we educate a statesman?

782
00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:11.610
How do we educate potential statesman?

783
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.250
This is a question,

784
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:15.700
what does it,

785
00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:16.560
what are its methods?

786
00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:17.910
This is a question asked,

787
00:38:17.911 --> 00:38:18.390
you might say,

788
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:20.130
of every mature science.

789
00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:20.964
It is a,

790
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:26.180
it is possession of a method that distinguishes a mature science from simply a

791
00:38:26.551 --> 00:38:27.900
jumble of facts,

792
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:28.890
hearsay,

793
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.570
inspired guesses,

794
00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:35.810
or a random collection of insights and observations without a distinctive method

795
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.530
for obtaining and organizing knowledge.

796
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.200
We are are just groping in the dark.

797
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.270
So what is the distinctive method of Aristotle's politics?

798
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.910
To some degree,

799
00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:53.500
Aristotle refuses to play the methodologists game

800
00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.980
in a well known passage from the ethics.

801
00:38:56.981 --> 00:39:01.981
He says that our discussions will be adequate if it achieves clarity within the

802
00:39:02.171 --> 00:39:03.700
limits of its subject.

803
00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.900
If it achieves clarity within the limits of its subject.

804
00:39:07.901 --> 00:39:08.681
In other words,

805
00:39:08.681 --> 00:39:13.681
he seems to be saying it is wrong to demand methodological purity in a subject

806
00:39:14.951 --> 00:39:19.270
like politics where there is always great variety and unpredictability.

807
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.550
It is the marquee says,

808
00:39:21.551 --> 00:39:23.050
have an educated person,

809
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:28.110
presumably a liberally educated person not to demand more precision in the

810
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:29.860
subject matter allows,

811
00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.870
but that formulation seems in many ways to be questioned begging because how

812
00:39:34.871 --> 00:39:37.840
much precision does the subject allow?

813
00:39:37.841 --> 00:39:39.400
How do we know?

814
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:41.590
There will always,

815
00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:46.650
he suggests appear to be something ad hoc about the methods used in the study of

816
00:39:47.261 --> 00:39:48.094
politics.

817
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:53.590
We will have to let the method fit the subject rather than demanding the subject

818
00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:58.591
matter fit a kind of Apriori method to insist on that kind of methodological

819
00:39:59.171 --> 00:40:04.030
purity he implies would be do impose a false sense of unity,

820
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:09.480
a false sense of certainty or absoluteness on the study of politics,

821
00:40:09.551 --> 00:40:14.551
which is variable and contingent and always subject to flux and change.

822
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:21.270
But even while Aristotle may deny that there is a single method appropriate to

823
00:40:21.371 --> 00:40:22.480
the study of politics,

824
00:40:22.481 --> 00:40:27.481
he proposes a set of common questions that political scientists have to address

825
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:34.180
and he lays out these questions at the very beginning of the fourth book of the

826
00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:35.014
politics.

827
00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:37.540
He lists for such questions.

828
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:39.730
The political scientist,

829
00:40:39.731 --> 00:40:40.151
he says,

830
00:40:40.151 --> 00:40:45.151
must have a grasp of the best regime given the most favorable circumstances.

831
00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:47.261
Second,

832
00:40:47.261 --> 00:40:51.580
he tells us the political scientists must consider what kind of regime will be

833
00:40:51.581 --> 00:40:55.150
best under less than optimal circumstances.

834
00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.093
Third,

835
00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.650
the political scientist may have,

836
00:40:59.651 --> 00:41:03.790
some must have some knowledge of how to render any regime,

837
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.550
no matter how imperfect it may be,

838
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.220
more stable and coherent.

839
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.253
And finally,

840
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:16.620
the political scientist must know something about the techniques of reform and

841
00:41:16.751 --> 00:41:17.590
persuasion,

842
00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:23.160
what we might call the area of political rhetoric by which existing regimes can

843
00:41:24.101 --> 00:41:26.380
be brought closer to the best

844
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.350
and taken together.

845
00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:35.040
These four questions are intended to guide inquiry to shape or direct inquiry.

846
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.580
They are not intended to yield sure or certain results,

847
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:46.090
but to guide and inform statesmen and citizens in the business of decision

848
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:48.104
making.

849
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.880
So bearing in mind that political science is a practical science,

850
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:55.570
a science of judgment,

851
00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:00.490
a science aimed at directing action under specific cir,

852
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.480
cir circumstances and situations.

853
00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.490
It is important.

854
00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:10.940
Aristotle finally suggest the language of political science express the common

855
00:42:12.451 --> 00:42:16.440
sense or ordinary language of political actors.

856
00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:22.680
There was virtually no jargon in Aristotle's politics.

857
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:29.030
Aristotle's political science stays entirely within the orbit of ordinary

858
00:42:29.371 --> 00:42:30.204
speech.

859
00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:32.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

860
00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:37.740
<v 0>Central language does not claim to be scientifically purged of ambiguity,</v>

861
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:43.450
but rather adopt standards of proof appropriate to people and debates and

862
00:42:43.451 --> 00:42:47.860
assemblies and courts of law and counsel rooms and the like.

863
00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:54.180
The language of Aristotelian political science is the language of man the

864
00:42:54.311 --> 00:42:55.300
political animal.

865
00:42:56.530 --> 00:43:01.530
You will never hear him speaking in terms of dependent or independent variables.

866
00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:08.730
You will never hear him using technical jargon out officially imported into the

867
00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:15.040
science of politics or this study of politics from the outside.

868
00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:22.960
But what most distinguishes Aristotle is that his language is addressed

869
00:43:22.961 --> 00:43:25.480
emphatically to citizens and statesmen,

870
00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.300
not too political side,

871
00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:31.210
other political scientists or philosophers.

872
00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:34.120
It has a public orientation.

873
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:35.890
It is publicly directed.

874
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:38.290
It is public spirited.

875
00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:40.960
It is concerned with the common good.

876
00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:46.090
Contrast that with today's political science

877
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:53.670
today it seems political scientists are more concerned with advancing the

878
00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:59.131
abstract truths of science and claims about creating a methodologically rigorous

879
00:44:02.471 --> 00:44:07.471
and pure science of politics where Aristotle is more concerned with the regime,

880
00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:13.750
modern political science in many ways,

881
00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:18.751
stain claims to stand above or apart from the regime to be objective,

882
00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:25.500
to be disinterested as if it were viewing human affairs from a distant planet.

883
00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:33.140
Aristotle takes his stand from within politics and the regime of which he is a

884
00:44:33.141 --> 00:44:33.974
part.

885
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:35.611
Of course,

886
00:44:35.611 --> 00:44:39.930
we all know contemporary political scientists are not neutral.

887
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:42.900
They frequently insert their views,

888
00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:44.341
values,

889
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:46.110
we call them value judgments.

890
00:44:46.111 --> 00:44:46.711
We call them.

891
00:44:46.711 --> 00:44:48.570
They insert them into their discussions.

892
00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:50.380
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

893
00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.600
<v 0>but these were values are regarded by them,</v>

894
00:44:52.601 --> 00:44:53.860
is purely subjective.

895
00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:54.371
Their own,

896
00:44:54.371 --> 00:44:54.641
again,

897
00:44:54.641 --> 00:44:55.930
their own value judgments,

898
00:44:55.931 --> 00:44:56.591
so to speak,

899
00:44:56.591 --> 00:44:59.860
and not strictly speaking a part of the science of politics,

900
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.230
but we all know doing not that most contemporary political scientists tend to be

901
00:45:05.231 --> 00:45:06.064
liberals.

902
00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:08.710
They're values are liberal values.

903
00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:14.680
This raises a question where did the relation between contemporary political

904
00:45:14.681 --> 00:45:18.580
science and liberalism is merely accidental or there,

905
00:45:18.581 --> 00:45:20.260
whether there is some intrinsic,

906
00:45:20.261 --> 00:45:22.870
some necessary connection between them.

907
00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.030
So when might do well to ponder,

908
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:30.220
<v 1>yeah.</v>

909
00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:33.430
<v 0>Which political science is really more scientific,</v>

910
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:35.140
Aristotle's,

911
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.920
which is explicitly and necessarily evaluative,

912
00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:44.440
and that offers advice and exhortation to the statesmen and citizens about what?

913
00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:49.920
About how to care for their regime or contemporary political science that claims

914
00:45:49.991 --> 00:45:52.390
to be neutral and nonpartisan,

915
00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:57.760
but which smuggles its values and preferences in always through the back door.

916
00:45:59.700 --> 00:45:59.920
And,

917
00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.480
and this very partisan note,

918
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.093
I conclude.

919
00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:05.280
So,

920
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.113
uh,

921
00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:07.143
on Friday,

922
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:08.170
let me just remind you,

923
00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.700
you'll crunchy pay with studying Machiavelli.
