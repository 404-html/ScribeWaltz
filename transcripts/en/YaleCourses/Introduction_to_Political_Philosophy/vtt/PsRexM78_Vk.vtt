1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.011
Okay.

2
00:00:01.011 --> 00:00:02.720
I want to begin with a question today.

3
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:03.321
I have a question.

4
00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:04.430
I have a question for you.

5
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.010
You've been reading the apology.

6
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.420
You've now read the,

7
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.470
you've read the apology and the Credo of had a little chance to think about

8
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:13.304
these,

9
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.551
uh,

10
00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:14.384
works.

11
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.931
Uh,

12
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:18.620
I just liked to do a piece of survey research.

13
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.380
How many of you just show of hands?

14
00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:21.551
Is,

15
00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:22.400
is all I need?

16
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.580
How many of you believe uh,

17
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.550
Socrates is innocent and should be acquitted?

18
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.203
<v 1>Okay.</v>

19
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.500
<v 0>And how many of you believe he is guilty and more or less got what he deserved?</v>

20
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.180
<v 1>Higher Place.</v>

21
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.993
Okay.

22
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.320
<v 0>Uh,</v>

23
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.750
not exactly the same proportion.

24
00:00:55.751 --> 00:00:59.440
I think somewhat a greater number of believe in his,

25
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.490
in his innocence then then in the Athenian jury,

26
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.241
obviously,

27
00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:06.280
but let me just ask you,

28
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.931
you'll be in the,

29
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:08.020
in the brown shirt.

30
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.780
Just curious.

31
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.940
Why do you think he,

32
00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:10.480
he is,

33
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.420
he is innocent and should be acquitted.

34
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.873
<v 1>Well,</v>

35
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.623
in terms of

36
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.903
the

37
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.183
politics

38
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.081
<v 0>and,</v>

39
00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:38.914
uh,

40
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.870
you,

41
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.210
you,

42
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.820
I noticed you had your yes.

43
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.630
Uh,

44
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.450
why did you,

45
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.240
why did you believe he was guilty and got what he deserved?

46
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.240
<v 1>What is</v>

47
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.353
what

48
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.480
society agrees?

49
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.930
I mean he was going against the people who had the authority.

50
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.900
What is justice,

51
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:14.150
what society says this?

52
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.670
It says what you did.

53
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.453
Okay.

54
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.260
<v 0>So,</v>

55
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.900
uh,

56
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.280
as Lincoln once said,

57
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.580
uh,

58
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.031
both,

59
00:02:25.031 --> 00:02:26.920
both of you can't be right.

60
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.330
Uh,

61
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.860
neither of you may be right,

62
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.120
but,

63
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.570
but both of you can't be right.

64
00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:32.710
So this,

65
00:02:32.711 --> 00:02:37.711
this is a question that I want to continue today to come to consider,

66
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.800
uh,

67
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.280
what,

68
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.770
what the trial of Socrates means.

69
00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:46.771
And I want to begin by going back to a problem or a paradox that I ended the

70
00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:48.850
class with last time.

71
00:02:48.851 --> 00:02:52.560
That is to say it's Socrates proposes a right,

72
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.920
a new conception of what it is to be a citizen.

73
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.120
He opposes,

74
00:02:58.121 --> 00:03:00.550
we have seen traditional,

75
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.361
you might say,

76
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:03.880
Homeric conception of the citizen,

77
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:04.723
the citizen,

78
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.800
uh,

79
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.460
certain notions of citizen loyalty and patriotism,

80
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.323
uh,

81
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.810
uh,

82
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.770
created,

83
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.340
shaped by the poetic tradition going back to homer.

84
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.600
He wants to replace it with a new kind of,

85
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.150
uh,

86
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.090
want to call it rational citizenship,

87
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.950
philosophical citizenship,

88
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.520
uh,

89
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.560
a view of citizenship that a,

90
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:26.951
again,

91
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:31.951
relies on one's own powers of independent reason and judgment.

92
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.940
And in the course of debate and argument,

93
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.750
and in the course of defending this point of view,

94
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:42.160
Socrates says in a,

95
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:46.000
in an interesting passage that he has spent his entire life,

96
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.780
uh,

97
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.380
pursue.

98
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.620
Uh,

99
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.971
he,

100
00:03:47.971 --> 00:03:48.320
he's,

101
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.640
he's,

102
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.410
he's spent his life,

103
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.740
uh,

104
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.740
pursuing private matters rather than public ones and is deliberately avoided a

105
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.120
public issues,

106
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.390
uh,

107
00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.530
issues of politics.

108
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.420
And that raises a question,

109
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:02.950
how can a citizen,

110
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.670
how can this new kind of citizenship that he is proposing,

111
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:11.290
how can any kind of citizenship be devoted just to private matters and not

112
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.303
public?

113
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.550
Uh,

114
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.390
citizenship seems to require even,

115
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.010
uh,

116
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.170
uh,

117
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.550
the public sphere,

118
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:19.450
the public realm.

119
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:19.721
What,

120
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:20.170
what,

121
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.170
what does Socrates mean when he says his way of life as has been devoted almost

122
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:27.190
exclusively to private,

123
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.200
rented into public matters as well.

124
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:34.201
The first thing we might think about is whether that's entirely true,

125
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:39.160
whether he's being entirely candid with his audience after all,

126
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.670
uh,

127
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.680
the kind of investigations,

128
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:46.681
the kind of interrogations that he has been pursuing since going to the Delphic

129
00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:48.274
Oracle,

130
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.020
and then then following,

131
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:50.741
it's his,

132
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:53.080
at least his interpretation of its mandate,

133
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.930
these investigations of the politicians,

134
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:56.681
the poets,

135
00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:57.520
the craftsmen,

136
00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:57.731
and the,

137
00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:58.061
like,

138
00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:00.580
he says he's had been carried out in public.

139
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.481
Uh,

140
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:05.260
he has gone around in a market and in the open,

141
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.820
in the Public Forum,

142
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.210
uh,

143
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.780
questioning and interrogating and obviously making a Var,

144
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.960
a variety of people look foolish.

145
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.360
So this is hardly simply,

146
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.120
uh,

147
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.830
a private question or a private way of life.

148
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.680
But perhaps he means simply that,

149
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.250
uh,

150
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.250
by pursuing a private life that again,

151
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:31.300
he's going to rely almost exclusively on his own,

152
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.780
uh,

153
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.200
individual powers of reason and judgment.

154
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.230
Not to defer or rely on such public goods as custom,

155
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.310
as authority,

156
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:43.360
as tradition,

157
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.871
uh,

158
00:05:43.871 --> 00:05:44.950
things of this sort.

159
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.740
But I think Socrates means more than that,

160
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.770
more than simply he wishes to rely on the powers of private,

161
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.490
individual judgment.

162
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.090
Uh,

163
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.610
when he says that his way of life has been private,

164
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.360
he means that he has pursued a policy of,

165
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.710
of,

166
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.710
let's call it a principled abstinence from a public life.

167
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:10.580
Socrates is a great,

168
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.181
uh,

169
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:12.200
abstainer,

170
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.100
uh,

171
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.100
he has abstained from participation in the collective actions of the city.

172
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.151
Uh,

173
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:21.970
actions that he believes,

174
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.580
uh,

175
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.580
could only entail a complicity and active of public,

176
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.401
uh,

177
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:29.211
injustice.

178
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:30.620
His own motto,

179
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:31.140
uh,

180
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.390
if you wanted to do a scribe him a motto seems to be a variety of,

181
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:36.860
of the hippocratic oath.

182
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:37.070
You know,

183
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.350
their doctors famous have to do no harm,

184
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.140
uh,

185
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.480
and to do no harm.

186
00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:44.990
He has a required of himself,

187
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:49.640
a kind of principle abstention from public life.

188
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:53.270
If George Bush described himself not long ago,

189
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:55.700
is that as the dis is the decider,

190
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.640
we might call Socrates the abstainer.

191
00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.631
Well,

192
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:00.740
what does he mean by,

193
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.980
or what do I mean by a referring to his policies of abstention from political

194
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:08.290
life?

195
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.511
Uh,

196
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.141
do you remember?

197
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:09.770
He gives,

198
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.750
he gives a couple of examples of,

199
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.823
of what he,

200
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.461
uh,

201
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:14.990
of examples of this sword.

202
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:16.340
One,

203
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.720
one of them remember,

204
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.100
uh,

205
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.820
concerned his refusal,

206
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.931
uh,

207
00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:23.090
to join in the judgment,

208
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:24.050
to condemn,

209
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.161
uh,

210
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:27.890
and execute the 10 Athenian generals,

211
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.491
uh,

212
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:31.550
who had failed to collect the corpses,

213
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.510
the bodies,

214
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.421
uh,

215
00:07:33.421 --> 00:07:36.290
of the men lost in a particular battle during,

216
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.700
during the Peloponnesian war.

217
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.800
This was a mark of great,

218
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.780
great shame and disgrace.

219
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.180
Uh,

220
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.390
the generals were a actual event.

221
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:45.140
Uh,

222
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:45.950
they were,

223
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.340
uh,

224
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.340
there was a kind of judgment of collective guilt and they were all,

225
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:51.700
uh,

226
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.820
executed there.

227
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.020
The leaders,

228
00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:56.270
the generals of this particular battle.

229
00:07:56.271 --> 00:08:00.230
And Socrates tells how he refused to,

230
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:01.100
uh,

231
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.410
engage in that kind of,

232
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.670
uh,

233
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:04.940
Jay to join,

234
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.410
to join the court,

235
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:07.161
uh,

236
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:10.370
in the judgment of their collective guilt,

237
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.020
a true,

238
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:12.801
true incident.

239
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:16.730
And the second story you remember from,

240
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.920
from your reading of the book was,

241
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.640
uh,

242
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.170
his telling,

243
00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:26.171
reminding the jury how he refused to participate.

244
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:30.440
He was ordered by the 30 that the hated tyranny of the 30.

245
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.370
Uh,

246
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.630
he was ordered to,

247
00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:33.464
uh,

248
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.860
assist in the arrest of a man known as Leon,

249
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.070
of Salah and an arrest that would have,

250
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.080
would have and did in fact,

251
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:42.560
uh,

252
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.120
lead,

253
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:43.400
uh,

254
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.560
to Leon's a execution.

255
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.400
And Socrates tells how he at considerable risk to himself refused to participate

256
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.481
in the,

257
00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:53.930
uh,

258
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.380
in the arrest of this man in both,

259
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.080
in both of these cases,

260
00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:58.580
uh,

261
00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.341
I take it,

262
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:04.341
Socrates is point a is that his own individual moral integrity,

263
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.163
uh,

264
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:12.170
stands as a kind of litmus test you might say for whether to engage or disengage

265
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.080
from political life.

266
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:16.950
Uh,

267
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.350
I was the sort of man he tells the jewelry.

268
00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:24.351
I was the sort of man who never conceded anything to anyone contrary to what is

269
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:25.434
just,

270
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:25.800
uh,

271
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.341
no doubt.

272
00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:28.200
Also reminding them,

273
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.990
uh,

274
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:33.990
of his again is a refusal to bow to the,

275
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:35.020
to the tier two,

276
00:09:35.021 --> 00:09:35.311
the two,

277
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:36.570
the 30 tyrants in the,

278
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:39.120
in the case of Leon of Sallome us.

279
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:40.020
But this raises,

280
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:45.050
I think that the central or a central point about Socratic citizenship or

281
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:48.240
Socrates is view of citizenship.

282
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:52.440
This kind of principled disobedience to the law.

283
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.273
Something,

284
00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:53.490
uh,

285
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.340
like a thorough is a model of,

286
00:09:56.341 --> 00:09:56.591
of,

287
00:09:56.591 --> 00:09:58.050
of civil disobedience.

288
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.063
Does this,

289
00:09:59.070 --> 00:09:59.430
uh,

290
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.590
does this policy of,

291
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:01.861
of,

292
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:03.840
of principal disobedience,

293
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.960
you might say vindicate or Indict Socrates of the charge of corruption in Po and

294
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:13.080
impiety that that has been brought against him.

295
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:13.411
Ken,

296
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:14.400
a citizen.

297
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:15.360
He,

298
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.500
he affirms,

299
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.191
uh,

300
00:10:17.191 --> 00:10:18.420
I will ask though,

301
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.420
can a citizen put his own conscience,

302
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:22.050
uh,

303
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.290
above the law as Socrates seems to do?

304
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:30.120
This is a problem that we will see considerably later in the term in the term

305
00:10:30.121 --> 00:10:31.430
that vexes uh,

306
00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:34.960
a very important political thinker by the name of Hobbs,

307
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:35.440
uh,

308
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.440
about whether an individual can somehow put their own sense of conscience or

309
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:42.090
moral integrity.

310
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.600
Uh,

311
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.860
even above the law.

312
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:45.420
What would a community,

313
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:46.070
uh,

314
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.600
of Socratic citizens look like?

315
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.463
Each one,

316
00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:49.920
uh,

317
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.210
picking and choosing,

318
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:56.211
you might say the laws or the rules to obey a,

319
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.450
or to follow or,

320
00:10:57.451 --> 00:10:57.670
or,

321
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.650
or not to follow.

322
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:03.650
Socrates is so concerned it seems with his individual is private and moral

323
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:09.210
integrity that he says in a sense to the city of Athens,

324
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:09.841
to the court,

325
00:11:09.841 --> 00:11:10.674
to the Athens,

326
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.090
to the assembly or the courts,

327
00:11:12.091 --> 00:11:14.130
that he will not dirty his hands,

328
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.700
uh,

329
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.200
with public life.

330
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:16.831
And again,

331
00:11:16.831 --> 00:11:21.180
this is a question that we will see later on that Machiavelli,

332
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:21.630
uh,

333
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.260
takes very seriously the question of whether or not politics,

334
00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:29.550
political life requires one to dirty ones hands,

335
00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:30.060
uh,

336
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:30.631
in the world.

337
00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:32.370
What kind of citizen is it?

338
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:37.030
Is he or she who abstains from maybe even rejects a,

339
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.240
the harsh necessities,

340
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:40.270
requirements of,

341
00:11:40.271 --> 00:11:41.220
of political life.

342
00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:43.920
Socrates seems to be in star in some respects.

343
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:49.280
An example of what Hegel and in 19th century described as a beautiful soul.

344
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:50.851
You know,

345
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:51.780
someone who,

346
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.171
and he,

347
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:54.580
and he used that ironically I should say,

348
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.151
uh,

349
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:59.740
someone who puts their own private moral incorruptibility,

350
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:00.731
uh,

351
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:02.920
above all else.

352
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.430
Uh,

353
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.610
and we all know it probably know or have read about,

354
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.110
about people like this.

355
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.340
How does Socrates answered these charges?

356
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:12.540
He,

357
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.680
he have of in a way,

358
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:15.130
uh,

359
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.470
being not just an abstainer but,

360
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.041
but it can,

361
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:22.840
putting his own private moral conscience or integrity,

362
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.411
uh,

363
00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:24.700
over and above the law.

364
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:29.701
And he tries to defend his point of view by arguing in a famous passage that his

365
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:36.580
policy of abstinence actually carries important benefits to the city.

366
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:41.080
He brings with it important benefits and an f in the passage that I'm referring

367
00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:41.680
to,

368
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.440
he defines himself as a gadfly.

369
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.850
Everyone will remember that the gadfly who improves the quality of life in the

370
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:52.420
city in section 30 d a Socrates rights,

371
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:53.500
let me read the passage.

372
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:54.041
So I,

373
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:59.041
men of Athens are now too far from asking from making a defense speech on my own

374
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:00.340
behalf.

375
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.010
I do it rather he says on your behalf,

376
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:03.671
what I say,

377
00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:04.810
I say for you,

378
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:09.310
he appears to say so that you do not do something wrong concerning the gift of

379
00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:11.680
the God referring to himself,

380
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.800
the gift of the God by voting to condemn me,

381
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:16.150
for if you kill me,

382
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.013
he continues.

383
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.460
You will not only destroy,

384
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.480
you will not easily discover another of my sought who,

385
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.640
even if it is rather ridiculous to say.

386
00:13:24.641 --> 00:13:29.641
So has simply been set upon the city by the God is though upon a great and born

387
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:35.920
horse who was rather sluggish because of his great size and needs to be awakened

388
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:39.760
by some gadfly just so in fact,

389
00:13:39.761 --> 00:13:44.761
the God seems to me to have set me upon the city as some one of this sort.

390
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.820
I awakened and persuade and reproach each one of you and I do not stop settling

391
00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:55.630
down everywhere upon you the whole day.

392
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.500
So here,

393
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.960
here we have the example of Socrates telling,

394
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:03.930
telling us not only declaring himself to be the gift of a God who is brought to

395
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:04.740
for this,

396
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.391
but that he is,

397
00:14:05.391 --> 00:14:05.530
uh,

398
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.390
he's a great benefactor of the city.

399
00:14:07.391 --> 00:14:08.680
That his pre,

400
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:09.850
his example,

401
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.920
his example of the,

402
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:12.861
of the man of,

403
00:14:12.861 --> 00:14:17.440
of individual moral conscience brings with it great as it were,

404
00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:18.210
public,

405
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:18.850
uh,

406
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:19.683
benefits.

407
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.970
It is not on his behalf.

408
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.260
He tells the audience,

409
00:14:23.261 --> 00:14:25.750
but yours is fellow citizens that he,

410
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.450
he does what he,

411
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.450
he does.

412
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.010
You may not like me.

413
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:30.430
Uh,

414
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.510
he says to the jury,

415
00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:34.210
but I am good for you.

416
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.041
And furthermore,

417
00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:36.910
he claims,

418
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.410
uh,

419
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:37.931
in this,

420
00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:38.440
uh,

421
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.910
what can only be described as sort of crazy religious language that he has no

422
00:14:42.911 --> 00:14:44.260
choice in the matter.

423
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.410
This is not something he has chosen to do.

424
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.071
He is,

425
00:14:48.071 --> 00:14:48.581
as he says,

426
00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:50.560
a gift from the God he has been.

427
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.360
He argues to do this.

428
00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:54.260
Men of Athens,

429
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:54.711
he says,

430
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:57.230
I will obey the god rather than you.

431
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.830
And as long as I breathe in and am able to do so,

432
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.860
I will certainly not stop philosophizing.

433
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:09.130
He seems to envelop him himself and his way of life with a kind of religious

434
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:12.081
imagery.

435
00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:13.490
The Delphic Oracle,

436
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:14.331
uh,

437
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:14.661
the,

438
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:14.751
uh,

439
00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:16.040
the gift of the God,

440
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:16.610
uh,

441
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:17.443
image.

442
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:22.910
He envelops his conception of citizenship within this religious language.

443
00:15:22.911 --> 00:15:23.990
And this will,

444
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:29.140
will or should lead any reader of the apology in any reader of Plato to ask an

445
00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:33.500
important question about Socrates use of this language.

446
00:15:33.501 --> 00:15:36.320
We will see it again in different ways in the republic.

447
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.430
Is he sincere in saying this and making this point,

448
00:15:40.431 --> 00:15:40.910
or is he,

449
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.100
or is he somehow being ironical,

450
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:43.610
uh,

451
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:48.610
in his use of the religious tone or the religious register?

452
00:15:48.891 --> 00:15:52.130
He is after all on trial for his life,

453
00:15:52.131 --> 00:15:54.170
for the charge of impiety.

454
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.040
Uh,

455
00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:00.020
would it not seem that in order to rebut the charge of impiety,

456
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.621
uh,

457
00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:01.490
that he would,

458
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:01.910
uh,

459
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.910
use or adopt a kind of religious language that would resonate with the jury and

460
00:16:08.661 --> 00:16:10.340
rebut the accusation,

461
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.190
perhaps even suggesting that he is the truly,

462
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:13.970
uh,

463
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.000
religious and pious one and not the ones,

464
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:17.420
uh,

465
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.170
like annotations and Mellitus who are bringing charges against him,

466
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.490
Socrates seems,

467
00:16:22.491 --> 00:16:26.210
or it could be seen to be speaking not just ironically,

468
00:16:26.211 --> 00:16:30.890
but provocatively and describing himself as a gift of the God.

469
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:31.491
In a sense.

470
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:34.610
You might ask what could be more ludicrous,

471
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.480
uh,

472
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:35.870
uh,

473
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:40.070
Socrates declaring himself or anyone declaring themselves to be,

474
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.670
uh,

475
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:41.190
you know,

476
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:41.480
uh,

477
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.800
a gift of the divine,

478
00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:44.420
but right.

479
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.110
I mean,

480
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.640
who,

481
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.473
who,

482
00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.030
who would make such a claim.

483
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.660
But in another respect,

484
00:16:53.661 --> 00:16:57.500
he seems to take the divine calling very seriously.

485
00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.340
Right?

486
00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:58.640
I mean,

487
00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.480
does he not?

488
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:00.763
Uh,

489
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:05.150
it was only when the Delphic oracle a replied to clarify on,

490
00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:09.800
he tells that story that replied to him that no one was wiser than Socrates,

491
00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:13.760
that Socrates undertook this second sailing as it were.

492
00:17:13.761 --> 00:17:14.481
His turn.

493
00:17:14.481 --> 00:17:18.860
We saw this last time has turned away from the investigation of purely natural

494
00:17:18.861 --> 00:17:23.861
phenomena to the study of the world of moral virtue and justice.

495
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:29.210
He repeatedly maintains that the path he has taken,

496
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:30.560
uh,

497
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.210
is not of his own choosing,

498
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:34.700
but the result of a divine command.

499
00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.270
He is under some kind of divine a edict,

500
00:17:38.271 --> 00:17:43.271
and it is precisely his devotion to this divine command to this particular kind

501
00:17:44.121 --> 00:17:49.121
of calling that has led him to neglect his worldly affairs.

502
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.710
Uh,

503
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.810
he reminds him at various points,

504
00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:54.330
the audience of his extreme poverty,

505
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:55.770
um,

506
00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.860
his neglect of his family and his obligations to his wife and children as well

507
00:18:02.911 --> 00:18:03.960
as just suffer,

508
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.690
uh,

509
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:09.690
the disgrace and the abuse that is directed against him by various public

510
00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:11.701
figures.

511
00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:12.090
He tells,

512
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:17.090
he tells us all of this is the result of his devotion to the divine command.

513
00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:19.830
He presents himself,

514
00:18:19.831 --> 00:18:20.551
in other words,

515
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:24.360
as a human being of unparalleled piety and devotion,

516
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.990
who will risk life itself rather than quick.

517
00:18:27.991 --> 00:18:30.990
The Post that has been given to him,

518
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.600
it's a very tall order that he,

519
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.920
he claims for himself.

520
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.230
Do we believe him in this respect?

521
00:18:40.231 --> 00:18:40.441
I mean,

522
00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:41.520
an important question.

523
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.930
Do we believe him?

524
00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:43.261
Again,

525
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:44.910
is he being sincere in,

526
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.820
or is he using this as it were,

527
00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:49.080
a kind of rhetoric,

528
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.831
uh,

529
00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:50.820
with which to,

530
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:51.740
uh,

531
00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:52.081
you know,

532
00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:53.220
envelop his,

533
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:53.700
uh,

534
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.533
himself.

535
00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:00.120
What is this peculiar kind of piety that he claims to practice?

536
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:01.993
Uh,

537
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.970
in many ways,

538
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.260
uh,

539
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:07.560
in replying to the jury's verdict,

540
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:08.280
uh,

541
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.400
and their request that he sees philosophizing,

542
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.090
uh,

543
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:15.330
Socrates explains himself in the following terms.

544
00:19:15.331 --> 00:19:19.950
Let me just quote one other passage briefly from the second speech that he gives

545
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:21.750
to the jury after his,

546
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.321
his,

547
00:19:22.321 --> 00:19:22.770
his,

548
00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:23.131
his,

549
00:19:23.131 --> 00:19:23.750
uh,

550
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:24.583
uh,

551
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.673
conviction.

552
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.340
It is hardest of all to persuade you

553
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.060
to persuade some of you about this.

554
00:19:33.061 --> 00:19:33.894
He says,

555
00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:34.170
uh,

556
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.580
about his way of life.

557
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.980
For if I say this is for,

558
00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:41.310
if I say that this is to disobey the God and because of this,

559
00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:43.020
it is impossible to keep quiet.

560
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:47.730
You will not be persuaded by me on the grounds that I am being ironic.

561
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:49.710
And on the other hand,

562
00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:50.161
he says,

563
00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:54.930
if I say that this even happens to be a very great good for a human being,

564
00:19:54.931 --> 00:19:59.100
that is to make speeches every day about virtue and that the unexamined life is

565
00:19:59.101 --> 00:20:00.900
not worth living for a human being,

566
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.620
you will still less be persuaded by me.

567
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.181
In other words,

568
00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:06.401
what he,

569
00:20:06.401 --> 00:20:11.401
he seems to be saying in that passage at around 37 c and D is that he realizes

570
00:20:14.701 --> 00:20:17.640
he is on the horns of a dilemma.

571
00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:18.540
On the one hand,

572
00:20:18.541 --> 00:20:21.510
he says his reference to a divine mission,

573
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:22.090
uh,

574
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:27.090
he explicitly says there will be taken by his audience as being ironic.

575
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:28.343
Uh,

576
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:32.880
just another instance of Socratic irony and insincerity,

577
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.050
but he says,

578
00:20:34.051 --> 00:20:36.210
if he tries to persuade people,

579
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:37.110
uh,

580
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:42.110
of the goodness and the justice of his way of life on simply rational grounds

581
00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:47.070
alone to persuade them that the examined life alone is,

582
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.391
is,

583
00:20:47.391 --> 00:20:48.430
is worth living,

584
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.190
he says he will not be believed.

585
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.570
So what you might say is a Socratic citizen to do.

586
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.940
Uh,

587
00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:00.100
he will either be accused of being ironic and not be believed,

588
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.100
or he will simply be disbelieved if he,

589
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:08.130
if he attempts to defend himself on rational or philosophical grounds.

590
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.620
That raises the question.

591
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.270
I think that,

592
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:13.600
uh,

593
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.610
I began the class with today,

594
00:21:15.611 --> 00:21:17.440
should Socrates be tolerated?

595
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.820
What a good society tolerate Socrates,

596
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.870
this is the question raised by dis dialogue.

597
00:21:25.871 --> 00:21:27.160
And the Credo is,

598
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:27.551
well,

599
00:21:27.551 --> 00:21:32.551
how far should freedom of speech and that is to say speech that verges in that

600
00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:37.420
borders on or even verges into civic impiety.

601
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.420
How far should such speech be tolerated?

602
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.590
It's been an assumption of readers of Plato,

603
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:45.131
uh,

604
00:21:45.131 --> 00:21:46.690
over the years,

605
00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:47.853
uh,

606
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.540
that the trial of Socrates,

607
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.370
that the execution of Socrates,

608
00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:52.000
uh,

609
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.833
presents,

610
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.190
uh,

611
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:58.190
the case for the fullest liberty or freedom of thought and discussion and the

612
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.750
evils or the dangers to a society,

613
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:02.501
uh,

614
00:22:02.501 --> 00:22:04.990
of trying to persecute or,

615
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:05.710
uh,

616
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:06.130
or,

617
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:06.580
or,

618
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.990
or suppress,

619
00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:08.530
uh,

620
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:09.880
freedom of speech.

621
00:22:09.881 --> 00:22:10.091
But,

622
00:22:10.091 --> 00:22:11.890
but is this right or in other words,

623
00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:13.450
is that really Plato's,

624
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:13.930
uh,

625
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.540
teaching among the things?

626
00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.170
Uh,

627
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:20.320
Socrates says he cares deeply about his,

628
00:22:20.321 --> 00:22:25.321
his calling as he puts it to do nothing but persuade you both younger and older,

629
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.150
not to care for your bodies and money,

630
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.640
but how your soul will be,

631
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.060
uh,

632
00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.280
in the best possible condition.

633
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.183
<v 1>Um,</v>

634
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.290
kind of lost my place.

635
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.320
Oh,

636
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.153
yeah.

637
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:46.263
So,

638
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.133
uh,

639
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:48.210
<v 0>let me,</v>

640
00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:48.910
sorry,

641
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.250
let me just get back to that.

642
00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:52.563
<v 1>Uh,</v>

643
00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:58.490
<v 0>how are we to understand this case about toleration and freedom of speech?</v>

644
00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.910
The apology presents Socrates,

645
00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.060
right as presenting the,

646
00:23:09.061 --> 00:23:14.061
the most intransigent case for the philosopher is a radical critic or questioner

647
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:15.991
of society.

648
00:23:15.991 --> 00:23:20.991
Socrates demands that the Athenians change,

649
00:23:22.021 --> 00:23:25.590
not simply this or that aspect of their policy,

650
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:29.100
but he demands nothing less than a drastic,

651
00:23:29.101 --> 00:23:31.650
I would even say revolutionary change.

652
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:32.670
Uh,

653
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.070
in Athenian civic life,

654
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.170
in Athenian Civic Culture,

655
00:23:37.171 --> 00:23:39.570
he tells his fellow citizens right,

656
00:23:39.571 --> 00:23:42.360
that their lives are not worth living.

657
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.960
Only the examined life is worth and you are not living examined lives.

658
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:48.974
Therefore,

659
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.180
your life cannot possibly have any value to it.

660
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:59.420
Even when presented with the option to cease philosophizing,

661
00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:02.240
he refuses to do so on the ground that again,

662
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:07.130
he is acting under a command divine command and cannot do otherwise.

663
00:24:07.131 --> 00:24:12.131
It's Plato asking us to regard Socrates is a man of high principal standing up

664
00:24:13.491 --> 00:24:18.491
for what he believes in the face of death or as a kind of revolutionary agitator

665
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:26.050
who cannot and should not be tolerated by a society whose basic laws and values

666
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.090
he will not accept.

667
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.350
Uh,

668
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.370
to some degree,

669
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:31.681
uh,

670
00:24:31.681 --> 00:24:34.190
I am inclined to answer those,

671
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.570
answer that both,

672
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:39.500
that both of those questions have something to them.

673
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.760
Maybe the answer or an answer to this question is revealed in the Credo,

674
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.290
the companion dialogue,

675
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.780
the companion speech that goes along with

676
00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:53.990
lead apology,

677
00:24:55.220 --> 00:25:00.220
although it typically gets much less attention than the apology in part because

678
00:25:02.061 --> 00:25:04.670
I think the dialogue presents a,

679
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:05.570
as it were,

680
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:05.930
uh,

681
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:07.280
the city's case,

682
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.910
the case of the city against Socrates.

683
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:11.121
I mean,

684
00:25:11.121 --> 00:25:13.010
consider some of the following.

685
00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:18.011
If the apology presents the philosophers case against the city Socrates case

686
00:25:19.341 --> 00:25:20.180
against the city,

687
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:25.310
the cryto presents the city's case against the philosopher.

688
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:30.020
Here's Socrates makes the case against himself.

689
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:35.560
You might say he makes the case against himself better than his accusers in the

690
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.823
courtroom.

691
00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:38.150
Uh,

692
00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:42.500
did so in the apology to speech between Socrates and the laws,

693
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.250
uh,

694
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.630
that forms a,

695
00:25:44.631 --> 00:25:45.464
as it were,

696
00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:46.010
uh,

697
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:50.680
the kind of central action of the dialogue presents the case that Mellitus and

698
00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.080
annotate as should have made against him.

699
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:55.321
Why?

700
00:25:55.321 --> 00:26:00.321
The apology seems to denigrate the political life as requiring complicity in

701
00:26:01.191 --> 00:26:02.024
injustice.

702
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:07.400
And Socrates says he will have no part of laws or policies that entail

703
00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:08.234
injustice.

704
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:12.870
The cryto makes the case for the dignity of the laws,

705
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.800
the dignity or majesty of the city,

706
00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:16.380
uh,

707
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.640
and its laws where the apology defends,

708
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:20.421
again,

709
00:26:20.421 --> 00:26:25.421
a Po politics of principled abstinence or disobedience to the political life.

710
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:32.860
The cryto makes the most complete and far reaching case for obligation in

711
00:26:34.281 --> 00:26:38.030
obedience to the law that has perhaps ever been made.

712
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.270
So how do we reconcile,

713
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:46.300
if we can these two apparently contradictory points of view in the,

714
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.400
in these two,

715
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.690
in these two dialogues,

716
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.790
these two dialogues,

717
00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:55.710
it should be evident,

718
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:56.460
I mean,

719
00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:01.460
differ not only in content but in their dramatic context.

720
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:05.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

721
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.140
<v 0>Just consider again,</v>

722
00:27:07.141 --> 00:27:08.490
some of the following.

723
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:14.240
The apology is a speech given before a large and largely anonymous audience of

724
00:27:16.741 --> 00:27:18.210
over 500 persons.

725
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:20.880
The assembly that the court,

726
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:22.290
uh,

727
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.030
we see Socrates addressing,

728
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:24.870
uh,

729
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:29.580
the only time in any platonic dialogue in audience of this size.

730
00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:35.570
The Credo on the other hand is a conversation between Socrates and a single

731
00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:36.864
individual.

732
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.190
Only one person.

733
00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.590
The apology takes place in the court of Athens.

734
00:27:43.591 --> 00:27:45.060
The most public of,

735
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:50.120
of settings or the credo occurs within the darkness and confinement.

736
00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:52.250
Uh,

737
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:52.860
of a,

738
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.000
of a prison cell.

739
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:56.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

740
00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.440
<v 0>The apology shows Socrates defending himself and his life as a gift of the God</v>

741
00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.670
that most truly benefits the city.

742
00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:10.050
But in the Credo we see him bow down to the authority of the laws that he seems

743
00:28:11.561 --> 00:28:14.020
to have previously rejected.

744
00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.113
And finally,

745
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:18.400
if the apology presents,

746
00:28:18.401 --> 00:28:21.880
Socrates is the first martyr for philosophy,

747
00:28:21.881 --> 00:28:24.670
the first person to die for the cause of philosophy.

748
00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:30.150
The cryto shows Socrates trial and sentence as a case of justice delivered.

749
00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

750
00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.400
<v 0>These huge contrasts again,</v>

751
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:39.020
they force us to ask a question.

752
00:28:39.021 --> 00:28:44.021
What is Plato doing in presenting these two very different point of views,

753
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:45.171
points of view.

754
00:28:45.171 --> 00:28:50.120
What does this point in presenting these two works with two such sharply

755
00:28:50.121 --> 00:28:55.121
contrasting perspectives on the relation of Socrates,

756
00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:56.270
uh,

757
00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:57.103
to the city.

758
00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:00.683
<v 1>Okay.</v>

759
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:02.940
<v 0>What's Plato confused?</v>

760
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:05.370
Was He contradicting himself?

761
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.013
Was He,

762
00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:08.121
what?

763
00:29:08.121 --> 00:29:08.954
What was he doing

764
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:14.303
<v 1>requesting?</v>

765
00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.330
I hope I have time to answer it.

766
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:27.180
<v 0>So let's look into the cried out just a little bit.</v>

767
00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:34.660
Credo is named for a friend and disciple of Socrates who at the outset of the

768
00:29:35.661 --> 00:29:37.550
dialogue is sitting,

769
00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:43.390
is a watchful guardian over his mentor urges Socrates to allow him to help him

770
00:29:46.331 --> 00:29:47.164
escape.

771
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.970
The jailers have been bribed and escape would be made easy,

772
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.800
but rather than trying to convince cryto directly,

773
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.410
Socrates creates a dialogue.

774
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:03.220
Actually you might say a dialogue within the larger dialogue,

775
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:08.730
a dialogue between himself and the laws of Athens where he puts forward the case

776
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.020
against escape.

777
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:16.140
That is to say the case against disobedience to the law and the argument could

778
00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:19.780
be summarized as follows.

779
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:24.010
No state can exist without rules.

780
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:30.330
The first rule of any state is the is the rule that citizens are not free to set

781
00:30:31.091 --> 00:30:36.091
aside the rules to choose among them which ones to obey and to disobey.

782
00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:41.910
To engage in dis in civil disobedience of any kind is not only to call this or

783
00:30:42.851 --> 00:30:44.980
that rule into question,

784
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.240
but it is to call into question the very nature of law.

785
00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:54.240
The very question of the rules to question or just obey the law is tantamount to

786
00:30:55.211 --> 00:30:58.390
destroying the authority of the law.

787
00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:03.480
The breaking of so much of a single law constitutes the essence of anarchy,

788
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.160
constitutes the essence of lawlessness.

789
00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:14.460
It has a far reaching argument for obedience to the law.

790
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.280
The breaking of even a single law calls into question the authority of law as

791
00:31:22.181 --> 00:31:22.840
such.

792
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.840
It's a very powerful argument that in a way Socrates makes against himself

793
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.790
putting that speech in the,

794
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.350
in the mouth of the laws.

795
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.930
But he goes even further than this.

796
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:36.520
Uh,

797
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.870
the citizen he says,

798
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.730
owes his very existence,

799
00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:40.451
took the laws.

800
00:31:40.451 --> 00:31:45.451
We are what we are because of the power and authority of the laws,

801
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:47.800
the customs,

802
00:31:47.801 --> 00:31:48.820
the traditions,

803
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:51.880
the culture that has shaped us.

804
00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:55.300
The laws he says have begat us.

805
00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.020
Uh,

806
00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:01.020
and the use of that term begat in our translation is clearly intended to

807
00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.660
resonate with something you might say we might,

808
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:08.020
we might think of as something biblical about it.

809
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.501
Uh,

810
00:32:08.501 --> 00:32:09.550
the citizen is,

811
00:32:09.551 --> 00:32:13.840
is it in a word created begat a by the laws themselves.

812
00:32:13.841 --> 00:32:18.220
They exercise a kind of paternal authority over us,

813
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.290
uh,

814
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:26.280
such that a disobedience to any law constitutes,

815
00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.380
uh,

816
00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:33.380
an active impiety or disrespect of the oldest things,

817
00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.753
uh,

818
00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:36.993
around us.

819
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.130
The laws are not only like our parents,

820
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.230
they are like our ancestors.

821
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.660
The founding fathers is,

822
00:32:44.661 --> 00:32:45.530
we might say,

823
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.720
who are owed respect,

824
00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:48.410
uh,

825
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:51.170
and piety in many ways.

826
00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:56.171
The cryto in some respect is the platonic dialogue about piety.

827
00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:58.933
Uh,

828
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.950
Socrates seems to accept here entirely the authority of the law.

829
00:33:03.951 --> 00:33:08.840
He does not offer arguments for noncompliance as he does in the,

830
00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:09.340
uh,

831
00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.190
apology.

832
00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:14.870
So what happened to what happened all of a sudden to Socrates,

833
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.210
the apostle of civil disobedience,

834
00:33:17.211 --> 00:33:18.044
Socrates,

835
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:21.080
the apostle of principled abstention,

836
00:33:21.081 --> 00:33:22.640
he accepts entirely,

837
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:27.700
or the laws forced him to accept entirely the covenant that every citizen has

838
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.710
with the laws that binds them to absolute awe.

839
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:32.570
Obedience.

840
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.770
The question is why does Socrates,

841
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:37.450
uh,

842
00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:42.450
exhibits such proud defiance and independence of the laws in the apology in such

843
00:33:44.721 --> 00:33:45.554
total,

844
00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:46.160
uh,

845
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.020
even kind of a mouse,

846
00:33:48.021 --> 00:33:52.160
like a rawhide acquiescence to the laws in the,

847
00:33:52.161 --> 00:33:52.451
in,

848
00:33:52.451 --> 00:33:54.590
in the cryto what happened to him?

849
00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:55.041
I mean,

850
00:33:55.041 --> 00:33:56.650
why is he a,

851
00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:57.620
all of a sudden,

852
00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.430
uh,

853
00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:01.910
become so humble and acquiesce and

854
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.700
what happened to his language about being the gift of the God?

855
00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:10.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

856
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:10.610
<v 0>Well that's,</v>

857
00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:13.690
that's something I want you to think about and maybe I'm sure you,

858
00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:15.130
you want her to talk about in,

859
00:34:15.131 --> 00:34:15.680
in your,

860
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:16.610
in your sections,

861
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:19.520
but let me propose something like the following,

862
00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:20.210
uh,

863
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:23.540
to answer or at least to respond to this,

864
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:24.710
this paradox,

865
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:25.730
this question,

866
00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:34.410
the apology and the cryto represent a attention.

867
00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.920
They represent even a conflict between two more or less permanent and

868
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.060
irreconcilable moral codes.

869
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:46.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

870
00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.970
<v 0>The one represented by Socrates,</v>

871
00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:50.710
regardless of reason,

872
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:56.320
that is to say the sovereign reason of the individual as the highest possible

873
00:34:56.321 --> 00:34:57.154
authority.

874
00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:02.970
It is the philosophers reliance on his own reason that frees him from that

875
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:08.970
dangerous authority of the State and safeguards the individual from complicity

876
00:35:10.331 --> 00:35:13.870
in the injustice and evils that seem to be unnecessary.

877
00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.560
Part of political life here is Socrates,

878
00:35:17.561 --> 00:35:17.950
the,

879
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:19.570
the principal abstainer.

880
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:24.280
But the other moral code is represented by the speech of the laws,

881
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:27.760
where it is the laws of the community.

882
00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.480
It's oldest and deepest beliefs and institutions.

883
00:35:31.481 --> 00:35:33.100
It's its constitution.

884
00:35:33.101 --> 00:35:35.500
It's regime as we would say.

885
00:35:35.501 --> 00:35:40.501
It's Polo Taya that are fundamentally obligatory on the individual and even take

886
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.560
priority,

887
00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.200
uh,

888
00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.780
over the individual.

889
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.050
The one point of view takes the philosophic life,

890
00:35:49.051 --> 00:35:54.051
the examined life to be the one most worth living the other takes the political

891
00:35:54.421 --> 00:35:54.811
life,

892
00:35:54.811 --> 00:35:59.160
the life of the citizen engaged in the business of deliberating,

893
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:00.360
legislating,

894
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:01.560
making war.

895
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.700
And peace is the highest calling for a human being.

896
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:07.850
These constitute to uh,

897
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.970
irreconcilable alternatives to different callings,

898
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:12.450
uh,

899
00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:17.450
so to speak in any attempt I think to reconcile or to synthesize these two can

900
00:36:18.511 --> 00:36:23.511
only lead to a deep injustice to each playdough seems to believe that each of us

901
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:31.101
must choose somehow must choose between one or the other of these two contenders

902
00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.480
for the most serious and worthwhile way of life,

903
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:38.550
which do we take weight,

904
00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:43.580
which is the matter of ultimate concern or care for us,

905
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:46.710
which,

906
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:48.480
but we cannot have both.

907
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:54.740
And I think that distinction to some degree captures the differences set out.

908
00:36:55.501 --> 00:36:58.440
When I asked what the beginning of the class about who,

909
00:36:58.620 --> 00:36:59.040
uh,

910
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.900
believes Socrates is innocent and should be acquitted and who believes he is

911
00:37:03.901 --> 00:37:08.901
guilty and should be condemned between a philosophical and a political point of

912
00:37:09.211 --> 00:37:10.044
view.

913
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.580
And in a sense,

914
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.690
one could say maybe this is not Plato's last word.

915
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:16.550
Uh,

916
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.771
I mean,

917
00:37:16.771 --> 00:37:21.030
why does Socrates choose to stay and drink the hemlock?

918
00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:21.440
Uh,

919
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.320
after all,

920
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:25.650
if he has committed a fundamentally to,

921
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.020
uh,

922
00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.990
the principles of his own reason,

923
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:28.501
still,

924
00:37:28.501 --> 00:37:31.440
why should he care that much about the laws of the city?

925
00:37:31.441 --> 00:37:36.180
Why not let a credo help him escape and go to Crete,

926
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:36.630
uh,

927
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:41.630
where he can drink the good wine of Crete and enjoy his old age.

928
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.051
And in fact,

929
00:37:43.051 --> 00:37:45.150
Plato wrote another dialogue,

930
00:37:45.151 --> 00:37:46.490
his largest dialogue,

931
00:37:46.491 --> 00:37:49.470
a book called the laws where you see an a,

932
00:37:49.471 --> 00:37:54.471
a man simply designated as the Athenian Stranger living in Crete and carrying on

933
00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.860
a conversation with representatives of,

934
00:37:59.070 --> 00:37:59.371
of,

935
00:37:59.371 --> 00:37:59.641
of,

936
00:37:59.641 --> 00:37:59.941
of,

937
00:37:59.941 --> 00:38:01.050
of that society.

938
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:03.080
And that might be Socrates,

939
00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:04.140
that that might be,

940
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:04.770
uh,

941
00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:07.350
although sat he is not identified as Socrates.

942
00:38:07.351 --> 00:38:09.330
It is sometimes thought here,

943
00:38:09.331 --> 00:38:13.530
here is the kind of speech or discussion Socrates would be having had.

944
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:14.363
He escaped.

945
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.710
But let gets back to the question.

946
00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:21.711
Are there reasons Socrates gives cryto for refusing to escape?

947
00:38:21.781 --> 00:38:25.650
The reasons he puts in the mouth of the laws of the city of Athens.

948
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.900
Are those Socrates is true reasons,

949
00:38:27.901 --> 00:38:32.901
just Socrates believe that speech that he constructs between himself and the

950
00:38:33.541 --> 00:38:33.900
laws,

951
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:38.900
or is it simply a fiction that he creates for the sake of relieving his friend,

952
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:41.561
uh,

953
00:38:41.561 --> 00:38:45.520
of the guilt he evidently feels for being unable to help.

954
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.070
Socrates cryto is of course,

955
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.310
very concerned with what people will think of him.

956
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:52.090
Uh,

957
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:54.010
if it becomes known that,

958
00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:54.790
uh,

959
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:59.290
he has somehow not a helped Socrates to escape.

960
00:38:59.540 --> 00:38:59.890
Uh,

961
00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:01.720
is that speech for the law,

962
00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:06.880
a law with the laws really intended for the benefit of Cryto,

963
00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:07.330
uh,

964
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:11.080
rather than an expression of Socrates is deepest,

965
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:11.411
uh,

966
00:39:11.411 --> 00:39:15.340
opinions about the questions of obligation in obedience.

967
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:19.600
Is he in that speech bestowing as it were,

968
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.430
a kind of justice,

969
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.970
uh,

970
00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:22.870
to Cryto,

971
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:23.980
uh,

972
00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.230
to reconcile him,

973
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:26.740
uh,

974
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.980
to the laws of the city and to give him reasons,

975
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:30.730
uh,

976
00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:35.730
you might say rational considerations for a ob continued obedience to the law.

977
00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:38.980
In many ways,

978
00:39:38.981 --> 00:39:43.981
that would seem to make a certain sense of the apparent discrepancy between

979
00:39:44.621 --> 00:39:45.760
these two dialogues.

980
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:47.050
It demonstrates,

981
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.620
uh,

982
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:52.620
not only Socrates's sense of his superiority to the laws of Athens,

983
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:53.590
uh,

984
00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:55.030
for in the first dialogue,

985
00:39:55.031 --> 00:39:57.160
he and the first speech and the apology,

986
00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:58.090
he defies,

987
00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:58.551
uh,

988
00:39:58.551 --> 00:40:00.310
the city to put him to death,

989
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:00.820
uh,

990
00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.980
by expressing indifference to death.

991
00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:04.960
And then in the cryto,

992
00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.040
he very much,

993
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.760
uh,

994
00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:11.760
expresses that indifference to death by refusing to allow Criteo to let him

995
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:12.881
escape.

996
00:40:12.881 --> 00:40:15.660
Socrates seems to remain even until the end,

997
00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.780
very much a kind of law unto himself a while.

998
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:20.620
At the same time,

999
00:40:20.621 --> 00:40:20.981
again,

1000
00:40:20.981 --> 00:40:22.240
providing cryto,

1001
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.841
uh,

1002
00:40:22.841 --> 00:40:24.340
and others like him,

1003
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:27.970
an example of rational and dignified,

1004
00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:28.330
uh,

1005
00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.800
obedience to the law.

1006
00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.560
When we look at the death of Socrates,

1007
00:40:32.561 --> 00:40:34.240
do we think of it as a tragedy?

1008
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:36.250
A is a moral tragedy

1009
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.420
and adjust man,

1010
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:41.080
uh,

1011
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.390
sentenced to death by an unjust law.

1012
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:44.740
I don't think so

1013
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:47.440
far from it.

1014
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.680
Socrates death at the age of 70,

1015
00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:52.150
was intended by him,

1016
00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:52.850
uh,

1017
00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:57.850
as an act of philosophical martyrdom that would allow future philosophy to be

1018
00:40:58.211 --> 00:41:03.211
favorably recognized as a source of courage and justice.

1019
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:05.800
In one of his later letters,

1020
00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:08.380
Plato refers to his attorney.

1021
00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:12.850
He refers to his depiction of Socrates as he says,

1022
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:16.930
his attempt to render Socrates young and beautiful.

1023
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.760
That is you consciously set out to beautify Socrates,

1024
00:41:21.761 --> 00:41:23.350
presenting a man,

1025
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:25.660
a fearless before death,

1026
00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:26.140
uh,

1027
00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:31.140
refusing to participate in any act of injustice while dispensing wisdom and

1028
00:41:31.571 --> 00:41:34.040
justice to those who will listen.

1029
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.680
We don't know the real Socrates.

1030
00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.580
All we know of Socrates is a,

1031
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:43.400
what we read in Plato and Aristotle Monies.

1032
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:43.910
Uh,

1033
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:44.181
and,

1034
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:44.461
and,

1035
00:41:44.461 --> 00:41:49.040
and a small number of others who have sketched various different pictures of

1036
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:49.580
him,

1037
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:50.450
but Plato,

1038
00:41:50.451 --> 00:41:51.320
Socrates,

1039
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:56.650
a is necessarily poles apart from aristophanes's Socrates depiction of him as a

1040
00:41:57.201 --> 00:42:00.710
sort of sofas who makes the weaker argument is stronger.

1041
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:02.840
Plato's dialogues,

1042
00:42:02.841 --> 00:42:07.841
the apology and as well as the republic and the credo are in the broadest sense

1043
00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:13.091
of the term and attempt not only to answer the charge against Aristophanes,

1044
00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.460
but also defend the cause of philosophy.

1045
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:17.960
<v 0>Uh,</v>

1047
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.430
as something of,

1048
00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.140
of value and merit,

1049
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:23.780
where does that leave us today?

1050
00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:26.030
What are we to make of all this?

1051
00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:31.220
We who live in a very different kind of world from that have,

1052
00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:31.851
you know,

1053
00:42:31.851 --> 00:42:34.480
fourth century gethin's.

1054
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:37.940
What can we learn from the example of Socrates?

1055
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:39.230
Most of us,

1056
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:40.820
like most of you earlier,

1057
00:42:40.821 --> 00:42:45.821
find ourselves instinctively taking the side of Socrates against the city of

1058
00:42:48.141 --> 00:42:48.974
Athens.

1059
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:53.780
Those who might defend the city of Athens against Socrates.

1060
00:42:53.781 --> 00:42:57.530
Those who believe in the value of civic piety,

1061
00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:58.150
uh,

1062
00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:00.020
are very few among us.

1063
00:43:00.021 --> 00:43:05.021
Perhaps only those of you who might come from a small town in the south or from

1064
00:43:05.721 --> 00:43:10.580
certain areas of Brooklyn a would understand something about,

1065
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:11.220
uh,

1066
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:11.440
the,

1067
00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:11.631
the,

1068
00:43:11.631 --> 00:43:11.781
the,

1069
00:43:11.781 --> 00:43:13.740
the supreme value of,

1070
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:14.660
of piety.

1071
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:15.141
Uh,

1072
00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:16.160
as a way of life.

1073
00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:16.941
Uh,

1074
00:43:16.941 --> 00:43:21.941
we by and large tend to accept the picture of Socrates,

1075
00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:22.670
uh,

1076
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:24.480
as a victim of,

1077
00:43:24.481 --> 00:43:24.980
uh,

1078
00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.120
of injustice.

1079
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:27.920
We overlook,

1080
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:31.070
we conveniently overlook a number of facts about him,

1081
00:43:31.071 --> 00:43:33.140
his hostility to democracy.

1082
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:34.820
We'll see that in the republic,

1083
00:43:34.821 --> 00:43:38.660
but we've seen it already to some degree in the apology is claimed that the

1084
00:43:38.661 --> 00:43:41.720
lives of his fellow citizens are not worth living.

1085
00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:42.900
Uh,

1086
00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:47.900
and his claim that his way of life has been commanded by a god that no one else

1087
00:43:48.171 --> 00:43:49.820
has ever heard or seen.

1088
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:54.980
None of these seem to make any difference to us and yet I think they should.

1089
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:56.703
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1090
00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.210
<v 0>Given Socrates's claims,</v>

1091
00:43:59.211 --> 00:44:00.380
ask yourself,

1092
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:04.700
what would a responsible body of citizens have done?

1093
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.710
How should they have acted?

1094
00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:11.840
One answer might be to extend greater toleration to civil dissidence like

1095
00:44:11.841 --> 00:44:12.674
Socrates,

1096
00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:15.500
a individuals of heterodox belief,

1097
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:20.780
but whose own views may stimulate others to question and think for themselves

1098
00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:21.680
all to the good.

1099
00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:23.900
Milton John Locke.

1100
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.960
People like Voltaire argued something like this,

1101
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.840
but is that to do justice to Socrates?

1102
00:44:29.841 --> 00:44:34.841
The one thing that does not argue is that play is that Socrates should simply be

1103
00:44:36.061 --> 00:44:41.040
tolerated to tolerate his teaching would seem to trivialize it in some sense,

1104
00:44:41.041 --> 00:44:42.480
to render it harmless.

1105
00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:47.580
The Athenians at least pay Socrates the tribute of taking him seriously,

1106
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.450
uh,

1107
00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:51.030
which is exactly why he is on trial.

1108
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:56.820
The Athenians refuse to tolerate Socrates because they know he is not harmless.

1109
00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.650
That he poses a challenge,

1110
00:44:58.651 --> 00:45:03.651
a fundamental challenge to their way of life and all that they hold to be noble

1111
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:05.730
and worthwhile.

1112
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:10.730
Socrates is not harmless because of his own professed stability to attract

1113
00:45:11.011 --> 00:45:11.820
followers.

1114
00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:12.840
A few today,

1115
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:14.550
a few more tomorrow,

1116
00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:19.610
who knows to tolerate Socrates would be to say to him that we care little for

1117
00:45:20.041 --> 00:45:24.930
our way of life and that we are willing to let you challenge it and impugn it

1118
00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:25.950
every day.

1119
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:27.203
Is that good?

1120
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.133
Is that right?

1121
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:33.890
The trial of Socrates asks us to think about the limits of toleration.

1122
00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.221
What,

1123
00:45:34.221 --> 00:45:35.220
what views,

1124
00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:36.420
if any,

1125
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:36.990
uh,

1126
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:39.330
do we find simply intolerable,

1127
00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:40.830
uh,

1128
00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:45.830
is a healthy society a one that is literally open to every point of view?

1129
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:50.550
Freedom of speech is naturally a cherished good.

1130
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.470
Is it the supreme good?

1131
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:57.770
Should it Trump all other goods or just toleration reach a point when it ceases

1132
00:45:58.831 --> 00:46:03.831
to be toleration and becomes in fact a kind of soft denialism that can extend

1133
00:46:06.151 --> 00:46:11.151
liberty to everything precisely because it takes nothing very seriously.

1134
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:13.470
And by nihilism,

1135
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.110
I mean the view that every preference,

1136
00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:21.260
however squalid base or sorted must be regarded as the legitimate equal of every

1137
00:46:23.461 --> 00:46:24.294
other.

1138
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:29.870
Is this really tolerance or is it rather a form of moral decay that is simply

1139
00:46:30.241 --> 00:46:35.100
decided to abandon the search for truth and standards of judgment?

1140
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:36.480
There's a danger.

1141
00:46:36.481 --> 00:46:41.481
I think that endless tolerance leads to intellectual pacivity and the kind of

1142
00:46:41.761 --> 00:46:45.780
uncritical acceptance of all points of view.

1143
00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:47.070
Well,

1144
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:48.810
so much for that.

1145
00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:49.710
Uh,

1146
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:50.640
what I want to do,

1147
00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:51.170
uh,

1148
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:54.930
I see we're running out of time is if you could think about it,

1149
00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:55.591
maybe hope,

1150
00:46:55.591 --> 00:47:00.591
hold that thought in your mind once in a while between now and Wednesday and

1151
00:47:01.201 --> 00:47:02.640
then Wednesday we will begin,

1152
00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:03.120
uh,

1153
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:03.930
reading,

1154
00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:04.201
uh,

1155
00:47:04.201 --> 00:47:06.030
what is arguably many people,

1156
00:47:06.031 --> 00:47:09.930
some people believe the most important book ever written,

1157
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:12.060
Plato's republic.

1158
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:13.860
See you on Wednesday.
