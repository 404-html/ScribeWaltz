1
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.080
I hope that everybody followed you so's advice

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.760
and yesterday exercised your rights as citizens of a free state

3
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.091
<v 0>hope.</v>

4
00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:18.080
So go ahead.

5
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.700
<v 1>I begin today with an apology.</v>

6
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.710
And that is for the particular edition that you're using for this section of the

7
00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:31.071
class.

8
00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:31.904
And Roussel.

9
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.470
This is the only addition that I've assigned in the course that I don't like.

10
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.970
Why did I assign it?

11
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.590
Because I want us to read the second discourse,

12
00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:49.730
the discourse on inequality and the social contract.

13
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.340
And this is the only addition that I could find where they are both in the same

14
00:00:55.341 --> 00:01:00.230
volume and I don't have to assign two separate books.

15
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.830
So in order to keep your costs down,

16
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.670
I bit the bullet and assigned in a translation in a d and an addition,

17
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:12.080
I don't particularly care for

18
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.810
a far superior addition is found in this.

19
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.510
This is one of the two volumes that Cambridge,

20
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.900
uh,

21
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.780
blue book series is.

22
00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:23.614
It's called,

23
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.510
uh,

24
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.870
edited and translated by Gourevitch.

25
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.220
If anybody wants to do more advanced work in Roussel,

26
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.030
uh,

27
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.010
you will no doubt get this,

28
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.640
uh,

29
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.570
addition,

30
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.100
better translations,

31
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:39.110
better notes and so on of the,

32
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:39.890
uh,

33
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.300
second discourse and,

34
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.830
and the social contract.

35
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.630
And for anybody who's interested,

36
00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:45.464
I've decided,

37
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.240
because Russo has become so important to me,

38
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.291
uh,

39
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:52.370
that next year,

40
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.970
uh,

41
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.800
I will be offering a,

42
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.530
an undergraduate seminar entirely devoted to Roussel.

43
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.911
Uh,

44
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:06.830
he's one of the handful of writers of political philosophers,

45
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:08.360
to whom one could,

46
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.373
you know,

47
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.783
uh,

48
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.833
you know,

49
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.840
justice devote an entire semester to his writings.

50
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.621
And,

51
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:18.860
uh,

52
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.300
that's what I want to do next year.

53
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.270
So if any of you should get the bug,

54
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.800
the Roussel bug next year,

55
00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:28.160
we'll,

56
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.420
we'll do Roussel in,

57
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.860
in,

58
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.200
in many more texts in detail.

59
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.570
So with that,

60
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.830
with that having been said,

61
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.820
I want to talk today about a remarkable,

62
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.920
remarkable human being and writer.

63
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.870
It's a very common way of entering the thought of Rousseau to see him as a

64
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:52.640
critic of liberalism,

65
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.810
of the kind of property owning rights based society,

66
00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.930
uh,

67
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.710
given expression by John Locke.

68
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.240
And I will talk about that a little bit later.

69
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.540
But to see Russo is a critic of Lockian liberalism a would be,

70
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:16.390
I think very short sighted and very unfair.

71
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.340
Russo was a product not of liberal society,

72
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:24.040
but rather of the onsie on regime,

73
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.600
the old regime and France Russo was born in 17,

74
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:29.434
12.

75
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.270
That was two years before the death of the famous Sun King Louis,

76
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:38.290
the 14th man who symbolize the age of absolutism.

77
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.380
And he died in 1778,

78
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.320
uh,

79
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.480
approximately a decade before the outbreak of the French revolution.

80
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:48.340
Uh,

81
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.900
his life in other words,

82
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:51.340
was lived entirely,

83
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.090
uh,

84
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.310
within the waning decades,

85
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:55.510
the waning years,

86
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.200
uh,

87
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.400
of the age of absolutism in France and in continental Europe.

88
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.430
You Russo was deeply aware that he lived in an age of transition,

89
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.860
but what precisely would come after,

90
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.520
uh,

91
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.140
he was by no means clear.

92
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:11.974
He wrote,

93
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.420
as you will see,

94
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.100
a with a passion,

95
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.680
uh,

96
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.260
and in,

97
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.100
and the intensity of someone who fully expected to be instrumental,

98
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.880
uh,

99
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.510
in the coming of a new historical and political,

100
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.990
uh,

101
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.823
epoch.

102
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.190
<v 0>Okay.</v>

103
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.731
<v 1>In indeed,</v>

104
00:04:29.731 --> 00:04:30.564
he was,

105
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.840
Russo was Swiss.

106
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.220
He was not French.

107
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.470
He was a Swiss.

108
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.980
He signed many of his most important words,

109
00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:45.981
simply sit [inaudible] a citizen of Geneva after the city,

110
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.370
uh,

111
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.360
where he was born.

112
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.440
He was the son of an artisan who abandoned his family after a falling out with

113
00:04:55.771 --> 00:04:56.910
the local authorities.

114
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.930
And the,

115
00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.160
and the young Roussel,

116
00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.761
uh,

117
00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:00.080
was it,

118
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.210
uh,

119
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.190
was apprentice to an engraver,

120
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.950
but he left Geneva.

121
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.240
He fled Geneva,

122
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.840
uh,

123
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.673
for good,

124
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.010
uh,

125
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.170
at the age of 16

126
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.550
for the following 16 years,

127
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.820
Russo lived a kind of vagabond,

128
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.440
varied life,

129
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.050
doing many different things,

130
00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:22.880
working,

131
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.100
uh,

132
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.220
as a music instructor and a transcriber.

133
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.970
Uh,

134
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.740
he was the secretary of,

135
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.440
to the French ambassador in the city of Venice.

136
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.341
Uh,

137
00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:35.850
and he was also the lover of a wealthy woman.

138
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.360
Uh,

139
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.320
many years,

140
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.550
his senior

141
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.140
after moving to Paris in 1744 ru,

142
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.330
so spent several years eking out a living,

143
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.680
a sort of on the margins of the Parisian literary scene until 1750 when he

144
00:05:56.371 --> 00:05:58.670
published his first,

145
00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.211
uh,

146
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:01.700
although quite brief major essay,

147
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.210
a work called the discourse and the arts and the sciences,

148
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.450
which catapulted him to lit two literary fame that work made his name.

149
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.853
So it was,

150
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.380
it came to be called the first discourse.

151
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.870
That work was followed,

152
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.460
uh,

153
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.460
five years later in 1755 by the work we will be reading starting today,

154
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.330
the discourse and the origins of inequality often simply called the second

155
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.410
discourse.

156
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.390
And that work was followed,

157
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.110
uh,

158
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.190
later on in 1762 with the social contract.

159
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.550
And also the same year that Roussel published his major massive work on

160
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:47.000
political education called in meal or an education,

161
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:50.570
both in 1762 during this period,

162
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.070
a Russo,

163
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.030
uh,

164
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.950
fathered five children,

165
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.910
uh,

166
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.270
he abandoned all of them to an orphanage.

167
00:06:59.660 --> 00:06:59.961
Uh,

168
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.960
he did so with a common law wife,

169
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.351
uh,

170
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:04.670
with whom he lived,

171
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.823
uh,

172
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:06.201
in,

173
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:07.430
during this times.

174
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.790
The writings I've mentioned are only a small portion,

175
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:14.240
although a very important portion of the writings,

176
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.640
ah,

177
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.381
which he lived.

178
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:18.680
He was also the author of a very large novel.

179
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.060
Halloween is the new Halloween is the new vowel Halloween's,

180
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.420
which was a best seller,

181
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.031
uh,

182
00:07:24.031 --> 00:07:24.950
in his time.

183
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.880
And it was a kind of philosophical novel that helped you,

184
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.870
that explored many of his ideas.

185
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.470
He was the composer of an opera [inaudible] de village.

186
00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:37.430
W there was a performed at the court of Louis the 15th.

187
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.391
Uh,

188
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:42.890
and he also wrote several very important and interesting volumes of

189
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:43.970
autobiography.

190
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:44.481
Uh,

191
00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:45.650
the most famous,

192
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.890
the best known of which is simply called confessions,

193
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.570
uh,

194
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.920
after the work of Saint Augustan,

195
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.000
a title,

196
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.380
a book of the same name.

197
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.270
And he also wrote another,

198
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.410
uh,

199
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.400
volume of,

200
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.761
of,

201
00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:02.780
of autobiography in a dialogue farm called Russo.

202
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:07.781
Jewish does genre Jacques in which he divides himself up into two different

203
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:08.331
people,

204
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:13.331
Russo and John Shock and kind of internal interrogation of himself.

205
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:19.781
Russo wrote in many and varied genres and his work spans the entire gamut of

206
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.650
philosophical,

207
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:27.140
literary and political themes.

208
00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:28.270
He was also the,

209
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.260
the writer of the,

210
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:33.860
or the different constitutional projects.

211
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.650
He was consulted by heads of state,

212
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:37.280
uh,

213
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.280
in his period and wrote constitutions for,

214
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.330
for uh,

215
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.433
Poland.

216
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:42.800
Uh,

217
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.640
and for this small island country of Corsica,

218
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.740
which he said in the social contract was the only place in Europe that one might

219
00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:53.360
expect great things.

220
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.260
And of course he was right.

221
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:55.950
Uh,

222
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.750
is anybody knows a generation or two later the famous Corsican yes.

223
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.131
Who put an end to,

224
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:03.240
who am I talking about?

225
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:04.981
Napoleon?

226
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:05.814
Of course.

227
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.273
Uh,

228
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.670
you might say he was right.

229
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:13.590
He helped to substitute the generals will for the general will,

230
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.010
but that was Nepal that was resolved.

231
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.740
People have been very baffled by exactly the nature of Rousseau's contributions.

232
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:24.900
What did he believe?

233
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:26.880
What did he stand for?

234
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:29.250
What do his writings represent?

235
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:30.750
Was he a revolutionary,

236
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:31.670
uh,

237
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:36.630
whose work help to inspire the radical phases of the French revolution?

238
00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:37.351
Just remember,

239
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:38.220
for example,

240
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.990
you've probably all heard the famous opening sentence of the social contract man

241
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:44.130
is born free,

242
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:44.731
uh,

243
00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:46.890
but is everywhere in chains.

244
00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:47.460
Uh,

245
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.390
his appeal,

246
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:49.320
uh,

247
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.320
to the severe political ethics of Ancient Sparta and Rome,

248
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.630
as well as his belief that the people,

249
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.441
uh,

250
00:09:58.441 --> 00:10:02.490
the people in their collective capacity or the only legitimate source of

251
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:03.324
sovereignty,

252
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.480
all of these seem to pave the way for the revolutionary politics of the late

253
00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:12.330
18th and century and,

254
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:12.721
and,

255
00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:14.970
and up and up into our own time.

256
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.250
So it was Russolo kind of incendiary and revolutionary,

257
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.120
or did his writings seek to release us all together from the bonds of society as

258
00:10:26.881 --> 00:10:31.800
he appears to do in the second discourse and the discourse on inequality in this

259
00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:32.520
work,

260
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.110
Russo seems to lay the basis for the kind of romantic individualism,

261
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:37.860
uh,

262
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.860
that would be associated with people like Wordsworth in England or Henry David

263
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:45.150
Thoreau in America.

264
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.000
Russo's direct appeals to nature as well as his,

265
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:55.390
as his celebration of the simplicity of peasant life and rural life seem to open

266
00:10:56.731 --> 00:10:59.870
the door later on to writers like Tolstoy,

267
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.481
uh,

268
00:11:00.481 --> 00:11:05.481
as well as to various kinds of social experiments in rural communal utopianism

269
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.271
such as,

270
00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:10.021
for example,

271
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:11.640
the Israeli kibbutz and movement,

272
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.750
which is in its own way a direct descendant of Rousseau.

273
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:21.380
So my suggestion is Rousseau's writings are varied and his influence has been a

274
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.560
manifold just to say the least.

275
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:28.583
Um,

276
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.390
he both helps to bring to fruition and completion.

277
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:34.140
Uh,

278
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.370
the political and intellectual movement that we know is the enlightenment.

279
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.960
He brings this to its highest phase of perfection in many ways.

280
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.580
And at the same time,

281
00:11:44.581 --> 00:11:48.750
he was a severe critic of the enlightenment.

282
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:49.560
A,

283
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.800
he was a close friend and associate of men like Dda,

284
00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:54.010
uh,

285
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.540
who,

286
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:54.880
uh,

287
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.230
was the general editor of the encyclopedia,

288
00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.083
the great,

289
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.460
the great French contribution to the age of the enlightenment.

290
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:08.790
And yet he excoriated the progress of the arts and the sciences and,

291
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:10.301
and,

292
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:10.661
and,

293
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:15.580
and worried about their effect on the moral life of communities.

294
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.730
He was a writer who wore different hats.

295
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:19.271
Uh,

296
00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:22.990
he defended what he called the savage survive,

297
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:23.501
uh,

298
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:25.720
against the civilized man.

299
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:26.170
Uh,

300
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.350
he took the side of the poor and the dispossessed,

301
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:29.851
uh,

302
00:12:29.851 --> 00:12:34.851
against the elites and he adopted the posture of the loyal son and a citizen of

303
00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:41.380
Geneva against the sophisticated per region intellectuals,

304
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:41.780
uh,

305
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.700
if his time.

306
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.360
So who was Russo and what did he stand for?

307
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:46.990
Uh,

308
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.990
that's what I want us to begin to try to find out a little about today.

309
00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.053
<v 0>Okay.</v>

310
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.453
It's all right with y'all.

311
00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.773
That works.

312
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.333
Okay.

313
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.630
The second discourse,

314
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.730
the discourse on inequality is in

315
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.900
<v 1>the eyes of many readers Russo's greatest work.</v>

316
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:16.100
I'm not sure if that's true,

317
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.080
but many people believe it is,

318
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:24.250
it is what writers in the 18th century called a conjectural history.

319
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.223
<v 0>Okay.</v>

320
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.861
<v 1>It is that,</v>

321
00:13:27.861 --> 00:13:30.920
it's just a kind of philosophical history really.

322
00:13:30.921 --> 00:13:35.210
That is to say a philosophical reconstruction of history,

323
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.200
but not of what actually happened in the past.

324
00:13:39.201 --> 00:13:41.660
It's not a history of facts and dates,

325
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:43.700
but it is a history.

326
00:13:43.701 --> 00:13:48.590
Russo believes of what had to have happened for in a way,

327
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.310
human beings to evolve to their current condition.

328
00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:58.270
Rousseau begins the work by comparing the effects of history on us to the

329
00:13:59.181 --> 00:14:00.740
statute of glaucous.

330
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:01.490
Uh,

331
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.641
did,

332
00:14:01.641 --> 00:14:06.470
he says the winds and storms had so disfigured that it's scarcely looked like a

333
00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:07.670
human being at all.

334
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.510
This is what history in time has done to us.

335
00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.590
It has so affected and transformed human nature did.

336
00:14:15.591 --> 00:14:19.610
If we want to understand what human nature really is,

337
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:24.850
he argues it is necessary to reconstruct it through a kind of thought

338
00:14:25.341 --> 00:14:26.180
experiment.

339
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.463
<v 0>Okay.</v>

340
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.080
<v 1>Russo at the outset,</v>

341
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:33.761
<v 0>is that okay?</v>

342
00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:34.270
Is that,

343
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.103
was that for me?

344
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:38.350
Okay.

345
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.950
No,

346
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:39.783
uh,

347
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.770
if it was my wife,

348
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.080
I tell her I'll get the canola is not to worry.

349
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.580
<v 1>Roussel compares the second one.</v>

350
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.413
<v 0>Describe.</v>

351
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:03.620
Oh dear.

352
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.453
All right.

353
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.610
Roussel compare

354
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.960
<v 1>bad to laugh at your own,</v>

355
00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:20.870
you know,

356
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:21.703
<v 0>jokes.</v>

357
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.680
He

358
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.390
<v 1>compares the second discourse,</v>

359
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.403
uh,

360
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.920
to an experiment like those undertaken by physicists and cosmologists in his own

361
00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:38.681
day who speculate about the origins of the universe in the same way that he's,

362
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.890
he is speculating about the original condition of human nature.

363
00:15:42.891 --> 00:15:43.880
That is to say,

364
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:44.750
uh,

365
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:49.750
there is no empirical or physical evidence to draw on to understand how the

366
00:15:50.121 --> 00:15:51.980
world was actually framed.

367
00:15:51.981 --> 00:15:53.090
We can only make,

368
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:53.811
he says,

369
00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:55.340
intelligent guesses,

370
00:15:55.341 --> 00:16:00.341
certain inferences or conjectures based on the evidence that we find around us.

371
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:05.960
And so Roussel remarks in one of the most arresting passages from his book and

372
00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:08.660
Russo is a man known for writing,

373
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.530
arresting,

374
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:13.130
paradoxical and and ingenious sentences.

375
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.791
He writes,

376
00:16:13.791 --> 00:16:17.420
let us therefore begin by putting aside all the facts.

377
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:22.450
Let us put all the stacks facts aside for they have no bearing on the case.

378
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:28.010
The investigation that may be undertaken concerning this subject should not be

379
00:16:28.011 --> 00:16:30.000
taken for historical truth.

380
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.943
He says,

381
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.700
but only for hypothetical and conditional reasonings.

382
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.381
In other words,

383
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:41.381
what he's saying is that the history that he intends to unfold is an experiment,

384
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.840
much like again,

385
00:16:42.841 --> 00:16:47.841
net undertaken by geologists who try to infer the development of plant or animal

386
00:16:48.531 --> 00:16:53.150
life from the existence of certain fossil remains or skeletal remains.

387
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.130
And yet at the same time,

388
00:16:55.131 --> 00:16:57.980
while Russo speaks of his work is tentative,

389
00:16:57.981 --> 00:16:59.870
experimental conjectural,

390
00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.420
he is only hazarded some guesses.

391
00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:03.254
He writes,

392
00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:08.320
you cannot help but be struck by the certain tone of confidence,

393
00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:10.131
uh,

394
00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:12.410
with which he presents his findings.

395
00:17:12.411 --> 00:17:13.310
In particular,

396
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:18.080
he discusses and rejects quite emphatically the investigations of his

397
00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:19.010
predecessors,

398
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:20.390
both ancient and modern.

399
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.250
The philosophers he wrote to have examined the foundations of society of all

400
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:28.310
felt the necessity of returning to the state of nature,

401
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.860
but none of them has reached it.

402
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:35.870
Rousseau says he believes that he alone has finally,

403
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.471
as it were,

404
00:17:36.471 --> 00:17:37.610
struck gold.

405
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:38.863
Oh Man.

406
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:39.770
He exclaimed,

407
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.491
Oh man,

408
00:17:40.491 --> 00:17:42.380
whatever country you may be from,

409
00:17:42.381 --> 00:17:44.330
whatever your opinions may be.

410
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.283
Listen,

411
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.240
here is your history.

412
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.590
As I have thought to read it,

413
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:53.010
not in the books of your fellow men who are liars,

414
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.510
but in nature,

415
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.860
who never lies.

416
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.670
That's a remarkable sentence for the first time.

417
00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:00.421
Rousseau says,

418
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:02.400
human nature will be revealed.

419
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.580
And the history of civil society explained,

420
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.330
explained to us here,

421
00:18:07.331 --> 00:18:07.620
Ma,

422
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.131
listen,

423
00:18:08.131 --> 00:18:09.780
here is your history.

424
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:10.290
It's,

425
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.250
I have read it,

426
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.780
not through other books,

427
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.100
but through nature.

428
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:14.851
He says,

429
00:18:14.851 --> 00:18:19.770
that seems to speak directly to me or to which I have,

430
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:20.300
uh,

431
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.133
an insight.

432
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.270
So what is the state of nature,

433
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.000
a term that we've been looking at in Hobbes and Locke?

434
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.420
What is it that Rousseau thinks he has found that the,

435
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.370
that alluded his predecessors.

436
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:33.170
<v 0>Okay.</v>

437
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:34.730
<v 1>In many ways we've already seen,</v>

438
00:18:34.731 --> 00:18:38.870
I've already suggested Roussel follows in the footsteps of his great

439
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:39.890
predecessors,

440
00:18:39.891 --> 00:18:42.020
particularly Hobbes and Locke,

441
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.820
and attempting to understand the original condition,

442
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:47.300
uh,

443
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:52.300
by referring to this hypothetical or conjectural state of nature.

444
00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.241
In many ways,

445
00:18:53.241 --> 00:18:57.380
he praises and follows a Hobbes and Locke in doing this,

446
00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:02.530
but suggests that they never really took the problem of nature seriously enough.

447
00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:04.131
Uh,

448
00:19:04.131 --> 00:19:05.360
what does it mean?

449
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.000
Roussel seems to ask us to take nature,

450
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:08.720
uh,

451
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.620
human nature,

452
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.640
the state of nature.

453
00:19:10.641 --> 00:19:13.490
What does it mean to take nature seriously

454
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:18.411
again,

455
00:19:18.411 --> 00:19:19.580
to understand it,

456
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.290
but to understand human nature?

457
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.700
What it originally is,

458
00:19:22.701 --> 00:19:27.701
is to conduct a sort of thought experiment where we peel away almost like the

459
00:19:28.311 --> 00:19:29.570
layers of an onion.

460
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:30.260
Uh,

461
00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:35.260
everything that we have acquired through the influence of time of history,

462
00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:40.960
of custom and tradition in order to discover what is naturally there.

463
00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.120
So when Hobbs tells us,

464
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:44.811
uh,

465
00:19:44.811 --> 00:19:49.310
or when he attributes to natural man certain warlike propensities,

466
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.310
Rousseau figures that this cannot be right,

467
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:57.610
a war and the passions that give rise to war can only come into being once we

468
00:19:57.981 --> 00:19:59.420
are in society.

469
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.470
The state of war is really the simply the state of society.

470
00:20:03.471 --> 00:20:07.820
This cannot be hold for natural man because natural,

471
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:12.850
the natural conditions had no so strong social relationships of this sword.

472
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.670
And you might say his statement was Ditto for John Locke.

473
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.910
When lock attributes to us in the state of nature,

474
00:20:19.911 --> 00:20:23.060
certain qualities of rationality,

475
00:20:23.061 --> 00:20:24.080
of industry,

476
00:20:24.081 --> 00:20:25.250
of acquisitiveness.

477
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.520
These two Roussel complaints are only qualities that we can acquire in the light

478
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:31.641
of society.

479
00:20:31.641 --> 00:20:35.330
Property entails social relations between persons,

480
00:20:35.331 --> 00:20:37.550
relations of justice and injustice.

481
00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.990
And Man in the state of nature is not a social animal.

482
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:47.950
So it is clear for Roussel that human nature is something infinitely remote and

483
00:20:48.521 --> 00:20:49.480
strange.

484
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.110
Uh,

485
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:55.110
then any of his predecessors had ever imagined what was the condition of natural

486
00:20:56.291 --> 00:21:01.291
man Russo's captivated readers in his time and since by showing that the

487
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:08.310
original condition of human nature was far more like an animal than anything,

488
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.320
uh,

489
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:16.320
identifiably or recognizably Human Russo takes great delight in analyzing a

490
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.630
human nature.

491
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:24.690
Analyzing us when Aristotle said that man is the rational being because we

492
00:21:24.911 --> 00:21:26.770
possess speech or logos,

493
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.750
Rousseau says wrong.

494
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:29.733
Again,

495
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:35.010
language is dependent upon society and could only have developed over literally

496
00:21:35.411 --> 00:21:39.160
thousands of generations and cannot be a property,

497
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:39.511
uh,

498
00:21:39.511 --> 00:21:40.600
of natural man.

499
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:45.370
Human nature is a little different from animal nature and in many ways Russo

500
00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:46.720
delights in.

501
00:21:46.721 --> 00:21:51.420
You can see this in his footnotes in particular in investigating or stories

502
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:56.320
about a rang of tanks and other species that he believes in many ways are our

503
00:21:56.321 --> 00:21:57.700
distant ancestors.

504
00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:58.331
Uh,

505
00:21:58.331 --> 00:22:00.640
you might say a century before Darwin,

506
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.910
a Russo could just have easily entitled his second discourse on the origins of

507
00:22:06.911 --> 00:22:07.780
the species.

508
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.213
Uh,

509
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.250
in many ways the whole science of,

510
00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:12.580
you know,

511
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.870
evolutionary biology is already in many ways implicit here.

512
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:22.260
And yet for all of our features are common features with other species.

513
00:22:22.691 --> 00:22:26.860
Russo specifies two qualities that set us apart.

514
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:33.030
The first is the quality of freedom or what he calls free agency.

515
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.280
Although he understands this and this very specific way,

516
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.410
let me read a relevant,

517
00:22:38.411 --> 00:22:40.990
are crucial passage in any animal,

518
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:41.350
uh,

519
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.370
Roussel rights.

520
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:42.671
Uh,

521
00:22:42.671 --> 00:22:47.671
in any animal I see nothing but an ingenious machine to which nature has given,

522
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:48.940
uh,

523
00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.940
senses in order for it to renew its strength and to protect itself to a certain

524
00:22:54.551 --> 00:22:55.260
point,

525
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:55.510
uh,

526
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.030
from all that tends to disturb it.

527
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:02.650
I am aware of precisely the same thing in the human machine.

528
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.311
In other words,

529
00:23:03.311 --> 00:23:03.970
he says,

530
00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:08.970
animals are just simply little machines that operate by a mechanical or,

531
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.950
or physical impulses and needs and desires.

532
00:23:14.951 --> 00:23:16.120
And the same is true.

533
00:23:16.121 --> 00:23:17.500
He says in the human,

534
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.620
a machine with this difference,

535
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:25.830
that nature alone does everything in the operations of an animal where his man

536
00:23:26.021 --> 00:23:30.610
contributes as a free agent to his own operations.

537
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.960
Man contributes as a free agent to his own operations.

538
00:23:34.961 --> 00:23:36.580
What does he mean there?

539
00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:39.610
And saying that man is a free agent.

540
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:40.181
Uh,

541
00:23:40.181 --> 00:23:45.181
this idea of free agency in many ways sounds similar and indeed it is to Hobbes

542
00:23:46.641 --> 00:23:47.181
and Locke,

543
00:23:47.181 --> 00:23:49.460
both of whom who said freedom,

544
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:50.001
uh,

545
00:23:50.001 --> 00:23:50.630
free,

546
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.160
free freedom of will,

547
00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:53.750
some kind of freedom is,

548
00:23:53.751 --> 00:23:54.230
is,

549
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:59.230
is a characteristic of natural man or natural pre-social ah,

550
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:00.501
man.

551
00:24:00.501 --> 00:24:03.020
But Roussel seems to add to this something different.

552
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:09.130
Freedom for Hobbes or Locke simply means the freedom to choose to do this or

553
00:24:10.341 --> 00:24:15.341
that the freedom to exercise the will and not to be interfered with by others

554
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:17.923
around us.

555
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.880
Roussel also believes that,

556
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:20.361
uh,

557
00:24:20.361 --> 00:24:22.700
but in many ways he adds something else to it.

558
00:24:22.701 --> 00:24:26.440
He connects freedom in this same passage to what he calls the,

559
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:27.950
the phenomenon or the,

560
00:24:27.951 --> 00:24:30.610
or the quality of the Faculty of perfectability.

561
00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:32.800
Perfectibility tay,

562
00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.720
what does he mean in connecting freedom with,

563
00:24:35.721 --> 00:24:40.721
he calls with what he calls perfectability perfectability for Rousseau suggests

564
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.760
an openness,

565
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:45.410
a sort of unlimit,

566
00:24:45.411 --> 00:24:48.530
virtually unlimited openness to change.

567
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.310
Uh,

568
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:54.310
we are the species who not only have the freedom to do this or that,

569
00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:00.820
but we are the species who have the freedom as it were to become this or that.

570
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:06.490
It is our very openness to change that accounts for our mutability over time as

571
00:25:08.961 --> 00:25:09.830
a species.

572
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.611
In other words,

573
00:25:10.611 --> 00:25:11.151
we are,

574
00:25:11.151 --> 00:25:11.751
you might say,

575
00:25:11.751 --> 00:25:13.610
uniquely under determined,

576
00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:14.240
uh,

577
00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:19.240
meaning that our nature is not confined in advance to what it may become.

578
00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.351
Rather,

579
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:26.351
our nature for Russo is uniquely suited to alter and transform itself,

580
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:27.581
uh,

581
00:25:27.581 --> 00:25:30.620
as circumstances change and as we adapt,

582
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:35.300
adapt and adopt to new and unforeseen situations.

583
00:25:35.301 --> 00:25:39.500
Perfectability for result is not so much a feature of the individual,

584
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.500
but it is as it is of the species.

585
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:43.551
And again,

586
00:25:43.551 --> 00:25:48.551
whereas Hobbes or Locke assume that human nature itself remained more or less

587
00:25:48.861 --> 00:25:49.730
constant,

588
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:50.391
uh,

589
00:25:50.391 --> 00:25:54.170
in the transition from what they called the state of nature to the civil state.

590
00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:54.741
Uh,

591
00:25:54.741 --> 00:25:59.741
Russo believes that human nature has undergone manifold revolutions is,

592
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.800
as he called it,

593
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:01.820
over this source,

594
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:02.331
uh,

595
00:26:02.331 --> 00:26:03.200
of time.

596
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:08.350
What we are at any one phase of human history or human evolution will be very,

597
00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:14.810
very different from what we are at any other particular phase.

598
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:19.810
And it is this what he calls distinctive and unlimited faculty that he says,

599
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:24.080
is that also the source of all of our misfortunes?

600
00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:29.150
So when he says that we are characterized by freedom and associates freedom with

601
00:26:29.151 --> 00:26:30.230
perfectability,

602
00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.330
he doesn't necessarily mean,

603
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:33.110
uh,

604
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.680
by perfectability that which,

605
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:35.990
uh,

606
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:37.100
perfects us.

607
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:42.430
He also says it is that which is at the source of our miseries and our dis

608
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.640
content's in many ways.

609
00:26:44.641 --> 00:26:47.160
If you wanted to give this book another title,

610
00:26:47.161 --> 00:26:50.250
I've already suggested one for the origin of the species.

611
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.780
It could just as well have been called more than a century before Freud

612
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.630
civilization and its discontents,

613
00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:58.111
uh,

614
00:26:58.111 --> 00:27:02.490
which was in many ways Fried's attempt to rewrite Russo's account of the

615
00:27:02.491 --> 00:27:04.710
evolution of the human species.

616
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:10.640
But Russo notes in this same park that freedom or perfectibility is not our sole

617
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.520
natural characteristic,

618
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:18.720
although it is responsible in some way for almost everything that we have

619
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:19.470
become.

620
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.490
Everything that we have become is due to this openness to change.

621
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:24.090
Uh,

622
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:29.090
in addition to perfectability and freedom is the quality that Rousseau calls PTA

623
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.343
or pity,

624
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.670
compassion.

625
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.860
And here is in a sense,

626
00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:38.430
Russo at his most characteristic you could say,

627
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.550
here is Roussel the founder of Romanticism.

628
00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.253
<v 0>Okay.</v>

629
00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.630
<v 1>Man is not the rational animal,</v>

630
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.740
the thinking being the being with logos,

631
00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:56.370
but we are the sensitive creature who so fines all kinds of evidence,

632
00:27:59.500 --> 00:27:59.870
uh,

633
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.550
for assuming that compassion is part of our original nature.

634
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.580
He notes in other species a reluctance,

635
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:07.420
uh,

636
00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:11.950
to witness the pain or suffering of another of its own kind.

637
00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.780
How an animal will not,

638
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:14.943
uh,

639
00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:20.160
wish to walk near a dead member of its own species.

640
00:28:20.411 --> 00:28:23.100
That seems to indicate to Rousseau,

641
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:23.680
um,

642
00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.090
even in the other species,

643
00:28:25.091 --> 00:28:27.430
a kind of natural core of,

644
00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:29.380
of compassion or pity.

645
00:28:29.381 --> 00:28:34.381
The fact that we cry at the misfortunes of others who have nothing to do with us

646
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.290
is evidence of our original sensitivity.

647
00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:40.390
Uh,

648
00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.550
do we not enjoy crying and movies?

649
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.100
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

650
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.350
<v 1>it's someone in here ever cried in a movie.</v>

651
00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:47.690
Yes.

652
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:47.910
Dot.

653
00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:48.743
We all have,

654
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:50.280
uh,

655
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.470
even at people or objects that don't exist.

656
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.630
Did we not feel pity for King Kong?

657
00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:59.460
When we saw that movie,

658
00:28:59.461 --> 00:29:00.031
did we not?

659
00:29:00.031 --> 00:29:03.330
Did we not feel pity for a fictional creature that could,

660
00:29:03.331 --> 00:29:04.260
could not exist,

661
00:29:04.261 --> 00:29:04.921
but yet,

662
00:29:04.921 --> 00:29:05.460
whose,

663
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:10.460
whose faith somehow effected us in some way and Rousseau would under completely

664
00:29:11.161 --> 00:29:13.680
understands us in giving man tears.

665
00:29:13.681 --> 00:29:18.681
Rousseau writes nature bears witness that she gave the human race the softest of

666
00:29:19.051 --> 00:29:19.884
hearts.

667
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:23.940
The softest of hearts man is the sensitive creature.

668
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:30.140
So much so that reus so finds evidence in this for what he believes is our

669
00:29:30.151 --> 00:29:31.440
natural goodness.

670
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:37.160
The natural goodness of man in the state of nature is to some degree borne out

671
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:42.890
by this quality of pity or compassion that we even share with are their species.

672
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.040
Why does Russo emphasize this quality?

673
00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:49.870
Because it is deeply important to him.

674
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.633
Uh,

675
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:52.810
you might say

676
00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.490
long before Dr Phil in thousands of other,

677
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:00.881
you know,

678
00:30:00.881 --> 00:30:02.630
self help gurus and,

679
00:30:02.631 --> 00:30:04.110
and self help manuals,

680
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.630
Roussel taught us to get in touch with our feelings.

681
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:13.810
One natural man may be compassionate and kind.

682
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.753
However,

683
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:21.330
that sentiment he tells us is easily overpowered by more powerful passions.

684
00:30:21.761 --> 00:30:23.500
Once we enter society,

685
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.470
once we become civilized or socialized,

686
00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:32.040
we see once we are in society to care about others and we become calculating in

687
00:30:33.371 --> 00:30:34.204
mercenary,

688
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.291
in our motives.

689
00:30:35.291 --> 00:30:36.700
Selfishness and ego.

690
00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:40.810
Ism are in fact reinforced for him by the development of reason.

691
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.960
Reason he writes is what in genders,

692
00:30:43.961 --> 00:30:47.050
egoism and reflections strengthens it.

693
00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.470
The development of rationality.

694
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:51.723
He thinks,

695
00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:52.390
uh,

696
00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:57.390
simply hastens or corruption by the assisting in the development of different

697
00:30:57.761 --> 00:30:58.450
vices.

698
00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.640
And the task of the second discourse,

699
00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.950
at least it's rhetorical task,

700
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:06.160
is in many ways to recover our natural selves,

701
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.210
compassionate,

702
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:08.080
gentle,

703
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:13.080
kind from the artificial corrupt and calculating selves we have all become in

704
00:31:14.561 --> 00:31:19.561
civil society and who can't read that in Roussel without realizing that there is

705
00:31:20.591 --> 00:31:24.490
a significant germ of truth in what?

706
00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:25.750
In what he says.

707
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:27.383
Um,

708
00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:33.240
did you so believe it possible then or desirable to return to this state of

709
00:31:33.611 --> 00:31:34.690
nature to risk,

710
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:39.910
to return to some kind of Prelab Sarian condition before the beginnings of civil

711
00:31:39.911 --> 00:31:40.744
society?

712
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:43.570
He is frequently read as saying this,

713
00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:44.111
uh,

714
00:31:44.111 --> 00:31:48.490
when Voltaire wrote a red rather the second discourse,

715
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:49.001
he said,

716
00:31:49.001 --> 00:31:54.001
never has so much intelligence been expended in the attempt to turn us back into

717
00:31:54.281 --> 00:31:56.950
brutes and that is clever.

718
00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:57.460
Uh,

719
00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.110
but it's not really right.

720
00:31:59.130 --> 00:31:59.740
Uh,

721
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:04.600
Voltaire surely knew that 150 years before Russo,

722
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.040
uh,

723
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:09.980
there was a French writer by the name of Montana,

724
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:11.440
Michelle de Montalban,

725
00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:16.860
who had written an important essay called on cannibals in which he described the

726
00:32:17.531 --> 00:32:20.260
Indian tribes off the coast of Brazil,

727
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:25.830
whom he praised against the true savagery and barbarism of their European

728
00:32:26.171 --> 00:32:27.004
conquerors.

729
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:29.410
When he calls that essay,

730
00:32:29.411 --> 00:32:30.430
that famous essay,

731
00:32:30.431 --> 00:32:33.460
Michelle Call Montanan calls of cannibals.

732
00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.700
It is an open question of who the cannibals are.

733
00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:40.160
Are they that the natives of the Brazilian coast

734
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:45.340
or are they again the European conquerors and maintain like Rousseau,

735
00:32:46.701 --> 00:32:50.210
but a century or more before praised?

736
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:50.901
Uh,

737
00:32:50.901 --> 00:32:55.490
in many ways the qualities and the capacities of these survive,

738
00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:55.940
uh,

739
00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.940
that he discovered a and contrasted them to that bloodthirsty cruelty of the

740
00:33:01.941 --> 00:33:02.810
Europeans,

741
00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:03.470
uh,

742
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:04.460
of his own day.

743
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:09.461
Russo was deeply influenced by this particular essay and it's a short essay and

744
00:33:09.651 --> 00:33:12.620
I would suggest at some point when you have a chance you read it,

745
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:18.520
but in any case Roussel makes it plain that return to the state of nature or

746
00:33:19.041 --> 00:33:24.041
some kind of pre social or pre civil state is no longer an option for civilized

747
00:33:24.651 --> 00:33:25.101
beings.

748
00:33:25.101 --> 00:33:26.270
In one of the footnotes,

749
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:28.070
and I encourage you to read the footnote,

750
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.750
very important footnotes in his,

751
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.613
in his book,

752
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.550
Rousseau writes,

753
00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:36.551
what then must we destroy societies and Naya late dine in mind and return to

754
00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:40.700
live in the forest with the bears a conclusion.

755
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.040
He writes in a style of my adversaries,

756
00:33:43.041 --> 00:33:48.041
which I prefer to anticipate rather than to leave to them the shame of drawing

757
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.460
and he says,

758
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.121
in other words,

759
00:33:50.121 --> 00:33:50.571
no,

760
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:55.100
we can't do that or return to the state of nature is impossible for us for the

761
00:33:55.101 --> 00:33:59.900
same reason it would be like returning a domestic animal back to the wild.

762
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:05.290
They and we have simply lost our instinct for self preservation.

763
00:34:05.391 --> 00:34:09.680
It has been dulled by continual association and dependence on others.

764
00:34:09.681 --> 00:34:12.260
We would not last a single day.

765
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:15.380
So if a return to nature is impossible,

766
00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:19.910
the only alternative in some way is to remain in society.

767
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:23.570
But before we can learn how to live in society,

768
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:29.470
Roussel wants to tell the story of how it is man became civilized,

769
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.033
so to speak.

770
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:36.100
How the transition from nature to culture or from nature to society in fact

771
00:34:37.101 --> 00:34:37.934
occurred.

772
00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:42.213
<v 0>Uh,</v>

773
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:46.760
<v 1>in one sense,</v>

774
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:48.343
<v 0>okay.</v>

775
00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:53.130
<v 1>Russo's account of this story can be given in a single word</v>

776
00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:55.413
<v 0>property.</v>

777
00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:02.500
<v 1>The first sentence of part two of the discourse reads as follows,</v>

778
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:08.710
the first person who having enclosed a piece of land took it into his head to

779
00:35:08.711 --> 00:35:10.030
say this is mine,

780
00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.860
and found people simple enough to believe him was the true founder of civil

781
00:35:14.861 --> 00:35:15.694
society.

782
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:17.110
<v 0>Okay?</v>

783
00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.530
<v 1>Lock would certainly agree in some respects,</v>

784
00:35:20.531 --> 00:35:23.140
but Roussel continues as follows.

785
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:24.940
<v 0>Okay?</v>

786
00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.220
<v 1>What crimes was murderers,</v>

787
00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:28.173
murderers,

788
00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.350
what miseries and horrors with the human race have been spared?

789
00:35:32.351 --> 00:35:33.910
Had someone pulled up,

790
00:35:33.911 --> 00:35:38.280
the stakes are filled in the ditch and cried out to his fellow men,

791
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.490
do not listen to this imposter.

792
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.760
You are lost if you forget that the fruits of the earth belonged to all and the

793
00:35:46.981 --> 00:35:48.030
earth to no one

794
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.650
there you see and a germ in many ways,

795
00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:55.210
his repudiation of Loc was toe,

796
00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.280
was not a communist,

797
00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:00.240
although this sounds very much in some respects like Karl Marx.

798
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:01.650
He was not a communist.

799
00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:02.340
Uh,

800
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.960
he did not feel it was either again,

801
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:08.320
possible or desirable to do away with private property or to collect,

802
00:36:08.321 --> 00:36:11.460
devise property and the manner of a Plato or a marks,

803
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.020
but there is no one

804
00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:13.960
<v 0>okay</v>

805
00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:18.960
<v 1>of whom I am aware who is a more acute observer of the ills of class and the</v>

806
00:36:20.381 --> 00:36:22.420
effects of private property.

807
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.633
Then Russo,

808
00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:24.550
uh,

809
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.730
he believed that there was something deeply wrong with a conception of

810
00:36:27.731 --> 00:36:28.564
government,

811
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:29.030
uh,

812
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:34.030
as the protector of private property that intervenes as little as necessary with

813
00:36:34.211 --> 00:36:39.211
the affairs of individuals leaving them simply free to pursue life,

814
00:36:39.401 --> 00:36:39.911
liberty,

815
00:36:39.911 --> 00:36:44.911
and it's state as they would see fit Russo in many ways points back to an older,

816
00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:49.480
it might take classical conception of government,

817
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:52.180
of the ancient Polis and ancient republic,

818
00:36:52.181 --> 00:36:52.940
one,

819
00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:53.290
uh,

820
00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:55.210
for which politics,

821
00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:55.660
uh,

822
00:36:55.660 --> 00:37:00.660
had the task among other things of supervising the pursuit and acquisition of

823
00:37:01.151 --> 00:37:01.721
property,

824
00:37:01.721 --> 00:37:06.721
mitigating the harshest effects of economic inequalities.

825
00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:07.931
And it's very,

826
00:37:07.931 --> 00:37:10.990
in a single sentence from Russo's first discourse,

827
00:37:10.991 --> 00:37:14.530
the discourse on the arts and sciences in many ways says it all.

828
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.900
Ancient politicians he wrote,

829
00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:20.020
spoke only about morals and virtues.

830
00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:24.130
Ours speak only of commerce and money.

831
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:27.400
That was Russo's complaint.

832
00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:28.510
Uh,

833
00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:33.100
no talk any longer of civic virtue and citizenship.

834
00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:34.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

835
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:34.720
<v 1>Oh,</v>

836
00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.370
Russo,

837
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:35.900
uh,

838
00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.381
excuse me.

839
00:37:36.381 --> 00:37:41.381
Locke's view recall from just a couple of days ago is that the emancipation or

840
00:37:43.971 --> 00:37:48.800
the of acquisition makes everyone better in locks.

841
00:37:48.801 --> 00:37:53.801
Famous formula a day laborer in England is how is clothed and fed better than a

842
00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:56.923
King of the Americas.

843
00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:00.860
And Rousseau believed that from a strictly you might take economic point of

844
00:38:00.861 --> 00:38:01.310
view.

845
00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:03.680
There is certainly a lot of truth to this,

846
00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:09.040
but he also realized that from the economic point of view or that the economic

847
00:38:09.141 --> 00:38:13.910
point of view barely began to scratch the surface of things,

848
00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.310
Russo is far more impressed,

849
00:38:16.311 --> 00:38:17.210
you might say,

850
00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.390
by the proud dignity and independence,

851
00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:21.040
uh,

852
00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.850
of the native American King.

853
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:28.150
Then with all the luxuries and conveniences that have made European kings and

854
00:38:28.431 --> 00:38:30.740
even some European day laborers,

855
00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.190
uh,

856
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:33.200
soft and dependent,

857
00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:33.770
uh,

858
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:34.880
in his word,

859
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.430
Russo is deeply impressed.

860
00:38:36.431 --> 00:38:36.821
And again,

861
00:38:36.821 --> 00:38:41.740
you see this in his footnotes with the kind of unassimilatable character of

862
00:38:41.741 --> 00:38:42.880
native peoples,

863
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.790
Icelanders Greenlanders hot and tots.

864
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:50.790
He writes all of their refusal to assimilate in many ways to European religion

865
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:55.420
and custom or they prefer their personal independence.

866
00:38:55.421 --> 00:38:59.650
He writes to the comforts and luxuries of modern civilization.

867
00:38:59.651 --> 00:39:01.150
Consider the following passage,

868
00:39:01.151 --> 00:39:02.890
which one of the passages I love,

869
00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:03.430
uh,

870
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.290
in this book that comes from his footnotes.

871
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:05.921
He says,

872
00:39:05.921 --> 00:39:08.680
savages have often been brought to Paris,

873
00:39:08.681 --> 00:39:09.191
London,

874
00:39:09.191 --> 00:39:10.210
and other cities.

875
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.090
People have been eager to display our luxury,

876
00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:17.200
our wealth and all are most useful and curious arts to them.

877
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:22.450
None of this has ever excited in them anything but a stupid admiration without

878
00:39:22.451 --> 00:39:24.790
the least stirring of covetousness.

879
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:30.100
I recall among others the story of the chief of some North Americans who was

880
00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:32.740
brought to the court of England about 30 years ago.

881
00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:37.420
He writes a thousand things were made to pass before his eyes in an attempt to

882
00:39:37.421 --> 00:39:40.270
give him some present that could please him,

883
00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.950
but nothing was found.

884
00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:47.070
That about which he seemed to care our weapons seemed heavy and cumbersome to

885
00:39:47.981 --> 00:39:48.280
him.

886
00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.120
Our shoes hurt.

887
00:39:49.121 --> 00:39:50.740
His feet are closed,

888
00:39:50.741 --> 00:39:51.580
restricted him.

889
00:39:51.581 --> 00:39:52.900
He rejected everything.

890
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:53.951
Finally,

891
00:39:53.951 --> 00:39:56.740
it was noticed that having taken a wool blanket,

892
00:39:56.741 --> 00:40:00.010
he seemed to take some pleasure and wrapping it around his shoulders.

893
00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:05.110
You will agree at least someone immediately said to him on the usefulness of

894
00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:05.950
this furnishing,

895
00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:06.731
yes,

896
00:40:06.731 --> 00:40:07.600
he replies,

897
00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:10.690
this seems to be nearly as good as an animal skin.

898
00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:11.950
However,

899
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:14.650
Rousseau says he would not have said that had he Warren,

900
00:40:14.651 --> 00:40:15.820
both of them in the rain.

901
00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.840
And there's kind of Rousseau sense of,

902
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:21.780
of the virtual,

903
00:40:21.781 --> 00:40:22.121
again,

904
00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:27.121
the proud independence of the native of the salvage as he calls him to the

905
00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:30.451
decadents.

906
00:40:30.451 --> 00:40:31.480
The corruptness,

907
00:40:31.481 --> 00:40:33.370
the softness of,

908
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:33.870
of,

909
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:35.740
of the modern European,

910
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:37.743
uh,

911
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:42.520
Russo was assertion that market economies,

912
00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:43.270
uh,

913
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:45.160
and the governments that protect,

914
00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:45.990
uh,

915
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:49.750
them do in a sense make our people better off.

916
00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:50.711
And yet,

917
00:40:50.711 --> 00:40:51.940
despite this fact,

918
00:40:51.941 --> 00:40:56.941
he realized that market economies also introduced vast inequalities between

919
00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.090
human beings.

920
00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:03.450
And this is a trade off that Rousseau seem unwilling to make or wish to make,

921
00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:09.120
even though I would have to say most Americans seem fairly happy with this trade

922
00:41:09.121 --> 00:41:09.401
off,

923
00:41:09.401 --> 00:41:10.640
perhaps because we have,

924
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.740
we either are or have become kind of natural lock-ins.

925
00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:16.573
Uh,

926
00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:22.050
but that again is a bargain or a trade off that Roussel was at least unwilling

927
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.321
to accept.

928
00:41:23.321 --> 00:41:28.321
He was not only impressed with what was gained by the progress of civilization,

929
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.210
but more impressed,

930
00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.471
so to speak,

931
00:41:32.471 --> 00:41:33.530
by what was lost.

932
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:36.320
It's inequalities increase.

933
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:38.480
We are forced to become greedy,

934
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:39.650
calculating,

935
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.630
acquisitive again,

936
00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:46.660
our natural pity or compassion is easily overcome by these more powerful

937
00:41:47.781 --> 00:41:48.614
passions.

938
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.070
Uh,

939
00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:53.600
what becomes of our original goodness and natural decency.

940
00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:54.140
Uh,

941
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.000
natural man for Russo,

942
00:41:56.001 --> 00:41:59.000
thought of himself but only of himself,

943
00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.930
whereas civilized man is forced to think of others,

944
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:07.490
but we do so only in a calculating in mercenary way,

945
00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:10.520
thinking of them as means to our own ends.

946
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.620
Even a social bond itself,

947
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.210
even as social contract,

948
00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:14.640
uh,

949
00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.720
is simply an agreement among business partners,

950
00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:18.501
so to speak,

951
00:42:18.501 --> 00:42:21.110
the most bourgeois of institutions.

952
00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:21.590
Uh,

953
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:22.460
the contract,

954
00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.310
the fact is Roussel believes,

955
00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:24.671
uh,

956
00:42:24.671 --> 00:42:26.510
under modern conditions,

957
00:42:26.511 --> 00:42:30.110
natural man is transformed into a bourgeois.

958
00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:30.890
Uh,

959
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:34.490
Russo is one of the first to use that term in,

960
00:42:34.491 --> 00:42:36.080
in quite that way,

961
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.771
locks,

962
00:42:36.771 --> 00:42:41.450
rational and industrious man was for Roussel simple,

963
00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:46.480
simply the calculating bourgeois and unlike the natural man who thinks only of

964
00:42:47.481 --> 00:42:52.481
himself or of the classical citizen of Rome or Sparta who thinks only of the

965
00:42:53.361 --> 00:42:55.400
common good in his public duties,

966
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:59.420
the bourgeois inhabits a kind of halfway house,

967
00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.500
neither capable of the original or spontaneous goodness,

968
00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:07.400
nor of political heroism or self sacrifice.

969
00:43:07.401 --> 00:43:08.150
In short,

970
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:11.870
our modern people have become kind of knowledges,

971
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:12.470
uh,

972
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:13.303
nowhere,

973
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:13.851
nowhere,

974
00:43:13.851 --> 00:43:14.480
men,

975
00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:14.990
nowhere,

976
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.440
man,

977
00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.620
you might say in the title of the Beatles Song,

978
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.000
how did that happen?

979
00:43:20.001 --> 00:43:21.470
How did we become

980
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.490
put in this situation?

981
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:29.270
I've suggested one answer or Rousseau suggest one,

982
00:43:29.271 --> 00:43:31.100
answer the development of property,

983
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:33.170
but that's only part of the story.

984
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:38.530
And what I want to do for next week is tell another very important,

985
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:40.130
in some respects,

986
00:43:40.131 --> 00:43:44.990
even more important part of that story of how we have become the way we are.

987
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:45.650
So,

988
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:45.861
uh,

989
00:43:45.861 --> 00:43:46.191
anyway,

990
00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:47.180
have a good weekend.

991
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:48.020
Uh,

992
00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:51.290
go to the football game and we're going to win win against Princeton.
