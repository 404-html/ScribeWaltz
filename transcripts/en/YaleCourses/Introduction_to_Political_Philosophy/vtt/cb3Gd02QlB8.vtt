1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.130
Good morning.

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.430
My name is Barak.

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.130
Anyone see the movie yet?

4
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.180
I saw it over the weekend and to cheer myself up a little bit after Saturday

5
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.470
afternoon,

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.240
but there's still another week to go

7
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.820
steal time.

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.713
I still time

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.343
morning.

10
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.791
Uh,

11
00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:37.470
I want to talk today about my favorite part of the second discourse.

12
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:39.570
A book that never grows old.

13
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.050
It never fails to produce.

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.320
Last time in talking about Rousseau's account of the origins of inequality,

15
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.630
I focused on a famous passage in which Russo claims it was the establishment of

16
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:07.791
private property that was the true formation of civil society and the beginnings

17
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:13.731
of inequality and all of the subsequent miseries of the human race that he wants

18
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:16.171
to describe.

19
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:16.801
But in fact,

20
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:21.060
that's not really true and was so himself knows.

21
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:22.410
It's not quite true

22
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.910
if Roussel we're only interested in issues of class and economic inequality.

23
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:34.440
There would be very little difference between him,

24
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.410
uh,

25
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.840
and materialist theorists of society like Karl Marx,

26
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.990
although Mark's was in fact a very,

27
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.561
uh,

28
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:48.561
appreciative reader of Rousseau and gotten most of his best lines against a

29
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:52.560
capitalist society from him.

30
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.371
Nevertheless,

31
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:55.920
Russo understands that

32
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.510
even for institutions like property and civil society to be possible,

33
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.110
uh,

34
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.110
there must be huge and important developments that go on or take place even

35
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:16.371
prior to this moral and psychological transformations,

36
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.091
uh,

37
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:18.720
of human beings.

38
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.480
And it is for Roussel far more,

39
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.930
uh,

40
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.740
what we might call the moral and psychological injuries,

41
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.230
uh,

42
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.480
of inequality.

43
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.420
Uh,

44
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.420
then the material aspects of the phenomenon that is of concern to him.

45
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.750
Rousseau very much takes the side of the poor and the dispossessed,

46
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.990
uh,

47
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.840
but it isn't property or it isn't poverty,

48
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:47.640
rather that really route rouses Russo's anger is,

49
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:52.641
it is the attitudes and beliefs shaped by inequalities and of wealth and power.

50
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:56.841
It is rue.

51
00:02:56.841 --> 00:02:59.190
So the moral psychologist,

52
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.310
uh,

53
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:01.010
where,

54
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.210
uh,

55
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.570
his voice truly comes out in many ways.

56
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:05.404
Russo,

57
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.860
uh,

58
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.560
like Plato finds his voice,

59
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.001
uh,

60
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:10.120
when discussing,

61
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.611
uh,

62
00:03:10.611 --> 00:03:13.000
the various complexities of,

63
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.380
of the human soul.

64
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.370
So what is the chief villain,

65
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.940
uh,

66
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.940
in Rousseau's second discourse and his account of the beginnings and

67
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:25.350
development,

68
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.541
uh,

69
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:26.680
of inequality,

70
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.410
real inequality begins,

71
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.000
uh,

72
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.360
in a faculty or a disposition that is in fact,

73
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:36.190
in most editions of the book,

74
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.670
uh,

75
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.670
rendered simply by the French term because it has really untranslatable into

76
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:42.971
English.

77
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:44.210
It is Mr. Probe,

78
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.980
the first,

79
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.750
the first term I put on the board,

80
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.250
which is the first,

81
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.030
uh,

82
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.870
and most durable because of inequality for Russo,

83
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.480
I am our proper,

84
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:56.040
again,

85
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.030
it's an untranslatable word,

86
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:03.031
but in many ways is related to a range of psychological characteristics such as

87
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:06.220
pride,

88
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.870
vanity,

89
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.560
uh,

90
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.700
conceit.

91
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.540
Uh,

92
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.010
in the translation that you have are in the d,

93
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.530
The translation that you have.

94
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:15.400
I believe the,

95
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.520
the translator refers to it as egocentrism a kind of ugly,

96
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.820
uh,

97
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.653
modern,

98
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.140
uh,

99
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.210
psychologist stick a term.

100
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.600
I think white men probably better and more accurately,

101
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.870
a evocatively translated by terms like vanity and conceit or pride and more prop

102
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:41.011
prefer Roussel only arises in society and is the true cause.

103
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.450
He believes for our discontents and in a lengthy footnote,

104
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.620
uh,

105
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.860
that I hope you checked in a lengthy footnote,

106
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:54.010
he distinguishes Mr Prokera from a nother,

107
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.670
uh,

108
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.250
disposition that he calls and more [inaudible] ma'am,

109
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.870
I sort of self love how were these distinguished?

110
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.390
He says in that note,

111
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:08.290
we must not confuse Mr proper with love of oneself.

112
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.660
These are two passions,

113
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.810
very different by Birch,

114
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.940
by virtue of their nature and their effects.

115
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.870
Love of oneself and more does swarmed them.

116
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.520
Love of oneself.

117
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:23.380
It's a natural sentiment he writes,

118
00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:28.381
which moves every animal to be vigilant and its own preservation in which

119
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:33.751
directed in many by reason and modified by pity produces humanity in virtue.

120
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.930
So there is a kind of self love he says that is at the root of our desire to

121
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:41.260
preserve ourselves,

122
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.590
to be strong and our self preservation and to resist the invasion or

123
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:48.400
encroachment by others.

124
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.020
But then he goes on to say,

125
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.790
Mr. Proper is,

126
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.180
is an entirely different kind of passion or sentiment and more proper is merely

127
00:05:57.391 --> 00:05:58.980
a sentiment that is relative.

128
00:05:58.981 --> 00:05:59.460
He says,

129
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.710
artificial and born in society,

130
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.930
which moves each individual to value himself more than anyone else,

131
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.410
which inspired in men all the evils they cause one another in which is the true

132
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.980
source of honor.

133
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.070
Listen to that last expression.

134
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.030
Uh,

135
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.990
and more appropriate,

136
00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:23.991
he says is what moves every individual to value him or herself more than any

137
00:06:25.741 --> 00:06:30.570
other which inspires all of the evils in society.

138
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.381
And he says,

139
00:06:31.381 --> 00:06:33.360
is the true source of honor?

140
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.923
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

141
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.150
<v 0>Both evil and honor the desire to be recognized and to steamed by others.</v>

142
00:06:42.811 --> 00:06:47.811
How can this passion of Mr Proper be responsible for these two very different

143
00:06:50.551 --> 00:06:52.420
sort of competing effects?

144
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.850
How did it set him at a Ross?

145
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.691
First of all,

146
00:06:54.691 --> 00:06:56.400
how did it come about?

147
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.210
And I suppose fundamentally and more importantly,

148
00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:03.060
what can or should be done about it?

149
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:06.743
<v 1>MMM.</v>

150
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.830
<v 0>For hubs recall and this idea of pride,</v>

151
00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:11.521
vanity,

152
00:07:11.521 --> 00:07:13.620
what cobb's called vain glory.

153
00:07:13.621 --> 00:07:18.621
You remember very important part of Hobbs is political and moral psychology and

154
00:07:18.901 --> 00:07:23.010
Leviathan pride is seen as something natural to us.

155
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.590
Hubs writes,

156
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.141
you remember,

157
00:07:25.141 --> 00:07:30.141
it is part of our natural pride is part of our natural desire to dominate a over

158
00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:32.551
others.

159
00:07:32.551 --> 00:07:37.551
But for Rousseau by contrast and more proper is something that could only come

160
00:07:38.131 --> 00:07:40.830
about after the state of nature.

161
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.190
A state that Hobbs,

162
00:07:42.191 --> 00:07:44.010
you remember I had called solitary,

163
00:07:44.011 --> 00:07:44.341
poor,

164
00:07:44.341 --> 00:07:44.821
nasty,

165
00:07:44.821 --> 00:07:49.821
brutish and short after the state of nature had already begun to give way to

166
00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:51.504
society.

167
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.520
Hubs is account,

168
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.180
uh,

169
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.320
for Russo is,

170
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.550
is incoherent.

171
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:57.420
Uh,

172
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.450
if the natural state is truly solitary,

173
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.231
solitary,

174
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:01.561
poor,

175
00:08:01.561 --> 00:08:02.041
nasty,

176
00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:02.940
brutish and short,

177
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.620
what would it mean?

178
00:08:04.621 --> 00:08:09.621
What would it mean in such a state to feel pride or vanity that requires human

179
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:17.110
socio ability and requires the esteem of others in somehow the gays or the look

180
00:08:17.641 --> 00:08:18.474
of others?

181
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.020
How could pride have arisen in a state of nature,

182
00:08:22.021 --> 00:08:22.854
which Hobbes,

183
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.110
his own account is solitary.

184
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:25.950
Uh,

185
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:30.950
Russo uses hubs in a way to prove his own point that Mr Prokera vanity is not a

186
00:08:32.251 --> 00:08:33.360
natural sentiment.

187
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.730
But as he says in that passage,

188
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:40.910
I just read a sediment that is relative and artificial could only have come into

189
00:08:41.281 --> 00:08:42.030
being,

190
00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:42.390
uh,

191
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.300
once we enter a society.

192
00:08:45.301 --> 00:08:45.931
In some ways.

193
00:08:45.931 --> 00:08:47.280
How bout how did that happen?

194
00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:49.470
Roussel speculates about this,

195
00:08:49.471 --> 00:08:50.160
and again,

196
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.580
this is part of is hypothetical or conjectural history.

197
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.470
He speculates that proper began to arise and develop.

198
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.150
As soon as people began to gather around a hut or a tree,

199
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:04.800
until look at one another.

200
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.120
As soon as we became conscious of the gaze of another,

201
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.460
and it is from that gaze,

202
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.130
from the look or gaze of another,

203
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:14.750
that this,

204
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.700
that the passion of vanity was born.

205
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.810
Listen to the way in which he speculates how this arose.

206
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.160
Each one he says,

207
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:27.270
began to look at the others and to want to be looked at himself.

208
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.310
And public esteem had a value.

209
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.330
The one who sang or danced the best,

210
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.640
the handsomest,

211
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.550
the strongest,

212
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:37.650
the most adroit are the most eloquent,

213
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:39.480
became the most highly regarded.

214
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.780
And this was the first step toward inequality.

215
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:48.140
And at the same time toward device from these first preferences were born vanity

216
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:52.830
and contempt on the one hand and shame and envy on the other.

217
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.640
And the fermentation caused by this new Levins eventually produced compounds

218
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:01.470
fatal to happiness and innocence.

219
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.060
So the rise of this passion to be seen,

220
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:06.930
to be seen,

221
00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:09.120
to be best at something,

222
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:10.260
uh,

223
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.290
produced in many for many people.

224
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:13.621
Again,

225
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:14.280
as he puts it,

226
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:19.280
pride and vanity from some shame and envy on the part of others.

227
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.480
And from this,

228
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.630
from this fatal compound grew,

229
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.410
uh,

230
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.180
tendencies that were as he says,

231
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:29.670
fatal to our happiness and innocence.

232
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.270
And Rousseau I think is very much onto something here.

233
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:34.350
Uh,

234
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.440
and more proper is presented in,

235
00:10:36.441 --> 00:10:40.020
in the passage I just read and throughout much of the second discourse in

236
00:10:40.021 --> 00:10:42.060
largely negative terms,

237
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:42.840
uh,

238
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.920
but there is also,

239
00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:48.921
it is also related to something positive in many ways for the development of

240
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.270
humanity and society.

241
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:56.271
The desire felt by all people once we enter society to be accorded some kind of

242
00:10:57.901 --> 00:11:00.240
recognition or respect,

243
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:00.900
uh,

244
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.430
by those around us.

245
00:11:02.431 --> 00:11:03.940
That too is a part of,

246
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.160
of a more proper,

247
00:11:05.161 --> 00:11:08.760
the desire to be seen and recognized and respected.

248
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.340
The desire for recognition,

249
00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:12.031
he says,

250
00:11:12.031 --> 00:11:14.820
is it the root of our sense of justice

251
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.640
and underlying this I think is the intuition powerful.

252
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.000
And in many ways I think deeply true that our feelings,

253
00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:24.661
beliefs,

254
00:11:24.661 --> 00:11:25.411
opinions,

255
00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:30.411
and attitudes be acknowledged and respected by others around us.

256
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:35.540
That we matter in some way when we feel that our opinions are slighted when

257
00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:39.990
others do not recognize our worth.

258
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.000
We feel angry,

259
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.420
uh,

260
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.240
about this and this need for recognition,

261
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.380
which is part of this passion of Mr Proper is for Rousseau,

262
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.260
also a cornerstone of justice,

263
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.490
but it is also,

264
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:55.563
as he says,

265
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.950
at the same time,

266
00:11:56.951 --> 00:12:01.951
the demand for recognition can easily become cruel and violent as we,

267
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.650
as we demand this from others.

268
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:07.570
Consider again just the following.

269
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:10.690
I want to read one other passage from the same part of the text.

270
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.681
He writes,

271
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:16.681
as soon as men had begun mutually to value one another and the idea of a steam

272
00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:19.600
was formed in their minds,

273
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.610
each one claim to have a right to it,

274
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.560
each one claim to have a right to it's steam or recognition and it was no longer

275
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:27.221
possible,

276
00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:30.160
he writes for anyone to be lacking it with impunity.

277
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.850
From this came the first duties of civility,

278
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.230
even amongst savages.

279
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:36.641
And from this,

280
00:12:36.641 --> 00:12:39.550
every voluntary wrong became an outrage.

281
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.150
Every time someone was harmed or injured,

282
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:48.070
it became an outrage because along with the harm that resulted from the injury,

283
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:52.990
he says the offended party saw in it contempt for his person,

284
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.830
which often was more insufferable than the harm itself.

285
00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:02.280
Think about the psychology that the moral psychology that Rousseau is invoking

286
00:13:02.801 --> 00:13:03.041
here,

287
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:05.020
and it's talked about harm and injury.

288
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:09.460
It's not the physical aspect of the harm it that bothers him.

289
00:13:09.461 --> 00:13:14.461
It is the sort of contempt that is implied or entailed in the act of injury.

290
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:15.941
Hence,

291
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:16.900
he goes on to say,

292
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.820
each man punished the contempt,

293
00:13:18.821 --> 00:13:23.821
shown him in a matter of proportionate to the esteem in which he held himself.

294
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.610
Act of revenge became terrible in men,

295
00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:29.800
became bloodthirsty and cruel.

296
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.250
It is to say Emma proper and society gave rise to the state of war.

297
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.570
Does this sound familiar?

298
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.190
I think it should.

299
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.250
I was trying to think of some example,

300
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:42.760
uh,

301
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.960
that might fit this.

302
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:44.121
And,

303
00:13:44.121 --> 00:13:45.880
and one I came up with

304
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.780
when I was thinking about this earlier,

305
00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:50.614
consider,

306
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:51.170
uh,

307
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.230
a story that was much in the news,

308
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:56.710
I forget if it was last spring or last summer sometime.

309
00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:57.551
Uh,

310
00:13:57.551 --> 00:13:59.710
the Danish cartoon controversy.

311
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:00.940
You remember that about the,

312
00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:05.941
about the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed and that outrage and protests often

313
00:14:07.841 --> 00:14:12.841
violent that occurred about that to some degree.

314
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:13.600
Uh,

315
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.600
Russo might argue the protests were about disrespectful cartoons of the prophet,

316
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:22.870
but he would argue,

317
00:14:22.871 --> 00:14:27.871
I suspect that the deeper cause seem to be that the protesters believed was

318
00:14:27.911 --> 00:14:30.850
disrespect being shown to them,

319
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.530
to their beliefs,

320
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.340
to what it is they held a sacred,

321
00:14:36.341 --> 00:14:37.060
in some sense,

322
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.290
it is their beliefs that were being disrespected.

323
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:42.071
And we're,

324
00:14:42.071 --> 00:14:47.071
the cause of the protests and more Prokera as Rousseau I think himself

325
00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:48.041
recognizes,

326
00:14:48.041 --> 00:14:50.920
is this very volatile passion.

327
00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.820
It contains the desire to be respected again and acknowledged that it is the,

328
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.790
that is at the root of Justice and virtue.

329
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.290
And yet at the same time,

330
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:03.530
this passion as we know is easily manipulable,

331
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:04.130
uh,

332
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:09.130
by those who wish to convince others that their basic entitlements and,

333
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.220
uh,

334
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:10.500
are,

335
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.900
are not being a,

336
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:14.420
or views are not being respected.

337
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.311
To some degree.

338
00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:19.790
I think Russo would believe the protestors,

339
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.541
uh,

340
00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:22.600
over those cartoons had appoint,

341
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.480
uh,

342
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.470
their views were not being respected.

343
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.470
Uh,

344
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:32.470
and to which you might say a and or a liberal formulation of the problem would

345
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:34.820
or response would be.

346
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:35.540
Well,

347
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.560
so what,

348
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:37.790
uh,

349
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.320
the task of government,

350
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:39.950
uh,

351
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:44.950
according to Locke or the liberal view is to ensure the security of person and

352
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:48.890
property to protect you from harm.

353
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.400
And of course to provide you the freedom to practice,

354
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:52.820
uh,

355
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:57.820
what religion you like a free with the consistent with the freedom of others to

356
00:15:58.221 --> 00:15:58.970
do so too.

357
00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:03.920
It is not the business of government to ensure that your beliefs are being

358
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:04.820
respected.

359
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:06.643
Uh,

360
00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.510
this was clearly the view,

361
00:16:08.511 --> 00:16:09.500
for example,

362
00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:14.501
of the Danish newspaper editors that publish the cartoon as well as the Danish

363
00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:19.640
prime minister who refuse to apologize for this on the ground.

364
00:16:19.641 --> 00:16:20.001
Again,

365
00:16:20.001 --> 00:16:25.001
that the government's job is not to impose a gag order on what can and cannot be

366
00:16:25.341 --> 00:16:26.170
said,

367
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:26.360
uh,

368
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.630
on the grounds that some people might find it offensive.

369
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:30.560
Uh,

370
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.560
this is a respectable sort of liberal line of thought going from lock to John

371
00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:36.820
Stuart Mill.

372
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.610
Uh,

373
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:42.220
and yet what I'm inclined to agree very much with,

374
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:43.640
with that point of view,

375
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.330
uh,

376
00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.030
there is something powerful and true,

377
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:47.520
uh,

378
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.420
about what Rousseau has to say about it.

379
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.210
What about this,

380
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:58.240
this kind of issue Locky in liberal thought was addressed in many ways to people

381
00:16:58.311 --> 00:16:59.630
who had experienced,

382
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:00.140
uh,

383
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.060
the crucible of civil war,

384
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.370
a century of religious conflict.

385
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.680
And we're looking for a way to settle a,

386
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.610
their religious and political differences.

387
00:17:10.611 --> 00:17:11.510
Toleration,

388
00:17:11.511 --> 00:17:16.511
in many ways is a liberal virtue because it requires us to distinguish between

389
00:17:17.061 --> 00:17:22.061
beliefs that we may take with the utmost seriousness in private life and yet

390
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:23.961
nevertheless,

391
00:17:23.961 --> 00:17:28.280
bracket them in some way once we enter the public world.

392
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:33.310
This in many ways is the peculiar liberal virtue of self restraint or a self

393
00:17:34.761 --> 00:17:39.761
denial that we refuse to allow our own moral point of view too in many ways

394
00:17:41.871 --> 00:17:42.704
dominate,

395
00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:43.021
uh,

396
00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:44.180
in the public space.

397
00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:48.590
But it is one thing you might say to tolerate other views.

398
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:49.561
Uh,

399
00:17:49.561 --> 00:17:54.561
and another thing to accord them respect and esteem that that seems to be

400
00:17:55.381 --> 00:17:58.170
something very different from what lock,

401
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:58.680
uh,

402
00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.513
talked about.

403
00:17:59.780 --> 00:17:59.911
Uh,

404
00:17:59.911 --> 00:18:04.770
to tolerate a means not to pursue it simply means not to persecute a,

405
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.970
to leave alone.

406
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.780
While I respect for something requires that we,

407
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:10.240
uh,

408
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.130
esteem it.

409
00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.030
Uh,

410
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.170
you might ask yourself,

411
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:17.130
must we esteem and respect values and points of view,

412
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:17.620
uh,

413
00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.990
that we do not share.

414
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:20.280
Uh,

415
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.540
this seems very different,

416
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:21.871
again,

417
00:18:21.871 --> 00:18:24.450
from the sort of liberal understanding of toleration.

418
00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:29.451
That means only a extending a acceptance to views again,

419
00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:31.290
that are very different from our own.

420
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.280
Um,

421
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.410
it doesn't require us to,

422
00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:35.281
as it were,

423
00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.010
sensor self-censor,

424
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:37.650
uh,

425
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.520
our own views on the ground that they may be.

426
00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:46.521
Our views may be in some ways disrespectful or hurtful to others.

427
00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:48.300
This is a vast topic.

428
00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:52.800
I've sort of used the opportunity to sort of move away from Luso so a little

429
00:18:52.801 --> 00:18:53.041
bit,

430
00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:54.780
but his point is I think,

431
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:55.291
uh,

432
00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:56.370
the Mr proper,

433
00:18:56.371 --> 00:18:58.680
the desire to be esteemed,

434
00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.080
recognized and to have your,

435
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:01.890
uh,

436
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:02.191
your,

437
00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:07.191
your values and points of view esteemed by those around you is in fact a violent

438
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.290
and uncontrollable passion.

439
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.160
Uh,

440
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:16.160
it is the passion very much like Plato's Thumos spiritedness backing in the

441
00:19:16.921 --> 00:19:17.520
republic.

442
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.353
It makes us,

443
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:23.630
it is a passion that makes us burn with anger over perceived slights and makes,

444
00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:29.490
makes us also risk our lives and endangered the lives of others to rectify what

445
00:19:30.541 --> 00:19:35.210
we believe to be acts of injustice like Plato.

446
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:35.911
In many ways,

447
00:19:35.911 --> 00:19:40.911
Russo wants to know whether Mr Proper is purely a negative passion or

448
00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:44.790
disposition or whether like through most,

449
00:19:44.791 --> 00:19:49.791
whether it can be re directed in some way to achieve social goods and social

450
00:19:50.491 --> 00:19:51.210
benefits.

451
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:56.030
All of this is entailed in that short distance discussion of,

452
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.700
of Ama Volpara in,

453
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:58.320
in,

454
00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:58.950
in the SEC,

455
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.210
in the second discourse,

456
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:01.530
uh,

457
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:06.530
so much of the Russo's subsequent account of civilization and its discontents

458
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:12.890
grows out of this peculiar psychological disposition and passion.

459
00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:20.290
So let's talk a little bit more about civilization and its discontents.

460
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.943
Um,

461
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.640
and Woody Allen's movie Annie Hall,

462
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:35.730
you might recall a sane when he says there are two kinds of people there,

463
00:20:35.861 --> 00:20:37.420
the horrible and the miserable,

464
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:39.871
the horrible,

465
00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:43.170
or those who have suffered some kind of personal tragedy,

466
00:20:43.171 --> 00:20:47.680
a disfigurement of some kind who are facing a terminal illness.

467
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.230
The miserable is everybody else.

468
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.403
<v 2>Okay.</v>

469
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.560
<v 0>Roussel wants us to be miserable.</v>

470
00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:58.910
Uh,

471
00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.880
he wants us to feel just how bad things are,

472
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:03.710
how bad we are,

473
00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.060
how bad off we are.

474
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:12.160
The only exception to this general human misery is

475
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.380
as he tells us at one point,

476
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.130
kind of early primitive society needs to societies described by him,

477
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:24.990
not quite the state of nature to be sure I maintained a kind of middling

478
00:21:24.991 --> 00:21:29.070
position between the pure state of nature in the development of modern

479
00:21:29.071 --> 00:21:29.821
conditions.

480
00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:34.821
He says these were the happiest and most durable societies and the best for man.

481
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:36.960
It was primitive man,

482
00:21:36.961 --> 00:21:37.460
not the,

483
00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:42.460
the pure savage of the state of nature where Russo finds a happy equilibrium

484
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.330
between our powers and our needs.

485
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.060
That he says is the recipe for happiness,

486
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.330
bringing our powers and our needs into equilibrium.

487
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:57.140
But the end of that happy state came with two inventions to discoveries,

488
00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.190
agriculture and metallurgy.

489
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.073
Bless you.

490
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.830
With agriculture came here.

491
00:22:07.831 --> 00:22:10.050
We see the division of land,

492
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.060
the division of property,

493
00:22:12.061 --> 00:22:14.700
and the subsequent inequalities that came with it,

494
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.440
with metallurgy came the art of war and conquest.

495
00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:21.840
With these two developments,

496
00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:25.050
he tells us humanity entered a new stage,

497
00:22:25.051 --> 00:22:29.880
one where laws and political institutions became necessary to adjudicate

498
00:22:29.881 --> 00:22:34.881
conflicts over rights and the establishment of governments that this entailed.

499
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:37.050
Uh,

500
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:41.310
rather than bringing a piece as it would for Hobbes or Locke,

501
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.930
the establishment of governments had the effect simply of sanctioning the

502
00:22:45.931 --> 00:22:50.370
existing inequalities that had begun to develop for Russo.

503
00:22:50.371 --> 00:22:54.840
There is something deeply shocking and deeply troubling about the,

504
00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:55.710
uh,

505
00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:00.710
assertion that men who were once free and equal are so easily,

506
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:01.801
uh,

507
00:23:01.801 --> 00:23:02.634
as it were.

508
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.330
Uh,

509
00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:08.330
led to consent to the inequalities of property and to rule by the stronger which

510
00:23:09.271 --> 00:23:13.050
government brings into being the social contract is he presents it.

511
00:23:13.051 --> 00:23:16.410
And the second discourse is really a kind of swindle.

512
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.130
Uh,

513
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:21.780
the establishment of government is a kind of swindle that the rich and the

514
00:23:21.781 --> 00:23:25.980
powerful use to control the poor and the dispossessed.

515
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:26.251
Again,

516
00:23:26.251 --> 00:23:28.380
rather than instituting justice,

517
00:23:28.381 --> 00:23:31.260
this compact merely legitimize his past.

518
00:23:31.261 --> 00:23:34.830
Usurpations government is a con game,

519
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:35.340
uh,

520
00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:40.340
that the rich play upon the poor political power simply helps to legitimize

521
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.220
economic inequalities.

522
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.170
Governments,

523
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.960
he tells us may operate by consent,

524
00:23:47.961 --> 00:23:52.460
but the consent they are granted is based on false hoods and lies.

525
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.140
How else can one explain why the rich live lives that are so much freer,

526
00:23:57.141 --> 00:23:58.340
so much easier,

527
00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:02.240
so much more open to enjoyment than the poor?

528
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.400
That is Russo's real critique and real question.

529
00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.280
And it is the establishment of government that is the last link in the chain of

530
00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:15.170
Rousseau's conjectural history.

531
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:17.303
Uh,

532
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:22.360
the last and most painful in in many ways legitimation of of the inequalities

533
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:24.920
that,

534
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.340
uh,

535
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:30.290
has been created after our emergence from the natural condition.

536
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.073
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

537
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:34.040
<v 0>But what again,</v>

538
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:39.041
is most painful to Russo is the emergence of a new kind of human being that this

539
00:24:42.201 --> 00:24:44.930
stage of civilization has been brought into.

540
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.740
This stage of civilization has brought into being Andrew.

541
00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:50.990
So is the first,

542
00:24:50.991 --> 00:24:52.970
I think to use that term,

543
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.033
uh,

544
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:54.260
uh,

545
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.310
so powerfully,

546
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:55.731
uh,

547
00:24:55.731 --> 00:24:58.340
which became used very much in the next two centuries.

548
00:24:58.341 --> 00:24:59.180
The bourgeois,

549
00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.000
the bourgeois is Russo's invention,

550
00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:05.070
uh,

551
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:10.070
in most striking about this human type for him is the necessity to appear to be

552
00:25:11.461 --> 00:25:15.210
one thing where actually being something else.

553
00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.800
Go back again to think of the way in which Plato or Socrates uses that,

554
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.730
a distinction between seeming and being when it,

555
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.670
when he talks about the just man in book,

556
00:25:26.671 --> 00:25:27.740
two of the Republics,

557
00:25:27.741 --> 00:25:29.820
someone who seems to be in someone who,

558
00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:30.930
who is just,

559
00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:36.140
it is this tension between the two that is so central to Russo's account of what

560
00:25:37.231 --> 00:25:41.940
he calls the bourgeois being something and appearing to be something he says

561
00:25:41.941 --> 00:25:43.800
become two different things.

562
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.900
And from this distinction,

563
00:25:45.901 --> 00:25:46.651
there are rows,

564
00:25:46.651 --> 00:25:48.330
grand ostentation,

565
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.890
deceptive cunning,

566
00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:53.250
and all the vices that follow in their wake.

567
00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:54.990
And in the pen ultimate,

568
00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:56.010
uh,

569
00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.810
paragraph of the second discourse,

570
00:25:57.811 --> 00:26:02.220
Russo describes the dilemma of the bourgeois and the following way.

571
00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:02.551
He says,

572
00:26:02.551 --> 00:26:04.950
the savage lives within himself,

573
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.550
the man accustomed to the ways of society.

574
00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:13.580
The bourgeois is always outside of himself and knows only how to live in the

575
00:26:14.191 --> 00:26:17.010
opinions of others and as it,

576
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.070
and it is as it were from their judgment alone,

577
00:26:20.071 --> 00:26:22.680
that he draws the sentiment of his own existence.

578
00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.610
Think of that sentence a constant on next to the last paragraph of the book.

579
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
That in society we only live through the opinions of others through the gaze of

580
00:26:33.031 --> 00:26:33.541
others,

581
00:26:33.541 --> 00:26:35.610
through what others think of us.

582
00:26:35.611 --> 00:26:39.270
We are constantly our own sentiment of existence.

583
00:26:39.271 --> 00:26:39.721
He says,

584
00:26:39.721 --> 00:26:40.554
our own,

585
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:41.220
uh,

586
00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:46.220
sent sentiment of self existence comes entirely from the judgment as he puts it

587
00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:49.350
of those around us.

588
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.520
The bourgeois,

589
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.271
in other words,

590
00:26:51.271 --> 00:26:54.750
is someone who lives in and through the opinions,

591
00:26:54.751 --> 00:26:59.751
the good opinions of others who thinks only of himself when he is with other

592
00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:05.640
people and only of other people when he is in bar by himself.

593
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.920
Such a person is duplicitous,

594
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.200
hypocritical and false.

595
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.110
This is why this is the true,

596
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.591
uh,

597
00:27:13.591 --> 00:27:17.100
you might say discontent of civilization.

598
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:17.670
This is,

599
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:22.170
this is what our perpetual restlessness and reflectiveness,

600
00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:22.590
uh,

601
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:27.420
have made of us goated on perpetually by em or proper.

602
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.991
It is.

603
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:32.850
This is the particular misery that civilization has bequeathed.

604
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:37.851
Just so the question at the end of the book is what to do about this and here,

605
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:38.821
uh,

606
00:27:38.821 --> 00:27:39.780
in many ways,

607
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.320
uh,

608
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.410
one has to say the second discourse false short,

609
00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:44.520
uh,

610
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.260
the book know that the essay,

611
00:27:46.261 --> 00:27:47.094
the book

612
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.160
ends on a note of,

613
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:51.840
of utmost despair.

614
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:52.891
Uh,

615
00:27:52.891 --> 00:27:57.891
it offers no positive answer to cure the problem of civilization,

616
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:03.660
but only hints at best a at two possible solutions.

617
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.120
One is suggested you,

618
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:11.190
you will recall by the letter to the city of Geneva,

619
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.520
which in a sense prefaces the book,

620
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.033
uh,

621
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:21.330
perhaps the closest approximation to the early state of primitive society.

622
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:26.330
Lauded by Rousseau I the small isolated rural republics like,

623
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.890
like Geneva in his own way,

624
00:28:28.891 --> 00:28:33.891
where a kind of simple patriotism and love of country have not been completely

625
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:39.300
overwhelmed by the agitations of Mr Pro bar only.

626
00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.930
He says in a well tempered democracy like Geneva,

627
00:28:42.931 --> 00:28:47.931
is it possible for citizens still to enjoy some of the equality of the natural

628
00:28:48.841 --> 00:28:51.630
man democracy for him?

629
00:28:51.631 --> 00:28:56.631
This kind of simple rural democracy like that of Geneva is the social condition

630
00:28:57.031 --> 00:29:02.031
that most closely approximates the equality of the state of nature.

631
00:29:02.911 --> 00:29:06.960
And that of course is a theme that Roussel we'll take up powerfully,

632
00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:07.481
uh,

633
00:29:07.481 --> 00:29:09.450
in his book the social contract.

634
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:13.140
But Rizzo offers another hint,

635
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:13.940
uh,

636
00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:14.400
to,

637
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.670
to the solution of the problem of civilization,

638
00:29:17.671 --> 00:29:18.810
what to do about it.

639
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:24.720
How can we restore happiness and,

640
00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:25.470
uh,

641
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.760
in,

642
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.300
in the midst of society,

643
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:34.040
the second discourse leaves us to believe that all society is a state of bondage

644
00:29:35.221 --> 00:29:36.900
and alienation from nature.

645
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.540
From our true being.

646
00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:40.710
We,

647
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:45.710
we have our true humanity that he describes in a state of nature,

648
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:47.170
state of Pitt,

649
00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.620
these for pity and compassion and the like.

650
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:56.700
And the answer to the problem of society is in many ways to return to the root

651
00:29:56.951 --> 00:29:57.731
of society.

652
00:29:57.731 --> 00:29:59.590
And this route of society is the,

653
00:29:59.591 --> 00:30:01.750
not just the need for self preservation,

654
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:07.380
but a kind of primordial as he calls it in that passage I read a minute ago,

655
00:30:07.661 --> 00:30:09.310
sentiment of existence,

656
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.640
the sentiment of our own existence by giving oneself over to this feeling of

657
00:30:15.161 --> 00:30:17.740
existence without a thought for the future,

658
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.110
without care or fear,

659
00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:25.380
the individual somehow psychologically returns to the natural state.

660
00:30:26.021 --> 00:30:28.240
Only a very few people,

661
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.800
Rousseau writes,

662
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.540
he being one of them.

663
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.373
Of course,

664
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:37.710
only a very few people are capable of finding their way back to nature.

665
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.930
Uh,

666
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:45.880
the type of human being who can find their way back to the sort of pure

667
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.810
sentiment of existence is not going to be a philosopher,

668
00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:55.690
is not going to be a person of high order reflection like Socrates,

669
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:59.650
but will more likely be an artist or a poet.

670
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:00.610
A,

671
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.200
he has one of those rare,

672
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:03.483
uh,

673
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.470
aristocrats of nature,

674
00:31:05.471 --> 00:31:06.310
you might say.

675
00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:07.420
Um,

676
00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:12.420
his claim to special to superiority is not based on a higher understanding,

677
00:31:12.911 --> 00:31:14.920
but it's superior sensitivity,

678
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:15.970
uh,

679
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.950
less on wisdom then on compassion.

680
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:19.960
Um,

681
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.870
Rousseau believed himself to be one of these people.

682
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:23.950
Uh,

683
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:26.860
maybe you also are one of them.

684
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.353
Yes.

685
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.730
But it requires you in some way to distance yourself severely and

686
00:31:33.731 --> 00:31:38.731
psychologically from all of the possibilities of society to return inward.

687
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:44.890
And it was that inward journey that Rousseau took and that he writes about so

688
00:31:44.891 --> 00:31:47.770
powerfully in his confessions and his final book,

689
00:31:47.771 --> 00:31:52.771
the reveries where you find the Roussel founder of the romantic disposition that

690
00:31:54.071 --> 00:31:54.820
you get again.

691
00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:59.820
And writers in America like Thoreau and others who look inward and returned to

692
00:32:01.091 --> 00:32:02.380
nature in some way,

693
00:32:02.381 --> 00:32:03.700
their natural self,

694
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:04.180
uh,

695
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.530
as opposed to society.

696
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:10.420
But the second discourse leave leaves us to be sure with a paradox.

697
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.261
Uh,

698
00:32:11.261 --> 00:32:15.940
the progress of civilization is responsible for all of our miseries.

699
00:32:15.941 --> 00:32:16.450
Yes,

700
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.190
it is society's fault.

701
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.420
It's not your fault.

702
00:32:19.421 --> 00:32:21.850
It's society's he wants to tell us.

703
00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:27.240
And yet he also leaves us with no real apparent way out.

704
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:33.460
He denies that we can as a practical solution,

705
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:34.420
uh,

706
00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:35.800
return to simpler,

707
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.710
more natural forms of political association.

708
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:45.260
But how then do we resolve the problem of,

709
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:45.860
uh,

710
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.120
that he leaves us with?

711
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:52.180
And his answer to it is political answer to it is most famous political answer

712
00:32:52.611 --> 00:32:54.290
to it is contained in his book.

713
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:54.920
Yes,

714
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.240
called the social contract.

715
00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:02.540
Do contract sociale published in 1762,

716
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:06.950
seven years after the second discourse here.

717
00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:11.930
He attempts to give one such answer and I mentioned one such answer because it

718
00:33:11.931 --> 00:33:14.330
is not his only or final answer,

719
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:18.440
but one such answer to the problems of inequality.

720
00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:19.820
And the uh,

721
00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:20.930
the again,

722
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.400
the injuries of,

723
00:33:22.401 --> 00:33:22.820
of,

724
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:23.180
of,

725
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:23.570
of,

726
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:24.403
of uh,

727
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:25.160
of,

728
00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.290
of ammo pro pro,

729
00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:27.080
uh,

730
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.620
social contract begins with one of the most famous sentences,

731
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:31.400
uh,

732
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.610
in all of the history of political philosophy.

733
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.210
Man is born free and is everywhere in chains.

734
00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.270
Always begin your essays with a good,

735
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.980
strong sentence like that.

736
00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:46.260
Rousseau knew this,

737
00:33:46.261 --> 00:33:47.790
he knew something about how to write.

738
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:54.750
The phrase is seems to be perfectly in keeping with the second discourse in the

739
00:33:54.751 --> 00:33:55.590
state of nature.

740
00:33:55.591 --> 00:33:56.640
We are born free,

741
00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:57.930
equal and independent.

742
00:33:57.931 --> 00:34:00.510
Only in society do we become weak,

743
00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.820
dependent and enslaved.

744
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:08.190
It is what follows after that sentence in a way that is the shocker.

745
00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.560
How did this take?

746
00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.600
How did this change take place?

747
00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.010
Roussel asks,

748
00:34:14.011 --> 00:34:18.030
I do not know what can render it legitimate.

749
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.670
I believe I can answer this question.

750
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:23.460
What can render it legitimate?

751
00:34:23.461 --> 00:34:25.080
And by the Itch I take it,

752
00:34:25.081 --> 00:34:26.970
he means the chains is in.

753
00:34:26.971 --> 00:34:30.000
This stays man is born free and just everywhere in Shane's.

754
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:35.250
And the second discourse here at attempted to completely delegitimize the bonds

755
00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:39.930
of society saying how the social contract and the creation of government was.

756
00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:40.830
It was nothing but,

757
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.650
but in many ways a sophisticated Swindell.

758
00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.900
Now in the social contract,

759
00:34:45.901 --> 00:34:47.160
he asks the question,

760
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:52.380
what can give these chains or bonds moral legitimacy?

761
00:34:52.381 --> 00:34:52.891
He says,

762
00:34:52.891 --> 00:34:57.891
I believe I can answer that as Rousseau simply undergone a massive change of

763
00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:02.910
heart in the seven years between these two books.

764
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:03.660
Uh,

765
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.160
I don't think so.

766
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.240
Uh,

767
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.530
but I think these are,

768
00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:08.940
this is part of his,

769
00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.200
one of his answers to this fundamental question.

770
00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:17.370
But before going into the details of this,

771
00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:22.380
let's consider some of the differences between these two very powerful books,

772
00:35:22.561 --> 00:35:23.310
right?

773
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.670
Uh,

774
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:24.750
the second discourse,

775
00:35:24.751 --> 00:35:29.751
the discourse on inequality presents itself as a hypothetical or conjectural

776
00:35:30.121 --> 00:35:34.950
history of human development from the state of nature to the civil condition.

777
00:35:34.951 --> 00:35:38.790
It is written in a vivid language is why it is always,

778
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.490
uh,

779
00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:43.800
is often considered one of Rousseau's most powerful pieces of writing a vivid

780
00:35:43.801 --> 00:35:48.801
language drawing on in many ways by the biological sciences of his day and newly

781
00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:55.611
discovered knowledge of animal species like a rang of tangs and other kinds of

782
00:35:55.981 --> 00:36:00.940
anthropological investigations of the Caribs and North American peoples.

783
00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.250
A very vivid,

784
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.731
uh,

785
00:36:02.731 --> 00:36:03.121
work.

786
00:36:03.121 --> 00:36:07.440
The social contract by contrast is written a dry,

787
00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:07.980
uh,

788
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.950
even the kind of bloodless language of a lawyer.

789
00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:11.850
Uh,

790
00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:15.750
it is very much written in the genre of a legal document.

791
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:20.160
Its subtitle is the principles of political right.

792
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:20.730
Uh,

793
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:24.720
it is a work of considerable philosophical abstraction,

794
00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:25.260
uh,

795
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.840
who's leading concepts are abstractions,

796
00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:29.490
like the social contract,

797
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:30.900
the general will.

798
00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:36.110
And the so on the book he tells us in his short preface was originally part of a

799
00:36:37.051 --> 00:36:40.890
longer investigation of politics which has since been,

800
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.870
which he says has since been lost.

801
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:54.630
Also the social contract presents itself in many ways as a utopia in ideal city

802
00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:01.530
in some respects and answer to the Koan Lippolis of Plato's Republic and get

803
00:37:02.921 --> 00:37:04.200
this is also now.

804
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.010
This seems to be not quite true.

805
00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:11.800
The work begins even before the famous sentence about man being born free.

806
00:37:11.801 --> 00:37:16.360
The work is prefaced with a statement that could have come directly out of

807
00:37:16.361 --> 00:37:21.361
Machiavelli's Prince taking men as they are and laws as they might be.

808
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:22.780
Rousseau says,

809
00:37:22.781 --> 00:37:27.640
I will try in this inquiry to bring together what right permits with what

810
00:37:27.641 --> 00:37:32.020
interest prescribes taking men as they are.

811
00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.510
You remember the 15th chapter of the Prince?

812
00:37:34.511 --> 00:37:37.300
Let us look at the effectual truth of things,

813
00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:41.710
not what is imagined to be but but the way people actually are.

814
00:37:41.711 --> 00:37:43.900
Let us take men as they are.

815
00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:46.240
Rousseau says following Machiavelli,

816
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.010
he will not begin.

817
00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:52.900
He tells us by making any heroic assumptions about human nature,

818
00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:57.580
no metaphysical flights of fancy but rather stay on the low,

819
00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.060
uh,

820
00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.150
but solid ground of recognized fact.

821
00:38:01.151 --> 00:38:05.890
What does he mean by this and what are these facts of human nature men as they

822
00:38:05.891 --> 00:38:06.251
are,

823
00:38:06.251 --> 00:38:09.550
he says that Rousseau claims to describe,

824
00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:10.240
uh,

825
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:10.571
in,

826
00:38:10.571 --> 00:38:11.920
in the social contract.

827
00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:17.700
And here we get to the basic premise of the book.

828
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:19.030
<v 2>Okay.</v>

829
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:24.030
<v 0>The basic premise I think from which the entire social contract unfolds is the</v>

830
00:38:24.881 --> 00:38:27.160
claim that man is born free.

831
00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:31.360
All subsequent relations of hierarchy,

832
00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.780
obligation and authority are the result.

833
00:38:34.781 --> 00:38:35.710
Not Nature,

834
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:41.340
but if agreement or convention society and the moral ties that constituted our

835
00:38:43.961 --> 00:38:44.890
conventional,

836
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.310
you might say by agreement or all the way down.

837
00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.400
There is nothing natural about any of the,

838
00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.320
uh,

839
00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:52.780
uh,

840
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.550
social contract.

841
00:38:56.770 --> 00:39:01.770
And from this basis of man as a free agent that we are born free Russo attempt

842
00:39:03.091 --> 00:39:05.260
to work out a system of justice.

843
00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:07.630
The principles of political right,

844
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:08.141
again,

845
00:39:08.141 --> 00:39:12.250
as the subtitle suggests that are appropriate to human beings,

846
00:39:12.251 --> 00:39:14.410
conceived as free agents,

847
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:16.810
responsible to themselves alone.

848
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:18.160
But how do you do that?

849
00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.210
How can you do that?

850
00:39:19.211 --> 00:39:21.610
Russo's political philosophy begins,

851
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.260
at least he believes,

852
00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:28.261
I think with the realistic or even empirical assumption that each individual has

853
00:39:31.151 --> 00:39:36.151
a deep rooted interest in securing the conditions of their own liberty.

854
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.020
Uh,

855
00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:43.020
the state of nature and the social contract presuppose individuals who are in

856
00:39:45.941 --> 00:39:50.941
competition with others and each attempting as it were to secure the conditions

857
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:53.530
for their own liberty.

858
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:59.610
He does not presuppose altruism on the part of any human being or any other kind

859
00:40:00.821 --> 00:40:01.654
of self.

860
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.210
Other regarding characteristics,

861
00:40:04.211 --> 00:40:05.530
what I call a moment ago,

862
00:40:05.531 --> 00:40:06.970
heroic assumptions.

863
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:11.860
He doesn't make the assumption that we are act for the interests of others.

864
00:40:11.861 --> 00:40:16.861
We are selfishly concerned with our own freedom and the best means of preserving

865
00:40:17.921 --> 00:40:19.300
it and protecting us.

866
00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.750
Each of us has a desire to preserve his or own freedom and this,

867
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:28.910
that social order will be rational or just that allows us to preserve that

868
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:31.144
freedom.

869
00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.180
The problem of course,

870
00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:35.650
is that in the state of nature,

871
00:40:35.651 --> 00:40:40.651
the desire to preserve my freedom comes into conflict with the selfish desire of

872
00:40:42.371 --> 00:40:44.740
everybody else to preserve their freedom.

873
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:50.070
The state of nature quickly becomes a state of war based on conflicting desires.

874
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:54.080
And con conflicting again means of,

875
00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:54.590
of,

876
00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:54.811
of,

877
00:40:54.811 --> 00:40:56.440
of liberty preservation.

878
00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:01.830
So how do we preserve our liberty without lapsing into anarchy?

879
00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:02.620
Uh,

880
00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.790
that is the state of war.

881
00:41:03.791 --> 00:41:08.791
This is the question that the social contract sets out to answer and to which

882
00:41:08.801 --> 00:41:13.801
his formulation is famous formulation of what he calls the general will is the

883
00:41:14.441 --> 00:41:15.274
solution.

884
00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:15.740
Uh,

885
00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.970
I'm going to end on that note today and Wednesday we'll,

886
00:41:18.971 --> 00:41:23.440
I want to talk about the general will and how Russo sees it as a sort of

887
00:41:23.441 --> 00:41:28.300
collective answer to the problem of the securing of individual liberty.

888
00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:34.810
So meditate on that if you like for the next day.
