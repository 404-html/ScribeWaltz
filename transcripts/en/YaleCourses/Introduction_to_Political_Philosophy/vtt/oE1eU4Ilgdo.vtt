1
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.010
Where else are we were going to have today we're going to continue the state of

2
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:07.560
nature hubs.

3
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:12.561
His most famous discovery is most famous metaphor is most famous,

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.433
uh,

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.353
concept.

6
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.560
The end of class last time I can have my Hobbs is central problem is the problem

7
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.094
of authority.

8
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.491
What,

9
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:31.200
what makes authority possible?

10
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.510
What makes La Thought Authority legitimate?

11
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.270
And in order to answer that question,

12
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:39.060
I suggested he created,

13
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.040
uh,

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.580
this idea,

15
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:44.190
this metaphor again of a state of nature,

16
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.900
a statement in which he says we are naturally in Hobbs.

17
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:53.430
This state of nature is virtually the opposite of Aristotle's conception of the

18
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.540
natural and are the natural tea loss of man.

19
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.670
Uh,

20
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.320
it does not consist of our perfection,

21
00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:05.130
a condition of our perfection as Aristotle believed,

22
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.560
but four hubs.

23
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.710
The state of nature is something like the condition of human life in the absence

24
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:14.610
of authority,

25
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.860
in the absence of any one to impose rules,

26
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.110
order law on us.

27
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.710
What,

28
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.250
what would human beings be like in such a condition,

29
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.400
a condition of the type that he imagined maintains in a periods of crisis,

30
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:37.791
civil war of the kind that was true of England and the 1640s.

31
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.190
And I suggested a at the end of last time that in many ways Hobbes,

32
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:49.191
his idea of a state of nature can be understood in a sense as an extension of

33
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:55.581
his scientific methodology set out in the opening chapters of the book.

34
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.653
Uh,

35
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.970
let's imagine as he says,

36
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:00.181
you know,

37
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:05.181
human beings as if they were in a sort of laboratory tests to let's strip human

38
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:11.061
beings of all their social ties and customs and traditions.

39
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:17.031
Let's see what they would be like a in abstraction from all of the social and

40
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:23.151
political relationships which they enjoy and see how they would interact with

41
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:27.180
one another almost as chemical properties.

42
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.100
And you can see,

43
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.670
uh,

44
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.790
Hobbs working along that line.

45
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.380
But I would say this,

46
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.830
uh,

47
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.281
as it were,

48
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:38.160
scientific or Prodo scientific,

49
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.580
a conception of the state of nature is not the whole answer to this story

50
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:49.311
because underlying Hobbs is a conception of the state of nature is a powerful

51
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.230
moral conception,

52
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.080
a moral idea of the human being.

53
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.080
And that's what I want to talk a little bit about today.

54
00:02:58.081 --> 00:02:59.650
Hobbs is a moralist,

55
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.401
uh,

56
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:02.290
which seems odd in some ways.

57
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:04.870
How could grim and,

58
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.093
uh,

59
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.270
door,

60
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.020
uh,

61
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.020
old Thomas Hobbs be regarded as he more or less or someone with a moral

62
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:18.040
conception of human nature and the human condition.

63
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.770
But that's what I want to suggest to you today.

64
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.150
Uh,

65
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.250
the term in,

66
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.500
in a sense in which we might better characterize his conception of the state of

67
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:31.840
nature is one of individuality.

68
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.093
<v 1>MMM.</v>

69
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.620
<v 0>Hub shows us what it is to exercise the qualities of moral agency that is to</v>

70
00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:42.451
say,

71
00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:47.451
to do for ourselves rather than to have things done for us or for you hubs

72
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.650
introduced into our moral language,

73
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.900
the idiom of individuality in this concept,

74
00:03:57.901 --> 00:04:00.210
the concept of what it is to be an individual.

75
00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:02.100
A moral agent isn't really,

76
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.290
it's really not older than,

77
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:09.291
or at least not much older than the 17th century until the renaissance,

78
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.120
or not much later,

79
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.620
people considered themselves primarily not as individuals,

80
00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:17.730
but as members,

81
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.340
members of a particular family,

82
00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:21.390
of a cast,

83
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.650
of a guild,

84
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.310
of a particular religious order of a city,

85
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.510
uh,

86
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.320
or so on.

87
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.630
The idea that one is first of all,

88
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:33.300
a self with an eye,

89
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.800
an ego,

90
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.880
uh,

91
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.430
would have been regarded as unintelligible.

92
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.630
Uh,

93
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.090
and even as late as the 19th century,

94
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.310
uh,

95
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.220
Alexis de Tocqueville in democracy in America says,

96
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.290
individualism is a recent expression arising from a new idea.

97
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.720
That idea appeared new to Tocqueville as late as the 19th century.

98
00:04:57.721 --> 00:05:02.721
And this idea of the individual I want to suggest is at least in part,

99
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.780
it may be in large part traceable back to Hobbs.

100
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

101
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.250
<v 0>What is Hobbes is individual</v>

102
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.170
hubs conceived us,

103
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.903
<v 1>uh,</v>

104
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.860
<v 0>through a process of abstraction from the web of attachments in which we find</v>

105
00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:31.010
ourselves we are beings.

106
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.280
He argues again in the opening chapters whose fundamental characteristics is

107
00:05:36.381 --> 00:05:39.170
human beings are willing and choosing.

108
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.070
We are beings for whom the exercise of the will is a pre eminent feature and

109
00:05:47.421 --> 00:05:52.421
much of our happiness as human beings depends upon our capacity to exercise our

110
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.600
will and our ability for choice.

111
00:05:56.601 --> 00:06:01.601
Life hubs is an exercise and continual willing and continual choosing that may

112
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:08.201
be temporarily interrupted but can never come to an end except with the end of

113
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:10.730
life itself.

114
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.660
Hobbes is individuality or individualism is closely connected to this conception

115
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.990
of a human being or human wellbeing.

116
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.770
Uh,

117
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.510
as success in the competition for the goods of life.

118
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.490
Continual success.

119
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:29.990
He writes in chapter six,

120
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:34.991
continual success in obtaining those things which a man from time to time desire

121
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:39.950
with is what is called happiness or Felicity.

122
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.390
Uh,

123
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.270
our wellbeing depends on our,

124
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.870
uh,

125
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.740
ability to achieve the objects of our desires.

126
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.750
Uh,

127
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.670
the objects of our choices for there is no such thing.

128
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.060
He continues as perpetual tranquility of mind.

129
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.670
No such thing is perpetual tranquility.

130
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:00.020
Why we live here?

131
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.860
Because life itself is button motion and can never be without desire nor without

132
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:07.304
fear.

133
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.470
No more than without sense.

134
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.220
These are the characteristics of human life,

135
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.083
sense,

136
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.890
fear and desire.

137
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.070
Continual desire for one thing after another.

138
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:20.721
When for Hobbes,

139
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:25.721
this fact is not simply a physical or factual description of human behavior,

140
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:32.951
but it is a moral condition because we are each of us bundles of activity and

141
00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:39.680
initiative of likes and dislikes of desires and aversions.

142
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.430
Life for Hobbs is competition or struggle,

143
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.940
not just over scarce resources,

144
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.160
although that might be part of the struggle.

145
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.780
But for honors,

146
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.190
for anything else that a person might value or esteem,

147
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.900
Hobbes is fascinated,

148
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:57.831
uh,

149
00:07:57.831 --> 00:07:58.730
and is again,

150
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.130
like Montaine and a number of others.

151
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.010
He is fascinated with the diversity,

152
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.660
the sheer diversity,

153
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.180
multiplicity of human desires.

154
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:12.980
What leads one person to laughter leads another person to tears.

155
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:18.250
What leaves one person to piety and prayer nee leads another person to ridicule

156
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:19.731
and so on.

157
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:20.540
And so on.

158
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.040
Even moral terms.

159
00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:24.560
Hobbes says terms like good and evil,

160
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:25.010
he says,

161
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.090
are expressions of our individual likes and dislikes.

162
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:29.720
Uh,

163
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.520
we liked something he says,

164
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:33.050
not because it is good,

165
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.960
but we call something good because we like it.

166
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.540
And the same with qualities of,

167
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:38.670
uh,

168
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:39.230
other,

169
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.210
other moral qualities and attributes.

170
00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:45.470
They are expressions for him of our psychological states,

171
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:45.910
uh,

172
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.150
and aspirations.

173
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.820
And it is this individualism,

174
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.050
uh,

175
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:51.883
that is,

176
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.430
uh,

177
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:57.430
the ground of the general competition that we all experience for the object of

178
00:08:57.961 --> 00:08:58.890
our desires.

179
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:04.190
That he says the net or from this he infers that the natural condition is one of

180
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:05.280
competition,

181
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.150
of struggle,

182
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.430
of enmity and of war.

183
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.850
In a famous passage from chapter 11,

184
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:13.380
he posits as he puts it,

185
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:16.170
a general inclination of all mankind,

186
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.590
a perpetual and restless desire of power after power that sees it only in death.

187
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.500
This is as he puts it,

188
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:28.800
a general inclination of all mankind,

189
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.520
a district constant restlessness and motion and expression of our individuality

190
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.360
and what I have been calling Hobbs individualism is connected.

191
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.231
In fact,

192
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:40.531
they've been,

193
00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:42.510
is underwritten by.

194
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:47.100
Another attribute that he did is central to hubs that his,

195
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:48.210
his skepticism,

196
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.100
like many of the great early modern philosophers,

197
00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:53.934
Montana,

198
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.691
Descartes,

199
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:59.691
Spinosa Hobbes was obsessed with the question about what can I know or maybe put

200
00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:02.971
a different way,

201
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:04.980
what am I entitled to believe?

202
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:10.470
And there are many passages in Leviathan nit testify to Hobbs is fundamentally

203
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:12.030
skeptical view of knowledge,

204
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:12.860
right?

205
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.320
Uh,

206
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:18.320
he is a skeptic not because he believes that all that we can have no foundations

207
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:22.500
for our beliefs,

208
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:23.334
whatever,

209
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.640
but he is a skeptic in the sense that there can be no on his view transcendent

210
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.330
or non human foundations for our beliefs.

211
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:38.930
We cannot be certain he thinks of the ultimate foundations of our knowledge and

212
00:10:39.151 --> 00:10:40.350
this explains,

213
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.210
you may have wondered about this.

214
00:10:42.211 --> 00:10:47.211
This explains the importance he attributes to such things as naming and attach

215
00:10:47.841 --> 00:10:52.200
and correct definitions to things for reason.

216
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:57.201
He writes in a famous passage for reason is nothing but reckoning that is adding

217
00:10:58.021 --> 00:11:03.021
and subtracting the consequences of general names agreed upon knowledge.

218
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:05.064
In other words,

219
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.210
it's four hubs,

220
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.420
a human construction and it is always subject to what human beings can be made

221
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.980
to agree upon.

222
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.750
And that skeptical view of knowledge or at least skeptical view of the

223
00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:23.670
foundation of knowledge has far reaching consequences for him if if all

224
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.650
knowledge according to Hobbs,

225
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.400
ultimately rests on agreement about shared terms.

226
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.670
He infers from the there.

227
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.730
Our reason,

228
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.760
our rationality has no share in what Plato or Aristotle would have called the

229
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:39.690
divine nous.

230
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.700
The divine intelligence,

231
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:42.301
uh,

232
00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:47.070
our reason has within it no spark of divinity.

233
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.210
Uh,

234
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:53.210
our reason does not testify to some kind of inner voice of conscience or

235
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:58.831
anything that would purport to give it some kind of in Duke biteable foundation.

236
00:11:59.380 --> 00:11:59.740
Uh,

237
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.740
such certainty as we have about anything is for Hobbs always provisional,

238
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.040
uh,

239
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:11.040
discovered on the basis of experience and subject to continual revision in the

240
00:12:13.031 --> 00:12:15.400
light of further experience.

241
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:16.750
And that again,

242
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:20.050
experiential conception of knowledge.

243
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:24.250
That kind of skepticism about the foundations of knowledge has further

244
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:28.570
implications for Hobbes is views on such things as religion and religious

245
00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:29.404
toleration.

246
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.480
Uh,

247
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.330
there are no signs or fruit of religion,

248
00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:34.871
he says,

249
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:38.500
but in man only says in chapter 12.

250
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.560
That is to say the causes of religion can be traced back and are rooted in the

251
00:12:44.171 --> 00:12:48.490
restlessness of the human mind in its search for causes.

252
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.300
And it is because he says we are born ignorant of causes.

253
00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:56.980
We are ignorant of the causes of things that we are led to search out beginnings

254
00:12:56.981 --> 00:12:57.880
and origins.

255
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.160
And this leads us ultimately,

256
00:13:00.161 --> 00:13:00.701
he says,

257
00:13:00.701 --> 00:13:05.200
to posit the existence of God who is a so to speak,

258
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:05.560
uh,

259
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.730
the first cause of all things Hobbes does not,

260
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:10.360
uh,

261
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.830
despite this kind of rationalistic view of religion and his view that religion

262
00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:15.700
has its origin,

263
00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:16.091
again,

264
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:17.960
in the restlessness and the UN,

265
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:18.460
uh,

266
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:18.780
of,

267
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:23.780
of the human mind hubs doesn't deny the possibility of revelation or some kind

268
00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:28.000
of direct communication of God to us.

269
00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:33.001
But what he does deny is that this revel is that anyone who has claimed to

270
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:35.140
receive such a revelation,

271
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:40.290
he denies that any such person has the right to impose that view on anyone else

272
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.200
because nobody else can correctly,

273
00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:44.590
uh,

274
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.940
have the means to verify a person's claim to revelation.

275
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:53.970
No one can impose their claim of revealed knowledge on another.

276
00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:58.630
Does this make hubs and atheist as many would have maintained in his day?

277
00:13:58.631 --> 00:13:59.250
No.

278
00:13:59.250 --> 00:13:59.511
Uh,

279
00:13:59.511 --> 00:14:02.020
it makes him a skeptic about,

280
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:02.711
uh,

281
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:03.720
about the,

282
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:04.773
uh,

283
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.610
revealed religion.

284
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.100
Okay.

285
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:16.100
So it is because of this individualism and skepticism.

286
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.820
A view of life is willing and choosing that there are in the state of nature,

287
00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:21.451
so to speak,

288
00:14:21.451 --> 00:14:26.451
no standards to adjudicate conflicts that the central issue of politics arises.

289
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.290
Namely what makes authority possible.

290
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.590
How are people who are biologically,

291
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:35.610
uh,

292
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.380
individually constituted?

293
00:14:37.381 --> 00:14:37.740
So,

294
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:38.461
so to speak.

295
00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:43.461
How can any of them ever be any of us ever be capable of obeying common rules or

296
00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:48.780
having moral obligations to one another?

297
00:14:48.781 --> 00:14:50.280
How is that possible?

298
00:14:50.281 --> 00:14:52.460
Hobbs to ask,

299
00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:53.060
uh,

300
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:53.420
in a,

301
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:58.420
in a manner of speaking on almost every page of the book,

302
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.150
but before answering that question,

303
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.290
uh,

304
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.530
consider a little further hubs,

305
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:10.280
his account of the state of nature and what makes it seem like a plausible

306
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.480
starting point?

307
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.020
Uh,

308
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:16.100
to answer the question of what makes authority possible

309
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.780
to say that the state of nature,

310
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:21.800
uh,

311
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.070
consists primarily of individuals with again,

312
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.330
diverse likes,

313
00:15:26.331 --> 00:15:27.350
dislikes,

314
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:28.041
beliefs,

315
00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:28.791
opinions,

316
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:29.624
and the like.

317
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.170
Uh,

318
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:35.170
is not to say that the state of nature is a state of isolation as it sometimes

319
00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:39.470
attributed to him and people in the state of nature may have regular and

320
00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:42.560
continual contact with one another.

321
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.130
It is just that their relations are unregulated.

322
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:48.050
They are unregulated by law,

323
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.630
they are unregulated by authority.

324
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.710
The state of nature is simply a kind of condition of maximum,

325
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:55.250
uh,

326
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.390
insecurity,

327
00:15:56.391 --> 00:15:59.660
an unregulated market with no,

328
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.680
um,

329
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:00.990
with,

330
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.540
with no common laws or rules to uh,

331
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:04.971
to,

332
00:16:04.971 --> 00:16:05.870
to sustain it.

333
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.490
The emphasis on the individual is just another way of saying,

334
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:11.210
again,

335
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:16.210
unlike Aristotle that no one has a natural authority over anyone else.

336
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:18.500
Uh,

337
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.610
relations of authority exist only by so to speak,

338
00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:25.730
the consent or the will of the governed.

339
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:32.170
And the fact that relations in the state of nature are unregulated for him makes

340
00:16:32.571 --> 00:16:37.571
it a container is synonymous with making it a condition of war of all against

341
00:16:40.461 --> 00:16:40.970
all.

342
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.650
And his famous formulation.

343
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.810
Now you might look at that formulation.

344
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.470
A state of war is won against of all against all.

345
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:50.970
And you might say that such a condition of,

346
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.430
of civil war,

347
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.830
of maximum insecurity,

348
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:59.860
of the total breakdown of condition of rules and laws is if anything,

349
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:01.790
the state of the acception.

350
00:17:01.791 --> 00:17:04.400
How often does that really occur?

351
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.910
Uh,

352
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:05.181
in,

353
00:17:05.181 --> 00:17:07.400
in our experience in human life.

354
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.360
But hubs like Machiavelli is we saw likes to take the exceptional situation and

355
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:17.090
turn it in to the norm.

356
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.460
It becomes the normal condition.

357
00:17:19.461 --> 00:17:20.900
State of security,

358
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.220
insecurity,

359
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.060
fear,

360
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.380
conflict in the leg.

361
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:28.760
This is not to say again that the state of nature for Hobbes is one of permanent

362
00:17:28.761 --> 00:17:29.594
fighting,

363
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:34.970
but it is one of permanent fear and distrust and he asks his readers,

364
00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:35.211
I mean,

365
00:17:35.211 --> 00:17:37.340
there's so many wonderful passages in this book.

366
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.520
It's just happens to be one of my particular favorites.

367
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.590
He asks us readers,

368
00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.300
if you don't believe me,

369
00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.051
again,

370
00:17:45.051 --> 00:17:46.340
think of his skepticism.

371
00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:46.550
Don't,

372
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:47.660
don't believe me.

373
00:17:47.661 --> 00:17:48.494
He says,

374
00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:53.540
check your own experience and see if I'm not right and this is what he writes.

375
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.100
Let him him the reader,

376
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.680
therefore ask himself Hobbs rights.

377
00:17:58.681 --> 00:17:59.970
When taking a journey.

378
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.730
He arms himself and seeks to go well,

379
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:04.950
accompanied when going to sleep.

380
00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:09.951
He locks his doors even when in his house and even went in his house.

381
00:18:10.801 --> 00:18:13.770
He locks his chest and this when he knows,

382
00:18:13.771 --> 00:18:18.480
he says there'd be laws and public officer's arm to avenge all injuries shall be

383
00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:19.314
done to him.

384
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:24.770
What opinion hubs asks he has of his fellow subjects when he rides armed.

385
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:26.070
You know,

386
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.490
what does that say about your thinking about your,

387
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:30.900
your fellow citizens?

388
00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:35.430
When you arm yourselves going for a trip of his fellow citizens,

389
00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:39.150
when he locks his doors at night or of his children and servants,

390
00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:40.740
when he locks his chest,

391
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.920
does he not therefore as much accused mankind by his action as I do by my words,

392
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:47.940
you can see the,

393
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.130
the mischievousness of Hobbs in that,

394
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:50.430
you know,

395
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:51.930
in that delightful passage.

396
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.430
What,

397
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.400
what about you?

398
00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:54.001
He says,

399
00:18:54.001 --> 00:18:56.610
and this is not in some kind of state of nature,

400
00:18:56.611 --> 00:18:58.230
this is in a completely,

401
00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.040
you know,

402
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.200
fully functioning society.

403
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:01.681
Uh,

404
00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:03.480
when you go go armed,

405
00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:04.830
when you lock your doors,

406
00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:05.490
when you lock,

407
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:08.610
when you lock your chests at night,

408
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.190
don't you just don't,

409
00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:14.610
your actions and your experience simply confirm what,

410
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:15.330
what I'm,

411
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.710
what I'm what I'm saying.

412
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.980
And this tells us another thing about the state of nature,

413
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.900
which it is easy to forget.

414
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:22.950
The state of nature,

415
00:19:22.951 --> 00:19:24.030
at least for Hobbes,

416
00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:28.230
is not some kind of primitive anthropological.

417
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.170
A datum that we find by,

418
00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:31.471
you know,

419
00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:34.650
going back in time somehow Russo,

420
00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:37.380
we'll speak about it more this way for Hobbes,

421
00:19:37.381 --> 00:19:39.480
the state of nature exists.

422
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:40.201
He says,

423
00:19:40.201 --> 00:19:43.360
whenever a authority is not enforced,

424
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.710
the state of nature fully continues in many ways.

425
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.290
Oddly even in civil society,

426
00:19:49.291 --> 00:19:49.741
he says,

427
00:19:49.741 --> 00:19:54.741
whenever we have reason to believe that our lives or our properties or ourselves

428
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.330
are not secure.

429
00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.513
Uh,

430
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:02.840
and so that,

431
00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.390
that's,

432
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:04.171
that's the,

433
00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:04.590
the,

434
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:05.423
the uh,

435
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.480
in in fact,

436
00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:06.900
we,

437
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.900
we can never be fully free of the fear and the anxiety and uncertainty of,

438
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:14.430
of,

439
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.630
of the state of nature,

440
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.660
even even within to some degree of fully constituted a civil society.

441
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.510
The only exception to this of course in Hobbs is a account of the state of

442
00:20:27.511 --> 00:20:28.530
nature when he says,

443
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:33.090
don't you lock your doors at night are of course a Yale students,

444
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:33.390
uh,

445
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:38.390
living here on campus who are so trusting that they never locked their doors at

446
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:41.190
night in their entryways and so on.

447
00:20:41.191 --> 00:20:41.791
And then of course,

448
00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:45.150
are always stunned to find when something is stolen from them.

449
00:20:45.151 --> 00:20:46.260
How could this be?

450
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.570
How this be a,

451
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.451
and I tell him,

452
00:20:49.451 --> 00:20:50.770
lock your doors,

453
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.780
but they still don't believe me.

454
00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.560
Uh,

455
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.560
maybe you'll now believe hubs if you don't believe me.

456
00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.290
So the state of nature,

457
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.150
it's a state of insecurity.

458
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:03.130
It's a state of conflict.

459
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.600
How do we get out of it?

460
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.231
This is,

461
00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:05.561
you know,

462
00:21:05.561 --> 00:21:09.280
of course that the huge issue that Hobbs asks,

463
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:09.850
uh,

464
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:10.720
for the rest of,

465
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.160
for much of the book,

466
00:21:12.161 --> 00:21:17.161
what do we do to get out of this state of nature to enter a condition of civil

467
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.720
society and civilized life?

468
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:24.740
How do I give up my right to do whatever is in my power to secure my person or

469
00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:30.250
my possessions when I have no expectation?

470
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:35.230
You might say that others around me are prepared to do so as well.

471
00:21:35.231 --> 00:21:40.231
This is sort of a classic example of what a economists and other people like

472
00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:43.390
them called the prisoner's dilemma.

473
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:43.721
You know,

474
00:21:43.721 --> 00:21:48.721
why should I act in such a way if I have no expectation or reasonable,

475
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:50.570
uh,

476
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.750
expectation that those around me will,

477
00:21:52.751 --> 00:21:53.051
will,

478
00:21:53.051 --> 00:21:54.160
will reciprocate.

479
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:54.993
Hobbs is,

480
00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:01.140
members of a state of nature seem to be in a classic prisoner's dilemma problem.

481
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:04.450
Maybe we can say,

482
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.741
we could say,

483
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:07.090
or Hobbs could say that,

484
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:07.660
uh,

485
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.780
laying down our right to do all things,

486
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:11.440
uh,

487
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.890
in seeking peace with others is the rational thing to do.

488
00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:15.370
Uh,

489
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:16.690
in the condition of nature,

490
00:22:16.691 --> 00:22:21.691
we are all rational actors and therefore it is rational for us to seek and to

491
00:22:22.001 --> 00:22:23.110
desire peace.

492
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.940
But note that that is exactly what Hobbes does not say.

493
00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:33.670
You does not say this far from having a sort of a rational actor model of

494
00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:34.841
politics.

495
00:22:34.841 --> 00:22:35.070
He,

496
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.770
he operates with an irrational actor model.

497
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.170
He assumes that it is not reason,

498
00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:42.340
but our passions,

499
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:43.180
uh,

500
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.000
that are the dominant force of human psychology,

501
00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:47.030
our desires,

502
00:22:47.031 --> 00:22:47.920
our aversions,

503
00:22:47.921 --> 00:22:48.910
our passions.

504
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:54.630
And although I've said that Hobbs has emphasize the diversity of our passions,

505
00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.640
there are still two main passions that he feels universally dominate human

506
00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:03.814
nature.

507
00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.690
And these two passions are pride and fear.

508
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.273
<v 2>Okay.</v>

509
00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.650
<v 0>Pride and fear.</v>

510
00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.180
These are the hubs,

511
00:23:17.181 --> 00:23:17.470
Ian,

512
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:19.880
equivalents of that too.

513
00:23:19.881 --> 00:23:20.390
Great.

514
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.750
Huet what Machiavelli called humors.

515
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:27.760
You remember the two humors of the two big of the two great social classes that

516
00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.130
the desires of,

517
00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:34.040
of the rich and powerful as it were to rule over others.

518
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:35.840
And the desire of the,

519
00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:36.853
of the week,

520
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.060
not to be ruled,

521
00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.890
Machiavelli called those the two.

522
00:23:39.891 --> 00:23:40.641
You Mari,

523
00:23:40.641 --> 00:23:41.180
the two,

524
00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.170
the two humors,

525
00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:46.580
the two groups and Hobbs similarly with a kind of model.

526
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.620
He's a great political psychologist.

527
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:49.251
Uh,

528
00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:49.530
the,

529
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.490
the two great passions of pride and fear,

530
00:23:52.491 --> 00:23:53.324
pride,

531
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.841
he says,

532
00:23:53.841 --> 00:23:56.000
is the passion for preeminence,

533
00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:02.050
the desire to be first and also to be seen to be first.

534
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:03.770
Uh,

535
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.810
in the great race of life.

536
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.400
Prideful people.

537
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:12.401
He tells us are those overflowing with confidence about their own abilities to

538
00:24:14.061 --> 00:24:14.721
succeed.

539
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:16.370
And we all know people like this.

540
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:18.020
Don't wait like Yale students.

541
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.750
They're all overflowing with confidence,

542
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:23.060
kind of Alpha types.

543
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:23.990
Uh,

544
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.020
Machiavelli might call them sort of manly men,

545
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:27.590
uh,

546
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.130
who,

547
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:28.640
who,

548
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.090
uh,

549
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.420
fully confident about their abilities.

550
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:36.620
And yet hubs is a great debunker of human pride.

551
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:41.660
Pride is equivalent to what he calls a vanity or vain glory.

552
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:47.110
It is a kind of exaggerated confidence in one's own power and ability.

553
00:24:47.751 --> 00:24:48.740
It is pride,

554
00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:53.741
the desire to Lord it over others and to have one one's superiority acknowledged

555
00:24:55.851 --> 00:24:56.684
by others.

556
00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:01.070
That is the great problem for hubs to be averted.

557
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.040
But if pride for him,

558
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:04.641
uh,

559
00:25:04.641 --> 00:25:07.220
is one of his great universal passions.

560
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.320
So is its opposite.

561
00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:10.040
Uh,

562
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:15.040
fear hubs makes the fear of death that may come to us at any time in a state of

563
00:25:17.061 --> 00:25:17.541
nature.

564
00:25:17.541 --> 00:25:19.370
Perhaps he exaggerates this,

565
00:25:19.371 --> 00:25:24.350
but making it a pure state of nature is a kind of existential condition in which

566
00:25:24.351 --> 00:25:26.930
death can come to you at almost any moment.

567
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:28.820
Uh,

568
00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.640
and but there is more to fear than then.

569
00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:33.350
This simply fear of death,

570
00:25:33.351 --> 00:25:38.351
although Hobbs emphasizes and dramatically perhaps overemphasizes fear is not

571
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.700
just the desire to avoid death,

572
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.810
but to avoid losing a,

573
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:52.811
you might say again in the great race of life to avoid losing and to be seen as

574
00:25:55.191 --> 00:25:56.024
a loser.

575
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:56.960
Uh,

576
00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.960
it is the desire to avoid the shame of being seen by others as losing out

577
00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.610
somehow.

578
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.970
There was a social quality clearly to both of these passions,

579
00:26:07.971 --> 00:26:11.330
pride and sh and in fear one again,

580
00:26:11.331 --> 00:26:15.320
the desire to have one's preeminence is steamed by others.

581
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:20.740
Fear that desire to avoid shame and dishonor.

582
00:26:20.871 --> 00:26:24.860
How we are seen by others is a crucial cardinal.

583
00:26:24.861 --> 00:26:27.980
Part of Hobbs is moral psychology and each of us,

584
00:26:27.981 --> 00:26:32.981
he says contain these do not simply represent two classes of individuals,

585
00:26:33.531 --> 00:26:34.790
two classes of persons.

586
00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:38.150
Each of us contains these two warring,

587
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:38.900
you might say,

588
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:39.980
elements within us,

589
00:26:39.981 --> 00:26:41.750
both self assertion,

590
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:42.500
uh,

591
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.050
and fear of the consequence of self assertion.

592
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.450
The question is for Hobbes.

593
00:26:48.451 --> 00:26:49.320
How do we,

594
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.570
uh,

595
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.520
how do we tame these passions?

596
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:56.160
How do we tame these passions?

597
00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:01.740
It is most of our pride that Hobbes wants to tame.

598
00:27:01.741 --> 00:27:03.840
And of course the very title of his book,

599
00:27:03.841 --> 00:27:08.070
Leviathan he tells us later on comes from what you remember.

600
00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:10.563
<v 2>Where does it come from?</v>

601
00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:12.303
Who remembers

602
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.750
<v 0>passage from what?</v>

603
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.730
Joe Book of Job,

604
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.680
where he refers to Leviathan as king of the children of pride.

605
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:29.500
The book is based on Biblical Metaphor about over coming or subduing.

606
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:32.363
Pride

607
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:39.140
is the great Marcellus wireless says in the film pulp fiction pride never helps.

608
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.360
<v 2>It only hurts</v>

609
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:44.121
<v 0>you.</v>

610
00:27:44.121 --> 00:27:44.900
Remember that?

611
00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.850
That's magnificent speech.

612
00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:53.650
Fear hub says is the passion to reckon on is the passion to be recognized.

613
00:27:54.441 --> 00:27:59.441
It is fear not reason that leads us to abandon the state of nature and sue for

614
00:28:00.741 --> 00:28:01.574
peace,

615
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.990
the passions that inclined men to peace hubs,

616
00:28:05.991 --> 00:28:06.380
right?

617
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.670
Our fear of death.

618
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:15.540
This is not to say that Hobbes believes fear to be the naturally stronger of the

619
00:28:15.541 --> 00:28:16.770
two passions in fact,

620
00:28:16.771 --> 00:28:17.604
far from it.

621
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:18.480
Uh,

622
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.830
there are many people,

623
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:20.250
uh,

624
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:21.960
certainly even around us who,

625
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:25.920
who Hobbes believes do not fear death as they should.

626
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:31.130
The proud aristocrat who prefers death before dishonor the religious zealot,

627
00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:32.810
uh,

628
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:36.780
prepared to sacrifice his life and of course those of others,

629
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.500
uh,

630
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.870
in order to achieve the rewards of heaven.

631
00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:43.020
And of course just the risk taking individual,

632
00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:43.530
uh,

633
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:44.430
who you know,

634
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.590
seeks to climb Mount Everest,

635
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.070
uh,

636
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.903
just for the,

637
00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:48.300
uh,

638
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.610
honor and esteem involved.

639
00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:55.050
And it is part of the broader educational or pedagogic function,

640
00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:55.540
uh,

641
00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.780
of Leviathan to help us see,

642
00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:02.730
Hobbes thinks the dangers of pride and the advantages of peace.

643
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.880
Properly directed fear leads to peace.

644
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:14.330
Fear is the basis even of what Hobbs calls the various laws of nature that lead

645
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:18.780
us to civil society.

646
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:24.860
The laws of nature for carbs are described as a precept or a general rule of

647
00:29:25.771 --> 00:29:26.311
reason.

648
00:29:26.311 --> 00:29:31.311
It every man ought to endeavor piece and it is out of fear that we begin to

649
00:29:32.431 --> 00:29:35.520
reason and see the advantages of society.

650
00:29:35.521 --> 00:29:39.750
Reason is dependent upon the passions upon fear.

651
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:44.900
The first and most fundamental law of nature he says is to seek peace and follow

652
00:29:46.511 --> 00:29:47.344
it.

653
00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.260
Not only should one seek peace,

654
00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.820
but we have an obligation.

655
00:29:52.821 --> 00:29:53.271
He says,

656
00:29:53.271 --> 00:29:54.890
to lay down our arms,

657
00:29:54.891 --> 00:29:59.891
to lay down our right to all things on the condition that others around us are

658
00:30:00.171 --> 00:30:02.210
prepared to do so as well.

659
00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:06.500
And Hobbes goes on to enumerate 19 laws of nature.

660
00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:06.951
I won't,

661
00:30:06.951 --> 00:30:08.210
I won't go into all of them.

662
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.010
19 laws of nature,

663
00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:14.510
nature that constitute a kind of framework for establishing civil society.

664
00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:16.693
These laws,

665
00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.720
he even compares as his equivalent of the golden rule,

666
00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.350
which he states in the negative do not do unto others.

667
00:30:24.351 --> 00:30:29.351
What you would not have them do unto you hear is Hobbes is rewriting of the

668
00:30:30.501 --> 00:30:33.380
golden rule in terms of these laws of nature.

669
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.710
But these raise a question for us as readers of Hobbs,

670
00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:41.090
right?

671
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.570
Don't they?

672
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:42.140
What?

673
00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.820
What is the status of the,

674
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:45.140
of the laws of nature?

675
00:30:45.141 --> 00:30:49.370
What is the moral status if any of these laws,

676
00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.940
hubs as we see sometimes,

677
00:30:52.941 --> 00:30:57.941
right as a sort of scientist or prodo scientists for whom nature and one

678
00:30:58.521 --> 00:31:03.521
supposes the laws of nature operate with the same kind of necessity as the laws

679
00:31:04.581 --> 00:31:05.870
of physical attraction.

680
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:08.660
That that's how he often writes about human behavior.

681
00:31:08.661 --> 00:31:13.661
That we obey the same laws of physical attraction as do any other bodies that we

682
00:31:15.261 --> 00:31:16.580
might choose to describe.

683
00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:21.790
They describe how bodies in motion always in necessarily behave these laws of

684
00:31:23.361 --> 00:31:23.811
nature.

685
00:31:23.811 --> 00:31:28.811
And yet at the same time Hobbs right is a moralist for whom the laws of nature

686
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:34.630
he calls precepts of reason or general rules according to which we are forbidden

687
00:31:35.751 --> 00:31:38.390
to do anything destructive of life

688
00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.753
in this tense.

689
00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:45.440
The laws of nature as he described him appear to be moral laws with moral

690
00:31:45.441 --> 00:31:50.441
commands commands you not to do anything that is destructive of life,

691
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.750
your own or that of others.

692
00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.750
And his moral laws in this sense,

693
00:31:56.751 --> 00:32:01.751
we have presumably the freedom to obey them or disobeyed them if they acted with

694
00:32:02.121 --> 00:32:06.230
a kind of mechanical necessity or even geometric necessity.

695
00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.770
They could not possibly be moral laws in that way.

696
00:32:09.771 --> 00:32:14.771
They can only be moral if there is some semblance of human choice or will

697
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:16.070
expressed in the,

698
00:32:16.071 --> 00:32:19.610
in the relationship our ability to do otherwise.

699
00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:24.790
So these laws of nature seek peace and so on do not simply seem to be

700
00:32:25.251 --> 00:32:28.910
descriptive of how people do behave.

701
00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:33.410
They seem to be prescriptive of how people ought to behave.

702
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.220
Uh,

703
00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.820
and this hubs even suggest at the end of Chapter 15,

704
00:32:37.821 --> 00:32:39.740
when he writes about the of nature,

705
00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:41.390
these dictates of reason.

706
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.161
Men,

707
00:32:42.161 --> 00:32:45.500
you men used to call by the name laws,

708
00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:50.501
but improperly for they are conclusions or theorems according to what conduces

709
00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.560
to the conversation of mankind.

710
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.400
These used to be called laws of nature,

711
00:32:58.401 --> 00:32:58.821
he says,

712
00:32:58.821 --> 00:32:59.990
but improperly.

713
00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.040
So if they are only improperly laws of nature,

714
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:07.220
why does Hobbs continue to use the term?

715
00:33:07.221 --> 00:33:07.491
Why?

716
00:33:07.491 --> 00:33:11.540
Why does he use this terminology of laws of nature?

717
00:33:11.541 --> 00:33:12.261
In a sense,

718
00:33:12.261 --> 00:33:17.261
this might simply be Hobbs is way of paying homage to the ancient tradition of

719
00:33:18.741 --> 00:33:19.790
natural law.

720
00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.670
Going back to the medieval scholastics,

721
00:33:22.671 --> 00:33:24.420
to the stoics and,

722
00:33:24.421 --> 00:33:27.080
and perhaps even beyond them.

723
00:33:27.081 --> 00:33:31.760
The natural laws for hubs are not divine commands or ordinances.

724
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:32.601
He says,

725
00:33:32.601 --> 00:33:35.150
but they are rules of practical reason.

726
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:36.890
Figured out,

727
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.210
uh,

728
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:42.510
by us is the optimal means of securing our wellbeing.

729
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:45.470
These laws of nature as he describes them,

730
00:33:45.471 --> 00:33:49.670
do not issue a categorical commands so much.

731
00:33:49.671 --> 00:33:51.530
It's sort of hypothetical rules.

732
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:52.970
If you want x,

733
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.050
do y.

734
00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:56.150
If you want peace,

735
00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.190
here are the means to it.

736
00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.770
And he calls these laws,

737
00:34:00.771 --> 00:34:02.480
these 19 laws of nature,

738
00:34:02.481 --> 00:34:05.060
the true and only moral philosophy.

739
00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.100
So you can see in that passage,

740
00:34:07.101 --> 00:34:09.500
Hobbs takes himself to be a moralist,

741
00:34:09.501 --> 00:34:13.640
writing within the great tradition of moral philosophy.

742
00:34:13.641 --> 00:34:16.190
These laws of nature are for him,

743
00:34:16.191 --> 00:34:18.950
the true and only moral philosophy.

744
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:24.470
What this brings me to some criticisms or at least some questions about hubs.

745
00:34:24.471 --> 00:34:26.720
This conception of the laws of nature.

746
00:34:26.721 --> 00:34:28.280
What are we to make of these laws?

747
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.881
As I've,

748
00:34:28.881 --> 00:34:30.050
as I've asked before,

749
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:37.180
in one sense there seems to be a genuine moral content to Hobbs is laws of

750
00:34:37.551 --> 00:34:37.971
nature,

751
00:34:37.971 --> 00:34:40.280
which can be reduced to a single formula.

752
00:34:40.281 --> 00:34:45.281
Seek peace above all other goods hubs more than anyone else wants us to value

753
00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.770
the virtues of civility.

754
00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:57.370
That is those you might say summed up in a word or the night with the 19 laws of

755
00:34:59.151 --> 00:34:59.640
nature.

756
00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.473
Command,

757
00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.410
the civility and tales,

758
00:35:03.411 --> 00:35:04.910
the virtues of peace,

759
00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.073
equity,

760
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:06.920
fairness,

761
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.360
playing by the rules,

762
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.770
pieces for hubs,

763
00:35:09.771 --> 00:35:10.700
a moral good.

764
00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:15.800
And the virtues are those qualities of behavior that lend to peace.

765
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.190
And vices are those that lead to war.

766
00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.193
Consider,

767
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:21.680
uh,

768
00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.780
the disadvantages of war.

769
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.550
And the benefits of peace.

770
00:35:25.551 --> 00:35:29.600
Here is what Hobbs writes in such a condition that is the state of nature.

771
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:33.770
There is no place for industry because the fruit thereof is uncertain and

772
00:35:33.771 --> 00:35:36.950
consequently no culture of the earth,

773
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.880
no navigation nor building,

774
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.640
nor instruments of moving and removing things.

775
00:35:41.641 --> 00:35:42.960
Is it require much force,

776
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:44.880
no knowledge of the face of the earth.

777
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.581
No.

778
00:35:45.581 --> 00:35:46.650
We'll count of time.

779
00:35:46.651 --> 00:35:47.311
No Arts,

780
00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:48.001
no letters,

781
00:35:48.001 --> 00:35:48.930
no society.

782
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.910
And which is worst of all continual fear and danger of violent death.

783
00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:54.720
Uh,

784
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.830
this is again the sort of existential condition in which Hobbs wants to put us

785
00:35:58.831 --> 00:36:03.360
in the state of nature and all the benefits he lists there he enumerates that

786
00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:06.030
are denied to us in such a condition.

787
00:36:06.031 --> 00:36:06.391
Again,

788
00:36:06.391 --> 00:36:07.200
no,

789
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.160
no knowledge,

790
00:36:08.161 --> 00:36:09.210
no geography,

791
00:36:09.211 --> 00:36:10.890
no cultivation of the earth,

792
00:36:10.891 --> 00:36:12.570
no navigation are building.

793
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.910
All of these things are the fruits of peace.

794
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.193
He tells us.

795
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:18.383
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

796
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:19.700
<v 0>But at this point,</v>

797
00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.790
a careful reader such as all of yourselves,

798
00:36:22.791 --> 00:36:23.624
no doubt,

799
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:24.440
uh,

800
00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.610
would no doubt be suggesting I've gone too far.

801
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:29.783
<v 2>Sure.</v>

802
00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.150
<v 0>And suggesting or calling Hobbs,</v>

803
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:36.200
a moral philosopher whose motto,

804
00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:36.980
uh,

805
00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:39.470
in a way could be summed up in the phrase,

806
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.450
give peace a chance.

807
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:42.860
Uh,

808
00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.180
is that what Hobbs believed?

809
00:36:44.181 --> 00:36:44.361
What,

810
00:36:44.361 --> 00:36:46.640
why is peace the highest good anyway?

811
00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:47.451
I mean,

812
00:36:47.451 --> 00:36:48.710
why not justice?

813
00:36:48.711 --> 00:36:49.820
Why not honor?

814
00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.310
Why not piety a,

815
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.930
why not the examined life?

816
00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:54.251
What,

817
00:36:54.251 --> 00:36:56.690
what makes piece so good for Hobbs?

818
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.440
Ah,

819
00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.520
well I've given a number of,

820
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.710
I've quoted him on a number of reasons,

821
00:37:00.711 --> 00:37:05.711
but one suggestion might be that it is not so much peace alone at Hobbs

822
00:37:07.521 --> 00:37:11.330
cherishes as life piece is a means to life.

823
00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:16.520
Every creature he says has a builtin desire to preserve itself,

824
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.770
to persevere in its own existence,

825
00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.710
to continue in its own steady state.

826
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.350
Uh,

827
00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:23.210
you might say,

828
00:37:23.211 --> 00:37:26.660
and to resist invasion or encroachment by others.

829
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.370
We are all endowed.

830
00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:31.430
He says with a kind of natural right to life.

831
00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:37.130
And the desire to preserve oneself is not just a biological fact,

832
00:37:37.131 --> 00:37:41.330
although it is also that it is for him a moral right.

833
00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.980
It is a moral entitlement.

834
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.460
Every being has a fundamental right to its own life.

835
00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:49.160
We not only have a right to our lives,

836
00:37:49.161 --> 00:37:54.161
but to do whatever we regard is needful to protect our lives.

837
00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:55.581
And again,

838
00:37:55.581 --> 00:37:58.220
this is not simply a brute fact of nature.

839
00:37:58.221 --> 00:38:00.470
It is a moral entitlement for hubs,

840
00:38:00.471 --> 00:38:03.260
this source of human worth and dignity.

841
00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:09.010
But now you will suggest I've really gone too far attributing to Hobbs d

842
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:14.420
doctrine of human dignity that one might expect to find in a philosopher like

843
00:38:14.571 --> 00:38:16.760
can't or someone else didn't.

844
00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.380
Hubs cynically,

845
00:38:18.381 --> 00:38:19.070
right?

846
00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.300
In chapter 10,

847
00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.800
the value or worth of a man is of all things his price,

848
00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:26.330
what,

849
00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:27.163
what we will,

850
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.550
what price we will fetch and the marketplace,

851
00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:33.200
no doubt the value or worth of a man is his price.

852
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:34.410
Uh,

853
00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:34.850
uh,

854
00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:38.350
I a phrase incidentally quoted by Karl Marx,

855
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:38.860
uh,

856
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.250
to indicate the sheer heartlessness of,

857
00:38:41.251 --> 00:38:41.521
of,

858
00:38:41.521 --> 00:38:41.751
of,

859
00:38:41.751 --> 00:38:46.030
of the kind of the bourgeois society that Hobbes was hoping to bring about and

860
00:38:46.031 --> 00:38:48.550
doesn't Hobbs is materialism.

861
00:38:48.551 --> 00:38:53.551
And his sort of mechanistic theory of nature seemed to detract from any inherent

862
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.200
worth of the individual.

863
00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:57.071
I mean,

864
00:38:57.071 --> 00:38:58.870
there seems to be something to that.

865
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:01.990
And yet Hobbs certainly regards life.

866
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.310
It's a precious good,

867
00:39:03.311 --> 00:39:06.670
perhaps the most precious good of all.

868
00:39:06.671 --> 00:39:11.671
And he writes with a lively sense of how fragile and endangered,

869
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:12.220
uh,

870
00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.150
life is.

871
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:13.780
Uh,

872
00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:18.780
the work as a whole can be seen as an effort to dispel what he believes to be

873
00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:20.350
false beliefs,

874
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.450
false doctrines and beliefs that disguise the truth from us.

875
00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:27.670
The truth about the value of life.

876
00:39:27.671 --> 00:39:28.391
For example,

877
00:39:28.391 --> 00:39:32.860
beliefs about the afterlife and all beliefs that detract from,

878
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.431
uh,

879
00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:38.080
an appreciation for the value of life as it is this prevent,

880
00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:43.110
this provides the moral basis of what I would call Hobbs is humanitarianism and

881
00:39:45.221 --> 00:39:49.720
get that humanitarianism seems to raise further problems.

882
00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:50.650
Uh,

883
00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:55.650
doesn't hubs or does Hobbs is attempt to instill in us the readers of his book,

884
00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:02.370
his attempt to instill in us and appreciation for life and the value of life.

885
00:40:02.681 --> 00:40:06.760
Does this simultaneously create an aversion to risk,

886
00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:07.550
uh,

887
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:12.520
in extreme fear of conflict and challenge or disorder,

888
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:18.390
you could say is this constant fear that hubs harps on fear of death and the

889
00:40:20.411 --> 00:40:21.340
value of life?

890
00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:23.530
To put it rather rudely,

891
00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:23.950
uh,

892
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:26.650
is this not another word for cowardice?

893
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:33.060
Just Hobbs is emphasis and the preservation of life is the supreme moral value.

894
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:38.850
Does this turn his mighty Leviathan into a kind of Commonwealth of cowards,

895
00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.073
uh,

896
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.040
where Aristotle made the courage of men in combat,

897
00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:45.910
uh,

898
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:50.910
central virtue of his ethics hubs pointedly emits courage from his list of the

899
00:40:52.541 --> 00:40:53.590
moral virtues.

900
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:56.290
At one point,

901
00:40:56.410 --> 00:41:01.330
he even suggests that courage is really just a species of rashness.

902
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:06.400
And his example of courage comes from duals and dual fighting,

903
00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:11.700
which he says will be always honorable but are unlawful for duals.

904
00:41:11.771 --> 00:41:16.690
He says our many times effects of courage and the ground of courage is always

905
00:41:16.691 --> 00:41:17.860
strength or skill,

906
00:41:17.861 --> 00:41:22.861
though for the most part he says they be effects of rash speaking and the fear

907
00:41:24.311 --> 00:41:27.880
of dishonor in one or both of the competence.

908
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:29.020
In other words,

909
00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.220
courage for him,

910
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.890
again as a form of vanity or pride,

911
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:37.100
a desire not to appear less than another.

912
00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.050
It is a form of rashness.

913
00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.040
He says,

914
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:44.360
and that suspicion is con is it's further carried out in Hobbs is very

915
00:41:44.361 --> 00:41:47.660
interesting treatment of military conscription,

916
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:52.990
which he talks about a in chapter 21 there he describes battle,

917
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:55.340
uh,

918
00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.173
is he says,

919
00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.040
a mutual running away,

920
00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:03.880
two armies confronting one another he describes is a mutual running away.

921
00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.301
And furthermore,

922
00:42:05.301 --> 00:42:05.811
he says,

923
00:42:05.811 --> 00:42:07.460
when it comes to conscription,

924
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:09.200
there should be a,

925
00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:14.320
there should be a allowance made for those that he calls men of natural timorous

926
00:42:15.251 --> 00:42:19.400
snus natural timorous snus cowards.

927
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.353
In other words,

928
00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:26.420
a man that has commanded as a soldier Hobbs rights to fight against the enemy

929
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:27.261
bill,

930
00:42:27.261 --> 00:42:28.340
his sovereign have the,

931
00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.520
has the right enough to punish his refusal with death.

932
00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.920
Death May,

933
00:42:32.921 --> 00:42:34.160
nevertheless Hobbs,

934
00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:34.401
right?

935
00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:39.401
In many cases refused without injustice as when he substituted a sufficient,

936
00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:40.190
uh,

937
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:42.350
sufficient soldier in his place.

938
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:43.640
<v 2>Okay.</v>

939
00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.473
<v 0>In other words,</v>

940
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.380
hubs is view of this is why do the fighting yourself,

941
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.310
if you can get someone else to do it for you,

942
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:57.620
there is no intrinsic virtue in courage or battle.

943
00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:01.520
If you can get somebody else to do the job for you.

944
00:43:01.521 --> 00:43:03.740
It sort of perfect description.

945
00:43:03.741 --> 00:43:06.320
I think of our volunteer army,

946
00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:06.920
uh,

947
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.270
how we pay people to do this,

948
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:12.650
does it difficult and dangerous work for us?

949
00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.540
But the question is,

950
00:43:17.541 --> 00:43:22.541
can even a Hobbsy in society one which insists on rules and so on,

951
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:29.180
can a Hobbsy in society do entirely without,

952
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:29.540
if,

953
00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:30.240
if that's,

954
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:30.441
uh,

955
00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:32.480
if that's my analyst calling,

956
00:43:32.481 --> 00:43:32.810
could you,

957
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.610
could you tell him I'd be a little late,

958
00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:34.970
uh,

959
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:36.590
discipline for today's appointment?

960
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:38.270
That'd be good.

961
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:39.103
Okay.

962
00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:41.083
Um,

963
00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:42.660
anyway,

964
00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.420
Kinda Hobbsy in society,

965
00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:45.350
uh,

966
00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.900
do without even a hoe do without the,

967
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:49.160
what we might call them,

968
00:43:49.161 --> 00:43:50.420
the manly virtues,

969
00:43:50.421 --> 00:43:51.710
the civic virtues,

970
00:43:51.711 --> 00:43:52.430
pride,

971
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:55.280
love of honor that Hobbes seems to condemn.

972
00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:57.710
Consider the case of Ralph Esposito.

973
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:02.570
Who was the Ralph Esposito you ask.

974
00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:04.520
Uh,

975
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.870
his name is not in the index of Hobbs,

976
00:44:06.871 --> 00:44:07.704
just book.

977
00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:08.720
Uh,

978
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.070
but Mr Esposito,

979
00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:10.560
uh,

980
00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:11.990
is in New York City fireman,

981
00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:13.010
uh,

982
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:14.780
who came to Bradford College,

983
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.980
uh,

984
00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:19.610
to be a masters t guest not long after nine 11

985
00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.013
and at length.

986
00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:22.590
Uh,

987
00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:27.590
he discussed there are people like himself who daily risk their lives running

988
00:44:28.081 --> 00:44:28.831
into building,

989
00:44:28.831 --> 00:44:29.310
burning,

990
00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:30.300
burning buildings,

991
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:30.930
uh,

992
00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.240
to rescue total strangers.

993
00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:36.030
Why do people do this?

994
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.970
Is it because some people have a kind of built in sense of Thumos,

995
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:42.210
you know,

996
00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:44.130
that wonderful platonic term,

997
00:44:44.131 --> 00:44:44.910
pride,

998
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:45.743
courage,

999
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.180
love of risk that no society,

1000
00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:48.400
no,

1001
00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.030
not even a HUBZone and one can do without,

1002
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:52.853
uh,

1003
00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:57.920
even Hobbs is society presumably cannot do without a fire department or a police

1004
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:03.350
department yet if one were to follow Hobbes is risk averse psychology.

1005
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.850
If one were to follow the 19 laws of nature that it,

1006
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.540
that advise us to seek peace and to avoid conflict.

1007
00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:16.200
Why would anyone ever become a fireman?

1008
00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:17.520
A soldier?

1009
00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.680
I'm a risk taker.

1010
00:45:19.681 --> 00:45:21.420
A policemen of any sort.

1011
00:45:21.421 --> 00:45:26.421
Why would any anyone ever risk one's life for one's country or a cause just to

1012
00:45:27.001 --> 00:45:28.410
help other people?

1013
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:28.890
Uh,

1014
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:32.280
people that we don't know and probably will never know.

1015
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:33.533
Um,

1016
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:38.930
even in the passage that I cited earlier where Hobbs describes the benefits of

1017
00:45:39.361 --> 00:45:40.320
civil society,

1018
00:45:40.321 --> 00:45:42.960
he speaks of activities like navigation,

1019
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:45.330
exploration and industry.

1020
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:50.570
Presumably these are activities that are all engage in risk taking behavior of

1021
00:45:51.091 --> 00:45:56.091
one kind or another that seem not to be able to be explained by Hobbs is law of

1022
00:45:57.691 --> 00:45:59.070
nature alone.

1023
00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:03.420
So the question I want to leave you with today and that I want to pick up again,

1024
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:03.931
uh,

1025
00:46:03.931 --> 00:46:06.480
on Wednesday is in the end,

1026
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:07.260
what do,

1027
00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.690
what do societies require more of?

1028
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:12.120
Do they require more of Hobbes?

1029
00:46:12.121 --> 00:46:16.650
Is Men of natural timorous snus or do they require more?

1030
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:19.250
Ralph Esposito's and Anat?

1031
00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:19.620
Uh,

1032
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.630
we'll finish up hubs on Wednesday.
