1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.950
Today Republic Act too.

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.110
I mean,

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.710
what I want to do is continue with the,

4
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:08.041
uh,

5
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:11.250
account of the various figures,

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.730
uh,

7
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.260
various persons who,

8
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:13.740
uh,

9
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.461
populate,

10
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:17.430
who inhabit this dialogue and who they are,

11
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.110
what they represent,

12
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.830
and how they contribute to the argument and the,

13
00:00:23.831 --> 00:00:25.170
and the structure of the work.

14
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.590
Uh,

15
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.161
as a whole,

16
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:26.971
last time,

17
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:28.410
and I won't repeat this last time,

18
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:28.951
you'll remember,

19
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:29.171
we,

20
00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:29.440
we,

21
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.440
we talked briefly at the end of class about capitalists and Socrates,

22
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.950
uh,

23
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.340
treatment of capitalists,

24
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.240
the embodiment of convention,

25
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.610
uh,

26
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.940
the embodiment of,

27
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.030
of Athenian opinion and the way in which Socrates,

28
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.991
Socrates,

29
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:46.824
as it were,

30
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.130
uh,

31
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.963
Chase's,

32
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.250
a capitalist out of the dialogue,

33
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.850
out of the,

34
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.050
out of the conversation.

35
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.970
We never hear from him again.

36
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.960
And,

37
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.440
uh,

38
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.440
the speakers are able presumably to pursue the audacious arguments,

39
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.530
uh,

40
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.131
that will,

41
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:07.080
will appear in the rest of the book without the oversight of the,

42
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:07.470
uh,

43
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.970
the head of the household,

44
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.420
the embodiment of conventional opinion.

45
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.680
And Socrates next pursues this discussion with,

46
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.310
uh,

47
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.660
the son of capitalists,

48
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.560
Palo Marcus,

49
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:22.220
the man who first approached,

50
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.470
uh,

51
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.100
had a,

52
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.990
had a Socrates approached on,

53
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.100
on the Pi Radius.

54
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.610
Paula Marcus is described as the air of the argument as well as the,

55
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.730
to be sure the air of the family Fortune Paula Marcus is what the Greeks would

56
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:44.451
call a gentleman that has to say he's a person willing to stand up for and

57
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:50.250
defend his family and friends.

58
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:52.560
I don't mean necessarily by a gentleman,

59
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:57.000
somebody who holds the door for others or so on,

60
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:01.320
but somebody who stands up for his family and friends,

61
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.670
uh,

62
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.850
in the way that he does,

63
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:04.260
unlike his father.

64
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.123
However,

65
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.610
Paula Marcus shows himself concerned not just with the needs of the body as

66
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:13.030
capitalists represented.

67
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.400
Paula Marcus is concerned to defend the honor and safety of the Polis.

68
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.420
He accepts the view,

69
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.740
uh,

70
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.770
that justice is giving to each what is owed,

71
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.640
but he interpreted this to mean the justice means doing good to your friends and

72
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:33.030
harm to your enemies.

73
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.950
Justice we might say is a kind of loyalty.

74
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.970
It is a kind of loyalty that we feel to members of a family,

75
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.800
to members of our team,

76
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.390
to member,

77
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:53.391
to fellow students of a residential college and the kind of loyalty we feel to a

78
00:02:56.311 --> 00:03:01.090
place like Yale as opposed to all other places.

79
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.991
That is to say,

80
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:06.991
Paula Marcus understands justice is kind of a kind of patriotic sentiment that

81
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:14.341
citizens of one city or one Polis feel for one another in opposition to all

82
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:17.140
other places.

83
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:17.801
Justice,

84
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:22.801
his devotion to one's own and one's own is the good for Palo Marcus.

85
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

86
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.780
<v 0>One's own is the just,</v>

87
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.050
but Socrates challenges Paula mark this on the grounds that loyalty to a group,

88
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.980
any group,

89
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.550
uh,

90
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.920
cannot be a virtue in itself.

91
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.210
And he trips Paula Marcus up with a very,

92
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.960
uh,

93
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.651
in many ways,

94
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:46.510
familiar Socratic argument.

95
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.570
Do we ever make mistakes?

96
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.530
He Asks Paula Marcus isn't the distinction between friend and enemy based on a

97
00:03:57.641 --> 00:04:02.641
kind of knowledge on a perception of who is your friend and who,

98
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.960
who is your enemy?

99
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.220
Have we ever mistaken friend for enemy?

100
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.110
The answer seems to be,

101
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:12.280
of course we have.

102
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:12.451
We,

103
00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:15.940
we all know people who we thought to be our friends,

104
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.740
but we found out,

105
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.610
uh,

106
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.971
you know,

107
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:23.971
that they were talking behind our back story that they were operating to deceive

108
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:26.410
us or in some way or another.

109
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:27.850
Of course it happens.

110
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.260
It's happened to everyone.

111
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.360
So how can we say that justice means helping friends in harming enemies.

112
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.480
Socrates asks when we may not even be sure who our friends and our enemies are

113
00:04:40.791 --> 00:04:41.471
really are.

114
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:45.370
Why should citizens of one state namely one's own,

115
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.760
if any moral priority over the citizens of another state when again,

116
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:56.881
we don't know them and we may well be mistaken in our assumption that they are

117
00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.480
enemies or,

118
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.730
or friends isn't,

119
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.810
in other words,

120
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.440
an such an unreflective attachment to one's own bound to result in an injustice

121
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.483
to others.

122
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.150
Uh,

123
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.530
Socrates seems to be asking Palamara this once again,

124
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.270
in many ways we see Socrates dissolving the bonds of the familiar.

125
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.010
Uh,

126
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.450
it no other point in the republic I think do we see so clearly the tension

127
00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:30.451
between philosophical reflectiveness on the one hand and the sense of

128
00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:32.560
camaraderie,

129
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.620
mutuality and just spree decor necessary for political life on the other

130
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.720
Socrates seems to dissolve those bonds of familiarity,

131
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.960
loyalty and attachment that we all have by saying to Paula markets,

132
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.730
how do we know,

133
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.870
how do we really know a distinction between friend and enemy?

134
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.770
But Marcus seems to believe that a city can survive only with a vivid sense of

135
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:04.544
what it is,

136
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.870
of what we might say,

137
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:07.100
what it stands for,

138
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.610
and an equally vivid sense of what it is not and who are its enemies.

139
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.520
Isn't this essential for the survival of any stage of any city?

140
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.940
Uh,

141
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.850
to know who it's friends and enemies are,

142
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.510
uh,

143
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.500
who has challenges?

144
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:29.501
Arch Socrates's disillusion of that very framework,

145
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.370
uh,

146
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.061
challenges.

147
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:37.061
It seems to me the very possibility of political life by questioning the

148
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:40.280
question or the distinction between friend and enemy.

149
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.010
Although Paula Marcus like has father is reduced to silence.

150
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.340
It is,

151
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.080
it is notable that his argument is not defeated later in the republic.

152
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.240
You will see not,

153
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.480
not that much later,

154
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:58.481
even Socrates will argue that the best city may be characterized by peace and

155
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:00.620
harmony at home,

156
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.810
but this will never be so for relations between states.

157
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.380
Uh,

158
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.520
this is why even the best city even clipless will require,

159
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.670
as he spends a great deal of time discussing,

160
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:16.100
will require a warrior class,

161
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.520
a class of what he calls auxiliaries or auxiliaries war.

162
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.830
And the preparation for war is an intrinsic part of even the most just city.

163
00:07:28.191 --> 00:07:30.140
Even the platonic just city.

164
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.070
We'll have to cultivate a warrior's citizens,

165
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.940
uh,

166
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.940
who are prepared to risk life in battle for the sake of their own city.

167
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.860
So in many ways it seems that Paula Marcus's argument why don't apparently

168
00:07:45.861 --> 00:07:50.861
refuted in book one is rehabilitated and re,

169
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:51.950
uh,

170
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.430
re-emerges in its own way later in the dialogue.

171
00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:59.540
And we might want to think about this because it is an argument that is very

172
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:04.541
important to a contemporary or 20th century important 20th century political

173
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:06.620
theorist by the name of Schmidt.

174
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.640
Uh,

175
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.600
who made the distinction between what he called the friend and the enemy,

176
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.020
right?

177
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.430
You remember the central to his understanding of politics.

178
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.230
This is an argument,

179
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:18.710
uh,

180
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.710
that comes from Paula Marcus in book one of,

181
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:26.730
of the Republic Paula Marcus's dispatched in one way or another.

182
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.900
And this creates the opportunity for the longest and in many ways,

183
00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:38.360
most memorable,

184
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:38.961
uh,

185
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:42.920
exchange in book one and perhaps even the republic as a whole.

186
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:48.070
The exchange with their Simica who represents a far more difficult challenge in

187
00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:53.720
his own way than either of the first two speakers.

188
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.020
Uh,

189
00:08:55.020 --> 00:09:00.020
in many ways because Thrasymachus could be seen as a Socrates is a alter ego in

190
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:03.031
some way.

191
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:04.770
He's sort of evil twin.

192
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.360
Uh,

193
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.380
he is,

194
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:07.710
uh,

195
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:08.461
how to put it.

196
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:10.830
He is the doctor Moriarity to,

197
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:11.960
uh,

198
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.790
Socrates is Sherlock Holmes.

199
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.080
Uh,

200
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.261
you know,

201
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:21.261
the evil doppelganger in some way through Simica says arrival of Socrates.

202
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:23.670
In many respects.

203
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:23.950
He is,

204
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.520
he also likes Socrates is a teacher.

205
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.200
Clearly he is an educator.

206
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:34.790
He claims to have a certain kind of knowledge of what justice is and claims to

207
00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:37.500
be able to teach it to others.

208
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.050
Uh,

209
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.560
he,

210
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.041
he,

211
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:42.150
he is a teaching,

212
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:42.271
uh,

213
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:43.260
kind of,

214
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.320
we will find out a kind of hard headed realism that expresses discussed at Paula

215
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:56.390
Marcus's talk about loyalty and friendship and the like a justice he asserts is

216
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:00.540
the,

217
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.240
is the interest of the stronger every polity,

218
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.030
uh,

219
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.720
of which we know is based upon a distinction between the rulers and the ruled

220
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.750
justice consists of the rules.

221
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:17.790
That is to say that are made for the Bennett made by and for the benefits of the

222
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:18.720
ruling class.

223
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.830
Justice is nothing more or less.

224
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:23.610
Right.

225
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.710
Then what benefits the rulers,

226
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.480
the rulers who determine the laws a of justice.

227
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.560
There's civicus is of course,

228
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.790
even for us today,

229
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:39.270
a familiar kind of person.

230
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.070
He is the intellectual.

231
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.400
He who enjoys bringing,

232
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:44.941
uh,

233
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:49.941
you might say the harsh and unremitting facts about human nature to light who

234
00:10:50.281 --> 00:10:54.930
enjoys dispelling illusions and pretty beliefs.

235
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.550
Uh,

236
00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:01.470
he's the one who probably would be the first to tell you there is no Santa

237
00:11:01.471 --> 00:11:02.304
Claus.

238
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.390
Uh,

239
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.930
he is that he is that kind of a hard boiled,

240
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:07.590
real us.

241
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.290
No matter how much we may dislike him.

242
00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:11.130
In some ways,

243
00:11:11.131 --> 00:11:13.380
one has to admit also there,

244
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.610
there may be a grain if,

245
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.440
if not more than a grain of truth in what he seems to be saying.

246
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:20.190
And He,

247
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.380
what he seems to be saying is this,

248
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.220
uh,

249
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:28.220
we are beings who are first and foremost dominated by a desire for power.

250
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.020
This is what distinguishes a,

251
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.720
you might say the true man,

252
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.280
uh,

253
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.630
the real man from the,

254
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.560
the Alpha,

255
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.790
the Alpha Male,

256
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.181
uh,

257
00:11:39.181 --> 00:11:44.181
you might say from the slave power and domination are all we truly care about.

258
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:50.490
And when we get later in this semester to Thomas Hobbes think re remember three

259
00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:50.971
Simica.

260
00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:52.320
So I'll just say that for now.

261
00:11:52.321 --> 00:11:55.150
Remember Thrasymachus when we get to Hobbs,

262
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:57.730
power and domination are all we care about.

263
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.410
And what is true of individuals is also true for collective,

264
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:02.920
uh,

265
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.581
entities.

266
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:07.180
Collective nouns like states and cities.

267
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:12.210
Every polity seeks its own advantage against others making might say relations

268
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:15.580
between states,

269
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:15.980
uh,

270
00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:20.980
a condition of unremitting war of all against all in the language.

271
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.580
If I can switch to the language of modern economics,

272
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.920
one could say that for through simic as politics is a zero sum game,

273
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.800
there are winners and there are losers.

274
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.960
And the more someone wins,

275
00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:40.630
that means the more someone else will lose.

276
00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:45.631
And the rules of justice are simply the law's set up by the winners of the game

277
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.990
to protect and to promote their own interests.

278
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.720
It didn't take Karl Marx to invent or to discover that insight that,

279
00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.583
uh,

280
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:00.430
uh,

281
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:05.430
am I to the rules of justice are simply the rules of the ruling class that that

282
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:09.550
comes straight out of out of through civicus book one of the Republic.

283
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.753
Well,

284
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:13.570
how,

285
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.860
how to respond.

286
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:15.880
Uh,

287
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.540
and again,

288
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:21.540
Socrates challenges through [inaudible] with a variation of the argument that

289
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:23.800
he'd used against Paula Marcus.

290
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:24.551
That is to say,

291
00:13:24.551 --> 00:13:26.980
do we ever make mistakes?

292
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:32.010
That is to say it is not self evident or it is not always intuitively obvious

293
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.470
what our interests are.

294
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:36.100
Uh,

295
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.700
if justice is truly in the interests of the stronger,

296
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:40.151
doesn't it,

297
00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:42.430
that requires some kind of knowledge,

298
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.290
some kind of reflection,

299
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:44.800
uh,

300
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.800
on the part of those in power to know what is really and truly in their

301
00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:50.800
interests.

302
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.390
People make mistakes and it is very possible to mistake,

303
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:55.900
uh,

304
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.290
to make a mistake about your own interests.

305
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:00.810
And of course,

306
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.800
[inaudible] has to acknowledge this.

307
00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:03.490
Of course,

308
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:08.490
the rulers make mistakes and he tries to invent an argument that if a ruler

309
00:14:08.591 --> 00:14:09.610
makes a mistake,

310
00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:11.650
he's not really a true ruler.

311
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.110
The true ruler is the person who,

312
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:14.560
uh,

313
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.560
both acts on his own interests and of course knows what those interests are.

314
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:26.010
But the point that he admits is all in a sense that Socrates needs justice is

315
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:27.880
not power alone.

316
00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.130
Justice requires knowledge.

317
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.710
Justice requires reflection.

318
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:37.120
And that is of course at the core of the famous Socratic thesis,

319
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:37.510
uh,

320
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.030
that all virtue is a form of knowledge.

321
00:14:40.031 --> 00:14:43.660
All the virtues require knowledge and reflection,

322
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.230
uh,

323
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.400
at their basis.

324
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:51.690
But much of the exchange with through simic is turns on the of what kind of

325
00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:57.191
knowledge justice involved with justice is a kind of knowledge if justice equal

326
00:14:58.321 --> 00:15:01.490
self interest and self interest requires knowledge.

327
00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:01.611
Well,

328
00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:03.500
what kind of knowledge is that?

329
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:08.530
There's Simica contends that justice consists of the art of convincing people to

330
00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:15.320
obey the rules that are really in the interests of others.

331
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.060
The interests of their rulers.

332
00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:17.840
Justice,

333
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.710
in other words,

334
00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:22.430
for [inaudible] is a kind of suckers game,

335
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.571
uh,

336
00:15:23.571 --> 00:15:25.070
obeying the rules,

337
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.030
uh,

338
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:31.030
that really benefit others largely because we fear the consequences of

339
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.200
injustice.

340
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.310
Uh,

341
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:38.930
justice is really something only respected by the week,

342
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:40.010
uh,

343
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:43.130
who are fearful of the consequences of injustice.

344
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:43.731
Uh,

345
00:15:43.731 --> 00:15:44.091
again,

346
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:44.924
the true,

347
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:45.870
uh,

348
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:46.260
uh,

349
00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:46.451
the,

350
00:15:46.451 --> 00:15:47.150
the true,

351
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.520
the true ruler in some ways is one.

352
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:50.121
There.

353
00:15:50.121 --> 00:15:55.040
Civicus believes he has the courage to act unjustly for his own interests.

354
00:15:55.041 --> 00:16:00.041
The true ruler he says is one who is like a shepherd with a flock,

355
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.360
but he rules not for the benefit of the flock,

356
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.210
but of course for his own interests,

357
00:16:08.211 --> 00:16:08.890
the good,

358
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:09.121
uh,

359
00:16:09.121 --> 00:16:10.790
of the shepherd justice,

360
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.690
like all,

361
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:12.460
uh,

362
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:12.770
uh,

363
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.210
knowledge is really,

364
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.170
uh,

365
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.030
a form again of self interest.

366
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.130
And so one can ask,

367
00:16:19.131 --> 00:16:19.551
right is,

368
00:16:19.551 --> 00:16:22.220
is through simic as wrong to believe this.

369
00:16:22.221 --> 00:16:22.421
And I,

370
00:16:22.421 --> 00:16:24.740
I realize I'm moving over this very quickly,

371
00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:28.190
but it's through [inaudible] wrong to believe that,

372
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.300
uh,

373
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.430
Socrates wins the argument in book one with,

374
00:16:32.431 --> 00:16:33.500
with a kind of,

375
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.420
you might even say sleight of hand.

376
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:36.530
Uh,

377
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.500
both he and through simic is believed that justice is a virtue.

378
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.990
But Socrates says,

379
00:16:41.991 --> 00:16:46.040
what kind of virtue is it to deceive and fleece other people?

380
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:52.190
There's civicus is forced to admit that the just person a is a fool.

381
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.350
Uh,

382
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.410
Thrasymachus believes is a fool for obeying laws that are benefits that are not

383
00:16:57.411 --> 00:17:02.411
beneficial to him or the best life Thrasymachus believes is doing maximum

384
00:17:03.111 --> 00:17:04.580
injustice to others.

385
00:17:04.581 --> 00:17:06.110
Doing whatever you like.

386
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.750
And with that realization,

387
00:17:08.751 --> 00:17:12.920
we see a very dramatic moment in book one,

388
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.610
even in the book as a whole to civicus blushes.

389
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.970
He blushes when he begins to real or when he realized that he has,

390
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.190
he has been defending the claim.

391
00:17:25.191 --> 00:17:26.930
Not that justice is a virtue,

392
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.610
but that justice,

393
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.270
uh,

394
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.580
is something that,

395
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.473
uh,

396
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.730
that is really a form of,

397
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.180
of,

398
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.230
of weakness.

399
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:37.370
Uh,

400
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.360
simic is himself seems to be embarrassed by his defense of the tyrannical life

401
00:17:45.411 --> 00:17:45.561
of,

402
00:17:45.561 --> 00:17:45.891
of,

403
00:17:45.891 --> 00:17:47.570
of the unjust life.

404
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.440
Uh,

405
00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:53.440
the suggestion Plato seems to be making by making Chris [inaudible] has blush is

406
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:56.370
despite all of his tough talk,

407
00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.243
right,

408
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.830
that he's not as as tough as he as he appears to be,

409
00:18:00.831 --> 00:18:02.430
as he wants to think of,

410
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:03.540
of himself to being,

411
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.580
he's shamed by the fact,

412
00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:06.520
uh,

413
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.520
that he has been defending injustice in the tyrannical way of life.

414
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.313
Uh,

415
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:19.420
and so it appears the three conversations and book one ends with uncertainty

416
00:18:20.481 --> 00:18:21.980
about what justice is.

417
00:18:21.981 --> 00:18:22.341
We have,

418
00:18:22.341 --> 00:18:24.650
we have had three views of capitalists,

419
00:18:24.651 --> 00:18:26.240
Paula Marcus and through [inaudible],

420
00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.970
they have all been refuted or,

421
00:18:28.971 --> 00:18:29.420
uh,

422
00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.350
been refuted.

423
00:18:30.351 --> 00:18:34.830
But no clear alternative seems to have emerged a,

424
00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:39.831
certainly Socrates is not really proposed an alternative to [inaudible] in his

425
00:18:40.311 --> 00:18:41.450
exchange with him.

426
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.531
He is only,

427
00:18:42.531 --> 00:18:47.531
as it were forced through civicus to see that the logic of his ideas,

428
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:53.270
the logic of his argument that justice is in the interest of his stronger is a

429
00:18:53.271 --> 00:18:58.271
defense of tyranny and as a defense of the unjust way of life.

430
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:04.330
So all of book one is really a kind of warmup for what follows a in the rest of

431
00:19:05.211 --> 00:19:06.044
the book.

432
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.963
Uh,

433
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.960
we find out presumably what,

434
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.560
what justice is until then,

435
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.470
uh,

436
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:17.720
until that point we have no reason to really give up on our,

437
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.440
uh,

438
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.220
current,

439
00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:19.710
uh,

440
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.850
existing ideas about what justice is.

441
00:19:22.851 --> 00:19:27.851
And this is where the two most important figures of the republic begin to make

442
00:19:28.911 --> 00:19:30.260
their voices heard.

443
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.113
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

444
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.610
<v 0>Those are Glaucon in Edia,</v>

445
00:19:36.611 --> 00:19:41.611
Mantas Glaucon tell Socrates that he just sad.

446
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.500
He is dissatisfied with the reputation of [inaudible].

447
00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.970
And so should we,

448
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.470
uh,

449
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:51.110
through Mckee,

450
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.960
through simic as has been shamed,

451
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.390
he has been forced to see the,

452
00:19:55.391 --> 00:19:56.050
uh,

453
00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:56.530
uh,

454
00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:59.110
logic where the logic of his argument takes him.

455
00:19:59.111 --> 00:20:02.080
But that is not the same thing as being refuted,

456
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:02.740
uh,

457
00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.060
through [inaudible] has really,

458
00:20:04.061 --> 00:20:04.900
as it turns out,

459
00:20:04.901 --> 00:20:06.220
a kind of girly man,

460
00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:07.270
uh,

461
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:08.103
who is,

462
00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:08.501
uh,

463
00:20:08.501 --> 00:20:11.860
ashamed to be seen defending the unjust life.

464
00:20:11.861 --> 00:20:12.730
But why,

465
00:20:12.731 --> 00:20:16.270
why should we be ashamed to praise injustice?

466
00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:17.170
Uh,

467
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.240
Glaucon challenges.

468
00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:24.220
Socrates is not enough to show that justice is wrong.

469
00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:29.790
Glaucon says what we need is to hear why justice is good or more precisely to

470
00:20:29.951 --> 00:20:32.710
hear justice praised for itself.

471
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:34.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

472
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.021
<v 0>Is there,</v>

473
00:20:35.021 --> 00:20:36.280
in your opinion,

474
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:42.480
Glaucon asks Socrates a kind of good that we would choose because we delight in

475
00:20:42.911 --> 00:20:45.070
it for its own sake.

476
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.560
Three 58 a,

477
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:53.370
is there a kind of good that we delight in for its own sake?

478
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.520
And this is where the rubber hits the road.

479
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.510
Who is Glaucon?

480
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.920
Uh,

481
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.850
Glaucon and Eddie and Manchester are the brothers of Plato.

482
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.910
And other than their appearance in this book,

483
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.810
there is no historical record left about them,

484
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.140
but Plato has given us enough

485
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:23.680
in the first place.

486
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:28.740
They are young aristocrats and Glaucoma cones desire to hear justice praised for

487
00:21:30.191 --> 00:21:35.191
its own sake indicates something about his scale of values.

488
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.110
It would be vulgar.

489
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:43.140
He believes to speak of justice or any virtue in terms of material rewards or

490
00:21:44.741 --> 00:21:45.760
consequences.

491
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.840
He does not need to hear justice praised for its benefits.

492
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.370
Uh,

493
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.290
he's indifferent to the consequences.

494
00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:58.290
Rather he claims that he wants to hear justice defended the way that no one has

495
00:21:58.661 --> 00:22:00.220
ever defended it before.

496
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.760
The brothers desire to hear justice praised for itself alone and that seems to

497
00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:12.361
be expressive of their own freedom from mercenary re motives and incentives.

498
00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:19.620
It reveals to us something about their idealism and a certain kind of loftiness

499
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.230
of soul.

500
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.880
And certainly the brothers we find out are not slouches.

501
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:30.790
They are not slouches at all.

502
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.930
Although it is easy to remember that later in the dialogue,

503
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.950
most of their contributions seem to be of the form of yes.

504
00:22:38.951 --> 00:22:39.880
Socrates,

505
00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.350
no Socrates.

506
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.540
They seem to be rather passive.

507
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:44.350
Uh,

508
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:49.300
interlocutors there early challenges to Socrates show them to be potential

509
00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:50.200
philosophers.

510
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:54.730
That is to say the kind of persons who might one day rule.

511
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.880
The city of the two Glaucon seems to be the superior.

512
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:04.210
He is described as the most courageous,

513
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:04.980
uh,

514
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.170
which in that context means the most manly,

515
00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:09.760
the most virile.

516
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.350
And later Socrates admits that he is always been full of wonder.

517
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:19.500
It can nature of the two brothers and three 68 [inaudible] he cites a line of

518
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:21.334
poetry,

519
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:21.760
uh,

520
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.170
you remember written about them for their distinction in battle.

521
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.970
They have been in war,

522
00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.100
they have been tested in war.

523
00:23:30.101 --> 00:23:30.934
Obviously.

524
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:32.860
They are also,

525
00:23:32.861 --> 00:23:36.400
and we see this from their relationship between one another and the way they

526
00:23:36.401 --> 00:23:37.690
speak to one another.

527
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:42.340
They are also highly competitive super achievers.

528
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:43.540
Uh,

529
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:44.830
a little bit like,

530
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:45.200
uh,

531
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.670
some of you perhaps,

532
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.350
uh,

533
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.020
there is quite a bit of jousting between them,

534
00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:51.480
uh,

535
00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:56.480
that you need to be attentive to and each proposes to Socrates a test that he

536
00:23:57.501 --> 00:24:02.501
will have to pass in order to prove the value of justice and the just life

537
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:11.020
Glaucon goes on to rehabilitate the argument of Thrasymachus,

538
00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:12.350
uh,

539
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:13.161
in many ways,

540
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:18.161
in a more vivid and a more expressive way than through civicus did himself.

541
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.360
Glaucon tells a story.

542
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.153
<v 1>You'll remember</v>

543
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.750
<v 0>a story that he modifies from the historian Heraclitus,</v>

544
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:29.730
uh,

545
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:34.730
a story about a man named guide who possessed a magic ring that conferred on him

546
00:24:36.771 --> 00:24:38.420
the power of invisibility.

547
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:44.840
Who is not wondered what we would do if we had this power,

548
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.270
the power of invisibility guide gs and P in glow cones,

549
00:24:50.271 --> 00:24:55.271
retelling of the story guide just uses this ring to murder the king and to sleep

550
00:24:56.541 --> 00:25:00.200
with his wife and to set himself up as king.

551
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:02.450
<v 1>What would you do</v>

552
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.400
<v 0>if you had this power?</v>

553
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:07.830
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

554
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:12.450
<v 0>this power of this magic rain where you could commit any crime,</v>

555
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.070
indulge any vice commit,

556
00:25:17.071 --> 00:25:21.780
any outrage and be sure you could always get away with it.

557
00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.070
Why?

558
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:24.660
If you could do that,

559
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:25.650
uh,

560
00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:30.650
would you wish to be just at the same time or wish to be just instead of that

561
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:36.690
this is the challenge that Glaucon poses to Socrates.

562
00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:41.930
Why would someone with absolute power and complete immunity to punishment,

563
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.010
why would they prefer justice to injustice?

564
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:47.910
Tell me that.

565
00:25:47.911 --> 00:25:50.190
Socrates Glaucon asks,

566
00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:55.230
if Justice truly is something praiseworthy for itself alone,

567
00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:00.680
then Socrates should be able to provide an answer that will satisfy a glock

568
00:26:02.341 --> 00:26:04.730
cones retelling of the story of guide you.

569
00:26:04.731 --> 00:26:08.160
So that is certainly a very tall order.

570
00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.080
And that is where the brother adding a mattress chimes in.

571
00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.160
Eddie and Matt has says somewhat different set of concerns.

572
00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:23.660
He has her justice praise his whole life from parents and from poets and from

573
00:26:23.941 --> 00:26:24.990
other authorities.

574
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:26.340
But for the most part,

575
00:26:26.341 --> 00:26:31.341
he has only heard justice praised again for the benefits justice confers both in

576
00:26:32.401 --> 00:26:33.211
this life.

577
00:26:33.211 --> 00:26:36.720
And the next honesty is the best policy.

578
00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:37.201
Uh,

579
00:26:37.201 --> 00:26:37.531
we hear,

580
00:26:37.531 --> 00:26:38.780
we've heard capitalists,

581
00:26:38.781 --> 00:26:42.270
a cunt being concerned about returning to others.

582
00:26:42.271 --> 00:26:43.104
What you owe,

583
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:43.710
uh,

584
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.490
as a way of pleasing the gods in the afterlife.

585
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.460
And addie and matches rightly takes this kind of argument to be two main.

586
00:26:52.461 --> 00:26:55.500
That justice is simply a virtue for the week,

587
00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.530
the lame and the unadventurous.

588
00:26:58.980 --> 00:26:59.250
Uh,

589
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.220
if you were only concerned with the consequences,

590
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.730
a real man does not fear the consequences of injustice,

591
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:11.420
rather adding a mantises concern and he gives a very revealing image of what he

592
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:17.870
takes justice to be is with an image of self guardianship or self control.

593
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:24.140
He tells us a three 67 a that each would be his own God.

594
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:25.830
In other words,

595
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.670
we should not care what people say about us,

596
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:34.200
but we should be prepared to develop qualities of self containment,

597
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:39.290
autonomy and independence from the influence that others can exercise over us.

598
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:45.020
How can I develop those qualities of self guardianship or self control?

599
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:50.900
He asks Socrates and who has not felt that way before the two brothers desire to

600
00:27:52.291 --> 00:27:57.291
hear justice praised for itself Glau cone and to live freely and independently.

601
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.350
Eddie Mantas and that shows to some degree,

602
00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:02.184
I think,

603
00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:02.580
uh,

604
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.840
their own sense of alienation from their own society.

605
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.380
If I can put the case for them slightly.

606
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.650
Anachronistically these are two sons,

607
00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:13.990
uh,

608
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:18.990
of the upper bourgeoisie who feel degraded by the mendacity and the hypocrisy of

609
00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:24.570
the world they see around them in any way.

610
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.170
What,

611
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:30.170
what person with any sensitivity to greatness has not felt this way at one time

612
00:28:31.651 --> 00:28:32.490
or another.

613
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:37.020
The two are open to persuasion to consider alternatives,

614
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.500
perhaps even radical alternatives to the society that has nurtured them.

615
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.300
They are,

616
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.260
to put it another way,

617
00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:50.520
perhaps potential not only potential rulers and potential philosophers,

618
00:28:50.521 --> 00:28:55.521
they may also be potential revolutionaries and the remainder of the book is

619
00:28:56.371 --> 00:28:57.420
addressed to them.

620
00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.940
And of course people like them.

621
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.200
With the speeches of Glaucon at Eddie and Mantis,

622
00:29:10.201 --> 00:29:14.160
you might say the circle around Socrates is effectively closed.

623
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:18.630
He knows he will not be returning to Athens that evening.

624
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.490
Antique proposes.

625
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:24.300
Instead he proposes to the Doobie brothers and those listening to the

626
00:29:24.301 --> 00:29:25.021
conversation,

627
00:29:25.021 --> 00:29:27.870
a kind of thought experiment did.

628
00:29:27.871 --> 00:29:32.190
He hopes will work magic on the to let us propose.

629
00:29:32.191 --> 00:29:37.191
He says to watch a city coming into being in speech but is create a city in

630
00:29:37.801 --> 00:29:38.634
speech,

631
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:40.050
it is easier.

632
00:29:40.051 --> 00:29:41.530
He says to view justice,

633
00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:44.173
uh,

634
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:48.490
not to view justice microscopically and an individual,

635
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:52.870
but rather let's view justice as it were through a magnifying glass.

636
00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.530
Let's view justice in the large sense.

637
00:29:56.531 --> 00:30:01.531
Let us view justice in a city in order to help us understand what it is in an

638
00:30:01.961 --> 00:30:02.794
individual.

639
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:08.770
And this idea that the city is essentially analogous to the soul,

640
00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:14.580
that the city is like the soul is the central metaphor around which the entire

641
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:18.460
republic is constructed.

642
00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:24.450
It seems to be presented entirely innocuously no one in the dialogue objects to

643
00:30:25.211 --> 00:30:25.890
it.

644
00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:29.430
Yet everything else follows from this idea that the,

645
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:30.370
that the city,

646
00:30:30.371 --> 00:30:33.970
the Polis is in certain essential respects,

647
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.380
like an individual,

648
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:37.840
like the soul of an individual.

649
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.820
What is Socrates trying to do here and what is that metaphor,

650
00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:47.821
that central metaphor in what function does it serve within the work?

651
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:50.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

652
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.120
<v 0>To state the obvious,</v>

653
00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.200
uh,

654
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.200
Socrates introduces this analogy to help the brothers better understand what

655
00:30:58.931 --> 00:31:01.570
justice is for an individual soul.

656
00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:04.420
The governance of the soul.

657
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.630
Adding a mantises standard of self control,

658
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.333
uh,

659
00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:14.170
must be like the governance of a city in some decisive respects.

660
00:31:14.171 --> 00:31:15.310
But in what respects,

661
00:31:15.311 --> 00:31:20.020
how was this city like a soul and in what respect is self governance?

662
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:25.070
The control of one's passions and appetites in what respect is self control.

663
00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:28.510
Like the governance of a collective body.

664
00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.740
Consider the following example.

665
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:38.700
When we say that so and so is typically American or typically to take Taiwanese

666
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.820
for example,

667
00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:48.570
we mean that that person expresses certain traits of character and behavior that

668
00:31:51.071 --> 00:31:56.071
are broadly representative and some way of the cross section of their

669
00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:57.963
countrymen.

670
00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:58.930
Is that,

671
00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.670
is this a useful way to think,

672
00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:01.990
uh,

673
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.860
more specifically,

674
00:32:02.861 --> 00:32:07.861
what does it mean to say that an individual can be seen as magnified in his or

675
00:32:08.981 --> 00:32:13.981
her country or that one's country is simply the collective expression of certain

676
00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:17.800
individual traits of character?

677
00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:21.850
That seems to be what Socrates is suggesting,

678
00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:22.750
right?

679
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:23.560
Said what he's,

680
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.393
he's getting at.

681
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:34.100
One way of thinking about the metaphor of city and soul together is to think of

682
00:32:34.381 --> 00:32:37.860
it as a particular kind of causal hypothesis,

683
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:38.930
uh,

684
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:43.930
about the formation of both individual character and political institutions.

685
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:50.390
And this reading of the city Seoul analogy as a kind of causal relation,

686
00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:51.920
uh,

687
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.920
maintains the view that indeed that is individuals we both shape and determine

688
00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:02.990
the character of our societies and that those societies in turn,

689
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.290
shape and determine individual character,

690
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:09.050
the city and soul analogy.

691
00:33:09.051 --> 00:33:13.230
Could be seen then it's an attempt to understand how society's reproduce

692
00:33:13.231 --> 00:33:16.940
themselves and how they shaped citizens who again,

693
00:33:16.941 --> 00:33:21.740
in turn shaped the societies in which they inhabit.

694
00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:23.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

695
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.360
<v 0>That seems to be one way of making sense of the city Seoul a hypothesis.</v>

696
00:33:28.671 --> 00:33:30.020
But it again,

697
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.970
it doesn't seem to answer the question.

698
00:33:31.971 --> 00:33:36.971
In what way are cities and individuals alike to take the American case,

699
00:33:37.731 --> 00:33:38.660
for example,

700
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.060
does it mean that something like,

701
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:41.570
uh,

702
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:42.710
the presidency,

703
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:45.330
the congress and just end the court,

704
00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:45.950
uh,

705
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:50.480
can be discerned within the soul of every American citizen?

706
00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:54.530
That would be absurd to think that obviously,

707
00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:54.990
uh,

708
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:55.371
I mean,

709
00:33:55.371 --> 00:33:56.630
I think it would be absurd.

710
00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:57.171
Maybe,

711
00:33:57.171 --> 00:33:59.540
maybe you want to argue it and we could have a discussion,

712
00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:00.240
but,

713
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:00.830
uh,

714
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.590
it might mean that um,

715
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:06.530
American democracy or democracy of any kind,

716
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.160
uh,

717
00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.120
helps to produce a particular kind of democratic soul.

718
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.320
Uh,

719
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.970
just like you might say,

720
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:15.980
the old regime and France,

721
00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:20.981
the old aristocratic society existing before the revolution tended to produce a

722
00:34:21.651 --> 00:34:23.770
very different kind of soul,

723
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:25.520
very different kind of individual.

724
00:34:25.521 --> 00:34:30.521
Every regime will produce a distinctive kind of individual and this individual

725
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:33.320
will come to embody the dominant,

726
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.940
the dominant character traits of the particular regime.

727
00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:44.280
The remainder of the republic is again devoted to crafting a regime that will

728
00:34:44.711 --> 00:34:48.460
produce a distinctive kind of human character.

729
00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:52.480
And that of course is why the book is a utopia.

730
00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.060
There has never been a regime in history.

731
00:34:55.300 --> 00:35:00.300
It was so single mindedly devoted to the end of producing that rarest and most

732
00:35:02.561 --> 00:35:07.561
difficult species of humanity called simply philosopher.

733
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:15.943
<v 1>Okay,</v>

734
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.740
<v 0>so sitting in soul.</v>

735
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:27.710
That leads to our next topic that I want to pursue for the,

736
00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.070
for the remainder of the class,

737
00:35:29.071 --> 00:35:31.650
the reform of poetry and the arts.

738
00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.190
Socrates city in speech proceeds through stages.

739
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.470
The first stage proposed by adding a Mantis is the simple city what he calls the

740
00:35:43.471 --> 00:35:45.660
city of most necessity.

741
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:50.880
That is a city limited to the satisfaction of certain basic needs,

742
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.150
the primitive or simple city,

743
00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.670
the simplicity of utmost necessity.

744
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.361
Again,

745
00:35:57.361 --> 00:36:01.650
it expresses the nature of adding a mantises own soul.

746
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:07.010
There was a kind of noble simplicity in him that treats subjects as bodies or

747
00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:10.620
creatures of limited appetites.

748
00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:16.530
The simple city is little more than a combination of households designed for

749
00:36:16.531 --> 00:36:19.980
this sake of securing one's existence.

750
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:22.230
And at this point,

751
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.090
and you can hear his brother,

752
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:24.750
uh,

753
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.060
chastising him at this point,

754
00:36:27.061 --> 00:36:31.020
Glaucon retorts that it seems as if his bro,

755
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.120
it seems as if adding a man has,

756
00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:36.720
has created a city only fit four pigs,

757
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:37.141
uh,

758
00:36:37.141 --> 00:36:38.460
city of pigs.

759
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:42.750
Are we only such that we want to feed it a common trough?

760
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.130
Uh,

761
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:45.610
is there nothing more to,

762
00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.220
to politics and that,

763
00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:48.080
and Glaucon says,

764
00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:49.320
where are the luxuries?

765
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.690
Where are the relishes?

766
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:52.680
He asks,

767
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:58.190
where are the things that make up a city and to hear to Glaucon city expresses

768
00:36:58.951 --> 00:37:01.860
his own tastes and his own soul.

769
00:37:01.861 --> 00:37:06.861
The warlike Glau cone would preside over what Socrates calls a feverish city,

770
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:12.530
one that institutionalizes honors competitions and above all war,

771
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:19.140
if adding a mattress again expresses the appetitive part of the soul.

772
00:37:19.141 --> 00:37:24.141
Glaucon cone represents that quality that Plato calls spiritedness or through

773
00:37:25.841 --> 00:37:27.120
most in Greek.

774
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:33.710
Spiritedness is this central psychological quality of the republic.

775
00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:41.360
The entire thrust of the book is devoted to the taming of spiritedness and to

776
00:37:42.781 --> 00:37:47.781
the control of spiritedness spirited is spiritedness is that quality of soul

777
00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.510
that is most closely associated with the desire,

778
00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.190
desires for honors,

779
00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:57.690
fame and prestige is a higher order,

780
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.790
psychological quality.

781
00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:03.060
It is what's dis seeks distinction,

782
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.720
the desire to be first in the race of life and lead us to seek to dominate

783
00:38:09.871 --> 00:38:10.410
others.

784
00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:13.290
We all know people have this sword,

785
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.153
do we not?

786
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.840
And we all to some degree embodied this quality in ourselves.

787
00:38:18.841 --> 00:38:23.841
It is the quality that we associate with being a kind of Alpha personality.

788
00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.130
Uh,

789
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.140
this is the issue for Socrates.

790
00:38:28.141 --> 00:38:33.141
How to channel this wild and untamed passion of spirit or heart.

791
00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:39.820
How to channel this to some kind of common good.

792
00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:40.840
Can it be done?

793
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:46.590
How can we begin the domestication of the spirited Glaucon?

794
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:51.760
The rest of the book is to some degree about taming glow,

795
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:55.600
whether asking the question whether Glau cone can be tamed.

796
00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:02.080
And it is here that Socrates turns to his first and perhaps even his most

797
00:39:02.171 --> 00:39:07.171
controversial proposal for the establishment of the just city.

798
00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:12.820
The creation of the just city can only begin,

799
00:39:12.821 --> 00:39:15.520
he says with the control of music,

800
00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.013
poetry,

801
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:18.303
and the arts.

802
00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.180
And this is where Plato's image,

803
00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:22.690
uh,

804
00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:24.240
as an educator derives.

805
00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:26.733
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

806
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:30.800
<v 0>The first order of business for the founder of a city,</v>

807
00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:35.830
any city is the oversight of education and his proposals for the reform of

808
00:39:36.471 --> 00:39:37.304
poetry,

809
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:42.420
especially Homeric poetry represent clearly a radical departure from Greek

810
00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:45.980
educational practices and beliefs.

811
00:39:45.981 --> 00:39:49.820
Why is this so important for Socrates?

812
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:52.640
Ask yourself if you were founding a city,

813
00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:53.210
uh,

814
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:54.440
where would you begin?

815
00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:55.853
Uh,

816
00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.590
Socrates belief or his argument seems to be something like this.

817
00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.420
Uh,

818
00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:06.800
it is from the poets and I mean that in the broadest sense of the term myth

819
00:40:06.801 --> 00:40:07.634
makers,

820
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:08.990
storytellers,

821
00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:10.190
artists,

822
00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.210
musicians.

823
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:15.050
Today we might say a film producers and television,

824
00:40:15.051 --> 00:40:16.850
Film and television producers.

825
00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:22.120
It is from these people that we receive our earliest and most vivid impressions

826
00:40:22.401 --> 00:40:24.380
of heroes and villains,

827
00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:27.320
gods and the afterlife.

828
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:29.390
These stories,

829
00:40:29.391 --> 00:40:34.391
the stories we hear from earliest childhood on shape us in some very meaningful

830
00:40:35.661 --> 00:40:40.661
sense for the rest of our lives and the Homeric epics or of course for the

831
00:40:41.061 --> 00:40:41.894
Greeks,

832
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:47.170
what the Bible was for us maybe even is in some communities the names of

833
00:40:48.411 --> 00:40:49.244
Achilles,

834
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:50.203
Priam,

835
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:51.050
Hector,

836
00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:52.880
Odysseus Ajax.

837
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:57.530
These would have been just as familiar and important to the contemporaries of

838
00:40:57.531 --> 00:41:00.080
Plato is the names of Abraham,

839
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:01.063
Isaac,

840
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:01.933
Joshua,

841
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:04.310
and Jesus are for us

842
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:11.080
Plato's critique of how America poetry in the republic is twofold.

843
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:13.690
It is both theological and political.

844
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:19.260
Maybe you might even say following Spinosa that this is the car of spin of,

845
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:21.820
of Plato's theological political,

846
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:23.440
a treatise here.

847
00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:24.011
Uh,

848
00:41:24.011 --> 00:41:29.011
the theological critique is that homer simply depicts the gods as false,

849
00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.090
as fickle and in constant,

850
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:36.710
he presents them as beings who are unworthy of our worship.

851
00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:38.690
Uh,

852
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:39.501
more importantly,

853
00:41:39.501 --> 00:41:44.390
the Homeric heroes are said to be bad role models for those who follow them.

854
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.000
They are shown to be intemperate insects,

855
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:51.230
overly fond of money into these vices,

856
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.700
Socrates ads,

857
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:57.790
cruelty and disregard for the dead bodies of the opponents of one's opponents.

858
00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:04.480
The Homeric heroes are ignorant and passionate men full of blind anger and

859
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:06.770
desire for retribution.

860
00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.040
How could such figures possibly serve as good role models for citizens of a bay

861
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:15.740
adjust city?

862
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:22.630
And Socrates answer is of course the purgation of poetry and the arts in books

863
00:42:23.751 --> 00:42:24.584
two and three.

864
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:29.770
He wants to deprive poets of their power to enchant and something Socrates

865
00:42:31.461 --> 00:42:34.850
admits in the 10th Book of the Republic to which he,

866
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.240
he himself has been highly susceptible to the enchanted meant,

867
00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:39.840
uh,

868
00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.700
of the poets.

869
00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.400
How we need to deprive again,

870
00:42:43.401 --> 00:42:44.300
the poets,

871
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:44.931
the,

872
00:42:44.931 --> 00:42:45.230
uh,

873
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.640
the song makers,

874
00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:48.110
the lyricists,

875
00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:49.520
the musicians,

876
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:50.750
the myth makers,

877
00:42:50.751 --> 00:42:51.920
the storytellers,

878
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:55.220
all of them the power to enchant us,

879
00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.331
uh,

880
00:42:56.331 --> 00:43:00.260
and in place of the pedagogical power of poetry,

881
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:05.500
Socrates proposes to install philosophy in its place.

882
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:06.921
As a result,

883
00:43:06.921 --> 00:43:07.754
the poets,

884
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:10.370
we'll have to be expelled from the city.

885
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:13.730
Imagine that Sophocles,

886
00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.580
there'll be expelled from the justice city,

887
00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:17.360
uh,

888
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.520
that Socrates wants to create.

889
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:25.760
This always raises the question that you will discuss in your section whether or

890
00:43:25.761 --> 00:43:30.761
not Socrates is censorship of poetry and the arts is an indication of his

891
00:43:31.941 --> 00:43:34.550
totalitarian impulses.

892
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:41.140
This is the part of the republic most likely to call up our own first amendment

893
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:42.583
instincts.

894
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.250
Uh,

895
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:43.921
who are you?

896
00:43:43.921 --> 00:43:44.751
Socrates.

897
00:43:44.751 --> 00:43:49.751
We are inclined to ask to tell us what we can read here and listened to.

898
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:53.383
And furthermore,

899
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.930
uh,

900
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:58.070
Socrates seems to be saying not that the color Lippolis will have no poetry and

901
00:43:58.071 --> 00:43:58.904
music.

902
00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:03.200
It will simply be Socratic poetry and music.

903
00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:07.550
And here's another question which you will no doubt be concerned to discuss.

904
00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:12.580
Namely what would such socratically purified music and poetry look like?

905
00:44:13.521 --> 00:44:15.080
What would it sound like?

906
00:44:15.081 --> 00:44:17.330
I don't know that I have an answer to this,

907
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:22.570
but perhaps the republic as a whole is itself a piece of this Socratic poetry

908
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.670
that will substitute for the Homeric kind.

909
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.310
But it's important to remember that,

910
00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:32.640
uh,

911
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:37.290
the question of education and the question of the reform and censorship and

912
00:44:37.291 --> 00:44:42.291
control of poetry is introduced in the context of taming the warlike passions of

913
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:44.460
Glau cone and others like him.

914
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:49.740
The question of censorship and the telling of lies is introduced.

915
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:50.521
In other words,

916
00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:52.950
as a question of military necessity,

917
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.430
controlling the guards or the auxiliary is of the city.

918
00:44:56.431 --> 00:44:57.600
It's warrior class.

919
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.980
Nothing is said here about the education of farmers,

920
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:02.963
artisans,

921
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.870
merchants,

922
00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:04.890
laborers,

923
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.760
the economic class maybe just speak bluntly.

924
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:12.480
Socrates just doesn't care that much about them.

925
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:14.760
It's okay what they listened to.

926
00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:15.450
Uh,

927
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:19.740
nor has anything really been said up to this point about the education of the

928
00:45:19.741 --> 00:45:24.741
philosopher is interest here is in the creation of a tight in highly disciplined

929
00:45:25.381 --> 00:45:30.381
cadre of young warriors who will protect the city much as watchdogs protect

930
00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:32.670
their own home.

931
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:35.310
That is to say recall and Paula Marcus,

932
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:40.490
those who are good to friends and bark and growl at strangers.

933
00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:46.730
Such individuals will substitute their own desires and pleasures to the group,

934
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.730
uh,

935
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:50.700
and live a life by a strict code of honor.

936
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:53.480
We have to ask our Socrates,

937
00:45:53.481 --> 00:45:55.770
is proposals unrealistic?

938
00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:58.520
Are they undesirable or are,

939
00:45:58.580 --> 00:45:59.700
are they desirable?

940
00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:01.020
Uh,

941
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.490
they are not undesirable.

942
00:46:02.491 --> 00:46:07.491
If you believe as he does that even the best city must provide provisions for

943
00:46:07.921 --> 00:46:11.100
war and therefore a warriors life.

944
00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:16.340
A soldier's life will require harsh privation in terms of material,

945
00:46:17.131 --> 00:46:18.840
awards and benefits,

946
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.710
as well as a willingness to sacrifice for others.

947
00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:26.100
It would seem far from being unrealistic.

948
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.630
Uh,

949
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:32.630
Socrates engages what we might call maybe a kind of Socratic realism.

950
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:38.220
Far more unrealistic would be the belief of those who argue.

951
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.350
And I'm thinking here of names like Emmanuel,

952
00:46:40.351 --> 00:46:43.260
Kant and others from the 18th and 19th century,

953
00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:48.620
that one day we can abolish war altogether and therefore abolish the passions

954
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:52.620
that give rise to conflict and war.

955
00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:54.061
So far,

956
00:46:54.061 --> 00:46:59.061
Plato believes is the passionate or spirited aspect of human nature remains

957
00:46:59.731 --> 00:47:00.564
strong.

958
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:05.750
So long will it be necessary to educate the warriors of society who defended?

959
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.031
So on that,

960
00:47:09.031 --> 00:47:12.900
I'm going to end today and next time we will talk about justice,

961
00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.380
the philosophers and Plato's discovery of America.
