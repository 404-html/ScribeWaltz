WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.080
Well today I'm going to finish Tocqueville or to put it a different way,

2
00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:11.820
I'm going to,
uh,
say what I can about Tocqueville on 50 minutes,

3
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.300
which is hardly finishing him.
And in fact,
we've hardly begun.

4
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.940
But I want to talk about two things to two aspects of the book today.

5
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.730
Again,
which,
well,
again,
only scratch the surface,
uh,

6
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.270
end up,
uh,
the,
those two topics are the following.

7
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.250
I want to talk about a little bit about the,
uh,

8
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.340
moral and psychological components or features of the democratic state,

9
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.740
uh,

10
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.630
which is largely the subject matter of volume two of the democracy.

11
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.800
And I also want to speak about the role of statesmanship.
Uh,

12
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.820
I mentioned earlier the issue of Tocqueville is educator as a kind of political

13
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:02.310
educator.
And I wanted to talk today,
uh,

14
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.440
end up today by talking a little bit about,
uh,

15
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.640
how he understands the role of the democratic statesman.

16
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.740
Uh,
but the first part,
first,
first subject,
uh,

17
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.630
is largely again,

18
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.520
the subject matter of volume to volume one of the democracy.

19
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.290
Uh,
as you've probably noticed,

20
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.910
focuses mainly not exclusively to be sure,

21
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:31.440
but mainly on watch.

22
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.280
I suppose we would call the social and political institutions,
uh,

23
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.860
of democratic society.
The institutional,
uh,
development,
uh,

24
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:44.470
of the democratic state,
uh,
volume to,
uh,

25
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.460
focuses on much more on,
uh,

26
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.740
so to call it the moral and psychological components,
uh,

27
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.090
of the democratic,
uh,
individual.
Uh,

28
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.890
Tocqueville here shows himself more concerned with the internal developments,

29
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:05.910
the,
again,
the moral and psychological determinants,
uh,

30
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.960
of the dem of democratic care of democratic character.

31
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.520
What is it to have a democratic soul,
uh,
so to speak,

32
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:19.380
that I think is Tocqueville's a concern in the second volume,

33
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.550
which in many ways,

34
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:25.551
at least to my way of reading it and makes volume to a sort of philosophically

35
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:29.910
richer,
uh,
discussion,
uh,

36
00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:31.830
than volume one,
uh,

37
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.860
because precisely because it focuses on what has the democratic social state

38
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:41.280
done to us.
How has it transformed us,
uh,

39
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.260
as individuals?
How has it shaped us as individuals?

40
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.940
These were in many ways Tocqueville's deepest problems.

41
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:52.380
And in this part of the book,

42
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:57.381
he shows himself to be a kind of moral psychologist of the democratic soul.

43
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.610
Very much along the same lines as we saw in Plato for example,

44
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:08.611
in volume eight a of the republic where Plato speaks about the different kinds

45
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:13.430
of individuals,
the different kinds of souls,
uh,

46
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.010
that are appropriate and had been shaped by different kinds,
uh,
of,

47
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.460
of regimes.
What I'd like to start with,

48
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.080
I want to focus on three aspects.

49
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.950
Spend a little time on three of the components aspects,

50
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.140
uh,
psychological,
um,
uh,

51
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.220
components of the democratic individual and uh,

52
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.250
those in no particular order I want to discuss as compassion,

53
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.300
uh,

54
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.300
what this translation has as restiveness and self interest,

55
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.190
uh,
taken together.
I think these three terms are,

56
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:00.610
these three concepts constitute the,
as it were,

57
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:05.611
this sort of moral scope of the democratic state and describing these character

58
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:07.490
traits.
Uh,

59
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.810
Tocqueville is providing us with a kind of moral phenomenology and excuse a

60
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.180
pleaser rather pretentious term,

61
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.530
a kind of moral phenomenology of democratic life,
uh,

62
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:25.531
one in which we are invited to look and ask whether we see ourselves in this

63
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:31.000
description and whether we like,
uh,
what it is we see.

64
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.340
The first of these features that I want to focus on.
Uh,

65
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:40.600
the most important moral effect in some respects the democracy has had on its

66
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:42.610
citizen is for Tocqueville,

67
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:47.611
the constant tendency to make us gentler towards one another.

68
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:52.810
This is an old 18th century theme to make us more compassionate,

69
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.530
to make us a gentler in our manners,
habits,

70
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.720
morals with one another.
Uh,
this is an old problem,
modest skill.

71
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.240
Tocqueville's great.
Uh,

72
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.870
18th century precursor Montesquieu or had argued in the spirit of the laws.

73
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.560
Let's Redo that.

74
00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:13.490
It was commerce that instituted a kind of,
of,
of,

75
00:05:13.491 --> 00:05:17.770
of softening affects,
uh,
on manners and morals,

76
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.760
uh,

77
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.760
moving us or taking us from a kind of warlike aristocratic ethic to one,

78
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.430
uh,
of gentler manners and morals.

79
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:31.100
And in Monte school had attributed this largely to the influence of,

80
00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:35.290
of commerce roof.
So you will remember in the second discourse,

81
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:39.940
the discourse on inequality made PTA or compassion,
uh,

82
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.420
a repugnance to view the suffering of others,
uh,

83
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:46.720
is a fundamental feature of natural man.

84
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.840
Compassion for Russo remained a kind of remnant of our natural goodness,

85
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.040
uh,
the fact that we still can still cry or sympathize or empathize,

86
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.940
we might say with the plight of others.
Um,

87
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.280
even with the growth of noisier and more powerful passions,

88
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.550
this sort of capacity for sympathy or compassion remains even in civilized life,

89
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.230
a kind of remnant,
uh,
of our natural goodness.

90
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.710
But for Tocqueville,
this feature of compassion,

91
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:23.690
it's not so much a feature of natural man,
uh,
as it was for a Roussel,

92
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:28.220
but it is for democratic life,
democratic social life.

93
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.420
It is not nature,

94
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.440
but democracy that has rendered as gentler and led to this softening of morals

95
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.470
and manners.
What does Tocqueville may mean by that?

96
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:44.471
When he says life in democracy has become gentler in a very powerful chapter

97
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.490
called how mores become milder as conditions are equalized.

98
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.121
Here,

99
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:54.770
he describes some of the moral and psychological consequences,

100
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.671
uh,

101
00:06:55.671 --> 00:07:00.671
of the transition from the age of aristocracy to one of democracy

102
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.450
under aristocratic times.
He says,
uh,

103
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.540
in Aristocratic Angel Ages,

104
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.550
individuals inhabited a world apart where members of one class or one tribe may

105
00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:20.090
have been similar to one another,

106
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.040
but they regarded themselves as being fundamentally different from the members

107
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.030
of all other social classes or tribes.
Uh,

108
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.270
this did not so much render people cruel,

109
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:37.450
but it did render them indifferent to the pain and suffering of others outside

110
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.860
their group.
Under democracy,
however,

111
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.720
he says we're all are equal.

112
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.520
All of us tend to think in feel in nearly the same manner.

113
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.480
We no longer make or imagine these kinds of distinctions.

114
00:07:55.941 --> 00:08:00.290
The moral imagination,
so called the democratic citizen,

115
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:04.040
is able to transport itself,
uh,

116
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:09.130
into the positions of others more easily than individuals living in an

117
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.550
aristocratic times all become a like,

118
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.740
or at least all our,
uh,

119
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.690
projected or perceived as being alike in our range of emotions,

120
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:21.830
sensibilities,

121
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.040
capacities for moral sympathies is people become more like one another.

122
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:32.030
Tocqueville says they showed themselves reciprocally compassionate regarding

123
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:36.260
their miseries and the laws of nations become milder.

124
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.320
The laws of nations become milder.

125
00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:42.680
They showed themselves reciprocally compassionate to one another.

126
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.850
That transformation of one of the key ethics of social life for Tocqueville has

127
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:53.870
had profound effects on us.

128
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.670
It has certainly made people gentler and more civil to one another.

129
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.310
Such things he tells us as torture,

130
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.580
deliberate cruelty,
uh,

131
00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:10.650
sort of spectacles of pain and humiliation that were once so much a part of

132
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:15.480
everyday life have largely been eliminated from the world.

133
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:16.710
I say largely not,

134
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.950
not entirely to be sure we more readily identify ourselves with the pain or

135
00:09:23.611 --> 00:09:26.460
suffering of people possibly in,

136
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:31.380
in very different parts of the world world parts that we've never seen and may

137
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:33.420
never visit.
Consider for example,

138
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:38.630
our response to the victims of the tsunami in Indonesia or the genocide in

139
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:44.730
Darfur.
Uh,
all of these events effecting people in places,

140
00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:49.731
again where we may never go nevertheless seem to have a claim on our moral

141
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.190
sympathies.
Uh,
President Bill Clinton,
uh,

142
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:58.210
profoundly captured this sense of enlarged moral sympathy when he told his

143
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:03.630
audiences,
I feel your pain.
I remember,
I don't know,

144
00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:04.860
you probably won't remember that,

145
00:10:04.861 --> 00:10:07.140
but you've probably heard the heard the expression.

146
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:11.790
It seems to show a kind of enlargement of the moral sympathies.

147
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:16.560
Being able to put oneself in the position,
uh,
of others,

148
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.990
uh,
who one doesn't know and may never meet.
Uh,

149
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.010
this is all a part of what Tocqueville understands.

150
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:28.011
This softening of morals under a democratic way of life.

151
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:34.110
And Tocqueville clearly regards this in many ways,
is a moral progress of sorts,

152
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.000
uh,
in our unwillingness to tolerate policies of deliberate cruelty.

153
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.270
And his statement,
uh,
perhaps,
uh,
premature,
uh,

154
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.260
that Americans of all the people in the world,
uh,

155
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.640
have succeeded or almost succeeded in abolishing the death penalty.

156
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.970
Not quite true.
Uh,
but nevertheless maybe more truer than than it is now.

157
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.590
Uh,
in democratic centuries.
He says,
men,
uh,
but,

158
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.070
but all of this compassion here,
here's,
but here's the problem.

159
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.060
Here's the problem.

160
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.330
All of this compassion comes still at a price and democratic centuries.

161
00:11:13.261 --> 00:11:16.890
He writes,
men rarely devote themselves to one another,

162
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:22.490
but they show a general compassion for all members of the human species.

163
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.580
They rarely,
he says,
devote themselves to one another.

164
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:31.581
This sort of generalized sympathy is genuine but soft.

165
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.630
Uh,

166
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.630
my ability to feel your pain does not really require me to do much about it.

167
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.100
Uh,
compassion,
uh,
you might say,

168
00:11:44.101 --> 00:11:47.670
turns out to be a rather easy virtue.
Uh,

169
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.200
it suggests sensitivity and openness.
Uh,

170
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.060
it implies caring,
uh,
without being judgmental.

171
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.030
It is not entirely relativistic,
uh,

172
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:03.060
but it risks certainly refrains from imposing one's own moral judgments in way

173
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:09.010
of life upon others.
Does Tocqueville believe,

174
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.010
uh,
that democratic peoples or in dangers of becoming too soft,

175
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.000
uh,
to morally sensitive,
uh,

176
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.940
to incapable of exhibiting the kind of harsher,
uh,

177
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:26.230
what we might call more aristocratic virtues of nobility,

178
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.760
of self sacrifice,

179
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:32.170
of love of honor that formed the moral code of previous times?

180
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.490
Well,
the answer to that question is yes.
Uh,

181
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.110
he surely did believe that was becoming the case.
Uh,

182
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.920
compassion is for Tocqueville in many ways,

183
00:12:41.921 --> 00:12:45.640
an admirable sentiment.
And again,

184
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:49.750
it is one likely to expand our rage of moral sympathies,

185
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.470
but there is something called a kind of misplaced compassion,
uh,

186
00:12:54.471 --> 00:12:58.000
that Tocqueville is very fearful about.
Compassion is a virtue,

187
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:03.420
but it carries with us with it like every virtue it's own particular forms of

188
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.460
misuse.
Uh,
for example,

189
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:11.550
when compassion becomes a standard by which to express our forms of moral

190
00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:15.400
superiority to others,

191
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.820
I mean consider the following to be accused today,

192
00:13:18.821 --> 00:13:21.610
particularly on places like college campuses,

193
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:25.240
to be accused of insensitivity to others,

194
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:30.241
to some kind of moral insensitivity is among many of us considered one of the

195
00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:35.050
worst moral crimes imaginable.
Uh,
we must all care,

196
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:39.190
or at least we must all pretend as if we care.
Yes.

197
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.670
Or must be seen to care about the plight of others,

198
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.300
much worse off than ourselves.
And the result of this,

199
00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.640
I think this is Tocqueville,

200
00:13:47.641 --> 00:13:52.641
his point seems to be to create new moral hierarchies of compassion where one's

201
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:59.250
superiorities is a demonstrated by our heightened sensitivity and feeling for

202
00:14:01.571 --> 00:14:06.550
others.
And it is precisely this kind of,
uh,
you know,
misplaced compassion.

203
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.510
You know,
asking the question,
who is the most sensitive,
uh,

204
00:14:10.511 --> 00:14:14.600
among us a very Russo in type question.
This kind of,
uh,

205
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.590
misplaced compassion.
That is,

206
00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:22.591
I think one of the psychological determinants of what we would call today a

207
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.840
political correctness.
Uh,

208
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.270
obviously a term Tocqueville does not use,

209
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:33.040
but you might think of the way in which the language of pity,

210
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:33.940
compassion,

211
00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:38.830
sensitivity has so much shaped our moral vocabulary,

212
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.840
ways of thinking about ourself,
uh,
and judging others.
If you don't believe me,

213
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.450
watch almost any,
uh,
any daytime,
uh,

214
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.010
afternoon show like Oprah or any of these other shows,

215
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.380
you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.
Course you,
you fall,

216
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.350
you've all seen these shows
I think much,

217
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.810
many more times than I have.
But nevertheless,
compassion,
compassion,

218
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.670
this is the first or one feature of democratic social life,

219
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:10.550
but it is not the only one.

220
00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:16.280
It is conducted or at least it exists alongside another.

221
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:21.470
And at the core also of the psychological,
uh,

222
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:26.500
life of modern democratic citizens took the rights is a profound sense of

223
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:28.460
uneasiness,

224
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:34.240
of anxiety that Tocqueville caused by the French term Anchia Tude word that

225
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:42.611
maybe is difficult to translate into English on Kia to anxiety.

226
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.330
Uh,
in earlier translation,
this was called restlessness.
Uh,

227
00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:53.060
in this particular translation,
you have restiveness,
uh,

228
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:57.870
to indicate the sort of perpetually dissatisfied character,
uh,

229
00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.030
of the democratic soul.
I mean,
in many ways the democratic soul,

230
00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:05.480
like democracy itself is never complete.

231
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.870
It is always a work in progress.

232
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:15.700
And this feeling of perpetual restlessness for Tocqueville is tied to the desire

233
00:16:17.481 --> 00:16:18.650
for wellbeing.

234
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.520
And by that he means particularly material wellbeing.

235
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.120
It is the desire for happiness measured largely in terms of material happiness

236
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:34.940
that is the dominant drive of the democratic soul.

237
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:36.590
Uh,
in many ways,

238
00:16:36.591 --> 00:16:41.120
Tocqueville brings to his analysis of democratic restiveness.

239
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:45.950
You can see in it something of the aristocrats disdain,

240
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.061
uh,

241
00:16:47.061 --> 00:16:52.061
for the acquisition of you might see mere material goods for which most of us

242
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.170
have to work so hard to acquire.

243
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.620
I mean,
perhaps more than anything else.

244
00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:04.430
This is what perplexes Tocqueville about democracy.

245
00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:09.680
A democracy meant for him predominantly a kind of middle class,

246
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.000
a way of life,

247
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:16.030
bourgeois life made up of people who are constantly in pursuit of some obscure

248
00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:21.260
object of their own desires.
I mean,

249
00:17:21.261 --> 00:17:26.000
consider the following passage,
one of my favorite from the entire book,
uh,

250
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.890
from a chapter entitled why the Americans showed themselves so restive.

251
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.160
So restive in the midst of their wellbeing,

252
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:39.080
let me read it at some length in the United States.
He says,

253
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:44.170
a man carefully builds a dwelling in which to pass his declining years and sells

254
00:17:44.961 --> 00:17:46.820
it.
Why the roof is being laid.

255
00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:52.500
He plans a garden and he rents it out.
Justice,
he was going to taste it's fruits.

256
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.330
He clears a field and he leaves it to others to care for the harvesting.

257
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.170
He embraces a profession and quit.

258
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.290
He settles in a place from which he departs soon after,

259
00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:07.830
so it was to take his changing desires elsewhere.

260
00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.680
Should his private affairs give him some respite.

261
00:18:11.681 --> 00:18:16.681
He immediately plunges into the whirlwind of politics and when towards the end

262
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.650
of a year filled with some leisure still remains to him.

263
00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:25.860
He carries his rest of curiosity here and there within the vast limits of the

264
00:18:26.591 --> 00:18:30.520
United States carrying his arrest of curiosity.

265
00:18:30.521 --> 00:18:31.750
Wherever he may go,

266
00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:37.260
he will just go 500 leads in a day in order to better to distract himself from

267
00:18:37.691 --> 00:18:42.691
his happiness on the point of what a wonderful place to distract himself from

268
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:44.364
his happiness.

269
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.630
Death finally comes and it stops him before he is grown.

270
00:18:48.631 --> 00:18:53.631
Weary of this useless pursuit of complete Felicity that always flees from him.

271
00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.870
Does that passage sounded like anything we may have read here?

272
00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:08.220
Does it not sound as if it is modeled almost exactly after Plato's description

273
00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:14.770
of the democratic soul,
uh,
in book eight a of the Republic,

274
00:19:14.771 --> 00:19:18.700
a person who is constantly moving,
constantly restless,

275
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:23.970
constantly unable to concentrate or to bear down on the one or very few things

276
00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:31.090
that give life a sense of wholeness and meaning and integrity.

277
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.550
Here is the democratic,
uh,

278
00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.210
man restive in the midst of wellbeing,

279
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:41.530
constantly moving ahead or moving to,
as he says,

280
00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.560
distract himself from his own happiness.

281
00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:46.780
Tocqueville writes here,

282
00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.900
it seems with a kind of disdain for a life understood as a constant and in his

283
00:19:54.311 --> 00:19:57.820
view,
self-defeating a pursuit of happiness.

284
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.610
The desire for wellbeing,
you might say,

285
00:20:00.611 --> 00:20:05.611
becomes the right almost the right of the Democrat in the more one desires

286
00:20:06.461 --> 00:20:10.430
happiness,
the more it eludes our grasp.
Uh,

287
00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:15.540
so just after the sentence and the sentence just after the passage I just read,

288
00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.560
Tocqueville says,

289
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:22.710
one is it first astonished to contemplate the singular agitation displayed by so

290
00:20:23.981 --> 00:20:27.640
many happy men in the midst of their abundance.

291
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.610
And you can sense Tocqueville's irony in his use of the term.

292
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:38.610
So many happy the distractions,
the agitation,
uh,

293
00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.140
complete agitation displayed.
He says,

294
00:20:41.141 --> 00:20:45.400
by so many happy individuals in the midst of their abundance,

295
00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:50.170
there's a world of social,
a condensed into those sentences.

296
00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:55.171
His combination of words like agitation in abundance in the same,

297
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.751
again,

298
00:20:55.751 --> 00:21:00.670
in the same context as the pursuit of happiness indicates for him that this way

299
00:21:00.671 --> 00:21:05.671
of life is more likely to bring frustration and anxiety than it is to bring us

300
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.730
satisfaction,
uh,
and repose.

301
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.210
And he traces this continual restlessness,
uh,

302
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.560
back to what seems to be for the democratic social,
uh,

303
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:20.320
for the democratic individual,

304
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:24.410
the virtual obligation to be happy.
Uh,

305
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:29.520
I would ask you in this context if you have some time to read Darren Mcmahon's a

306
00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:33.790
wonderful new book on a history of happiness,
uh,

307
00:21:33.791 --> 00:21:37.540
to give you a little bit of an indication of the way this term has been used

308
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.220
throughout its history and the way in which in many ways the obligation to

309
00:21:42.221 --> 00:21:45.190
pursue happiness,
uh,
to,
uh,

310
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.220
restiveness that kind of restiveness,
uh,

311
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.430
is the source of so much as he puts it singular,

312
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.290
the singular melancholy.

313
00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:58.290
He says that the inhabitants of democratic lands often display a mid their

314
00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:01.810
abundance,
life,
liberty,

315
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:06.760
the pursuit of happiness have become what one person wants called a kind of

316
00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:09.250
joyless quest for joy.

317
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.460
And this is the second feature,
uh,

318
00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:17.290
this restless or restive character of,
of,
of democracy.

319
00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:20.283
And finally,

320
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:25.210
the third feature of democratic psychology that I want to focus on is this idea

321
00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:30.160
of self interest or self interest.
Well understood,
uh,

322
00:22:30.161 --> 00:22:32.430
as Tocqueville,
uh,
calls it,

323
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:38.350
this is a doctrine with which everybody is familiar from courses on moral

324
00:22:38.351 --> 00:22:42.970
psychology,
on utilitarianism to modern courses and,

325
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:43.450
uh,

326
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:48.450
firm in economics and game theory and other things where the term self interest

327
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:54.060
is regarded almost just sort of a teller's manic pro has the almost talismanic

328
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:58.960
properties of explaining all kinds of human behavior.

329
00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:03.820
But Tocqueville means something very specific by self interest or self interest.

330
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.060
Well understood.
It is in one sense,
the kind of,

331
00:23:07.061 --> 00:23:12.061
you might say every day utilitarianism not in any strict sense of the term,

332
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:17.670
uh,
with which we are instinctively familiar.
When we hear talk,
we're,

333
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.660
when we hear are told things like honesty is the best policy and things like

334
00:23:22.661 --> 00:23:26.050
this.
It seems simple and obvious enough,

335
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.760
but it in fact has a very complex and difficult,
uh,
history.

336
00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.460
Uh,
by the time that Tocqueville wrote these chapters in the democracy,

337
00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:41.210
theories of self-interest had long been a kind of staple,
uh,

338
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:45.620
of the European,
uh,
moral philosophy going back to the 17th century,

339
00:23:45.621 --> 00:23:49.560
at least going back to people like Hobbs and,
and others.
Um,

340
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:55.400
the question is what,
what work does this idea,
this concept of self interest,

341
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:57.350
rightly understood,
understood,

342
00:23:57.351 --> 00:24:02.060
do for Tocqueville and the first place he understands it somewhat differently

343
00:24:02.061 --> 00:24:06.890
than I think we would when we hear the term self-interest.

344
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:07.460
Uh,

345
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:12.260
we are likely to think of it as soon as opposed to or to think of.

346
00:24:12.261 --> 00:24:16.040
It's Antonym as indicating some kind of altruism,

347
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:21.350
a while intro while interest or self interest is thought of as inherently

348
00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.220
self-regarding altruism or something like that.

349
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:30.320
It is in other regarded and other regarding disposition regarding the welfare

350
00:24:30.431 --> 00:24:34.670
well wellbeing of others.
But when Tocqueville talks about self interest,

351
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.880
self interested behavior was put forward by him as a kind of comprehensive

352
00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:45.680
antonym to behavior motivated by vanity,

353
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:50.300
by honor and above all by the concept of glory,

354
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.860
uh,
terms.
Remember thinking,

355
00:24:54.861 --> 00:24:59.861
going back to Hobbs in some way and Hobbs is concerned to replace ideas of

356
00:25:00.191 --> 00:25:04.820
vanity,
vainglory and pride with a notion of,
you know,

357
00:25:04.821 --> 00:25:09.680
fear of death,
uh,
kind of self-interested,
uh,
behavior,

358
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:14.460
what glory a was for Tocqueville and,
and others,
uh,

359
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:18.680
a sense associated with war and warlike pursuits,

360
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:23.830
interest self interest was in variably associated with commerce and peaceful

361
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.640
competition.
In contrast,
in other words to the aristocratic,

362
00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:33.380
uh,
concern with fame and honor,
interest was regarded.

363
00:25:33.381 --> 00:25:38.381
Self-Interest was regarded as a relatively peaceful or harmless disposition

364
00:25:39.501 --> 00:25:44.501
leading us to cooperate with one another for the sake of common ends.

365
00:25:44.961 --> 00:25:49.930
The pursuit of self interest has a kind of unmistakably democratic,
uh,

366
00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.700
and to Galitary an impulse behind it.

367
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:56.920
The pursuit of self interest is something literally everyone,
uh,

368
00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:02.170
is able to follow even was such things is honor and glory seem to be,

369
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:07.670
uh,
by nature unequally,
uh,
available to different people.

370
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.450
And into this debate between,
uh,

371
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:17.020
between an ethic of honor and glory and an ethic of self interest or self

372
00:26:17.781 --> 00:26:22.430
interest,
rightly understood.
Enters Tocqueville.
Enter is democracy in America.

373
00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.560
He begins his chapter called how the Americans combat individualism by the

374
00:26:27.561 --> 00:26:32.120
doctrine of self interest,
rightly understood with the following sentence,

375
00:26:32.121 --> 00:26:34.190
with the following observation.
He writes,

376
00:26:34.191 --> 00:26:37.850
when the world was led by a few wealthy and powerful individuals,

377
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.520
these like to farm for themselves,

378
00:26:40.521 --> 00:26:44.520
they like to farm for themselves is sublime idea of the duties of man.

379
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.910
They were pleased to profess that it is a glue,

380
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:52.970
that it is glorious to forget oneself and that it is fitting to do good without

381
00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:56.010
self interest like God himself.

382
00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.620
This was the official doctrine of the time in matters of morality.

383
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.530
Speaking of Aristocratic Ages,
I doubt that man.

384
00:27:04.531 --> 00:27:08.250
He says we're more virtuous in aristocratic centuries than others,

385
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.830
but it is certain that the beauties of virtue,

386
00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:15.540
we're constantly spoken of only in secret.
He concludes,

387
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:20.320
did men study it's utility.
Um,

388
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.980
you might think about that passage perhaps,
uh,
in section,

389
00:27:25.981 --> 00:27:30.120
but note that Tocqueville adds to the concept of self interest.

390
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.790
This idea or this modifier of well understood,
uh,

391
00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:39.660
well understood.
What does this ad,
what does he intending that to say?

392
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.220
Uh,
self-interest.

393
00:27:41.221 --> 00:27:46.221
Well understood is not the same thing as egoism or what Roussel called Mr pro

394
00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.070
pro,
for example.
Uh,

395
00:27:50.071 --> 00:27:54.060
it is not the desire simply to be talked about to be looked at,

396
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.270
to be first in the race of life.
Uh,

397
00:27:57.271 --> 00:28:01.270
in that way rather self interest is connected or in self-interest.

398
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:06.270
Well understood is connected to this passion for wellbeing and the desire to

399
00:28:06.271 --> 00:28:09.990
improve one's conditions that remain for Tocqueville.

400
00:28:09.991 --> 00:28:13.800
A very important wellspring of human actions.

401
00:28:13.801 --> 00:28:18.110
But it is important to remember that these are not the only desires are,

402
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.310
these are not the only motives for action.

403
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.520
Tocqueville probably is distinguished from many social scientists today by

404
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:31.260
suggesting that self-interest well understood is not some kind of universal

405
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.560
determinant,
uh,
of human behavior.
It is not,

406
00:28:34.561 --> 00:28:36.660
it is not something a universal,

407
00:28:36.661 --> 00:28:41.460
it is a product of a particular social state.
Uh,
a particular,

408
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.490
uh,
we might say the democratic social state.

409
00:28:44.491 --> 00:28:49.350
He is not in this sense a kind of moral or psychological reductionist who wants

410
00:28:49.351 --> 00:28:54.351
to see one cause of human behavior across all centuries and all climates.

411
00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.690
Uh,
he is not saying that our,
uh,
behavior is self interested.

412
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:04.560
In fact,
in that very chapter on self interest,
rightly understood.

413
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.700
You will remember,
you may remember,
probably don't remember,
uh,

414
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:12.790
that he quotes in a footnote,
uh,
uh,

415
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:16.650
an essay by Montaine,
a name that I've mentioned before,

416
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:21.710
an essay by man chain called of Glory of glory to remind the reader that the

417
00:29:22.081 --> 00:29:24.650
desire for fame and honor,
uh,

418
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:29.370
we'll always contend with the desire for wellbeing and happiness.

419
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:34.330
And in many ways these are,
uh,
two conflicting,
uh,

420
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:37.590
motives,
uh,
of,
of,
of human behavior.

421
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:42.820
What did he believe that this ethic of self interest well understood would bring

422
00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:46.930
about a,
again,
like compassion?
Uh,
the,

423
00:29:46.931 --> 00:29:51.880
the doctrine of self interest has done much to sort of soften,
uh,
the,
uh,

424
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.710
the harsher features,
uh,
of the aristocratic ethics of,

425
00:29:56.711 --> 00:30:00.100
of warlike,
of the warlike nobility,
uh,

426
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.040
self-interest well understood as a kind of antidote to,
uh,

427
00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.750
an ethic of fame and glory.

428
00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.690
And yet you can see throughout volume too,

429
00:30:10.691 --> 00:30:15.691
especially how Tocqueville lament the decline of this older aristocratic codes

430
00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:21.610
of honor and chivalry.
By contrast,
the doctrine of self interest,

431
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:24.280
well understood is not lofty.
He says,

432
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:29.281
but it is clear and sure it has characteristics of reliability and

433
00:30:29.711 --> 00:30:34.210
predictability.
Uh,
it is not itself a virtue,
he says,

434
00:30:34.211 --> 00:30:38.170
but it can form people who are,
and these are his terms,

435
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:41.980
regulated,
temperate,
moderate,
foresighted,

436
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:46.930
masters of themselves,
regulated,
temperate,
moderate,

437
00:30:46.931 --> 00:30:50.420
force,
a farsighted.
Uh,

438
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.710
what does that sound like a think about,
think about that.

439
00:30:53.711 --> 00:30:56.980
What kind of person is this and what has it created?

440
00:30:56.981 --> 00:31:01.390
These are the virtues of the Democratic Republic.
Uh,
again,

441
00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:05.770
these may not be heroic or extraordinary qualities,
but they have the,

442
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:10.510
they do have the virtue of being within the range of everyone.

443
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:15.340
But,
uh,
is such a,
is such a,

444
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:18.070
it's such a code or a such a moral code,

445
00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:20.590
a desirable for itself.

446
00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:25.120
That's something that Tocqueville leaves a little bit up in the air of all

447
00:31:25.121 --> 00:31:28.600
philosophical theories.
He calls them as he calls it,

448
00:31:28.601 --> 00:31:32.740
the doctrine of self interest,
rightly understood is he says,

449
00:31:32.741 --> 00:31:37.460
the most appropriate to the needs of men in our time.
Uh,

450
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:39.730
think about that judgment.

451
00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:43.840
It is the most appropriate to the needs of men in our time.

452
00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:49.020
It doesn't seem to suggest that this is a either universal or necessarily that

453
00:31:50.951 --> 00:31:51.970
it is the best.

454
00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:56.710
It is simply the best adapted to the needs of our time,

455
00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:01.600
to our level of humanity,
to where,
where we are now.

456
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.220
And again,
there is,

457
00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:08.221
there is an implicit to be sure and implicit kind of critique a suggested in

458
00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:09.790
those,

459
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:14.790
in that phrase that you might think about as you read or as you go back to that

460
00:32:15.071 --> 00:32:19.090
important chapter on self interest and its role in again,

461
00:32:19.091 --> 00:32:22.420
the shaping of of the modern democratic individual.

462
00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.770
So these three characteristics,
compassion,
um,

463
00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.253
uh,

464
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:37.940
what was the other one?
What restlessness?
Yes.

465
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.090
Go good.
Yes.
Yeah.
Can you can't even remember what I'm talking about.

466
00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.410
Restlessness and self-interest.
I was just,
I was quizzing him.
I was check,

467
00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.310
checking,
just checking.

468
00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:47.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

469
00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:50.470
<v 0>It's not,
it doesn't have anything to do with short term memory loss.</v>

470
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.433
<v 1>Hm.</v>

471
00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:59.480
<v 0>These are,
these are what is what has shaped us.
And,</v>

472
00:32:59.481 --> 00:33:03.370
uh,
Tocqueville holds this ESOP as a kind of portrait,
hey,

473
00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:06.720
democratic individual,
uh,

474
00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:11.510
and also of course primarily to not so much to the democratic individual,

475
00:33:11.511 --> 00:33:15.020
but to his readers back in France,
uh,

476
00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:19.730
and saying this seems to be the future shape of,

477
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:23.960
of humanity,
of democratic humanity.
Uh,

478
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.940
we need both to adapt to it.
In some ways.

479
00:33:28.941 --> 00:33:32.390
We have to recognize that this is what's coming and adapt to it,

480
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.820
but we also have to be,
to some degree,

481
00:33:34.821 --> 00:33:39.821
wary of what of what is coming and what kind of people we may create out of

482
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:45.860
ourselves,
what may be created.
And this brings me to the,

483
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:50.690
to the theme that I mentioned at the beginning about democratic state craft

484
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:56.690
democratic education.
What is the role,
uh,
of the statesmen,

485
00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.610
uh,
in a democratic age?

486
00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:03.610
How should one adapt as well as try to guide these features?

487
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:09.140
A democracy in America,
uh,
is a work

488
00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.260
of political education,

489
00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:17.580
a supreme work of political education addressed to leaders or potential leaders,

490
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:23.720
uh,
not only for Tocqueville's time,
uh,
but for the future.

491
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:30.550
The possibilities of statecraft are as they are always dependent on what we

492
00:34:30.891 --> 00:34:34.790
understand politics and political science to be.

493
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:41.050
What is it in the introduction to the book in one of those characteristically

494
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:45.260
epigrammatic sentences,
and you should be,
uh,
attuned.

495
00:34:45.261 --> 00:34:49.690
Today's Tocqueville often likes to give these one sentence paragraphs to

496
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:53.150
highlight an idea,
you know,
to really make it stand out.

497
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.790
I don't recommend it for you,
uh,
but for him,
uh,

498
00:34:56.870 --> 00:35:00.620
he takes one sentence and can make it,
turns it into a paragraph.

499
00:35:00.621 --> 00:35:03.020
He talks about this book,
he says,

500
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:07.400
is a new political science for a world all together.

501
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:11.330
Knew that that statement has to jump out at you.
What the page,

502
00:35:11.331 --> 00:35:15.350
what is this new political science,
a new political science.
Again,

503
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:19.540
in some ways following Machiavelli who had,
uh,
uh,

504
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:22.050
that departs from the ancients.
Uh,

505
00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.270
but perhaps also from his modern predecessors too,

506
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:29.180
like Machiavelli and Hobbes or Locke and Rousseau.

507
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:34.030
What is the distinguishing feature of the political science,
uh,

508
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:38.040
for a new democratic age for a world altogether new

509
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:42.360
Tocqueville's new political science,

510
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.360
let me suggest to you,

511
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:52.280
is based on a novel and profound understanding of the relationship between

512
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:59.360
history or historical forces and human agency between individual power and

513
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:06.870
individual powers or agency and historical forces.

514
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:09.840
Let me try to explain what I mean by that.

515
00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:16.590
Is any reader of the democracy quickly notes even from the opening pages of the

516
00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:21.820
book,
Tocqueville attributes a kind of providential power,
uh,

517
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:24.690
to history,
uh,
the immense,

518
00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.740
a centuries long progress,
uh,

519
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:33.890
or transition from the aristocratic to the democratic era seems to be as he

520
00:36:35.701 --> 00:36:40.680
describes it,
almost an act of divine providence,
almost of divine will.

521
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.640
He warns his readers,
uh,
uh,

522
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.670
that it is a mistake.
Uh,

523
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:51.180
it is self defeating to try to re to resist or to turn back,

524
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:55.140
uh,
this movement.
This would be futile.
It would not only be futile.

525
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:57.900
He even suggests it would be impervious.

526
00:36:57.901 --> 00:37:02.901
It would be in some ways to go against the will of God as if the hand of God,

527
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:08.550
we're behind this immense historical progress or process.

528
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:09.563
Tocqueville,

529
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:15.000
no doubt deliberately overstates that argument,
but he does.

530
00:37:15.001 --> 00:37:19.080
So I think in order to make a serious and profound point,

531
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:24.500
our politics are politics are deeply embedded within long structures of human

532
00:37:26.581 --> 00:37:30.510
history that we can do little to alter and escape.

533
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.330
We seem to be deeply embedded.

534
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:37.260
We as individuals deeply embedded within these structures.

535
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:42.410
This is it to two or to use a term that modern political scientists often use to

536
00:37:42.601 --> 00:37:47.490
describe this.
It is an argument from what is often called path dependency.

537
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:52.560
That we are again,
deeply embedded within historical processes,

538
00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.110
tendencies,
uh,

539
00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:59.130
paths of development that we can do little to resist or control.

540
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.910
And in many ways,
Tocqueville,
often you will find Tocqueville.

541
00:38:02.911 --> 00:38:07.911
Often writing is if he has some kind of historical or sociological determinist

542
00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:14.280
allowing little room for individual initiative or agency words like fate,

543
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.370
destiny,

544
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.760
a tendency a are frequently used throughout the book,

545
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.730
uh,
to underscore the limits of political action.

546
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:30.220
I would even be an interesting experiment,
uh,
or,
uh,

547
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:36.020
to go through the book page by page and find how many of those,

548
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:41.590
those kinds of words,
tendency,
fate,
destiny,

549
00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.590
these kind of deterministic words that,

550
00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:49.180
that suggest irresistible movements,
movement,
uh,

551
00:38:49.181 --> 00:38:51.280
of history.
Uh,
he,
he,

552
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:56.250
how many times he uses this and these Indian what contact contexts and he

553
00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:01.320
frequently offers predictions throughout the book on the basis of what he

554
00:39:02.171 --> 00:39:05.860
regards to be underlying historical and social trends.

555
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.160
You can hardly read a page of the book,

556
00:39:09.161 --> 00:39:14.161
sometimes not even a paragraph without finding in it some kind of prediction,

557
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:19.450
uh,
based on,
uh,
these trends.
I again,
I would ask you,
you know,

558
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.620
if you have time,
go through the book,
you don't have time this semester.

559
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:28.570
Maybe it will be a great senior essay later on to go through the book and find

560
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.540
examples.
As many as you can have.
Again,

561
00:39:31.541 --> 00:39:36.541
predictions that Tocqueville makes on the basis of these historical,

562
00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:41.350
uh,
these,
this claim about historical forces,
uh,

563
00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:46.410
in much of this seems to deny taken literally much of this would seem to deny

564
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.620
the role of independent,
uh,
human initiative.
Uh,

565
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:54.070
or statecraft in history.

566
00:39:54.071 --> 00:39:59.071
Consider the following passage from pages one 54 and 55 of your translation.

567
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.960
Here's what Tocqueville writes about,
the Statesman.

568
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:09.220
He says sometimes after a thousand efforts,

569
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:14.110
the legislators succeeds in exerting an indirect influence and the destiny of

570
00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:17.620
nations and then one celebrates his genius,

571
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:22.570
whereas often the geographical position of the country about what she can do.

572
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:27.430
Nothing.
A social state that was created without his concurrence,

573
00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:32.320
mores and ideas of whose origin he is.
Ignorant,
a point of departure,

574
00:40:32.321 --> 00:40:33.280
unknown to him,

575
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:38.550
impart irresistible movements to society against what she struggles in vain in

576
00:40:38.831 --> 00:40:43.300
which carry him along.
In turn there.
There you go.

577
00:40:43.301 --> 00:40:48.301
He gives us a list of all of the different determinants of,

578
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:53.710
of,
of,
of,
of human,
you know,
surrounding conditions,
a geography,

579
00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.470
morays,
social position.
These,
he says,

580
00:40:56.471 --> 00:40:59.770
impart an irresistible movements to society.

581
00:40:59.771 --> 00:41:03.850
There is that kind of deterministic language again against which he,

582
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.980
the statesman can do nothing and yet he begins this.

583
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:12.280
He begins that little statement by saying that after a thousand efforts he

584
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:17.140
succeeds in exerting an indirect influence and the destiny of nations.

585
00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:19.600
And then he is celebrated as a great genius.

586
00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:24.370
You can see Tocqueville's irony and what appears to be downplaying,

587
00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:28.810
uh,
the,
uh,
abilities or the role of the legislator,

588
00:41:28.811 --> 00:41:31.050
the Statesman to,

589
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:35.840
to effect a change with any significant kind.

590
00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:40.760
Uh,
I don't like to be political,

591
00:41:40.761 --> 00:41:44.580
but one might wonder what our president would have made of that,
uh,

592
00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:49.550
head he read that passage or thought about it or those around him had thought

593
00:41:49.551 --> 00:41:54.440
about it a couple of years ago before our current,
uh,
miseries,
uh,

594
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:59.060
began.
Uh,
anyway,
this passage,
uh,

595
00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:04.110
almost seems to be mocking the claims of Machiavelli or Rousseau who,

596
00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:09.220
who saw the ability of the new of a new prints or a legislator to found people's

597
00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:11.780
institutions.
Uh,

598
00:42:11.781 --> 00:42:16.781
Tocqueville seems to regard that the legislator can do relatively little on his

599
00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:21.200
own,
but as strongly hemmed in by a host of factors,

600
00:42:21.201 --> 00:42:24.770
geography,
social customs,
morality,
again,

601
00:42:24.771 --> 00:42:27.620
over which one can do little,

602
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:32.020
the legislator is more like a ship's captain,
uh,

603
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:37.030
dependent on the external circumstances that control the fate of the ship.

604
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.350
And he even goes on to say,

605
00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:43.100
the legislator resembles a man who plots his course.

606
00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:48.080
In the middle of the ocean.
Thus he can direct the vessel that carries him,

607
00:42:48.081 --> 00:42:50.150
but he cannot change its structure,

608
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:55.340
create wins or prevent the ocean from rising under his feet.

609
00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.360
Uh,

610
00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:01.360
all of this seems to be on this side of those historical features that,

611
00:43:01.781 --> 00:43:06.080
that limit what we can do.
Yet if Tocqueville,

612
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:07.160
uh,

613
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:12.160
often writes as if the statesmen is hemmed in by these kinds of circumstances,

614
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.000
uh,
he also,

615
00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:19.060
and you see this especially throughout volume too strongly opposes our systems,

616
00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:26.350
all intellectual or philosophical systems of historical determinism that deny to

617
00:43:26.811 --> 00:43:29.450
us the power of human agency.

618
00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:33.490
A while he's sometimes writes to shame or to humble,
uh,

619
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:36.080
the pretension of human greatness.

620
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.890
He is just as concerned about the tendency,
in fact,

621
00:43:39.891 --> 00:43:44.630
the very dangerous tendency towards self abnegation that denies,

622
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.650
uh,

623
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:50.570
the denies the role of the individual in politics and history.

624
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:55.400
He often writes as if the,
it is the peculiarity of democratic times,

625
00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:56.840
uh,

626
00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:01.840
when our peoples are considered equal in therefore all of us considered equally

627
00:44:02.421 --> 00:44:07.220
powerless to effect or change anything.
And again,

628
00:44:07.221 --> 00:44:11.180
I would ask who has not felt this way at some time?

629
00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:16.100
Maybe all the time that with all of us being again,
more or less equal,

630
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:21.190
no one seems to have the power kind of singular power to effect any great social

631
00:44:22.341 --> 00:44:25.880
change.
There is one wonderful chapter,
uh,
among others,

632
00:44:25.881 --> 00:44:29.110
but I'll just mention one look at the chapter.
Uh,

633
00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:32.220
and I can't recall off hand the exact,
uh,

634
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.410
number of the chapter,

635
00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:39.650
but the one called on historians on the role of historians in democratic and

636
00:44:40.971 --> 00:44:42.990
aristocratic times and how we,

637
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:47.010
how we shows us that in aristocratic ages he's thinking particularly of the

638
00:44:47.011 --> 00:44:47.880
ancient world,

639
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:52.110
historians attributed to extraordinary individuals,

640
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:56.130
all the power to affect nations and change nations.

641
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.130
But in democratic times,
in modern times,

642
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:02.130
we tend to think of historians.

643
00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:06.840
What one might also take as term historian to include social science as well.

644
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:11.770
Uh,
we tend to project systems which deny the power,
uh,

645
00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.700
the unique power of the individual.

646
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:18.680
We are all a product of,
of,
of vast,
uh,

647
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:23.580
you might say historical or causal circumstances over which the individual has

648
00:45:23.581 --> 00:45:28.080
no control.
Think of the way in which a Marxism,
uh,
again,

649
00:45:28.081 --> 00:45:32.580
denies the power of the individual Friday and analysis.
Did Not,
you know,

650
00:45:32.581 --> 00:45:37.581
sees all of our desires and motives as determined by forces over which we have a

651
00:45:40.321 --> 00:45:44.940
little control.
All kinds of economic theories of development,

652
00:45:44.941 --> 00:45:47.540
again,
which a cs all,
uh,

653
00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:51.840
acting under a certain kind of uniform rules of human behavior.

654
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.850
Where is the,
where is the room for the individual?
It's that,

655
00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:00.960
that chapter is a wonderful illustration of Tocqueville's general point.

656
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:05.970
So what is then his teaching?
Uh,
and more specifically,

657
00:46:05.971 --> 00:46:10.380
what is his vibe?
Is his advice,
uh,
for the state craft,
uh,

658
00:46:10.381 --> 00:46:13.950
of the future?
Uh,
and it seems that the,
by the end of the book,

659
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.910
Tocqueville is walking on a very narrow tightrope.

660
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.110
He wishes to convince his contemporaries,
uh,

661
00:46:22.111 --> 00:46:24.330
that the democratic age is upon us.

662
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:28.980
That the transition from aristocracy to democracy is irreversible.

663
00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:32.490
That it cannot be a dead,
it cannot be resisted.

664
00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:36.210
And what he calls the Democratic Revolution,
uh,

665
00:46:36.211 --> 00:46:39.930
is an accomplished fact.
And yet at the same time,

666
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:45.710
he wants to instruct us that what form democracy will take in the future will

667
00:46:45.841 --> 00:46:49.350
very much depend on will on intelligence,

668
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.990
on what he's sometimes called enlightenment.

669
00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:56.130
And especially on an individual human agency.

670
00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.210
What form democracy will take.
Democracy may be inevitable.

671
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:04.170
Equality.
The age of equality may be inevitable,

672
00:47:04.171 --> 00:47:06.600
but democracy is not of all one piece.

673
00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:11.810
It depends not just an impersonal historical forces but on what you might call

674
00:47:12.061 --> 00:47:17.061
the act of virtue and intelligence of individuals ranging from self interest,

675
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:21.210
rightly understood to honor and ambition.

676
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:26.360
Democracy can still take many forms and whether it will favor liberty or be

677
00:47:26.491 --> 00:47:31.491
favorable to liberty or does some kind of collectivism is for him very much an

678
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.520
open question.

679
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:38.590
What form democracy will take and Tocqueville returns to this theme.
It's very,

680
00:47:38.591 --> 00:47:42.610
very important theme.
In the last very last paragraph of his book,

681
00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.130
I am not unaware.

682
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:49.930
He tells his readers that several of my contemporaries have thought that peoples

683
00:47:49.931 --> 00:47:54.190
are never masters of themselves.
Here below there's little we can do.

684
00:47:54.191 --> 00:47:56.830
We are never met and that they necessarily obey.

685
00:47:56.831 --> 00:48:01.831
I do not know which insurmountable and unintelligent force born of previous

686
00:48:02.501 --> 00:48:05.860
events,
the race,
the soil or the climate.

687
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:11.460
Those he says are false and cowardly doctrines that can never produce anything

688
00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:15.070
but weak men and pusillanimous nations.

689
00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:20.340
That is to say these doctrines of historical determinism have an actual effect

690
00:48:20.651 --> 00:48:25.460
on people.
It makes us weak.
It makes us cowardly.
It makes us,
uh,

691
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:30.690
it makes entire societies and it enervates entire society.

692
00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.290
And yet he continues.

693
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:37.530
Providence has not created the entire race entirely independent or perfectly

694
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:43.480
enslaved.
It traces.
It is true.
He's speaking about providence.

695
00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:48.580
It traces,
it is true a fatal circle around each man that he cannot leave.

696
00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:52.870
But within this vast limits man is powerful and free.

697
00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:57.700
So too,
he says with people,
Tocqueville leaves us,

698
00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:00.520
in other words,
not with the solution,
uh,

699
00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:05.290
but rather with a paradox or I would say a challenge for us to consider.

700
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.290
We are determined but not altogether.

701
00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:13.410
So the statesmen must know how to navigate the shoals between historical,

702
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:18.541
social and cultural forces over which we have no say.

703
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:23.790
And those matters of institutional design and moral suasion that are still

704
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:29.080
within our power to affect pip.
Politics is intelligent.

705
00:49:29.081 --> 00:49:33.970
People have always known,
uh,
which is not to say all people to be sure,

706
00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:36.210
but as intelligent people have known,
uh,

707
00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:39.310
is a medium that takes place within language.

708
00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:44.800
It is a matter of providing people with the linguistic and the rhetorical

709
00:49:44.801 --> 00:49:45.634
abilities,

710
00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:50.050
both to construct their pasts and to imagine their futures.

711
00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:54.730
It is language,
uh,
going back to Aristotle,
it is logo.

712
00:49:54.731 --> 00:49:59.731
So there's language that gives us a latitude and ability to adapt to changing

713
00:49:59.771 --> 00:50:02.680
circumstances and to create new ones.

714
00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:07.870
Tocqueville provides us living in a democratic age with the language to shape

715
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:11.410
the future of democratic societies.

716
00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:14.560
What we do with that language,

717
00:50:14.561 --> 00:50:19.300
how we apply it to new circumstances and conditions that Tocqueville could never

718
00:50:19.301 --> 00:50:24.010
have imagined will be,
of course,
entirely up to us.
Uh,

719
00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:27.010
and on that note,
I have to end Tocqueville.

720
00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:31.240
And Wednesday I'll see you for our last class and I'm going to talk about where

721
00:50:31.241 --> 00:50:32.620
we go from there.
