1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.370
Today I have the impossible task of finishing,

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.650
uh,

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:07.240
the,

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.550
the parts of the republic that I have assigned for the class.

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:12.421
And,

6
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:13.254
uh,

7
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.601
in the past,

8
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:19.620
sometimes I've assigned a full two weeks to the republic,

9
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:21.450
which would be four lectures.

10
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.930
Uh,

11
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.320
but because I wanted to do some other things with the course as well,

12
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:28.720
I had to cut the republic by one lecture and now I'm,

13
00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:30.660
I'm paying for that today.

14
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.610
So I'm going to try to rush through unfortunately a number of the major themes,

15
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.361
uh,

16
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:40.350
regarding the creation of the just city creation of color.

17
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.810
And then,

18
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.120
uh,

19
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.850
try to end the class by talking about,

20
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:47.250
as I like to do for every thinker.

21
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.940
Uh,

22
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.200
what does in this case,

23
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:49.600
what does,

24
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.820
what does Plato,

25
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.340
what are his views on modern America?

26
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.130
What does Plato say to us today?

27
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.080
But I want to start with what is one of the grand themes of the republic.

28
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.390
It is indicated in book two,

29
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.050
uh,

30
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.130
by Eddie and manages his speech about self control.

31
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.790
It has introduced further by the claims of the,

32
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:12.300
uh,

33
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.010
of Socrates to control a,

34
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.000
to sensor,

35
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:18.960
to control the poetry and the arts,

36
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.390
uh,

37
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.131
of the city.

38
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:24.900
And this is the big theme of what one might call the control of the passions.

39
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.681
Uh,

40
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:30.681
this is the theme of every great moral list from Spinosa to con to Freud.

41
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.640
How do we control the passions?

42
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.200
And it is certainly a large theme of Plato's theory of Justice in the republic.

43
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.230
Every great moral philosopher has a strategy for helping us submit our passions

44
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.350
to some kind of control to some kind of supervening moral power.

45
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.041
And again,

46
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:55.110
recall this is the theme raised,

47
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.540
uh,

48
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.910
at the beginning of book two,

49
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.120
by adding Mantas who puts forward an idea of self control or what he calls self

50
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:04.110
guardianship,

51
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.850
uh,

52
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.210
as his goal,

53
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:11.211
how can we protect ourselves from the passion for injustice?

54
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.330
And one of the things Socrates emphasizes,

55
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.470
uh,

56
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.240
is that the most powerful of those passions is the most powerful passion,

57
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.871
uh,

58
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:22.500
is the,

59
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.150
is that Socratic passion that he calls Thumos,

60
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.000
uh,

61
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.650
or what our translator has his spiritedness anger.

62
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.963
Uh,

63
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.403
maybe what the,

64
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.340
what Biblical translators call heart,

65
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.910
uh,

66
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.450
having,

67
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.710
having a big heart,

68
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.430
having,

69
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.520
having thumos.

70
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.480
And all of that implies this is for Plato,

71
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:47.460
the Political Passion,

72
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.570
uh,

73
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.650
par exsalonce.

74
00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:54.651
It is a kind of fiery love of fame,

75
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.680
love of distinction that leads men and women of a certain type,

76
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.780
uh,

77
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.780
to pursue their ambitions in public life in the public space.

78
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.110
Uh,

79
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.730
it is clearly connected.

80
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:14.731
This notion of spirit had nurse or this through Motak quality to our capacities

81
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:19.510
for her heroism and for self sacrifice,

82
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.140
but it is also connected to our desires for domination and the desire to

83
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:32.671
exercise tyranny over others through most has a kind of dual component to it.

84
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.860
It can lead us to a sense of kind of righteous indignation and anger at the site

85
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.760
of injustice,

86
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.120
but it can also lead us in a rather contradictory way to desire to dominate in

87
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:47.410
tyrannized over others.

88
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:48.940
This is the quality that,

89
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:53.941
that Socrates regards as being possessed by every great political leader and

90
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:56.440
statesman.

91
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.440
But it is also clearly a quality possessed by every tyrant and the question

92
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:04.600
posed by the republic in many ways.

93
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:07.030
The question around which the book as a whole,

94
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.253
uh,

95
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.970
gravitates,

96
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.020
uh,

97
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.500
is whether this through Mautic quality can be controlled.

98
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:16.090
Can it be redirected?

99
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:20.260
Can it be rechannel in the service of the public good?

100
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.160
Socrates introduces the problem of the most,

101
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.970
uh,

102
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.810
by a story,

103
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.650
a particularly vivid story that I hope you will remember.

104
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.210
We're in book four.

105
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.800
He tells the story about Leon ts at the balls.

106
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.440
Leontief he writes,

107
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:42.670
was proceeding from the Pi radius outside the north wall when he perceived

108
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.470
corpses lying,

109
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:46.060
you're the public execution.

110
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.310
At the same time,

111
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:49.930
he desired to see them.

112
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.020
He wanted to see this grotesque site,

113
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.351
these,

114
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:54.820
these dead bodies lying there.

115
00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:55.870
And to the contrary,

116
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:59.110
he felt disgust and turned himself away.

117
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:02.980
And for a while he battled with himself and hid his face,

118
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.550
but eventually overpowered by desire.

119
00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:10.360
He forced his eyes open and rushing toward the corpses said,

120
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.660
see you damned wretches take your fill of this beautiful site for 39.

121
00:05:17.141 --> 00:05:17.974
See

122
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.480
that story that Socrates tells here,

123
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.650
uh,

124
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.980
is not one of reason controlling the passions,

125
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:34.981
but rather one of intense internal conflict that Leon ts felt.

126
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.101
Uh,

127
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:41.101
we see his conflicting emotions both just see and not to see a sense that,

128
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.430
uh,

129
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.450
he wished to,

130
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.620
to observe.

131
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.740
And yet he is at,

132
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.060
in some ways at war with himself knowing to Goc to stare at this site.

133
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:53.560
There's something shameful about it.

134
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:54.700
And he felt shame.

135
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.700
One example I particularly like of this was suggested,

136
00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.660
uh,

137
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.690
last year I think by Justin's RMB who said,

138
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:03.200
it's the,

139
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.130
it's the emotion we all feel when we're driving down the highway,

140
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.791
right?

141
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:12.380
And we see a car crash or we go buy a wreck in.

142
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:13.910
Everybody slows down,

143
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:14.151
right?

144
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:17.150
They all want to see what are they hoping to see?

145
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:17.481
Well,

146
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:18.680
they want to see blood.

147
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:20.900
They want to see if there's a body.

148
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:23.150
They want to see how much damage has been caused.

149
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:23.481
And we all,

150
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:26.970
we've all been in this where we know that it's shameful to,

151
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.771
to look at this.

152
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:31.910
Just this drive on mind you is Socrates would say mind your own business.

153
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.650
And yet at the same time,

154
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:33.880
we,

155
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.190
we,

156
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.940
we feel even against our will compelled to,

157
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.160
to look and think of it.

158
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:41.210
Think about that.

159
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.810
Uh,

160
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.840
and think about that and that this case of Leontief was,

161
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.370
uh,

162
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.430
the next time you'll,

163
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.493
uh,

164
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.850
for those of you who have driver's licenses,

165
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.410
uh,

166
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.690
no,

167
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.420
the next to,

168
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.650
uh,

169
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.640
who drive driving on the highway and see something like that.

170
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.730
It is the thumos that is the cause of it.

171
00:06:58.731 --> 00:06:59.030
Should,

172
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.680
that should be the cause of your shame at slowing down to look.

173
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:07.940
Sometimes we can't help but slow down because everybody is slowed down in front

174
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:08.151
of us.

175
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:08.990
We have no choice.

176
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.160
But anyway,

177
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.610
that,

178
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.420
that,

179
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.920
that incident,

180
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.610
uh,

181
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.080
that story that Socrates relates is connected to the fact that Leante has a

182
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:20.300
certain kind of man.

183
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:20.660
He is,

184
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:20.960
he,

185
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.670
he regards himself as proud,

186
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.833
independent,

187
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.740
someone who wants to be in control of his emotions but,

188
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.500
but isn't a,

189
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.570
he has a soul at war with himself and potentially therefore at war with others

190
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:36.680
in the room.

191
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.920
With the republic tries to do is to offer a strategies,

192
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:45.010
maybe even we might even call it a therapy for dealing with through most,

193
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:50.261
for submitting it to the control of reason and helping us to achieve some level

194
00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:54.200
of balance of self control and moderation.

195
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:59.090
And these are the qualities taken together that's talk with these calls,

196
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:04.180
justice that can only be achieved when reason is in control of the appetites and

197
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:06.100
desires.

198
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:06.470
The,

199
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.303
again,

200
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:12.650
a question the book asks is whether that ideal of justice can be used as a model

201
00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:16.040
for politics.

202
00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:21.041
Can it serve as a model for justice in the city?

203
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.160
Uh,

204
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.540
this connection we,

205
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.710
he is established between justice in the city and justice in the soul.

206
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.600
What are the therapies or,

207
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.820
or strategies for solving,

208
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:32.350
uh,

209
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.290
injustice in the soul or imbalance of some kind in the soul?

210
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:41.030
Can those be transferred or translated in some way to public justice,

211
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.560
to two political justice,

212
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:44.000
justice and in the Polis,

213
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.540
right.

214
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:48.840
You,

215
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.770
you with me on that?

216
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.493
So far?

217
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.860
So on the basis of this,

218
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.160
uh,

219
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.160
Socrates proposes how to proceed with the construction of Calypso lists and he

220
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:05.850
does so through what he calls three waves.

221
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.620
There are three waves that will three waves of reform,

222
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.550
so to speak,

223
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.880
that will contribute to the creation of the city.

224
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:19.881
The first of these waves is you remember the restrictions on private property,

225
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.400
even the abolition of private property,

226
00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:26.580
the second the abolition of the family,

227
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.220
and the third wave being the establishment of the philosopher kings.

228
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:37.250
Each of these waves is regarded as in some way necessary for the proper

229
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:39.660
construction of adjust city.

230
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.090
And I'm not going to speak about all of them,

231
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.280
but I do want to speak a little bit about because it has particularly particular

232
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:48.330
relevance for us.

233
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.230
Uh,

234
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.160
his proposals for the coeducation a of men and women.

235
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.250
That is a great part of his plan,

236
00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.520
especially related to the abolition of the family that men and women be,

237
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:03.300
uh,

238
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.950
educated in the same way.

239
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.493
<v 1>Right?</v>

240
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.440
<v 0>The car of sacrifices,</v>

241
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.910
proposal for equal education,

242
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.140
uh,

243
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:16.973
is

244
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:19.841
presented in a,

245
00:10:19.841 --> 00:10:24.841
in a context that he knows to be or suggests will be laughable.

246
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.850
It will certainly be seen that way.

247
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:32.560
He suggests by Glaucon and Eddie Amanda's there is no job.

248
00:10:32.561 --> 00:10:37.510
He states it cannot be performed equally well by both men and women.

249
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.720
Is Socrates a feminist

250
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.330
gender differences?

251
00:10:43.331 --> 00:10:47.590
He says there are no more relevant when it comes to positions of political rule

252
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:53.020
then is the distinction between being bald and being Harry.

253
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.810
Socrates is not saying that men and women are the same in every respect he says,

254
00:10:58.811 --> 00:11:02.650
but equal worth respect to competing for any job at all.

255
00:11:02.651 --> 00:11:07.150
There will be no glass ceilings in Calypso lists.

256
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.390
Uh,

257
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.820
first in many ways.

258
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.880
Great defender of the first grade champion of the emancipation of women from the

259
00:11:16.121 --> 00:11:16.954
household.

260
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.340
But this proposal comes at certain costs.

261
00:11:21.341 --> 00:11:26.341
He tells us the proposal for a level playing field demands of course equal

262
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.820
education.

263
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:33.430
And here he says that men and women being submitted to the same regimen will

264
00:11:35.021 --> 00:11:40.021
mean a among other things that they will compete with one another in

265
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.240
coeducational gymnasium.

266
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:48.930
They will compete with each other in the nude because that is the way Greeks

267
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.140
exercised.

268
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.513
They will,

269
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.370
they will compete naked

270
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.630
<v 2>in a coeducational gymnasium.</v>

271
00:11:57.631 --> 00:11:58.060
I think.

272
00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.020
Think of that.

273
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.753
Okay.

274
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:06.801
<v 0>Furthermore,</v>

275
00:12:06.801 --> 00:12:09.860
their marriages and their procreation will be,

276
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.110
he tells us for the sake of the city,

277
00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.560
there is nothing like romantic love.

278
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.140
Uh,

279
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.140
among the members of the Guardian class,

280
00:12:18.141 --> 00:12:23.141
sexual relations will be intended purely for the sake of reproduction and

281
00:12:25.191 --> 00:12:27.890
unwanted fetuses will be a boarded

282
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:37.790
only exception to this prohibition is for members of the Guardian class who are

283
00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:39.830
beyond the age of reproduction.

284
00:12:39.831 --> 00:12:40.664
He tells us,

285
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.230
and today he says,

286
00:12:42.231 --> 00:12:44.660
can have sex if they're still able,

287
00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:45.381
uh,

288
00:12:45.381 --> 00:12:46.101
with anyone.

289
00:12:46.101 --> 00:12:51.101
They like a kind of version of recreational sex as a reward for a lifetime of

290
00:12:52.761 --> 00:12:53.750
self control.

291
00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:57.680
Child bearing may be inevitable for women,

292
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.930
but the rearing of the child will be respond,

293
00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.240
will be the responsibility of the community.

294
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.710
Uh,

295
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:07.550
or at least a class of guardians in common daycare centers.

296
00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:13.010
Sort of variation of Hillary Clinton's book that it takes a village

297
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.140
to raise a child,

298
00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.210
comes right out of Plato.

299
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:22.300
Apparently no child should know their biological parents and no parent should

300
00:13:24.111 --> 00:13:25.190
know their child.

301
00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:30.220
The purpose of this scheme being to eliminate senses of mine and me to promote a

302
00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:38.771
kind of common sense of esprit de Corps among the members of the Guardian Class,

303
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.410
a community of pleasure and pain.

304
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:43.040
Uh,

305
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.810
Socrates calls it at four 64,

306
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.780
eight a what we are creating is a community of pleasure and pain.

307
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.610
I will feel your pains and of course you will.

308
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.050
You will feel mine.

309
00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.440
The objections to Socrates are of course,

310
00:14:00.441 --> 00:14:00.771
you know,

311
00:14:00.771 --> 00:14:04.970
raised as early as is by Aristotle himself and the,

312
00:14:04.971 --> 00:14:06.500
in the very next generation.

313
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:07.940
Uh,

314
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.460
how can we care for things?

315
00:14:10.461 --> 00:14:13.970
How can we truly care for things that are common?

316
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:14.870
Uh,

317
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:19.870
we learn to care for things that are closest to us that are in some way our own.

318
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.520
We can only show proper love and concern for things that are ours.

319
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.821
Not,

320
00:14:25.821 --> 00:14:27.740
not things that are common.

321
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.180
Common ownership,

322
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.480
Aristotle argues will mean a sort of common neglect.

323
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.640
Children will not be raised,

324
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.140
uh,

325
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.410
better by,

326
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:39.920
uh,

327
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.370
putting them under the common care of Guardians of,

328
00:14:43.371 --> 00:14:43.521
of,

329
00:14:43.521 --> 00:14:45.860
of guardians or in daycares,

330
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.130
but they will be equally a neglected.

331
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:50.690
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

332
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.650
<v 0>but it in this,</v>

333
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.090
<v 2>and you can think about that,</v>

334
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.530
but whether that's true or not,

335
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:57.800
but it is in the same context of his treatment of men and women,

336
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.560
did something else often goes unnoticed.

337
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.810
And that is Socrates is efforts to rewrite the laws of war.

338
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.311
Because of course,

339
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:10.940
the guardians are being trained and educated to be,

340
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.080
to be guards,

341
00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:13.190
to be warriors,

342
00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:17.270
to be members of a military class in the first place.

343
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:17.841
He tells us,

344
00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:20.360
children must be taught the art of war.

345
00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.590
<v 0>This must be the beginning of their education.</v>

346
00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:26.730
Socrates says,

347
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.670
making the children's spectators of war.

348
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:30.680
<v 2>Okay,</v>

349
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.420
<v 0>children love will be taken.</v>

350
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:37.421
He seems to suggest two battles and two sites of where we're fighting is going

351
00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:39.770
on to be spectators,

352
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:40.611
uh,

353
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:43.430
for them to become use to in,

354
00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:43.721
in,

355
00:15:43.721 --> 00:15:44.420
in a bitchy,

356
00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:49.160
waited to seeing war and everything that goes on.

357
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.270
Not only his expulsion from the ranks of the Guardians,

358
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.220
a penalty for cowardice,

359
00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:00.940
but Socrates suggests there should be listened to this erotic rewards for those

360
00:16:02.001 --> 00:16:03.530
who excel in bravery,

361
00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:08.400
erotic rewards for excellence in bravery.

362
00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:09.600
Consider the following.

363
00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:14.601
Remarkable proposal it for 68 C and I add to the laws of war.

364
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.510
Socrates writes it as long as day.

365
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.080
Uh,

366
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.150
the guardians are on campaign,

367
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:26.930
no one whom he wants to kiss should be permitted to refuse so that if a man

368
00:16:28.651 --> 00:16:30.150
happens to love someone,

369
00:16:30.151 --> 00:16:31.920
either male or female,

370
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.850
he would be more eager to when the rewards of valor.

371
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:37.540
<v 2>Okay.</v>

372
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.260
<v 0>It is to say as a reward for bravery,</v>

373
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.330
exhibited bravery,

374
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:49.230
the hero should be allowed to kiss any one day like while they are on.

375
00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:50.330
<v 2>Okay.</v>

376
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.490
<v 0>Patrol male or female,</v>

377
00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:54.541
uh,

378
00:16:54.541 --> 00:16:59.541
particularly puritanical editor of Plato from the 20th century writes in a

379
00:17:00.601 --> 00:17:02.250
footnote to that passage.

380
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.840
This is almost the only passage in Plato that one would wish to blot out.

381
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.290
His sensibilities are offended by this notion,

382
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.240
but I wonder what kind of,

383
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:18.800
if this might even make a powerful incentive for military recruitment today.

384
00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.033
<v 2>Okay.</v>

385
00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.013
What do you think?

386
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.401
<v 0>Well,</v>

387
00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:32.234
think about it.

388
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:33.723
I don't know.

389
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.760
So at long last we moved from the education of the guards to justice.

390
00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:42.110
What is justice?

391
00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.550
We've been question.

392
00:17:43.551 --> 00:17:47.810
We've been asking ourselves do out this book and which Plato has been,

393
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:52.140
Socrates has been teasing us with at long last we come to this thing,

394
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:56.040
the platonic idea of justice concerns harmony.

395
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.260
He tells us both harmony in the city,

396
00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.483
in harmony,

397
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.660
in the soul.

398
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.400
We learned that the two are actually a homologous in some way.

399
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:10.401
Justice is defined as what binds the city together and makes it one or he puts

400
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:12.781
it another way.

401
00:18:12.781 --> 00:18:17.070
It consists of everyone and everything performing those functions for which they

402
00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:18.440
are best equipped.

403
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.060
Each of the other citizens,

404
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.050
Socrates says,

405
00:18:22.051 --> 00:18:24.780
must be brought to that which naturally suits him,

406
00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:26.220
which naturally suits him.

407
00:18:26.221 --> 00:18:26.941
One man,

408
00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:31.320
one job he says so that each man practicing his own,

409
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.050
which is one will not become many,

410
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.003
but one.

411
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:35.821
Thus you see,

412
00:18:35.821 --> 00:18:39.060
he says the whole city will naturally grow up together.

413
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.090
Justice seems to Maine,

414
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:46.350
it adhering to the principle at least justice in the city adhering to the

415
00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:48.330
principle of division of labor.

416
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:49.800
One man,

417
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:55.010
one job everyone doing or performing the task that naturally fits or suits them.

418
00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:02.700
One can of course is you've already imagined raise several objections to this

419
00:19:02.701 --> 00:19:02.971
view.

420
00:19:02.971 --> 00:19:03.480
And again,

421
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.520
Aristotle seems to take the lead.

422
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.880
Plato's excessive emphasis on unity would seem to destroy the natural diversity

423
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.360
of human beings that make up a city is their one and only one thing that each

424
00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:19.710
person does best.

425
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.390
And if so,

426
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:22.020
uh,

427
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:27.020
who could decide this was such a plan of justice not be overly coercive and

428
00:19:28.051 --> 00:19:32.100
forcing people into predefined social roles.

429
00:19:32.101 --> 00:19:37.101
Shouldn't individuals be free to choose for themselves their own plans of life

430
00:19:37.951 --> 00:19:40.080
wherever it may take them?

431
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.980
But however that may be a Plato believes he is found in the formula of one man,

432
00:19:46.831 --> 00:19:47.550
one job,

433
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.520
a certain foundation for political justice.

434
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:56.330
That is to say the three parts of the cities workers auxiliary is guardians.

435
00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:02.130
Each of them all work together and each by minding their own business that is

436
00:20:02.131 --> 00:20:03.540
doing their own job.

437
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:04.650
Uh,

438
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:05.483
out of this,

439
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.970
a certain kind of peace and harmony will prevail.

440
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:14.130
And since the city you remember is simply the sole writ large,

441
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:19.470
the three classes of the city merely expressed the three parts of the soul.

442
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.880
The soul is just,

443
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:25.910
he tells us when the appetites spiritedness in reason cooperate with reason,

444
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.110
ruling,

445
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.640
spirit and appetite.

446
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.170
Just as in the Polis,

447
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.101
the philosopher,

448
00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:33.240
king rules,

449
00:20:33.241 --> 00:20:35.100
the warriors and the workers,

450
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:40.460
the result he tells us as a kind of balance of the parts of the whole right

451
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.950
justice as a kind of harmony in which the three parts of the city and the three

452
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:51.520
of the soul are direct expressions of one another.

453
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:55.773
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

454
00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.540
<v 0>But that formula</v>

455
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:06.490
forces us to return to the original Socratic question about the harmony of the

456
00:21:08.091 --> 00:21:08.990
soul on the city.

457
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:15.290
Is the structure of a city identical to the structure of a soul?

458
00:21:15.291 --> 00:21:16.880
Are they really identical?

459
00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:17.600
Well,

460
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.433
maybe,

461
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:19.543
maybe not.

462
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:21.261
For example,

463
00:21:21.261 --> 00:21:25.910
every individual consists of three parts of appetite,

464
00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.680
spirit and reason.

465
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.290
Yet each of us will be confined.

466
00:21:30.291 --> 00:21:32.630
It seems to only one task,

467
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:33.290
uh,

468
00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:34.820
in the social hierarchy.

469
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:40.570
I assume what Socrates means by that is though each individual will,

470
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.200
each of us embody off three features of soul,

471
00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.101
appetite,

472
00:21:46.101 --> 00:21:46.551
Spirit,

473
00:21:46.551 --> 00:21:47.384
and reason.

474
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:52.160
Only one of these will be the dominant trait in each of us.

475
00:21:52.161 --> 00:21:55.250
Some of us will be dominantly appetitive,

476
00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.330
uh,

477
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:57.320
personalities.

478
00:21:57.321 --> 00:22:00.770
Others will be dominantly spirited and so on.

479
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.960
But even still,

480
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.950
when we think of it,

481
00:22:03.951 --> 00:22:06.980
if I am a member of the money making class,

482
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:11.690
I am still more than simply a bundle of desires and appetites.

483
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:17.180
Just as a member of the warrior class would be clearly more than than,

484
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.770
than,

485
00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:21.050
than mere through most are mere spiritedness.

486
00:22:21.051 --> 00:22:23.060
So to confine the individual,

487
00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:28.090
it seems to one and only one sphere of life would seem to do an injustice to the

488
00:22:30.861 --> 00:22:35.861
internal psychological complexity that makes each of us who we are.

489
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:41.780
Let's examine that problem from a slightly different point of view.

490
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:47.470
Socrates tells us repeatedly the justice in the city consists of each member,

491
00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:52.430
each citizen fulfilling his task in this social division of labor,

492
00:22:52.431 --> 00:22:54.560
in the social hierarchy.

493
00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.640
But this seems to be a very far cry,

494
00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:03.700
does it not from the kind of justice he talks about in the soul,

495
00:23:03.981 --> 00:23:08.590
that consists in what we might think of as a sort of rational autonomy or self

496
00:23:08.591 --> 00:23:09.424
control,

497
00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:13.610
where reason controls the passions and the appetites.

498
00:23:13.611 --> 00:23:14.151
In fact,

499
00:23:14.151 --> 00:23:19.151
the vast majority of citizens in even the platonically just city,

500
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:25.130
well not necessarily have platonically just souls.

501
00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:25.670
Uh,

502
00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:30.410
the harmony and self discipline of the city will not be do it seems to each and

503
00:23:30.411 --> 00:23:31.940
every member of the city.

504
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:35.900
But rather we'll rely on the Guardian class,

505
00:23:35.901 --> 00:23:40.720
that special class of philosopher kings who will rule,

506
00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.790
let it be recalled to selective lies,

507
00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:44.660
myths,

508
00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.660
and various kinds of deception.

509
00:23:47.661 --> 00:23:49.640
So how can it be the case,

510
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:50.420
uh,

511
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.070
if at all that,

512
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:52.430
uh,

513
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.590
you could have a just city,

514
00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:55.190
uh,

515
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.840
that is to say a city where everyone is performing their own tasks,

516
00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:01.910
they're following the division of labor.

517
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:07.270
And yet very few of those members will have so to speak,

518
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:09.710
platonically just souls.

519
00:24:09.711 --> 00:24:14.510
That is to say souls dominated by a kind of self control or self guardianship.

520
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:14.991
Uh,

521
00:24:14.991 --> 00:24:18.080
that will certainly not be true of the members of the,

522
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:18.770
uh,

523
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.690
artisan class or the,

524
00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:21.021
or the,

525
00:24:21.021 --> 00:24:23.060
or the military class for that,

526
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.680
for that reason.

527
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.090
So the question that question is posed,

528
00:24:29.091 --> 00:24:31.850
that objection is posed by adding Magis.

529
00:24:31.851 --> 00:24:33.650
You remember at the beginning of book four,

530
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.320
what would your apology be?

531
00:24:36.321 --> 00:24:37.131
Socrates.

532
00:24:37.131 --> 00:24:38.120
Eddie Mantra says,

533
00:24:38.121 --> 00:24:41.480
if it were objected that you're hardly making these men happy.

534
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.520
These people just,

535
00:24:43.521 --> 00:24:44.121
he says it.

536
00:24:44.121 --> 00:24:49.121
Forum 19 a Eddie mantises concerned that Socrates is being unfair to the

537
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.770
auxiliaries and the guardians,

538
00:24:51.771 --> 00:24:53.870
giving them all the responsibilities,

539
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:56.150
but none of the rewards,

540
00:24:56.151 --> 00:25:00.800
none of the pleasures that would seem to be the reward of responsibility.

541
00:25:00.801 --> 00:25:03.410
How can a citizen of Calypso Alice leave,

542
00:25:03.411 --> 00:25:08.411
adjust or happy life if he or she is deprived of most of the goods or pleasures

543
00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:12.290
that we seek?

544
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:18.430
Socrates gives rather lame response in founding the city.

545
00:25:18.951 --> 00:25:23.951
He says we are not looking to the exceptional happiness of any one individual or

546
00:25:24.921 --> 00:25:25.754
any group,

547
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.100
but rather to the city as a whole.

548
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.110
And Eddie and Mantas appears to accept that response.

549
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:33.940
Oh yes,

550
00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:34.190
we,

551
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.641
I forgot,

552
00:25:34.641 --> 00:25:35.474
I forgot.

553
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.790
We are concerned with the happiness,

554
00:25:37.791 --> 00:25:39.260
the justice of the hole,

555
00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:44.860
but his question is still is one that lingers and one that played out includes

556
00:25:46.491 --> 00:25:47.271
for a purpose.

557
00:25:47.271 --> 00:25:52.271
What about how can you have a platonically just city if there are most even most

558
00:25:55.071 --> 00:25:55.960
people in it are.

559
00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:00.970
Certainly most people have the auxiliary class are deprived of the pleasures and

560
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:04.580
the goods that uh,

561
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.420
that we,

562
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.560
that we desire.

563
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:12.610
It's a question that lingers and one might wonder whether Socrates ever

564
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.470
successfully answers that question.

565
00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:21.650
He silences adding Amanda's in some way as he silences.

566
00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.850
There's simic is earlier.

567
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:28.630
That is not always to say that their objections have been answered and that

568
00:26:29.511 --> 00:26:34.511
leads as it were to the third and final wave of paradox of the [inaudible],

569
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.310
which is the famous proposal for the philosopher King.

570
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.270
What is Plato without the philosopher King?

571
00:26:45.271 --> 00:26:45.541
Yes.

572
00:26:45.541 --> 00:26:47.730
What is the republic without the philosopher King?

573
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:52.710
Unless the philosophers rule as kings are those now called King's genuinely

574
00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:53.730
philosophize.

575
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.510
There will be no rest from the ILS for the cities.

576
00:26:57.511 --> 00:26:58.080
He says,

577
00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:58.913
right.

578
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.310
Socrates presents this proposal.

579
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:02.701
Again,

580
00:27:02.701 --> 00:27:03.451
it's outlandish.

581
00:27:03.451 --> 00:27:08.451
She says he expects to be drowned in laughter and this has led some readers to

582
00:27:10.021 --> 00:27:13.860
suggest that the proposal for philosophers,

583
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:18.890
kings is ironical that it is intended as a kind of joke too in many ways just

584
00:27:20.491 --> 00:27:25.491
credit the idea of the justice city or at least to limp to indicate it's extreme

585
00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:27.930
implausibility.

586
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.230
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

587
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.891
<v 0>The question is,</v>

588
00:27:30.891 --> 00:27:35.891
why does Socrates regard philosophic kingship as required for [inaudible] for

589
00:27:37.461 --> 00:27:38.390
the just city?

590
00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:41.411
Let me say,

591
00:27:41.411 --> 00:27:46.411
I am by no means convinced that the idea for the philosopher king is an

592
00:27:48.431 --> 00:27:52.750
impossibility or is intended as a kind of absurdity.

593
00:27:52.751 --> 00:27:57.751
Plato himself remember made a number of trips to Sicily to serve as the advisor

594
00:28:00.161 --> 00:28:01.540
to a king there,

595
00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.790
Dionysius and all this.

596
00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:08.110
Although these missions failed and left him deeply dispirited,

597
00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:13.620
the ambition in some ways to unite philosophy and politics has been a recurring

598
00:28:14.561 --> 00:28:18.940
dream of political philosophy ever since Plato.

599
00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.810
Socrates says he will be drowned in laughter,

600
00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:28.140
but many other people have taken this dream or this aspiration very seriously.

601
00:28:28.721 --> 00:28:32.380
Consider one thinker and I will.

602
00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.230
I'm going to read you a short passage and I'm going to come back to this again

603
00:28:35.231 --> 00:28:39.100
later in the semester from Thomas Hobbes Leviathan,

604
00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.250
chapter 31 of Leviathan,

605
00:28:42.251 --> 00:28:47.251
which hubs gives us a very personal statement about his intention in writing

606
00:28:47.351 --> 00:28:48.184
this book.

607
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:50.303
Hobbs wrote,

608
00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:55.740
I am at the point of believing that my labors will be as useless as the

609
00:28:56.531 --> 00:28:57.970
Commonwealth of Plato.

610
00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:03.220
He seems to be rather despairing about whether this book is actually going to

611
00:29:03.221 --> 00:29:04.240
have any effect.

612
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.750
I'm in the point of believing that it will be as useless as the Commonwealth of

613
00:29:07.751 --> 00:29:12.751
Plato for he also is of the opinion that it is impossible for the disorders of

614
00:29:13.001 --> 00:29:18.001
state and change of government by civil war ever to be taken away till

615
00:29:18.341 --> 00:29:19.240
sovereigns,

616
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.650
the philosophers.

617
00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:26.820
But after admitting his despair about the possibility of realizing his ideas and

618
00:29:28.691 --> 00:29:31.090
practice how Hobbs continues as follows,

619
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:33.400
I recover some hope.

620
00:29:33.401 --> 00:29:34.200
He says,

621
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:34.580
uh,

622
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:39.580
that one time or other in this writing of mine may still fall into the hands of

623
00:29:39.701 --> 00:29:44.701
a sovereign who will consider himself without the help of any interested or

624
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.320
envious interpreter.

625
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:52.990
And by the exercise of entire sovereignty in protecting the public teaching of

626
00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:53.350
it,

627
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:58.350
convert this truth of speculation into the utility of practice.

628
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:00.730
So they are there.

629
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:05.650
You have hubs talking about his own book expecting or at least hoping it will

630
00:30:05.651 --> 00:30:10.651
fall into the hands of a sovereign who one day again with without a envious or a

631
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:15.070
self interested interpreters.

632
00:30:15.071 --> 00:30:20.071
May it may one day become a practical source of guidance for statecraft.

633
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:24.850
Here is Hobbes taking Plato's suggestion very seriously,

634
00:30:24.851 --> 00:30:28.720
and we see this would see this again very much in the history of political

635
00:30:28.721 --> 00:30:33.721
philosophy and thinkers like Rousseau or marks or nature or certain Machiavelli,

636
00:30:34.571 --> 00:30:36.520
all of whom sought to get,

637
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:41.550
gain the ear of political leaders and convert their ideas into some kind of

638
00:30:41.891 --> 00:30:42.724
practice.

639
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:49.080
But most of the objections to Plato's particular form of the philosophy,

640
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.280
philosophic kingship,

641
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:52.120
uh,

642
00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.550
really are centered on the practicality.

643
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.300
Uh,

644
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.340
if his idea and beyond this,

645
00:30:57.341 --> 00:31:02.341
there is the problem with the very cogency of the idea itself can consider the

646
00:31:02.471 --> 00:31:02.921
following,

647
00:31:02.921 --> 00:31:03.160
can,

648
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.120
can philosophy and politics actually be United,

649
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:13.080
it would seem that the needs of philosophy are quite different from the demands

650
00:31:13.631 --> 00:31:15.700
or requirements of political rule.

651
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:20.700
Can you imagine Socrates willingly giving up one of his conversations for the

652
00:31:22.691 --> 00:31:26.920
tedious business of legislation and public administration?

653
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:31.360
Can one imagine that the philosopher is described by Plato,

654
00:31:31.361 --> 00:31:36.361
is someone with knowledge of the eternal forms lying behind or beyond the many

655
00:31:37.391 --> 00:31:38.141
particulars,

656
00:31:38.141 --> 00:31:43.141
but just how does that kind of knowledge help us deal with the constant ebb and

657
00:31:43.991 --> 00:31:46.390
flow of political life?

658
00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:51.520
It seems not enough that the philosopher have knowledge of the forms,

659
00:31:51.521 --> 00:31:55.450
but this knowledge has to be supplemented by experience,

660
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:56.680
by judgment,

661
00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:01.920
and by a kind of practical rationality was played out simply unaware of this.

662
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.180
I can't believe that.

663
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.680
Uh,

664
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.860
I don't believe that.

665
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.180
So the question is,

666
00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:07.780
uh,

667
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:12.780
what kind of unity was he expecting of philosophy and politics?

668
00:32:13.691 --> 00:32:14.110
Anyway,

669
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:17.530
philosophers are not purely thinking machines,

670
00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.160
uh,

671
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.460
but they are also human beings composed of reason.

672
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.050
Spiritedness and appetite will not even philosophers.

673
00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:27.370
One might ask,

674
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.700
given the possibility of absolute power,

675
00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.540
be tempted to abuse their positions.

676
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:36.783
Maybe,

677
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.501
maybe not.

678
00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:40.334
Who knows?

679
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.080
So these are the questions.

680
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.651
These are,

681
00:32:42.651 --> 00:32:42.981
at least,

682
00:32:42.981 --> 00:32:46.490
these are among the questions that Socrates or Plato,

683
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.121
Plato,

684
00:32:47.121 --> 00:32:48.110
the author of the book,

685
00:32:48.111 --> 00:32:52.100
deliberately poses for us to consider.

686
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.900
So what is the doctrine of the philosopher king intended to prove,

687
00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:58.860
uh,

688
00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:03.860
must a massive effort to construct the city and speech in order to understand

689
00:33:04.161 --> 00:33:05.430
justice in the soul?

690
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:10.640
It is it a philosophical possibility cause he hauled it out as a,

691
00:33:10.971 --> 00:33:15.971
is a real possibility or must it be considered a failure in some way or that if

692
00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:18.680
the dialogue does end in failure,

693
00:33:18.681 --> 00:33:19.090
what,

694
00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:20.480
what can we learn from that?

695
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:22.183
Uh,

696
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.760
those are questions I want you to consider,

697
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:31.120
but for now what I want to do is talk about Plato's democracy and hours.

698
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.100
What does played out teach us about our own regime?

699
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

700
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.830
<v 0>Could play Doh have imagined such a regime?</v>

701
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.460
I think in many ways he can and he did

702
00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:51.810
in one sense,

703
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:54.090
the republic,

704
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:58.710
and I've given some indications of this today seems to be the most

705
00:33:58.711 --> 00:34:00.690
anti-democratic book ever written.

706
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:02.611
It's defensive.

707
00:34:02.611 --> 00:34:07.611
Philosophic kingship is itself a direct repudiation of Athenian democracy is

708
00:34:08.851 --> 00:34:10.350
conception of justice.

709
00:34:10.351 --> 00:34:15.351
Minding one's own business is a rejection of the democratic belief that citizens

710
00:34:16.741 --> 00:34:21.741
have sufficient knowledge to participate in the offices of government

711
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:29.530
to be sure Athenian democracy is not American democracy.

712
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:35.200
Plato thought of democracy as a kind of rule by the many that he associated with

713
00:34:36.141 --> 00:34:40.280
the unrestricted freedom to do everything that one likes.

714
00:34:40.281 --> 00:34:45.281
This seems in many ways to be quite far from the American democracy based on

715
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:50.270
constitutional government systems of checks and balances,

716
00:34:50.271 --> 00:34:53.120
protection of individual rights and so on.

717
00:34:53.121 --> 00:34:58.121
The differences between Athens and Washington seemed to be very far and yet in

718
00:34:59.031 --> 00:34:59.864
many ways,

719
00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:00.920
uh,

720
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.360
Socrates a diagnosis,

721
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:06.140
uh,

722
00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.220
very powerfully,

723
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:08.531
uh,

724
00:35:08.531 --> 00:35:09.980
an important condition,

725
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.510
uh,

726
00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:13.940
of modern democratic life with which we are all familiar.

727
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.260
Consider this passage in book eight of the Republic,

728
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:18.831
uh,

729
00:35:18.831 --> 00:35:21.630
that I encourage you to read but uh,

730
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:22.640
is not on your,

731
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:23.061
uh,

732
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:24.430
assigned list.

733
00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.010
Uh,

734
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.480
Socrates Wright's book eight,

735
00:35:26.481 --> 00:35:27.500
five 61.

736
00:35:27.501 --> 00:35:28.334
See,

737
00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.250
speaking of the democratic soul,

738
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:32.780
the democratic man,

739
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:38.290
he also lives along day by day gratifying the desire that occurs to him at one

740
00:35:40.021 --> 00:35:43.080
time drinking and listening to the flute

741
00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:45.790
today we will,

742
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.610
we have different kinds of music to substitute for the flute.

743
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.000
But,

744
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:49.390
uh,

745
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:53.560
you get the point drinking and listening to the flute.

746
00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:55.360
It another time,

747
00:35:55.361 --> 00:36:00.361
downing water and dieting now practicing gymnastics and again,

748
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:02.860
idling and neglecting everything.

749
00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:08.370
And sometimes spending his time as though he were occupied with philosophizing.

750
00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:13.300
Often he engages in politics and jumping up says,

751
00:36:13.301 --> 00:36:16.030
and does whatever chances to come to his mind.

752
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.120
And if he ever admires any soldiers,

753
00:36:19.121 --> 00:36:20.380
he turns in that direction.

754
00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:22.240
And if an end,

755
00:36:22.241 --> 00:36:24.160
if moneymakers in that one,

756
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:28.570
and there is neither order nor necessity in this life,

757
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.610
but calling this life sweet,

758
00:36:30.611 --> 00:36:31.900
free and blessed,

759
00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:33.700
he follows it throughout

760
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:38.560
is that is that image of life at all familiar to us?

761
00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:39.993
Uh,

762
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:41.830
doing anything you like?

763
00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:42.581
Uh,

764
00:36:42.581 --> 00:36:47.581
it seems to be the opposite of the platonic understanding of justice as each one

765
00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:54.060
doing a special function or fulfilling or are doing a special craft.

766
00:36:56.020 --> 00:37:01.020
Just doing whatever you like and calling that sweet free and blessed throughout

767
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:08.380
this account should be instantly recognizable as the state of modern democracy

768
00:37:09.141 --> 00:37:13.230
in some ways and they're there exists is Plato and Socrates clearly understand

769
00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:18.231
the very real and tendency within democracy to identify the good human being,

770
00:37:20.181 --> 00:37:23.360
the good man with you might say the good sport,

771
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:25.160
the regular guy,

772
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:27.260
the cooperative fellow,

773
00:37:27.261 --> 00:37:32.261
you know someone who goes along and gets along with others by educating citizens

774
00:37:32.751 --> 00:37:35.420
to cooperate with each other in a friendly manner.

775
00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:37.490
Democracies same,

776
00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.830
so Plato is suggesting a,

777
00:37:39.831 --> 00:37:44.831
they stand in danger of devaluing people who are prepared to stand alone of

778
00:37:46.371 --> 00:37:51.371
rugged individualists who will go down with the ship if need be.

779
00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.280
It is precisely this kind of creeping conformism.

780
00:37:58.281 --> 00:38:03.281
This kind of easy going toleration is sort of soft nihilism that democracies

781
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:08.180
tend to foster and which not only Plato,

782
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:13.600
but modern thinkers like Emerson and Tocqueville and mill John Stuart Mill,

783
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.500
very much warned about

784
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:22.030
what bothers Socrates most about our democracy is a certain kind of instability.

785
00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:28.120
Its tendency to be pulled between extremes of anarchy between lawlessness and

786
00:38:31.041 --> 00:38:31.874
tyranny.

787
00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:32.650
It is this,

788
00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:34.660
it is in this section of the Republican Adyen.

789
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.650
Manchus asks,

790
00:38:35.651 --> 00:38:36.460
won't we?

791
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.320
Won't we with escalas say,

792
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.570
say whatever comes to our lips,

793
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.150
what we say with Escalas,

794
00:38:43.151 --> 00:38:44.560
whatever comes to our lips.

795
00:38:44.561 --> 00:38:49.561
The idea of having the liberty to say whatever comes to our lips sounds to Plato

796
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.290
like a kind of blasphemy.

797
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.690
The view that nothing is shameful,

798
00:38:55.691 --> 00:38:56.170
that ev,

799
00:38:56.170 --> 00:39:00.880
everything should be permitted to say whatever comes to our lips.

800
00:39:00.881 --> 00:39:05.881
There was a kind of license that comes from the denial of any restraints on our

801
00:39:06.461 --> 00:39:11.461
desires or kind of relativistic belief that our desires are equal and all should

802
00:39:12.701 --> 00:39:13.720
be permitted.

803
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.620
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

804
00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:16.910
<v 0>Plato's view some democracy.</v>

805
00:39:16.911 --> 00:39:18.980
We're not all negative to be sure.

806
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:22.790
He wasn't only a critic of democracy.

807
00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:28.340
It was after all a democracy that produced Socrates and allowed him to

808
00:39:28.341 --> 00:39:32.030
philosophize freely until his 70th year.

809
00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:36.560
Would this have been permitted in any other city of the ancient world and he

810
00:39:36.561 --> 00:39:41.561
surely would not be allowed to philosophize in many cities and countries today.

811
00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.230
<v 2>Okay.</v>

812
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:48.970
<v 0>You remember the letter that Plato wrote near the end of his life when he</v>

813
00:39:48.971 --> 00:39:53.680
compares the democracy to a golden age,

814
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:59.160
at least in comparison to what went after Plato here seems to agree with Winston

815
00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:05.010
Churchill that democracy is the worst regime except for all the others.

816
00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.213
<v 2>Okay.</v>

817
00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:11.771
<v 0>So worst,</v>

818
00:40:11.771 --> 00:40:14.090
it's been tried except for everything else.

819
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:16.261
So what is,

820
00:40:16.261 --> 00:40:19.020
what is the function of colonialists this perfect,

821
00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.010
this beautiful city?

822
00:40:20.011 --> 00:40:20.430
What,

823
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:21.840
what purpose does it serve?

824
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.000
The philosopher King,

825
00:40:24.001 --> 00:40:24.541
he tells us,

826
00:40:24.541 --> 00:40:28.140
may be an object of hope or wish,

827
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:33.120
but Plato realizes that this possibility is not really to be expected

828
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:40.160
if the philosophic city is introduced as a metaphor to help us understand the

829
00:40:40.321 --> 00:40:42.120
education of the soul.

830
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:46.800
The reform of politics may not be within our power,

831
00:40:46.801 --> 00:40:51.801
but the exercise of self control always is the first responsibility of the

832
00:40:52.471 --> 00:40:57.471
individual who wishes to engage in political reform is to reform themselves

833
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:03.140
or reform seems to begin at home.

834
00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.310
And we all see this,

835
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.760
uh,

836
00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.760
very vividly when we look at so many politicians today and public Scholes who

837
00:41:14.511 --> 00:41:15.650
teach us and how,

838
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:20.360
who are hectoring us about living a certain way of life,

839
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:23.840
living a certain living according to their lights.

840
00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:24.360
Uh,

841
00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.150
and then we will find out of course,

842
00:41:26.151 --> 00:41:28.460
something very shameful about them.

843
00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.110
I won't you,

844
00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:30.480
I,

845
00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.110
I'm thinking of a couple of,

846
00:41:32.111 --> 00:41:34.030
of people in particular won't mention any,

847
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:34.960
any names in the,

848
00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:35.990
in the public sphere.

849
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:39.150
Plato's judgment seems to be you,

850
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:42.740
you need to reform yourself before you can,

851
00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:43.550
uh,

852
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:44.840
think about reforming,

853
00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:45.291
uh,

854
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:46.124
others.

855
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:47.810
Uh,

856
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:52.700
this is a point that is often lost in the republic that it is first of all,

857
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:53.031
uh,

858
00:41:53.031 --> 00:41:55.520
work on the reform of the soul.

859
00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:00.830
That is not to say at all that it teaches withdrawal from political

860
00:42:00.831 --> 00:42:01.880
responsibilities.

861
00:42:01.881 --> 00:42:04.220
It does not philosophy.

862
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:07.820
And certainly Socratic philosophy requires friends,

863
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:09.110
comrades,

864
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:10.340
conversations.

865
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.000
It is not something that can simply be pursued in isolation.

866
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:18.470
Socrates understands that those who want to reform others must reform

867
00:42:18.471 --> 00:42:19.304
themselves,

868
00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:23.570
but many who've tried to imitate him have been less careful.

869
00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:29.000
It is easy to confuse as many people have done.

870
00:42:29.001 --> 00:42:31.730
The Republic with a recipe for tyranny,

871
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:34.550
the 20th century,

872
00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.950
and even the beginnings of our own,

873
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:38.150
uh,

874
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:43.040
is littered with the corpses of those who have set themselves up as philosopher,

875
00:42:43.041 --> 00:42:43.874
kings,

876
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:44.833
Lenin,

877
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:45.673
Stalin,

878
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.633
Hitler,

879
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:51.680
Mao Khomeini to name just some of the most obvious.

880
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.860
But these men are not philosophers.

881
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:59.630
They're professions to justice are just that.

882
00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:04.660
They are professions are pretentions expressing their vanity and their ambition

883
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:07.221
for Plato.

884
00:43:07.221 --> 00:43:09.560
Philosophy was in the first instance,

885
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:14.620
a therapy for our passions in a way of setting limits to our desires.

886
00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.760
And this is precisely the opposite of the tyrant who played oh describes as a

887
00:43:19.761 --> 00:43:24.761
person of limitless desires who lacks the most rudimentary kind of governance,

888
00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.990
namely self control.

889
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:32.120
The difference between the philosopher and the tyrant illustrate two very

890
00:43:32.121 --> 00:43:33.980
different conceptions of philosophy.

891
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:39.470
For some philosophy represents a form of liberation from confusion,

892
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:43.700
from unruly passions and prejudices from incoherence.

893
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:44.481
Again,

894
00:43:44.481 --> 00:43:49.481
a therapy of the soul that brings peace and contentment and just end to kind of

895
00:43:50.001 --> 00:43:50.834
justice.

896
00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:52.310
And yet for others,

897
00:43:52.311 --> 00:43:56.030
philosophy is the source of the desire to dominate.

898
00:43:56.650 --> 00:44:01.650
It is the basis of tyranny and the great age of ideologies through which we are

899
00:44:02.721 --> 00:44:05.300
still passing.

900
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:12.740
The question is that both tendencies or at work within philosophy,

901
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.520
and how do we encourage one side but not the other?

902
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:21.260
Is that great philosopher Karl Marx once asked,

903
00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.380
who will educate the educators?

904
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:27.410
So why is this thing he ever said?

905
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:32.640
Who will educate the educators who do turn to for help?

906
00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:37.830
There was obviously no magic solution to this question,

907
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:41.040
but the best answer I know of is Socrates.

908
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:46.050
He showed people how to live and just as importantly,

909
00:44:46.051 --> 00:44:47.550
he showed them how to die.

910
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:50.070
He lived and died.

911
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.780
Not like most people,

912
00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:53.363
but better,

913
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:58.800
and even his most vehement critics will admit to that.

914
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:02.023
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

915
00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.340
<v 0>thank you very much.</v>

916
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:06.970
I'll see you next Wednesday and we'll start Aristotle.
