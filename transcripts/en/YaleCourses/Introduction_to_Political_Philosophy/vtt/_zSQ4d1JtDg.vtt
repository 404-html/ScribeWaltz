1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.070
I want to look at two sets of issues.

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.760
I want to in a way conclude,

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.630
uh,

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.040
my interpretation,

5
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:16.041
my reading of the second treatise by focusing on the role of executive power in

6
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:18.390
Locke's theory of government,

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.120
Locke's theory of constant of the constitutional state.

8
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:26.100
What did particularly focusing on the role of the executive visa vi the

9
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:28.230
legislative branch of government.

10
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.830
And then I want you to turn a little more speculative speculatively to thinking

11
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:35.010
about lock,

12
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.820
uh,

13
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.820
and the American regime and the current state of political philosophy,

14
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.690
modern contemporary American political philosophy.

15
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.450
But let me start first by going back and sticking with the second treatise by

16
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:55.920
talking a little bit about the role of legislative and executive power.

17
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:57.510
The last time I think,

18
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.261
uh,

19
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:03.261
I was concluding by arguing that lock doesn't endorse a necessarily one

20
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:07.410
particular form of government,

21
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:08.130
uh,

22
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.060
from any other.

23
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:13.630
He is an advocate of what we have come to call limited government of,

24
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.450
of constitutional government.

25
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.480
There is that important passage where he ridicules the Hobbs' sovereign is a

26
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:24.000
lion a and tells,

27
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:24.390
uh,

28
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.711
we,

29
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:29.070
we did not enter into the social compact to be devoured by lions.

30
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:29.551
He says,

31
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:29.710
the,

32
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.941
the,

33
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:30.131
the,

34
00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:32.700
the form of government must be limited,

35
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.040
although he's relatively open or at least noncommittal agnostic,

36
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.881
you might say,

37
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:41.760
as to what particular form,

38
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.600
uh,

39
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.921
that,

40
00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:44.370
that government may take.

41
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.390
One feature of this form of government that he thinks is very important is that

42
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.340
it must in some sense,

43
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:56.220
embodying a separation of powers.

44
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:58.860
Powers must be made to check,

45
00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.340
uh,

46
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.173
one another,

47
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.780
uh,

48
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.640
what he calls in the book,

49
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.210
uh,

50
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.640
the subordination of powers.

51
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:07.980
This is locks doctrine and you will see it there.

52
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:12.981
We often associated with mom to secure or sometimes with the federalist authors,

53
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.420
but in fact lock himself,

54
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.900
uh,

55
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.900
is a strong advocate of what he calls the subordination or separation of powers.

56
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.350
Uh,

57
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.350
not exactly the same as we will see between our understanding of executive

58
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:31.110
legislature should legislative and judicial,

59
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.290
but nevertheless a separation nonetheless.

60
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.043
Uh,

61
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.961
however,

62
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:40.860
in the first instance a lock emphasizes and in fact,

63
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:42.840
he continually affirms,

64
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.590
uh,

65
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.590
nevertheless the primacy of legislative authority in England,

66
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.510
in the England of his time.

67
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:52.410
And even today,

68
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:54.270
that means a doctrine of what,

69
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.240
what is called parliamentary supremacy.

70
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.080
But he says that the first and fundamental positive law of all constitutions is

71
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:08.770
in establishing that of the legislative power.

72
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.910
Uh,

73
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.960
the first act after the completion of this social contract,

74
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:14.351
he says,

75
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:16.720
is establishing the legislative power.

76
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:21.721
It is the law making authority of government that is supreme.

77
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.541
Uh,

78
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:26.530
he wishes to emphasize this seems to push lock,

79
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.650
you might say more in the small d democratic direction.

80
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:34.150
It is not so much executive power,

81
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:35.650
the power of a prince,

82
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.581
uh,

83
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:38.830
but rather the legislature,

84
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:41.920
the parliament that is a supreme,

85
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.850
there is nothing more important in Locke's theory of constitutional government

86
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:53.041
in the existence of what he continually refers to as settled or known laws,

87
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.710
settled laws that serve against a arbitrary rule.

88
00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.793
In many ways,

89
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.920
the purpose of government for Locke is much less to offset the dangers of

90
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:11.341
returning to an anarchic state of nature is it was for Hobbs then to prevent the

91
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:17.701
possibility of the emergence of tyrannical despotic power to radical or despotic

92
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:21.034
sovereign.

93
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.941
And of course,

94
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:22.361
locks.

95
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:27.361
Writing is very much bound up with the big and major constitutional crisis of

96
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:28.600
his,

97
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.770
of his time leading,

98
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.400
leading,

99
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.400
leading to the overthrow and expulsion of the King James the second.

100
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.700
Yet in many ways,

101
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:44.260
even though lock is the great advocate of legislative supremacy,

102
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:49.261
he obviously cannot and does not wish to dispense all together with the role of

103
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:51.490
executive power.

104
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.000
He often treats the executive,

105
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:57.700
whether that be in the form of a prince of monarch,

106
00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.960
uh,

107
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.320
or even perhaps even a body and uh,

108
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.910
uh,

109
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:02.600
uh,

110
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.660
a cabinet of,

111
00:05:03.661 --> 00:05:06.100
of office chief officers as it were.

112
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:11.101
He treats them often simply as if they were an agent of the legislative or of

113
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:12.790
the legislature.

114
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:17.740
The purpose of the executive he sometimes seems to write is merely that of

115
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:21.970
carrying out the will of the legislature in locks language.

116
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:26.971
The executive power is ministerial and subordinate to the legislature.

117
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.160
Section one 53,

118
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:32.260
I believe the executive,

119
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.011
again,

120
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:37.660
on some aspects of locks writing seems to be little more than a cipher,

121
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.790
uh,

122
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.600
in comparison to the doctrine of legislative supremacy.

123
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.880
And yet lock here is not all together consistent.

124
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:53.180
One has to say because he understands in every community,

125
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.643
<v 1>okay,</v>

126
00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.220
<v 0>there is a need for a distinctive of government dealing with matters of war and</v>

127
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:02.114
peace.

128
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.270
Lock calls this the federative power.

129
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.230
Every community he says like Hobbs is to every other community what every

130
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:17.141
individual is to every other individual in a state of nature and a distinctive

131
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.710
federative or war,

132
00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:24.711
making power within the government is necessary for dealing with matters of

133
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:26.210
international conflict,

134
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:31.211
conflict between states and in a remarkable passage lock notes that this power

135
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:35.840
he says cannot be bound by antecedent,

136
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:37.880
standing positive laws,

137
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.450
but it must be left to quote the prudence and wisdom of those whose hands it is

138
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:46.670
in to be managed for the public good.

139
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.043
In other words,

140
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.050
lock seems to suggest that this particular kind of this branch of government,

141
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.640
uh,

142
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.220
this federative branch,

143
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:57.860
which falls to some degree under the executive,

144
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.250
must have a certain latitude even apart from the law that realize he says on the

145
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:07.040
prudence and wisdom of those whose hands it is,

146
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.100
it is in to manage it for the public good.

147
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.940
In other words,

148
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:16.270
matters of war and peace cannot be left to the legislature or to standing laws

149
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.340
as he calls them alone,

150
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:23.750
but requires the intervention of strong leaders.

151
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.400
What he calls in an absolutely stunning passage.

152
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.030
God did like princes section.

153
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.020
If you don't believe me,

154
00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:36.980
section one 66 locks reference here to God.

155
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:41.981
Like princess seems to recall Machiavelli in many ways.

156
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:45.680
Machiavelli's talk of armed profits.

157
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.473
Uh,

158
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.750
it is necessary in extreme situations for such princes to call on their

159
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.150
prerogative power.

160
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.810
It isn't,

161
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.810
it is impossible lock rights to foresee and so by laws to provide for all the

162
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:07.211
accidents and necessities that might make concern the public and that during,

163
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.373
in other words,

164
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.380
contingencies or emergency situations,

165
00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:17.381
the executive must be empowered with this prerogative power to act for the good

166
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.180
of the community.

167
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.981
For this reason,

168
00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:26.981
it seems the executive is not simply a tool or an agent of the legislature,

169
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.270
but he says again,

170
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:32.930
must have the power to act according to discretion.

171
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.930
That is to say according to his own discretion,

172
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.370
for the public good,

173
00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:39.800
without the prescription of law.

174
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.260
Those are locks own words,

175
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.100
how to balance this.

176
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.940
His argument for constitutional government and legislative supremacy with this

177
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:54.941
doctrine of prerogative power and what seems to be a kind of a power of God,

178
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.170
what he calls in no uncertain terms,

179
00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:03.171
the godlike princes and their need to exercise this power locks prerogative is

180
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:10.911
in many ways the result of simply the inability of law to foresee all possible

181
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:13.590
circumstances,

182
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:15.330
all possible contingencies.

183
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.600
That's an argument that goes as far back as Aristotle.

184
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:23.601
We've seen our inability to make rules that can apply to all possible events,

185
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.640
makes it necessary to leave some discretionary power in the hands of the

186
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:33.120
executive to act for the public safety locks.

187
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:33.630
One,

188
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:38.190
one of the examples that lock gives of the use of this power is in fact a

189
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:39.024
domestic,

190
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.163
not a,

191
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:40.411
uh,

192
00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:41.730
an international issue,

193
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.370
which is to say in the case of a fire,

194
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:45.000
uh,

195
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.271
in a,

196
00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:46.104
in a city,

197
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.810
it is sometimes necessary for the,

198
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.640
as he says in his day for the fire department to tear down the house of an

199
00:09:53.641 --> 00:09:54.750
innocent person,

200
00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:55.410
uh,

201
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.070
to prevent the fire from spreading to other houses.

202
00:09:59.070 --> 00:09:59.640
This is,

203
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.060
this is acting for the public good of the community.

204
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:08.210
Even while in some ways it's clearly a violation of rights of property and so

205
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:08.641
on.

206
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:13.641
He understands this is as a piece of prerogative power acting for the public

207
00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:13.861
good.

208
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:14.271
In fact,

209
00:10:14.271 --> 00:10:16.320
the example is not so far fetched.

210
00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:17.820
Think today for example,

211
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.210
about arguments we have today even in Connecticut.

212
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:21.630
Uh,

213
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.660
there's a big argument going on about the,

214
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.920
the right of what's called eminent domain,

215
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:26.651
uh,

216
00:10:26.651 --> 00:10:29.520
the right of the government to uh,

217
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.420
to uh,

218
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.470
absorb or to take over private properties.

219
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.951
Uh,

220
00:10:34.951 --> 00:10:39.951
whenever it w w you usually for things like schools or airports but also for

221
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:44.730
general improvement when it is thought it will enhance the public good.

222
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:49.590
There's a big debate going on that now out in new London and in Brooklyn also

223
00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:53.310
with the argument about the creation of some civic centers,

224
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:57.510
some sports arena that will require the demolition of certain neighborhood

225
00:10:57.511 --> 00:10:58.080
houses.

226
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.750
And there's a big debate about this eminent domain.

227
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:01.830
What is that?

228
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:07.070
But in a way locks the example of prerogative power acting,

229
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.370
doing something that is somehow said to be for the public good.

230
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:11.551
That,

231
00:11:11.551 --> 00:11:15.660
but that represents some kind of extra constitutional powered.

232
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:20.640
But the question for lock is for any constitutional lawyer is what are the

233
00:11:20.641 --> 00:11:23.040
limits of this prerogative power?

234
00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:23.910
What check,

235
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:24.390
uh,

236
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.230
if any,

237
00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:25.740
uh,

238
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.620
is there on this power to prevent their,

239
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:29.041
uh,

240
00:11:29.041 --> 00:11:29.874
abuse?

241
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.051
Well,

242
00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:34.290
lock doesn't exactly say yes.

243
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:34.680
Uh,

244
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.101
yes,

245
00:11:35.101 --> 00:11:35.401
right.

246
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:39.930
He doesn't exactly say he raises this question to be sure of fundamental

247
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.070
importance for a constitutional government.

248
00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:45.870
Does executive authority,

249
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:46.973
he asks us,

250
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.690
extend to all things even or especially in times of war.

251
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:56.870
Think about the debates that are going on now about a detainees at Guantanamo

252
00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:58.600
or,

253
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.051
uh,

254
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:04.051
the issues of domestic spying when it comes to issues of,

255
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:05.470
of the,

256
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.610
the war on terror.

257
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.180
Are these examples of prerogative power.

258
00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:15.181
That is to say the executive acting outside the limits or the bounds of

259
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.610
constitutional authority for the sake of protecting the public good.

260
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.080
Or are these,

261
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:23.830
uh,

262
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.270
examples of,

263
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.590
uh,

264
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:30.590
of kind of political absolutism is the invocation of this power in some ways

265
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:36.780
going down the slippery slope to despotism and absolutism.

266
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:41.980
I will leave it to you or your sections to try to discuss these matters,

267
00:12:41.981 --> 00:12:46.981
but lock himself praises those who he caused the wisest and best princes of

268
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:54.481
England as being those who have exercised the largest prerogative,

269
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:55.541
uh,

270
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:57.250
on behalf of the public good.

271
00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:57.641
This,

272
00:12:57.641 --> 00:13:02.080
this is beginning to sound more and more in some respects like Machiavelli,

273
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.980
then the advocate of,

274
00:13:03.981 --> 00:13:04.601
of again,

275
00:13:04.601 --> 00:13:06.010
limit limited government.

276
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.690
Some this,

277
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.580
this power comes into play.

278
00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:10.061
He says,

279
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:15.061
especially during times of national crisis or emergency,

280
00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.300
uh,

281
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.520
when it is necessary to act,

282
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:19.210
uh,

283
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.370
for the public safety.

284
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:21.910
Uh,

285
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:22.743
in some ways,

286
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:23.381
and again,

287
00:13:23.381 --> 00:13:28.381
this seems to have special resonance for us today as we face issues like states

288
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:32.560
of emergency states of exception.

289
00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:35.980
There are in fact political theorists,

290
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.370
uh,

291
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.860
one name comes to mind,

292
00:13:37.861 --> 00:13:39.760
a 20th century German,

293
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.270
a legal philosopher by the name of Carl Schmitt,

294
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.170
uh,

295
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:49.170
who argued that the state of emergency or the exceptional,

296
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.080
uh,

297
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.070
situation,

298
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.521
uh,

299
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:54.130
is the essence of politics,

300
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:54.580
uh,

301
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:59.580
and that the person or body who has the power to declare the exception is none

302
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:02.530
other than the sovereign.

303
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.330
So from Schmidt's point of view,

304
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.343
you might say,

305
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:05.890
ah,

306
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:10.890
this isn't this idea of prerogative as a kind of extra constitutional power that

307
00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:16.051
the statesman must of necessity utilize when ordinary constitutional operations

308
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.060
like the rule of law,

309
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:19.660
uh,

310
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.820
prove to be inadequate.

311
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.410
But consider another example,

312
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:32.610
if you like that prerogative power about prerogative powers may be granted by

313
00:14:34.091 --> 00:14:35.110
the constitution.

314
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:41.080
Consider Lincoln's famous suspension of Habeas Corpus during,

315
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.220
during the civil war.

316
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:48.660
Lincoln interestingly did not take this extraordinary step by appealing to an

317
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.900
extra constitutional power that obtains in times of crisis.

318
00:14:55.491 --> 00:15:00.491
Rather Lincoln argued quite forcefully that this sort of prerogative power is

319
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:07.001
already deeply embedded within the structure of constitutional government.

320
00:15:07.971 --> 00:15:10.130
He cites the constitution when it,

321
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.280
when it came to the,

322
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.910
to the suspension of Habeas Corpus.

323
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.380
The constitution rights,

324
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:20.381
the privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended unless when

325
00:15:21.051 --> 00:15:21.230
it,

326
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.590
when in cases of rebellion or invasion,

327
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.990
the public safety requires it.

328
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.031
In other words,

329
00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:34.031
the constitution itself seems to allow for this extraordinary kind of action,

330
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.170
at least in cases of rebellion or invasion.

331
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:40.483
When he says,

332
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:43.310
when it says the public safety requires it,

333
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:49.010
the constitution seems to embody within itself our constitution,

334
00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:54.011
that is this Lockian power of prerogative that comes into effect or can be

335
00:15:56.241 --> 00:16:01.241
legitimately exercised in times of rebellion or invasion.

336
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.780
Are we living in that kind of age now?

337
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.460
Not rebellion perhaps,

338
00:16:07.461 --> 00:16:08.300
but invasion.

339
00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:09.250
Well think,

340
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:10.580
think about that again.

341
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:11.690
Uh,

342
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.800
are these arguments applicable to uh,

343
00:16:15.801 --> 00:16:16.510
our,

344
00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:16.811
our,

345
00:16:16.811 --> 00:16:21.811
our situation today in some sense when it comes to debates about the extent of

346
00:16:22.791 --> 00:16:27.791
executive power to embark on these extraordinary measures

347
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:37.630
and yet at the same time lock is aware clearly of the abuse of these kinds of,

348
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.420
or the potential abuse of this kind of prerogative.

349
00:16:41.421 --> 00:16:43.130
He asks who will judge,

350
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.880
who can judge whether the discretion of the executive is being used for the

351
00:16:49.281 --> 00:16:51.740
public safety or the public good,

352
00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:56.090
or whether it is simply a kind of usurpation of power,

353
00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:57.980
uh,

354
00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.980
in these moments of high constitutional crisis between conflicting powers of

355
00:17:04.551 --> 00:17:05.384
government.

356
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.740
In such cases,

357
00:17:06.741 --> 00:17:10.490
Locke says there shall be no judge on earth.

358
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.601
He says,

359
00:17:11.601 --> 00:17:14.750
the people have no other remedy in this,

360
00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:16.280
but to appeal to heaven,

361
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.310
this is intersection one 68.

362
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:24.440
How much is contained in that term appeal to heaven?

363
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:29.960
What does lock main in terms of high constitutional crisis,

364
00:17:29.961 --> 00:17:32.240
when he says there is no judge on earth,

365
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.760
the people must appeal to heaven.

366
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:39.530
Does that mean they should fall down on their knees and and begin to pray,

367
00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:40.250
uh,

368
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.360
what they should do?

369
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.063
Uh,

370
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.963
unlikely.

371
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:45.620
Uh,

372
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:50.620
by an appeal to heaven lock means the people's right to dissolve their

373
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:54.384
government.

374
00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:00.410
He raises this question at the very end of the book when a conflict between the

375
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:05.421
people or their representatives and the executive becomes so great,

376
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:06.240
uh,

377
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.890
that the very conditions of social trust have been dissolved,

378
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.090
who will be judged and he answers emphatically the people,

379
00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:15.690
uh,

380
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:16.860
will be judged.

381
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.480
Lock affirms here,

382
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:18.781
uh,

383
00:18:18.781 --> 00:18:23.781
right of revolution and appeal to heaven or what he calls an appeal to heaven

384
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.980
really refers to an appeal to arms,

385
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:34.440
to rebellion and the need to create a new social covenant

386
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:37.550
lock.

387
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:42.550
You can see is attempting to hold together a belief in the sanctity of law and

388
00:18:44.421 --> 00:18:49.421
the necessity for prerogative that may sometimes have to circumvent the rules of

389
00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:50.480
law.

390
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.360
Are these two doctrines incompatible?

391
00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.050
Uh,

392
00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.610
I think in many respects,

393
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.200
or at least in some respects,

394
00:18:57.201 --> 00:18:58.034
they are,

395
00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:58.730
uh,

396
00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:03.730
can the prerogative power of the executive be in a way constitutionalized so

397
00:19:03.741 --> 00:19:08.741
that it does not threaten the liberty of its own citizens lock alerts us to this

398
00:19:10.551 --> 00:19:14.420
timeless as well as this very timely problem.

399
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:15.350
Uh,

400
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:20.350
one of the best sources for thinking about many of these constitutional issues

401
00:19:21.981 --> 00:19:22.814
today,

402
00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:23.120
uh,

403
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:28.120
regarding privacy rights and other kinds of citizen rights,

404
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:29.060
uh,

405
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.110
can be found in,

406
00:19:30.111 --> 00:19:30.261
oh,

407
00:19:30.261 --> 00:19:34.580
I would say the last five chapters or so of Locke's second treatise,

408
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.890
I can't think of a better source.

409
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.051
So when the end,

410
00:19:42.051 --> 00:19:47.000
the locks appeal to heaven or Locke says that the people have an appeal to

411
00:19:47.001 --> 00:19:47.720
heaven,

412
00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:52.720
that is to say an appeal to arms and appeal to revolution suggests that at the

413
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.231
end of the day,

414
00:19:54.231 --> 00:19:57.290
lock was a revolutionary.

415
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.270
But I would say also a sort of cautious and moderate one,

416
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.420
if this is not a complete contradiction in terms

417
00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.193
<v 1>I won't</v>

418
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.130
<v 0>go through chapter 19.</v>

419
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.200
Famous chapter on Revolution in fall,

420
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:15.010
uh,

421
00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.820
to talk about the conditions under which he,

422
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.940
he believed that people have,

423
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.740
can rightfully appeal to heaven as it were,

424
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:24.811
but locks,

425
00:20:24.811 --> 00:20:29.220
doctrine of consent and legislative supremacy.

426
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:34.250
This should make him in many ways a hero to Democrats,

427
00:20:34.381 --> 00:20:35.880
to radical Democrats.

428
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.800
His beliefs about limited government,

429
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.790
the rights of property should make him a hero too in some ways.

430
00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:44.910
Constitutional Conservatives and even libertarians.

431
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:46.853
And the end,

432
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.690
I think Locke was neither or both.

433
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:50.970
Uh,

434
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:54.280
like all of the great thinkers in some ways he defines,

435
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.360
he defies,

436
00:20:55.361 --> 00:20:55.961
excuse me,

437
00:20:55.961 --> 00:20:58.360
simple a classification,

438
00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:03.361
but there is no doubt that lock and gave the modern constitutional state.

439
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:08.560
It's definitive form of expression and the problems of our state,

440
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.580
the problems,

441
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.391
the legal,

442
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:15.391
the constitutional and political problems that we experience are very much

443
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.120
problems rooted in the philosophy of John Locke and are unthinkable without the

444
00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:22.810
influence of lock.

445
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:27.190
So that takes me to a theme that I want to talk about for a little while,

446
00:21:27.191 --> 00:21:28.540
which is locks America,

447
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.060
John Locke's America,

448
00:21:31.061 --> 00:21:31.900
no one who,

449
00:21:31.901 --> 00:21:34.030
who reads lock even superficially.

450
00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:38.860
And I would not accuse anyone here of being a superficial reader after all,

451
00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:42.160
but no one can be fail to be impressed,

452
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:42.761
uh,

453
00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:43.594
of the,

454
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.280
uh,

455
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.280
harmony in many ways between Locke's writings and those of the American republic

456
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:56.220
that he helped to found his conception of natural law rights,

457
00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.760
government by consent,

458
00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:00.130
the right to revolution and all are,

459
00:22:00.131 --> 00:22:04.150
are part of the cornerstone of our founding documents.

460
00:22:04.151 --> 00:22:05.290
Just some degree,

461
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:05.780
uh,

462
00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.180
as I've just been suggesting,

463
00:22:07.181 --> 00:22:12.181
a judgment on America is very much a judgment on the philosophy of Locke and,

464
00:22:13.211 --> 00:22:13.570
and,

465
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:14.680
and vice versa.

466
00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:15.431
Uh,

467
00:22:15.431 --> 00:22:19.510
in many ways to the IX or if anyone is,

468
00:22:19.511 --> 00:22:24.511
I think Locke has the title to be considered America's philosopher king.

469
00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:27.430
So shot.

470
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.200
So how should we think of lock,

471
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:29.890
uh,

472
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:34.890
after more or less three centuries of consistent Locky and rule?

473
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:35.710
Uh,

474
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:37.030
how should we think of Loc

475
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.670
for many years?

476
00:22:39.671 --> 00:22:40.870
And for many people,

477
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.530
uh,

478
00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:42.251
even today,

479
00:22:42.251 --> 00:22:43.084
the affinity,

480
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.950
the affiliation between lock in America has been regarded in a largely,

481
00:22:47.951 --> 00:22:52.951
although not wholly and largely positive light for many historians and political

482
00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:58.330
theorists or stability or system of limited government.

483
00:22:58.331 --> 00:23:03.331
Our market economy has been the result of a sort of broad consensus over Locky

484
00:23:05.861 --> 00:23:06.880
and principles

485
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.990
over locking in first principles.

486
00:23:10.991 --> 00:23:13.540
But for many other readers of the,

487
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.980
of American history,

488
00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:20.490
this relationship has been seen as more problematic in the 1950s,

489
00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.040
uh,

490
00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.980
a book written by a famous,

491
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.833
uh,

492
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:27.700
political theorist and historian named Louis Hartz,

493
00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:33.780
a book called the liberal tradition in America complained of Americas,

494
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.240
what he called irrational Lockey aneurysm that was hearts is line that was hard

495
00:23:39.821 --> 00:23:40.361
to just quote,

496
00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:45.361
are irrational Locky and his and by which he meant a kind of closed commitment,

497
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:46.640
uh,

498
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.640
to locking and principles and ideals that shut off all other political

499
00:23:52.371 --> 00:23:54.080
alternatives and possibilities.

500
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.710
Hearts was someone very much interested in the question,

501
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.320
as is many political theorists have been since,

502
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:00.980
ah,

503
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.740
why has there been no socialism in America?

504
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:09.190
Why did America not evolve or develop along European lines with social

505
00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:10.760
democratic parties?

506
00:24:10.761 --> 00:24:14.690
And Socialist parties like the English Labor Party and other,

507
00:24:14.691 --> 00:24:16.740
other kinds of labor movements and,

508
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:17.420
and hearts.

509
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:22.420
His argument was that we were sort of arrested in this Locky and phase of

510
00:24:22.431 --> 00:24:23.061
development,

511
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:26.840
what he called are irrational Lockey aneurysm that closed off,

512
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:27.470
uh,

513
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.670
in many ways other,

514
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.840
other principals and for still other thinkers,

515
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.950
uh,

516
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:35.690
more or less on the left,

517
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.320
uh,

518
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:36.831
lock,

519
00:24:36.831 --> 00:24:40.100
legitimized what was called a kind of theory of,

520
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.580
or an ethic of what was called possessive individualism,

521
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
particularly locks focused on property and the rights of private property that

522
00:24:49.011 --> 00:24:49.820
makes,

523
00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:50.211
uh,

524
00:24:50.211 --> 00:24:51.770
that focuses entirely,

525
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:52.251
uh,

526
00:24:52.251 --> 00:24:57.251
on market relations or puts the market values ahead of all other things and for

527
00:24:58.971 --> 00:24:59.810
still others.

528
00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:00.351
Uh,

529
00:25:00.351 --> 00:25:04.430
in many ways more recently thinkers have a more assertive communitarian

530
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.320
direction or bent,

531
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.040
uh,

532
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:07.551
locks,

533
00:25:07.551 --> 00:25:12.380
emphasis upon rights and the protection that government should protect natural,

534
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:12.790
uh,

535
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.760
or certain unalienable rights suggests a purely or,

536
00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:21.790
or overly legalistic conception of politics that has no language for talking

537
00:25:22.911 --> 00:25:24.470
about the common good,

538
00:25:24.471 --> 00:25:28.880
the public good or other sort of collective goods or benefits.

539
00:25:28.881 --> 00:25:33.470
So my point is that locks influence has not been all together,

540
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.311
uh,

541
00:25:34.311 --> 00:25:36.410
accepted by everyone.

542
00:25:36.411 --> 00:25:36.830
There is,

543
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:40.820
there has been much ground for criticism of this offense,

544
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:45.350
this peculiar affinity between Locky and Islam in America.

545
00:25:45.351 --> 00:25:50.090
But today I would say that Locke's theory of liberalism or Locke's theory of

546
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:50.630
limited,

547
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:54.410
limited government constitutional government is confronted by another

548
00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:59.620
alternative that in many ways has deep roots in the very tradition which lock

549
00:26:00.561 --> 00:26:01.394
himself,

550
00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:02.120
uh,

551
00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.990
the very liberal tradition in many ways with which lock himself is the founder.

552
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:11.290
And I am referring in particular to a book that many of you will read at some

553
00:26:11.451 --> 00:26:13.220
point in your Yale experience.

554
00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:13.600
Uh,

555
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.091
a book,

556
00:26:14.091 --> 00:26:16.820
a widely read and widely acclaimed book by uh,

557
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.770
a recently deceased,

558
00:26:18.771 --> 00:26:21.800
a political philosopher by the name of John Rawls,

559
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:26.180
who wrote a book in 1973 called a theory of justice

560
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:28.611
in many ways,

561
00:26:28.611 --> 00:26:29.241
Rawls.

562
00:26:29.241 --> 00:26:33.170
His book was an attempt to update,

563
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.160
uh,

564
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.740
the liberal theory of the state.

565
00:26:36.741 --> 00:26:41.741
He invokes the idea of a state of nature in original condition is he calls it a

566
00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:43.560
theory of rights,

567
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:48.030
although he does so in many ways through the techniques of contemporary

568
00:26:48.031 --> 00:26:50.310
philosophy and end game theory.

569
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.670
And Ross's book is probably the most single,

570
00:26:53.671 --> 00:26:58.671
most important contribution to Anglo American political philosophy in the last

571
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:00.061
generation.

572
00:27:00.061 --> 00:27:03.510
It is a book that situates itself within the liberal tradition,

573
00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:04.590
beginning with Loc,

574
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:08.640
developed by people like Emmanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill,

575
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.160
and which Raul's himself hope too,

576
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.180
in many ways,

577
00:27:12.181 --> 00:27:13.950
bring to completion,

578
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:14.430
uh,

579
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:19.430
in his book a theory of Justice as he calls it stands or falls on its theory of

580
00:27:19.621 --> 00:27:22.350
rights from which all else is derived.

581
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:25.530
And what I want to do for a few minutes is to contrast,

582
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:26.723
uh,

583
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:28.890
Roz's general theory,

584
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:29.461
uh,

585
00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:34.461
so powerful and influential today from that of John Locke's the original founder

586
00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:39.480
of the liberal theory of the state and see how this,

587
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.740
how they have diverged.

588
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.650
Consider the following propositions,

589
00:27:43.651 --> 00:27:44.484
if you will.

590
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.290
Here is John Locke.

591
00:27:46.291 --> 00:27:48.390
Section 27 of the second treatise.

592
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.450
Every man has property in his own person.

593
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.260
This nobody has any right to but himself.

594
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.920
And where there is property,

595
00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:57.391
he writes,

596
00:27:57.391 --> 00:27:59.790
there can be justice and injustice.

597
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:01.843
<v 1>Okay,</v>

598
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.370
<v 0>here is John Rawls.</v>

599
00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:04.720
Uh,

600
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.060
one of the opening pages of this theory of justice.

601
00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:12.090
Each person Rawls rights possesses an inviolability founded unjustice that even

602
00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:17.791
the welfare of society as a whole cannot override for this reason.

603
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.750
He continues justice,

604
00:28:19.751 --> 00:28:24.751
denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared

605
00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:27.363
to others.

606
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:28.180
Okay,

607
00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.830
so far so good.

608
00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:30.641
In other words,

609
00:28:30.641 --> 00:28:33.130
both of them present their theories of justice,

610
00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:34.880
uh,

611
00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.370
as justified in terms of the liberal principles of equality,

612
00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:44.490
freedom and the sanctity of the individual and individual rights both regard the

613
00:28:46.331 --> 00:28:51.331
purpose of government in many ways is securing the conditions of justice is

614
00:28:52.211 --> 00:28:56.890
deriving from the consent or the informed consent of the governed,

615
00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.753
but both,

616
00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:02.910
it seems to me go onto differ profoundly about the source of rights and

617
00:29:04.211 --> 00:29:09.211
therefore the role that government has in securing the conditions of justice.

618
00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.730
Let me explain a little bit more what I mean

619
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.143
for Loc.

620
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:22.450
Going back to chapter five of the second treatise rights derive from a theory of

621
00:29:23.601 --> 00:29:24.680
self ownership.

622
00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.290
According to his view,

623
00:29:27.291 --> 00:29:28.580
you will remember right,

624
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:32.900
everybody has a property in his or her own person.

625
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:37.930
That is to say no one has a claim on our bodies other than ourselves.

626
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:44.830
It is on the rock of self ownership fact that we have property in ourselves.

627
00:29:46.061 --> 00:29:48.070
It just when the rock of self ownership,

628
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.850
that lock builds his edifice of natural rights,

629
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.620
justice in limited government.

630
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.260
To put it in a slightly different way,

631
00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:59.380
perhaps a person has an identity,

632
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.160
what we might call today a moral what we,

633
00:30:02.161 --> 00:30:07.150
we have moral personality or an identity by the fact that we alone are

634
00:30:07.151 --> 00:30:09.730
responsible for making ourselves.

635
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.070
He uses this metaphor of the work of the body and the Labor of our hands,

636
00:30:15.071 --> 00:30:18.190
but we are literally the products of our own making.

637
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:23.520
We create ourselves through our activity and our most characteristic activity is

638
00:30:24.971 --> 00:30:27.580
our work locks.

639
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:32.850
Fundamental doctrine is that the world is the product of our own free

640
00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.360
creativity,

641
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.210
not nature but the self.

642
00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:41.860
The individual is the source of all value for lock.

643
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.360
It is this self,

644
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.190
the I the me,

645
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:46.781
the ego.

646
00:30:46.781 --> 00:30:51.781
That is the unique source of rights and the task of government is to con is to

647
00:30:51.951 --> 00:30:56.951
secure the conditions of our property in the broadest sense of the term,

648
00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:01.150
namely everything that is proper to us.

649
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:07.150
Now using that as a sort of shorthand.

650
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:08.873
Uh,

651
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.070
contrast this to Rose's idea.

652
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:16.480
Rawls adds to his idea of justice.

653
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.870
Something that he calls the difference principle,

654
00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:27.230
the deep he is it sometimes referred to in the literature on,

655
00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:28.220
on Rawls.

656
00:31:28.221 --> 00:31:29.660
What is the difference principle,

657
00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:35.540
this principle maintains that are natural endowments,

658
00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:37.130
our talents,

659
00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.120
our abilities,

660
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.010
our family backgrounds,

661
00:31:40.011 --> 00:31:40.970
our history,

662
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.280
our unique history is our place,

663
00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.511
so to speak,

664
00:31:44.511 --> 00:31:46.040
in the social hierarchy.

665
00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:49.460
All of these things are from a moral point of view,

666
00:31:49.461 --> 00:31:51.170
something completely arbitrary.

667
00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:57.320
None of these are ours in any strong sense of the term.

668
00:31:57.321 --> 00:31:59.210
They do not belong to us,

669
00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:04.870
but are the result of a more or less kind of random or arbitrary genetic lottery

670
00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:08.780
or social lottery of which I,

671
00:32:08.781 --> 00:32:12.620
or you happen to be the unique beneficiaries.

672
00:32:12.621 --> 00:32:14.300
The result of this,

673
00:32:14.301 --> 00:32:14.991
in other words,

674
00:32:14.991 --> 00:32:18.140
is that no longer can I be regarded,

675
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:23.470
is the sole proprietor of my assets are the unique recipient of the advantages

676
00:32:26.091 --> 00:32:29.960
or disadvantages I may accrue from them.

677
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.823
Fortune,

678
00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:31.693
luck,

679
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.720
Machiavellian Fortuna,

680
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:36.170
and that way is utterly arbitrary.

681
00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:36.820
Uh,

682
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.440
and therefore Rawls concludes,

683
00:32:39.441 --> 00:32:42.020
I should not be regarded as the possessor,

684
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:46.010
but merely the recipient of what talents,

685
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.060
capacities,

686
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.730
and abilities that I may again,

687
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.550
purely arbitrarily happen to possess.

688
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:58.540
So what does that mean in terms of social policy or theory of government?

689
00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:06.720
The result of Rawls is difference principle and its fundamental difference with

690
00:33:07.571 --> 00:33:12.571
that of John Locke could not be more striking from this point of view.

691
00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

692
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:17.720
<v 0>The locking in theory of Justice broadly speaking,</v>

693
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.400
supports a meritocracy,

694
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.570
uh,

695
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:24.620
sometimes referred to as a quality is equality of opportunity.

696
00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:29.650
That is what a person does with his or her natural assets belongs exclusively to

697
00:33:30.891 --> 00:33:31.724
them.

698
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.830
The right to rise or fall,

699
00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:34.480
uh,

700
00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.440
belongs exclusively to them.

701
00:33:36.441 --> 00:33:41.441
No one has the moral right to interfere with the products of our labor,

702
00:33:42.231 --> 00:33:43.610
the products of which,

703
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:48.440
which may also include not just in a primitive sense what we do with our hands

704
00:33:48.441 --> 00:33:49.071
and bodies,

705
00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:51.270
but what we do with our endowment,

706
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.740
with our intelligence and our natural endowments.

707
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

708
00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:56.650
<v 0>For Rawls,</v>

709
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:57.310
again,

710
00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:58.210
on the other hand,

711
00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:02.920
our endowments are never really our own to begin with.

712
00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:05.453
Um,

713
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:10.540
they are part of a common or collective possession to be shared by society as a

714
00:34:12.981 --> 00:34:13.401
whole.

715
00:34:13.401 --> 00:34:15.710
The capacities of hard work,

716
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.030
ambition,

717
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:18.440
uh,

718
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:22.610
and intelligence and just good luck that,

719
00:34:22.611 --> 00:34:23.421
for example,

720
00:34:23.421 --> 00:34:25.430
got you to a place like Yale,

721
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.390
uh,

722
00:34:26.390 --> 00:34:31.390
for an Ross as a con do not really belong to you or at least the fruits of those

723
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:36.830
ambitions and intelligence and good luck do not belong to you.

724
00:34:36.831 --> 00:34:37.850
They are,

725
00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:38.361
again,

726
00:34:38.361 --> 00:34:42.650
they are somewhat arbitrary is a result of upbringing and genetics.

727
00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:43.520
They're not,

728
00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.180
they're not yours or mine in any strong sense of the term,

729
00:34:47.181 --> 00:34:52.181
but rather a collective possession that can be or should be distributed.

730
00:34:53.451 --> 00:34:57.950
The fruits of which distributed to society as a whole consider the following

731
00:34:57.951 --> 00:34:59.300
passage from Rawls.

732
00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.960
The difference principle he writes represents in effect in agreement to regard

733
00:35:05.511 --> 00:35:10.511
the distribution of natural talents as a common asset and to share in the

734
00:35:11.211 --> 00:35:13.130
benefits of this distribution,

735
00:35:13.131 --> 00:35:13.730
whatever,

736
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.710
whatever it turns out to be,

737
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.980
whatever it turns out to be.

738
00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:25.300
Your intelligence or your drive or your endowments are,

739
00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:27.621
or again,

740
00:35:27.621 --> 00:35:30.920
what he calls a collective asset.

741
00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:33.660
<v 1>Think about that.</v>

742
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:40.450
<v 0>And it is this conception of common assets that underwrites Rawls is theory of</v>

743
00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:45.771
distributive justice and the welfare state just as Locke's theory of self

744
00:35:47.671 --> 00:35:52.671
ownership justifies his conception of limited government and the constitutional

745
00:35:54.031 --> 00:35:54.864
state.

746
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.180
According to Raul's.

747
00:35:57.181 --> 00:35:58.014
Again,

748
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:03.230
justice requires that social arrangements be structured for the benefits of the

749
00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:09.120
least advantaged in the genetic lottery of society.

750
00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:14.130
His thought experiment that he caused the original condition specifies that

751
00:36:15.031 --> 00:36:20.031
nobody would know in advance in this condition what their particular endowment

752
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.830
intellectually in many other ways would be.

753
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:27.023
Therefore,

754
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:29.010
every individual would,

755
00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:29.850
uh,

756
00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.110
in contracting,

757
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:31.680
uh,

758
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:36.680
with the whole would agree to share equally in the benefits of this,

759
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:38.260
uh,

760
00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.110
as it were genetic lottery.

761
00:36:40.111 --> 00:36:45.111
So redistributing our common assets does not violate on Rawls as account the

762
00:36:45.151 --> 00:36:47.940
sanctity of the individual because again,

763
00:36:47.941 --> 00:36:49.350
the fruits of our labor,

764
00:36:49.351 --> 00:36:51.690
we're never really ours to begin with.

765
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:54.181
Uh,

766
00:36:54.181 --> 00:36:55.290
unlike lock,

767
00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:55.890
uh,

768
00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:00.300
whose theory of self ownership provides a moral justification for the

769
00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:01.260
individual,

770
00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:02.220
for the self,

771
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:04.140
for our moral personality.

772
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:05.670
Rawls is different.

773
00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:10.410
Principle maintains that we never again belong to ourselves at all.

774
00:37:10.411 --> 00:37:13.530
We never really have ownership in ourselves,

775
00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:17.070
but are always part of a larger social.

776
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:17.993
We,

777
00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:18.320
uh,

778
00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:18.490
uh,

779
00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:20.520
s a social collective,

780
00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:25.710
a collective consciousness whose common assets can be redistributed for the

781
00:37:25.711 --> 00:37:26.940
benefit of the whole

782
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:30.120
lock and Rawls.

783
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:35.900
The point I'm trying to make is they represent two radically different visions

784
00:37:36.271 --> 00:37:37.860
of the liberal state.

785
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.880
Uh,

786
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.190
one broadly libertarian,

787
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.040
the other broadly welfare wrist,

788
00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:44.760
uh,

789
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.770
one emphasizing liberty,

790
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.840
the other emphasizing,

791
00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:49.350
uh,

792
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.190
equality.

793
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.660
Uh,

794
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:52.890
interestingly again,

795
00:37:52.891 --> 00:37:54.780
this represent this transition.

796
00:37:54.781 --> 00:37:59.781
This evolution represents a change which has gone on within,

797
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.390
uh,

798
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:02.730
in many ways the liberal tradition itself.

799
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.320
Unlike some of these other critics,

800
00:38:04.321 --> 00:38:08.670
Rawls does not come to be claiming from a tradition outside of liberalism,

801
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.660
but to be developing certain arguments from within,

802
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:13.260
uh,

803
00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.260
the liberal tradition and yet has moved in a wave,

804
00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:20.100
clearly very different from its Locky and formulation.

805
00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:21.150
Both of these views,

806
00:38:21.151 --> 00:38:21.481
again,

807
00:38:21.481 --> 00:38:26.340
they begin from common premises but move in very different directions.

808
00:38:26.341 --> 00:38:31.341
Locke's theory of self ownership regardless of the political community in

809
00:38:32.821 --> 00:38:37.821
largely negative terms as protecting our ad antecedent individual selves or an

810
00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:44.821
individual rights Rovs us theory of common assets regarding the community.

811
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:50.160
In a far more positive sense is taking an active role in reshaping and

812
00:38:50.831 --> 00:38:55.370
redistributing the product of our individual endeavors for the common interests.

813
00:38:55.371 --> 00:38:57.190
The question for you,

814
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:59.560
it just like the question for any of us,

815
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:00.010
uh,

816
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:05.010
is which of these two views is more valid or which of the two strikes you is

817
00:39:06.161 --> 00:39:09.190
more powerful or plausible?

818
00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.790
My own view,

819
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:14.790
and I love to editorialize,

820
00:39:14.791 --> 00:39:19.791
but my own view is far closer to American theory to Locke's theory,

821
00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.413
which I think,

822
00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:22.050
uh,

823
00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:23.250
then then Rawls.

824
00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:24.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

825
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.320
<v 0>The declaration of independence,</v>

826
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:31.660
the Charter of American Liberty States that each individual is endowed with

827
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.660
unalienable rights among which are life,

828
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.673
liberty,

829
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.910
the pursuit of happiness.

830
00:39:36.911 --> 00:39:40.030
The very indeterminacy of the last phrase,

831
00:39:40.031 --> 00:39:44.560
the pursuit of happiness with its emphasis upon the individual's right to

832
00:39:44.561 --> 00:39:49.561
determine happiness for themselves suggests a form of government that allows for

833
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:54.760
ample diversity for our natural talents and abilities.

834
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:57.060
And all the declaration,

835
00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:57.970
uh,

836
00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:00.700
certainly intends that the establishment of justice,

837
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.720
uh,

838
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.730
is one of the first tasks of government.

839
00:40:03.731 --> 00:40:08.731
Nowhere does it imply that this requires the wholesale redistribution of our

840
00:40:09.971 --> 00:40:12.520
individual goods and assets.

841
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:15.743
<v 1>And second,</v>

842
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:20.900
<v 0>although Rawls is clearly attractive,</v>

843
00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:21.660
uh,

844
00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:22.461
excuse me,

845
00:40:22.461 --> 00:40:27.461
Roz's clearly attentive to the moral ills of inequality and we will turn to that

846
00:40:28.101 --> 00:40:29.600
problem in phatic ugly.

847
00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:29.991
Uh,

848
00:40:29.991 --> 00:40:34.130
on Wednesday when we look at John Jack Russo's essay on inequality,

849
00:40:34.131 --> 00:40:36.110
there has never been a more powerful,

850
00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.320
passionate and persuasive critic of the ills of inequality than John Jacques

851
00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:42.450
Rousseau.

852
00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:42.650
Uh,

853
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:46.700
but while Rawls is certainly attentive to the moral ills of inequality,

854
00:40:46.701 --> 00:40:49.910
he seems very naive about the mechanisms,

855
00:40:49.911 --> 00:40:54.911
the actual political mechanisms by which inequalities will be rectified.

856
00:40:55.011 --> 00:40:59.300
Rawls wants government to work for the benefit of the least advantaged,

857
00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:04.660
but this will require the extensive and often arbitrary use of judicial power,

858
00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:05.750
uh,

859
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:08.030
to determine who has a right to watch,

860
00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:08.620
uh,

861
00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:11.930
far in excess of the powers of the court.

862
00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.150
The result would be,

863
00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.980
I think if we follow Rawls,

864
00:41:15.981 --> 00:41:16.940
his teachings,

865
00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:17.900
uh,

866
00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:18.733
to their letter,

867
00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:23.180
the result would be not a class of philosopher kings,

868
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:26.060
but rather a class of chief justices,

869
00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:26.480
uh,

870
00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.480
endowed with the power to rearrange and redistribute our collective assets for

871
00:41:32.241 --> 00:41:36.470
the sake of the maximum degree of social equality.

872
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:41.470
It is no surprise that the warmest reception that Rawls is the writing gets

873
00:41:41.511 --> 00:41:44.150
today is in the schools of law,

874
00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:49.250
is in the law schools where he has had an enormous influence on shaping the

875
00:41:49.251 --> 00:41:54.110
education of the current and the next generation of lawyers,

876
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:59.230
judges and possibly chief justices who may be looking to,

877
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.290
uh,

878
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:01.070
again,

879
00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:01.490
uh,

880
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:03.530
looking not to the constitution,

881
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.740
but to Rose's theory of justice as a,

882
00:42:06.741 --> 00:42:07.340
uh,

883
00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:07.950
as a,

884
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:08.300
uh,

885
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:08.960
uh,

886
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:13.960
again at a litmus or a tool for bringing about a social redistribution.

887
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:20.150
So I leave you on that sobering note,

888
00:42:20.151 --> 00:42:22.790
but a return to lock such as it is,

889
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.870
uh,

890
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:28.870
even if such a return where possible is by no means a panacea to what ails us.

891
00:42:29.841 --> 00:42:34.100
I am not suggesting for a moment that lock is some kind of cure all.

892
00:42:34.101 --> 00:42:35.210
Some historians,

893
00:42:35.211 --> 00:42:36.800
let me just just mention again,

894
00:42:36.801 --> 00:42:41.801
Louey hearts was but the most famous treat America as a nation uniquely built

895
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.110
upon locking in foundations America,

896
00:42:45.111 --> 00:42:48.260
he believed remains something of a lackey and remnant,

897
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.240
a Lockey in,

898
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.601
yeah,

899
00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:55.601
our remnant fossil in some ways in a world increasingly governed by more radical

900
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.650
forms of modernity.

901
00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.091
In fact,

902
00:42:59.091 --> 00:43:04.091
it has been our sort of stubborn Lockian aneurysm that has a in many ways

903
00:43:04.491 --> 00:43:09.491
prevented the kinds of extreme ideological polarization and conflict that one

904
00:43:10.901 --> 00:43:15.440
sees throughout throughout much of the 19th and 20th centuries,

905
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:21.910
but locks effort to build a kind of modern republican government on the low but

906
00:43:22.731 --> 00:43:27.260
solid foundations of self interest and self ownership and the desire for

907
00:43:27.261 --> 00:43:32.261
comfortable preservation could not help but generate its own farms of

908
00:43:33.231 --> 00:43:34.460
dissatisfaction.

909
00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:39.700
Can regime dedicated to the pursuit of happiness or to the protection of

910
00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:46.151
property ever satisfy the deepest longings of the human soul kinda regime

911
00:43:47.841 --> 00:43:52.340
devoted to the rational accumulation of property answered those higher order

912
00:43:52.341 --> 00:43:55.370
needs or higher order virtues like honor,

913
00:43:55.460 --> 00:44:00.460
nobility and sacrifice can urge gime devoted to the avoidance of pain,

914
00:44:00.861 --> 00:44:05.861
discomfort and anxiety produce anything more than contemporary farms of

915
00:44:06.651 --> 00:44:09.320
epicureanism and nihilism.

916
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.850
In any case,

917
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:13.910
I'm suggesting no more than any other land could.

918
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:18.910
America insulate itself from the great heights as well as the great depths of

919
00:44:19.461 --> 00:44:21.770
later farms of modernity.

920
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:23.840
America,

921
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.300
as a former teacher of mine,

922
00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.051
once said,

923
00:44:27.051 --> 00:44:29.600
is the land where the many facets,

924
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.510
the many faces of modernity are working themselves out.

925
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:34.081
We are,

926
00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:35.280
but a moment,

927
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:40.850
a moment in the kind of comprehensive self dissatisfaction that is,

928
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:42.780
uh,

929
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:43.620
modernity.

930
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:48.800
So that a return to Lockey aneurysm in many ways is not so much a cure for the

931
00:44:50.011 --> 00:44:52.080
pathologies of maternity.

932
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:57.380
I would suggest that those pathologies are themselves already rooted in the

933
00:44:58.261 --> 00:44:59.910
pathologies of lock.

934
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:00.680
Uh,

935
00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.830
I will end on that,

936
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:03.120
on that sober note,

937
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:07.590
and encourage you to take Russo's advice about loving one's country.

938
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:08.760
Uh,

939
00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.170
I'm seriously on Tuesday.
