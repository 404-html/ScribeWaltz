1
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.330
There.

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.070
There is one person in here,

3
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.520
I don't know who it is and you will not know who it is yet,

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.900
but there is one person in here for whom the reading of Plato's Republic will be

5
00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:25.181
the most important intellectual experience you have at Yale.

6
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.030
It is a book that one of you will go back to time and time again and it will

7
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:35.330
stick with you forever.

8
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.980
And what I would like you to do is to remember this and four years from now when

9
00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:44.720
most of you are ready to graduate,

10
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.450
uh,

11
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.360
if that one person in here,

12
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.050
uh,

13
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.320
would email me and let me know who it is.

14
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.493
Okay.

15
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.640
Maybe the Yo

16
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.040
maybe.

17
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.640
Okay.

18
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.290
The boy,

19
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.260
are you okay?

20
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.530
But this is the book that started it off.

21
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.040
Uh,

22
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.930
the apology,

23
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:09.651
the cryto.

24
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:11.840
These are our warmups to the,

25
00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:12.110
uh,

26
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.190
to the big theme to the other two,

27
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.230
the big book,

28
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.093
the Republic,

29
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.810
every other book in political science that has since been written beginning with

30
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:31.001
Aristotle's politics and moving on to the present day is in one way or another,

31
00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:32.990
an answer,

32
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.990
a response to Plato's republic.

33
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.800
It started the whole thing.

34
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.840
The first and most obvious thing to say about the republic is that it is a long

35
00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:49.244
book,

36
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.513
uh,

37
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.090
not the longest book you will ever read,

38
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:54.560
but long enough.

39
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.640
Uh,

40
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.600
and in fact,

41
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.410
uh,

42
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.360
in part because of this,

43
00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:02.690
we are only reading approximately half the book.

44
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.510
Uh,

45
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.110
the first five books to be more specific.

46
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.620
The first five books that deal with Anne and culminate in the best city,

47
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.380
Plato's ideal city,

48
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:16.760
what he calls cut Lippolis,

49
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.810
the just city,

50
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:18.800
the beautiful city,

51
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.850
uh,

52
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.830
rule by philosopher kings.

53
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.170
The second half of the book,

54
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.573
uh,

55
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.650
turns in somewhat different,

56
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.860
certainly equally important directions,

57
00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:35.861
but would take us much more time than the time we have allotted to deal with.

58
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.120
So you will read that on your own.

59
00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:39.830
You can take another course,

60
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.993
what have you.

61
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.720
The Republic is a very perplexing book.

62
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.680
You will find out,

63
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.390
uh,

64
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.130
it's,

65
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.030
it's meaning will not be evident to you on a first reading.

66
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.170
Uh,

67
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.110
it may not be clear to you on a 10th reading,

68
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.940
uh,

69
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.940
unless you it with the proper questions and the proper frame of mind.

70
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.570
So let's start by asking a simple question.

71
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:09.840
What is the republic about?

72
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.090
What,

73
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.890
what is this book?

74
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.120
What does this book deal with?

75
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.403
<v 1>Okay.</v>

76
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.620
<v 0>This is a question that has perplexed and divided readers of Plato almost almost</v>

77
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:25.054
from the beginning.

78
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.360
Is it a book about justice?

79
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.860
As the subtitle of the book suggests,

80
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.320
is it a book about what we today might call moral psychology and the right

81
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.230
ordering of the human soul,

82
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.200
which is a prominent theme,

83
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.771
uh,

84
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:49.090
addressed in this work?

85
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.060
Is it a book about the power of Poetry and myth,

86
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.730
what we would call the whole domain of culture,

87
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.930
uh,

88
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.820
to shape souls and to shape our societies?

89
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.810
Or is it a book about metaphysics and the ultimate structure of being as

90
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:12.840
certainly,

91
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.060
uh,

92
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.080
many of the,

93
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:14.500
uh,

94
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.333
last,

95
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.610
uh,

96
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.290
later,

97
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.600
uh,

98
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.100
books of the Republic,

99
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:18.550
uh,

100
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.100
suggest the theory of the forms,

101
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:24.400
the image of the divided line and so on and so on.

102
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.413
Of course,

103
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.190
it is about all of these things and several others,

104
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.360
others as well.

105
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.960
But at least at the beginning when we approached the book,

106
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:37.270
we should stay on its surface,

107
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.381
not dig,

108
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:40.360
at least initially to deeply.

109
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.350
It's one of the great readers of Plato of the last century.

110
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:45.184
Once said,

111
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.940
only the surface of things reveals the essence of things and the surface of the

112
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:57.700
republic reveals that it is a dialogue.

113
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.280
It is a conversation.

114
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.450
We should approach the book.

115
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:05.261
In other words,

116
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:07.510
not as we might a treat us,

117
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.730
but as we might approach a work of literature or drama.

118
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.840
It is a work comparable in scope to other literary master works,

119
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.463
Hamlet,

120
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.150
Don Quixote,

121
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.160
Warren piece,

122
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.150
others you might think of

123
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.830
it as a conversation is a dialogue.

124
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.190
It is something that the author wants us to join to take part in.

125
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.420
We were invited to be not merely passive onlookers of this conversation,

126
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:51.031
but active participants in that dialogue that takes place in this book over the

127
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.600
course of a single evening.

128
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.760
Perhaps the best way to read this book is to read it aloud as you might with a

129
00:06:07.871 --> 00:06:10.870
play to yourself or with your friends,

130
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.900
but let's go a little further.

131
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.100
The republic is also a utopia.

132
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.040
A word that Plato does not use was not coined in too many,

133
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.670
many centuries later by Sir Thomas Moore.

134
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.700
But Plato's book is a utopia.

135
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:34.130
It is a kind of extreme.

136
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.660
You present an extreme vision of politics.

137
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:41.330
He presents an extreme vision of the Polis.

138
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:45.560
The guiding thread of the book is the correspondence.

139
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.590
And we will look at this in some length and you will discuss in your sections,

140
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:55.040
no doubt the guiding thread of the book is the correspondence,

141
00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.710
the symmetry between the parts of the city and the parts of the soul

142
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.070
discord within the city.

143
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.630
Uh,

144
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.490
just as discord within the soul is regarded as the greatest evil.

145
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.630
The aim of the republic is to establish a harmonious city based on a conception

146
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:18.590
of justice.

147
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.240
That so to speak,

148
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:23.510
harmonizes the individual and society.

149
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.020
How,

150
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.870
how to achieve that the best city,

151
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:27.710
uh,

152
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.710
will necessarily be one that seeks to produce the best or highest type of

153
00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:34.154
individual.

154
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.420
And Plato's famous answer to this is that the city,

155
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.990
any,

156
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.080
any city will never be free of conflict.

157
00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:47.081
We'll never be free of factional strife until in his famous formula,

158
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.850
kings become philosophers and philosophers become kings.

159
00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:59.613
<v 1>Okay.</v>

160
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.170
<v 0>Republic asks us to consider seriously,</v>

161
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:09.080
what would a city look like ruled by philosophers

162
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.461
in this respect.

163
00:08:12.461 --> 00:08:17.350
It would seem to be the sort of perfect bookend to the apology.

164
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.810
Remember the apology,

165
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.620
uh,

166
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.540
viewed the dangers posed to philosophy and the philosopher and the philosophical

167
00:08:25.541 --> 00:08:26.740
life from the city.

168
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.890
The republic asks us,

169
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:35.130
what would a city be like if it were ruled by Socrates or someone like him?

170
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.690
What would it be like for philosophers to rule such as city would require?

171
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:46.050
So Socrates tells us throughout the opening books the severe censorship of

172
00:08:48.131 --> 00:08:49.780
Poetry and theology,

173
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.250
the abolition of private property and the family,

174
00:08:54.251 --> 00:08:56.880
at least among the Guardian class of the city.

175
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.870
And the use of selected lies and myths.

176
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.900
What would today probably be called ideology or propaganda is tools of political

177
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:08.004
rule.

178
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.010
It would seem that far from utopia.

179
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.900
The Republic represents a radical Dystopia,

180
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.390
a satire in some sense of the best polity.

181
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:23.941
And in fact,

182
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:28.941
much of modern political science is directed against Plato's legacy.

183
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.330
The modern state is,

184
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:38.331
we have come to understand it is based upon the separation of civil society from

185
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.760
governing authority,

186
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.270
the entire domain of private,

187
00:09:44.271 --> 00:09:47.940
what we call private life separated from the state.

188
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.660
But Plato's republic recognizes no such separation or no such independence,

189
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:56.550
uh,

190
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.320
for a private sphere.

191
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.520
And for this reason,

192
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:05.060
Plato has often been cast as a kind of harbinger a of the modern totalitarian

193
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.513
state.

194
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.840
A famous professor at a distance university was said to have begun his lectures

195
00:10:18.431 --> 00:10:20.200
on the republic by saying,

196
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.770
now we will consider Plato the fascist.

197
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.540
And this was in fact the view popularized by one of the most influential books

198
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.430
about Plato written in the last century.

199
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.240
A book written by a Viennese emigre by the name of Karl Popper,

200
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.790
who in the very early 1950s,

201
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.310
right at the height of the Cold War.

202
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.640
And of course the end of the conclusion of the Second World War wrote a book

203
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.440
called the Open Society and its enemies.

204
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.480
He wanted to know,

205
00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:57.050
uh,

206
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:02.050
what were the causes or who were the responsible for the exp experiences of

207
00:11:03.201 --> 00:11:04.460
totalitarianism,

208
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.540
both in Stalin's Russia and it Hitler's Germany.

209
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.000
And in the course of this inquiry,

210
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:16.420
he concluded that not only Hegel and Marx were important in that particular

211
00:11:17.061 --> 00:11:17.841
genealogy,

212
00:11:17.841 --> 00:11:20.690
but this went back to Plato as well.

213
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:25.810
Prep Plato principally a Plato who he accuses popper and a passionate,

214
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.013
uh,

215
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.430
albeit not very well written book,

216
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.360
uh,

217
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.910
accuses a Plato of,

218
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:39.800
of a stab being the first to establish a kind of totalitarian dictatorship.

219
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.300
Is that true?

220
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:43.310
Well,

221
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.860
Plato's republic is,

222
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.200
we will discover as you read,

223
00:11:48.201 --> 00:11:50.690
it is a republic of a very special kind.

224
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:57.690
It is not a regime like hours devoted to maximizing individual liberties,

225
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.630
but it is one that puts the education of its citizens,

226
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.490
the education of its members as its highest duty

227
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:13.990
republic.

228
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:20.130
Like the Greek Paullus was a kind of tootle area association and its principal

229
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:23.374
good.

230
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.980
It's principal goal was the education of citizens for positions of public

231
00:12:31.091 --> 00:12:35.260
leadership and high political responsibilities.

232
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:43.290
It is always worthwhile to remember that Plato was above all a teacher.

233
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.570
He was the founder of the first university,

234
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.573
the academy,

235
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.320
the Platonic Academy,

236
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.300
where we will find out later,

237
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:58.840
Aristotle came to study among among many others,

238
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.071
Aristotle being,

239
00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:05.071
but the most famous Plato was a founder of this school and this intern spawned

240
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:12.010
other philosophical schools throughout the Greek world and later the Roman

241
00:13:12.011 --> 00:13:12.844
world.

242
00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:14.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

243
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.330
<v 0>With the demise of Rome in the early Christian centuries,</v>

244
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.360
these philosophical academies,

245
00:13:21.361 --> 00:13:26.361
these philosophical schools were absorbed into the medieval monasteries and

246
00:13:27.391 --> 00:13:32.391
these in turn became the basis of the first European universities and places

247
00:13:32.551 --> 00:13:33.384
like Bologna,

248
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.213
Paris,

249
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:36.923
Oxford,

250
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:43.610
these were in turn later transplanted to the new world and established in towns

251
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.140
like Cambridge and of course,

252
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.123
new haven.

253
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.360
We can say today that this university is a direct ancestor of the Platonic

254
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.221
Republic of Plato's academy.

255
00:14:02.221 --> 00:14:03.480
We are all here,

256
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.340
the heirs of Plato.

257
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.850
Think of that without Plato,

258
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:10.950
no Yale,

259
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.530
we would not be here today

260
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.370
and I think that is a fact.

261
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.320
You just ponder that for a moment

262
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:32.950
and in fact,

263
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:35.170
let me even say a little more about this.

264
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:40.320
The institutional and educational requirements of Plato's Republic share many

265
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.160
features with a place like Yale.

266
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.420
For example,

267
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.780
in both the platonic ca Lippolis,

268
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.510
the just city as well as this place,

269
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.580
men and women,

270
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:57.980
men and women

271
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:04.750
are selected at a relatively early age because of their capacities for

272
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:06.704
leadership,

273
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.360
for courage,

274
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.530
for self discipline and responsibility.

275
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.740
They spend several years living together,

276
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:24.530
eating together and common mess halls,

277
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:30.850
exercising together and studying together of course,

278
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:36.170
far from the oversight of their parents.

279
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.780
The best of them are winnowed out to pursue further study and eventually assume

280
00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:51.200
positions of public leadership and responsibility.

281
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.050
Throughout all of this,

282
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:59.740
they are subjected to a course of rigorous study and physical training that will

283
00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:05.861
lead them to adopt prominent positions in the military and other branches of

284
00:16:06.351 --> 00:16:07.310
public service.

285
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.760
Does this sound at all familiar to you?

286
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.103
It should.

287
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:14.840
Let me put it another way.

288
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.090
If Plato is,

289
00:16:17.091 --> 00:16:18.290
is a fascist,

290
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.540
what does that make you?

291
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

292
00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:26.920
<v 0>Plato of course,</v>

293
00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:31.921
is an extremist and he pushes his ideas to their most radical conclusions.

294
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.650
That's what it is to be a philosopher,

295
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.450
but he is also defining a kind of school.

296
00:16:40.451 --> 00:16:45.451
He regards the politics or the republic because that is the original Greek title

297
00:16:47.231 --> 00:16:47.741
of the book,

298
00:16:47.741 --> 00:16:48.411
polity or,

299
00:16:48.411 --> 00:16:49.450
or regime.

300
00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:50.740
Uh,

301
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.440
he regards the polar Taher is a score.

302
00:16:53.441 --> 00:16:58.441
Who's chief goal is preparation for guidance and leadership of a community.

303
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.690
If you don't believe me about this,

304
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.770
maybe you will consider the words of John Jack Russell,

305
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:11.250
one of the great readers of Plato's Republic Russo wrote in is a meal to get a

306
00:17:11.981 --> 00:17:14.320
good idea of public education.

307
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.333
He says,

308
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.500
read Plato's Republic.

309
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.570
It is not a political treatise as those who merely judge books by their title.

310
00:17:22.571 --> 00:17:23.404
Think.

311
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.330
But it is the finest,

312
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.570
most beautiful work on education ever written.

313
00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.123
<v 1>Roussel</v>

314
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.373
so

315
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.413
here we go.

316
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.673
Let's

317
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.780
<v 0>look in a little.</v>

318
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.290
That's what's now peak into the book itself.

319
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:46.693
Just peak.

320
00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:48.180
<v 1>Well,</v>

321
00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.013
go too far.

322
00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.630
<v 0>Start with the first line.</v>

323
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.040
Who remembers what the first line is?

324
00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:57.721
Oh,

325
00:17:57.721 --> 00:17:58.200
come on.

326
00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.040
You should know this.

327
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.920
It's now you're looking at the book.

328
00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:02.754
You're cheating.

329
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.950
I went down to the Pi Radius.

330
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.280
I went down to the Pi Radius.

331
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:10.320
Why does Plato Begin with this line?

332
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.140
Here's a story that I heard.

333
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:15.090
I'm not sure altogether true,

334
00:18:15.091 --> 00:18:16.470
but it's a good story.

335
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:20.310
And at least about the famous German philosopher Martin Heidegger,

336
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.560
who said that,

337
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:22.891
uh,

338
00:18:22.891 --> 00:18:25.260
on his first teaching of the republic,

339
00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:26.940
he went through the whole book,

340
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.730
taught throughout the whole book in one in one class,

341
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.080
in one seminar,

342
00:18:31.081 --> 00:18:32.040
one semester.

343
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.460
The last time he taught at the final time,

344
00:18:35.461 --> 00:18:35.911
he taught it.

345
00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:37.950
He never got beyond the first sentence.

346
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.170
I went down to the [inaudible].

347
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.240
What does it mean?

348
00:18:42.241 --> 00:18:44.370
Why does he begin with this?

349
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.800
I went down a going down,

350
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.440
the Greek word for this is Khattab Asus.

351
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.200
I had made a descent.

352
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:57.420
There is a book by a famous contemporary of Plato's [inaudible] name's Xenophon,

353
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.690
who wrote a book called the analysis.

354
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.290
The analysis means a going up and us an s sent.

355
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:09.030
But Plato begins this dialogue with the stigma.

356
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.110
I went down

357
00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.340
the descent to the pirates.

358
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:19.370
It is clearly modeled on Odysseus's descent to Haiti's in the,

359
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.050
in the Odyssey.

360
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:27.710
And in fact the work is a kind of philosophical odyssey that both imitates homer

361
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:34.220
but also anticipates other great odyssey's of the human mind works by those like

362
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:36.450
Servon tastes or,

363
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:37.410
or Joyce.

364
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.180
The book is full.

365
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:43.320
You will see other number of descents and essence,

366
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.020
the most famous climb upward,

367
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:46.321
uh,

368
00:19:46.321 --> 00:19:50.550
although we will not actually read these parts for this class.

369
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.970
Concerns the climb of to the divided line,

370
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
the famous image of the divided line in book six and the assent to the world of

371
00:19:59.041 --> 00:20:01.050
the imperishable forms.

372
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.500
And then in the last book of the Republic Book 10,

373
00:20:04.501 --> 00:20:07.800
there is once again a descent to the underworld,

374
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.010
to the world of,

375
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:09.870
of Haiti's.

376
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:11.100
Uh,

377
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:16.020
the work is not in a sense written simply as a sort of timeless philosophical

378
00:20:16.021 --> 00:20:16.561
treatise,

379
00:20:16.561 --> 00:20:19.800
but as a dramatic dialogue with a setting,

380
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.400
a cast of characters and affirm location in time and place.

381
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:32.030
Let's say a little more about that time and place already indicated in this.

382
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.650
In the phrase or sentence.

383
00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:36.240
I went down to the Pi Radius.

384
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.260
Plato was born in four 27,

385
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:46.010
which is four years after the commencement of the Peloponnesian war.

386
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.700
He was a young man of 23 when the democracy in Athens was defeated,

387
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:59.970
and he was only 28 when the restored democracy executed his friend and teacher

388
00:21:01.661 --> 00:21:04.060
Socrates in three 99

389
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.870
almost immediately after the trial of Socrates,

390
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:16.290
Plato left Athens and traveled extensively throughout the Greek world.

391
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.270
And upon his return,

392
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.600
he established this school at Athens called the academy for the training of

393
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.440
philosophers,

394
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.333
statesmen,

395
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.540
and legislators.

396
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.440
Plato lived a long time.

397
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.780
He lived until the age of 80,

398
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:40.300
and except for two expeditions to Sicily where he went at the request of

399
00:21:40.301 --> 00:21:45.040
Dionysius to help try to establish a philosophical kingship,

400
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.330
uh,

401
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:47.500
in Syracuse.

402
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:48.400
Uh,

403
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.960
he remained in Athens,

404
00:21:49.961 --> 00:21:51.160
teaching and writing.

405
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.290
<v 1>The republic</v>

406
00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:01.130
<v 0>belongs to that period of Plato's work after his return to Athens,</v>

407
00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.920
after the execution of Socrates,

408
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.380
the dominant feature of Plato's political theory,

409
00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.060
David Green,

410
00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.610
a great reader of Plato has said,

411
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:17.630
is the root and branch character of the change.

412
00:22:17.631 --> 00:22:21.170
It advocates and existing institutions.

413
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.880
Plato desire for a kind of radical make-over of Athenian and Greek political

414
00:22:29.241 --> 00:22:34.241
institutions and cultures grew out of his experience of political defeat and

415
00:22:37.101 --> 00:22:37.934
despair.

416
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:44.110
The utopianism of the book is in many ways the reverse side of the sense of

417
00:22:45.441 --> 00:22:50.441
profound disillusionment that he felt at the actual experience of the Athenian

418
00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:53.503
Polis.

419
00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.810
This was not only true of his experience at home,

420
00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:00.410
but as his failed efforts to turn,

421
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.930
uh,

422
00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:05.930
Dionysius Dionysius his kingship in Sicily into a successful example of

423
00:23:08.781 --> 00:23:10.790
philosophical rule.

424
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.571
In fact,

425
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:14.291
we have,

426
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:16.510
and I want to read to you in just a moment,

427
00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:21.570
a lengthy transcript of Plato's own account of why he came to write the

428
00:23:24.371 --> 00:23:25.030
republic.

429
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.320
One one thing of course,

430
00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:30.190
you note in the republic is that Plato is nowhere present.

431
00:23:30.191 --> 00:23:33.160
He is not a participant in his own dialog.

432
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.920
He is the author but not the participant.

433
00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:38.770
We don't know precisely what played,

434
00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:40.120
what Plato thought,

435
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:45.121
but we are helped at least by a kind of intellectual that he wrote and that we

436
00:23:48.021 --> 00:23:48.920
still have,

437
00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:49.790
uh,

438
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:54.790
in what is conventionally referred to as the seventh letter.

439
00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:59.060
P Plato wrote a series of letters that we have.

440
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.060
People have argued over the authenticity of them,

441
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:06.020
although I think by now it is established that they are his.

442
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.930
And in the most famous of these letters,

443
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.280
the lengthy seventh one,

444
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:11.600
he gives us again,

445
00:24:11.601 --> 00:24:16.601
something of an autobiography and tells us a little bit about why he came to

446
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:17.880
write this book is,

447
00:24:17.881 --> 00:24:19.760
isn't this amazing that you know,

448
00:24:19.761 --> 00:24:22.310
2020 500 years ago,

449
00:24:22.311 --> 00:24:27.311
we still have the letters of the man who wrote this book.

450
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:32.390
So let me read to you what Plato says about how he came to write this book.

451
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:33.590
When I was a young man.

452
00:24:33.591 --> 00:24:33.981
He said,

453
00:24:33.981 --> 00:24:36.830
and this is written as he's very old.

454
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:38.750
When I was a young man,

455
00:24:38.751 --> 00:24:41.450
I felt as many young men do.

456
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.710
I felt at the very moment I attained my majority,

457
00:24:45.711 --> 00:24:47.720
I should engage in public affairs.

458
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.850
And there came my way and opportunity that I want to tell you about

459
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.720
the democratic constitution.

460
00:24:56.721 --> 00:25:01.640
Then loudly decried by many people was abolished and the leaders of the

461
00:25:01.641 --> 00:25:06.440
revolution set themselves up as a government of 30 men with Supreme Authority.

462
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.640
This is,

463
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.640
he's referring to the tyranny of the 30 that existed after the Athenian defeat.

464
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:15.590
Some of these men,

465
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.540
some of the members of the 30,

466
00:25:17.541 --> 00:25:18.920
you must understand,

467
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.400
were relatives of mine and well known to me.

468
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:23.961
And what is more,

469
00:25:23.961 --> 00:25:28.961
they actually invited me at once to join them is no politics and I were a fit

470
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:30.543
match.

471
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:32.870
I was very young then.

472
00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:35.930
And it is not surprising that I felt as I did,

473
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.120
I thought that the city was then living a kind of life which was unjust and that

474
00:25:41.121 --> 00:25:45.770
they would bend it to adjust one and so it administer it more justly.

475
00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.100
So I eagerly watch to see what they would do.

476
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:51.740
And you must know as I looked on,

477
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:57.130
I saw those men in a short time make the former democracy look like a golden

478
00:25:58.221 --> 00:25:59.054
age.

479
00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.990
Those are the referring to his relatives.

480
00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.720
Men like Critias and comedies,

481
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:06.440
uh,

482
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.100
who,

483
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:07.520
uh,

484
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.353
turned,

485
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:08.900
uh,

486
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.900
Athenian politics into a tyranny and which he says makes the democracy looked

487
00:26:14.351 --> 00:26:15.530
like a golden age.

488
00:26:15.531 --> 00:26:17.930
Let me continue in Plato's words.

489
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:19.581
I looked at this,

490
00:26:19.581 --> 00:26:20.414
you see,

491
00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:25.340
and at the men who were in politics at the laws and customs and the more I

492
00:26:25.341 --> 00:26:27.260
looked and the older I grew,

493
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:32.890
the more difficult it seemed to me to administer political affairs justly for

494
00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:38.240
you cannot do so without friends and comrades you can trust and such men,

495
00:26:38.241 --> 00:26:43.241
it was not easy to find for the city you see no longer lived in the fashion and

496
00:26:44.371 --> 00:26:49.371
ways of our fathers eager as I had once been to go into politics is I look at

497
00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:54.960
these things and saw everything taking any course at all with no direction or

498
00:26:54.961 --> 00:26:55.794
management.

499
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.660
I ended up feeling dizzy.

500
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.030
I did not abandoned my interest in politics,

501
00:27:01.031 --> 00:27:05.130
do to discover how it might be better than other respects and I was perpetually

502
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.690
awaiting my opportunity.

503
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:12.630
But at last I saw that as far as all states now existing are concerned,

504
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.960
they are all badly governed for the condition of their laws is bad.

505
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.460
Almost passed cure except for some miraculous accident.

506
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:29.330
So I was compelled to say and praise and true philosophy that it was from it

507
00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:33.510
alone that was able to discern any justice.

508
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:38.930
And so I said that the nations of the world will never cease from trouble until

509
00:27:39.241 --> 00:27:44.241
either the true breed of philosophers shall come to political office or until

510
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:49.700
that of the rulers shell by some divine law take to the pursuit of philosophy.

511
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.880
And there you see in that,

512
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:54.331
you know,

513
00:27:54.331 --> 00:27:59.331
wonderful letter and that kind of probing self examination of his early motives

514
00:28:01.171 --> 00:28:01.620
and,

515
00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:01.981
and,

516
00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:03.060
and uh,

517
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:03.930
and,

518
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.430
and expectations.

519
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.250
You see the disillusionment of the,

520
00:28:08.251 --> 00:28:08.670
uh,

521
00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:09.630
of the older,

522
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:10.050
uh,

523
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:11.220
Plato Looking,

524
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.450
looking on what is,

525
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:12.840
what,

526
00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.200
what,

527
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.660
what the tyranny had done,

528
00:28:15.661 --> 00:28:18.270
but also looking at the states,

529
00:28:18.271 --> 00:28:20.010
the nations of his time,

530
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:20.760
uh,

531
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.593
seeing,

532
00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:21.990
uh,

533
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.490
their management,

534
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:28.491
seeing their decay and conflict and saying and suggesting that no,

535
00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:29.640
uh,

536
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.370
no justice will ever be expected until,

537
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.420
as he says at the end,

538
00:28:33.421 --> 00:28:35.850
kings become philosophers and philosophers,

539
00:28:35.851 --> 00:28:36.261
Keynes,

540
00:28:36.261 --> 00:28:39.690
a direct reference to the,

541
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.030
to,

542
00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:40.920
to the republic.

543
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:48.570
This little autobiography he goes on at considerably greater length,

544
00:28:48.571 --> 00:28:49.141
I should say.

545
00:28:49.141 --> 00:28:53.850
But this provides a kind of introduction as it were to the republic.

546
00:28:53.851 --> 00:28:57.000
We haven't Plato's own words here,

547
00:28:57.001 --> 00:29:02.001
the way he viewed politics and his reasons for his political philosophy.

548
00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.810
And yet in many respects,

549
00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:11.811
if the republic was the result of comprehensive despair and disillusionment with

550
00:29:13.021 --> 00:29:14.520
the prospects of reform,

551
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:20.120
the dialogue itself points back to an earlier moment in Plato's life and the

552
00:29:20.761 --> 00:29:22.890
life of the city of Athens.

553
00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:23.760
Uh,

554
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.420
this remarkable letter was written when Plato was very old,

555
00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:28.100
uh,

556
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:33.100
approximately 50 years after the trial and execution of Socrates.

557
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:39.470
But the action of the republic takes place long before the defeat of Athens,

558
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:40.900
uh,

559
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.560
before the rise of the 30 and the execution of Athens.

560
00:29:44.561 --> 00:29:49.561
It refers to that period that Plato says in the letter looked like a golden age

561
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.200
when many things seemed possible.

562
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:56.320
And that brings us back to the opening,

563
00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.600
the descent to the Pi Radius.

564
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:03.610
The action of the dialogue begins at the Pi Radius,

565
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.100
the port city of Athens,

566
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.130
somewhere around the year for 11,

567
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:10.481
uh,

568
00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:13.120
during what was called the piece of Nikias.

569
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:18.150
That is to say the PR piece that endured a kind of respite truce that was

570
00:30:18.221 --> 00:30:22.270
established during the fighting between Sparta and Athens.

571
00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.320
And at the very beginning of the dialogue,

572
00:30:26.321 --> 00:30:29.050
we see Socrates and his friend Glaucon.

573
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.033
What are they doing?

574
00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:31.780
What are they doing?

575
00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:35.503
<v 1>Do you remember?</v>

576
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.190
What are they doing at the very beginning?

577
00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:41.043
Where,

578
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.633
right.

579
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.190
<v 0>Let me put it a slightly here.</v>

580
00:30:47.191 --> 00:30:47.531
Yes,

581
00:30:47.531 --> 00:30:50.230
they are walking back to Athens from my the Pi Radius,

582
00:30:50.231 --> 00:30:52.810
but maybe to put it a slightly different way.

583
00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.690
They're trolling the waterfront.

584
00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.200
What is the Pi Radius?

585
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:05.360
It is the harbor of Athens and what do you expect from harbors?

586
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.480
What our harbor cities like?

587
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.090
What do you find down at harbors?

588
00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:13.893
<v 1>Okay,</v>

589
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:16.110
<v 0>there's CD,</v>

590
00:31:16.111 --> 00:31:16.590
aren't they?

591
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:17.520
They're kind of,

592
00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:22.820
you find various kinds of disreputable and maybe unseemly things going on there.

593
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:27.210
We are forced to ask ourselves,

594
00:31:27.211 --> 00:31:29.940
what are Socrates and Glaucon doing there?

595
00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.090
Why are they there together?

596
00:31:33.091 --> 00:31:33.660
What are they,

597
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:34.530
what are they doing?

598
00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.200
What do they expect to find?

599
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.130
These seem to be questions that immediately come to mind.

600
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:46.650
We learned shortly afterwards that they have taken this descent,

601
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:50.610
the pro Reyes to have your festival kind of carnival.

602
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:56.310
It sounds like something one might expect to see in a Fellini film,

603
00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.760
a kind of carnival carnival,

604
00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.700
a Mardi gras.

605
00:32:02.701 --> 00:32:05.600
We're a festival is going on and what,

606
00:32:05.601 --> 00:32:10.601
what's more a new goddess is being introduced into the Pantheon of deities.

607
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:13.350
Uh,

608
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:17.220
this seems to suggest that referring back to the apology,

609
00:32:17.221 --> 00:32:18.790
that it is not Socrates,

610
00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:22.020
the Athenians who innovate,

611
00:32:22.021 --> 00:32:26.640
who create an in in introduced new deities,

612
00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.770
Socrates remarks that the,

613
00:32:28.771 --> 00:32:29.604
uh,

614
00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:34.910
thracians the display of the thracians put on a good show showing that his own

615
00:32:35.281 --> 00:32:38.910
perspective is not simply bound by that of his city.

616
00:32:38.911 --> 00:32:43.610
It suggests from the beginning of kind of loftiness and impartiality of

617
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:46.670
perspective characteristic of the philosopher,

618
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.100
but not necessarily the citizen.

619
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.780
And on their way back from this festival,

620
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:54.830
from the,

621
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:56.780
from this carnival on their way back,

622
00:32:56.781 --> 00:32:57.770
they were accosted.

623
00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:03.580
You remember they are costed by a slave who's been sent on by Paula Marcus and

624
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:08.540
his friends and who orders Socrates and Glaucon to wait.

625
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.450
Paula Marcus orders you to weight.

626
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:15.380
The slave says he orders you to wait.

627
00:33:15.381 --> 00:33:17.060
He coming up behind you.

628
00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:18.950
Just wait.

629
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.300
And of course we'll wait.

630
00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:24.290
Glaucon replies.

631
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.160
When Paula Marcus and his friends arrive,

632
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:33.140
we find that his friends include Eddie Mantis who was glaucoma,

633
00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:38.150
his brother in Nicole Rogers who was the son of Nikias,

634
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:42.740
the general who was just brokered the peace that they are now enjoying.

635
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:47.660
So famous piece of Nikki as when they Charlotte challenge Socrates,

636
00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:50.540
stay with us or prove stronger,

637
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.120
stay with us or prove stronger.

638
00:33:53.121 --> 00:33:54.710
Could we not persuade you?

639
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:56.330
Socrates asked,

640
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.340
could we not persuade you to let us go?

641
00:33:58.341 --> 00:34:00.530
Not if we won't listen.

642
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.180
Paul Lamarca says,

643
00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.750
and instead they reach a compromise.

644
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.113
Let's Socrates,

645
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:13.210
let's Socrates and Glaucon come with parlor Marcus and the others to the home of

646
00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:13.571
parlor.

647
00:34:13.571 --> 00:34:13.971
Marcus,

648
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:14.804
his father,

649
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.823
we're at dinner,

650
00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:20.830
will be provided for them and later a return to the festival where there will be

651
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:23.060
a horseback race.

652
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:29.170
It seems Glaucon says we must stay in Socrates.

653
00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.003
Concur's.

654
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.080
Why does the book begin with this?

655
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:41.110
You want to say opening gambit is it's simply a ruse to get the reader's

656
00:34:43.671 --> 00:34:48.671
attention and some sense or to kind of rope you in with some promise of what's

657
00:34:49.851 --> 00:34:50.684
to follow.

658
00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:57.160
Already from the very opening lines we see in this a clue to the,

659
00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:02.720
to the theme that is that is going to follow who has the title to rule?

660
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:08.150
Is it Paula Marcus and his friends who claimed to rule by strength of numbers?

661
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:09.920
Can we persuade you?

662
00:35:09.921 --> 00:35:11.420
Not If we don't listen,

663
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.823
he says,

664
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:18.070
or Socrates and Glaucon who hope to rule by the powers of reason to speech and

665
00:35:18.591 --> 00:35:19.251
argument.

666
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:20.600
Can we convince you?

667
00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:21.980
Can we persuade you?

668
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:26.750
Can Democracy that expresses the will of the majority,

669
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:31.280
the will of the greater number be rendered compatible with the needs of

670
00:35:31.281 --> 00:35:35.990
philosophy and the reclaims to respect only reason and the better argument.

671
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:41.260
That seems to be the question already posed in this opening scene.

672
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:44.640
Can a compromise be reached between the two?

673
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:45.540
Uh,

674
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:50.540
can the strength of numbers as well as respect for reason and the better

675
00:35:51.121 --> 00:35:54.570
argument be in some sense a harmonized,

676
00:35:54.571 --> 00:35:55.404
can they be,

677
00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:55.860
uh,

678
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.240
can they be brought together?

679
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.260
Is the just city perhaps that Socrates,

680
00:36:01.261 --> 00:36:06.261
we'll later consider a combination of these two of both force and persuasion.

681
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:10.230
That will be something left to see.

682
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:15.560
But I think you can see the big themes of the book already very present in the

683
00:36:17.101 --> 00:36:19.140
opening scene,

684
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:19.740
uh,

685
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.370
that this,

686
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:20.491
uh,

687
00:36:20.491 --> 00:36:25.491
of the dialogue when the first book is really a kind of preamble to everything

688
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.393
that follows.

689
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

690
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.093
<v 0>Okay.</v>

691
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:36.540
You're with me so far on this.

692
00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:39.723
<v 1>Let's talk</v>

693
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:44.470
<v 0>a little bit about the participants in this dialogue.</v>

694
00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:46.000
It is a dialogue.

695
00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:49.120
It has a number of,

696
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.770
uh,

697
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:52.900
a fairly large number of characters,

698
00:36:52.901 --> 00:36:56.050
although only a relatively few number of them,

699
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.470
uh,

700
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:57.303
speak,

701
00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:57.760
uh,

702
00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.593
in the book.

703
00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.350
Uh,

704
00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.420
and yet it's something very important,

705
00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:01.720
uh,

706
00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:06.370
as we would want to know in any play or novel or movie.

707
00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:07.503
Uh,

708
00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:10.270
we want to note something about,

709
00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:10.720
uh,

710
00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.520
the particular people who

711
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.550
inhabit this,

712
00:37:15.551 --> 00:37:20.551
this dinner party that Socrates and Glaucon have been promised.

713
00:37:20.621 --> 00:37:24.190
Who are they and what do they represent?

714
00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:27.003
Uh,

715
00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:30.910
there is capitalists,

716
00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:36.160
we will see very quickly the father of Paula Marcus and whose home they are

717
00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:38.400
attending a,

718
00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:41.040
the venerable Pocho familiars,

719
00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:43.450
the venerable father of the family,

720
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:44.350
Paula Marcus,

721
00:37:44.351 --> 00:37:45.184
his son,

722
00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:50.410
a solid patriot who defends not only his father's honor,

723
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:53.590
but that of his friends and fellow citizens.

724
00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.290
And we will also see through civicus,

725
00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:57.020
Ahh,

726
00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:02.020
a cynical intellectual who rivals Socrates as an educator of future leaders and

727
00:38:03.551 --> 00:38:04.384
statesmen.

728
00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:08.530
And of course it is the exchange between Socrates and Thrasymachus.

729
00:38:08.531 --> 00:38:11.860
That is one of the most famous moments of the book.

730
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:16.480
And there is in the first set of dialogues,

731
00:38:16.481 --> 00:38:18.640
it distinct hierarchy of characters,

732
00:38:18.641 --> 00:38:19.474
you might say,

733
00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:24.870
who we see later on express those distinctive features of the soul and the city

734
00:38:26.741 --> 00:38:27.550
capitalists.

735
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:28.383
We learn,

736
00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:29.643
right?

737
00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:32.650
He has spent his life in the acquisitive arts.

738
00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:34.480
That is to say he's a businessman.

739
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:39.850
He's been concerned with satisfying the needs of his body and making money.

740
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:44.650
He represents what will later be called in the republic,

741
00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.080
the appetitive part of the soul,

742
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:48.610
the appetites,

743
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.630
Paula Marcus,

744
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:53.080
whose name actually means warlord.

745
00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:59.320
Think of that the warlord is preoccupied with questions of honor and loyalty.

746
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:06.940
He tells us to get a little bit ahead of ourselves that justice is helping your

747
00:39:06.941 --> 00:39:09.280
friends and harming your enemies.

748
00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:15.090
He seems to represent what Plato or Socrates will later called a spirited part

749
00:39:15.221 --> 00:39:15.761
of the soul,

750
00:39:15.761 --> 00:39:17.290
something that we want to return to.

751
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:18.840
And there's civicus,

752
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:19.570
uh,

753
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:20.840
visiting surface to,

754
00:39:20.841 --> 00:39:22.900
seeks to teach and educate,

755
00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:27.430
anticipating what the republic will call the rational soul,

756
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.020
the rational part of his soul.

757
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:34.050
Each of these figures in many ways prefigure the relatively superior natures of

758
00:39:36.311 --> 00:39:38.290
those who come later in the dialogue.

759
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:44.280
The two brothers Glau cone and Adyen Mantas who's exchange with Socrates

760
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:47.500
occupies for the most part,

761
00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.070
the rest of the dialogue from book two onwards.

762
00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:55.330
The two brothers who incidentally are the brothers of Plato.

763
00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:57.530
Uh,

764
00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:57.850
we should,

765
00:39:57.850 --> 00:39:59.050
I should say we know,

766
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.011
to my knowledge,

767
00:40:00.011 --> 00:40:02.670
we know nothing more about glaucoma and addy,

768
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.150
Amanda's from history,

769
00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:07.960
but Plato put them into his dialogue,

770
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.633
put them into the,

771
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:13.210
they will always be remembered as the two brothers in the dialogue.

772
00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:13.781
And again,

773
00:40:13.781 --> 00:40:17.470
they seem to represent something quite different.

774
00:40:17.471 --> 00:40:22.450
And bear this in mind as you are reading the book because it is easy to kind of,

775
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:24.130
uh,

776
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.830
forget who's talking and what they represent.

777
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:34.510
Adding a Mantis is we will find a kind of hedonistic and pleasure seeking

778
00:40:35.141 --> 00:40:35.974
brother.

779
00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:37.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

780
00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:41.900
<v 0>And Glaucon whose name means something like gleaming,</v>

781
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:43.123
shining,

782
00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:44.643
uh,

783
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:47.120
is the fierce and warlike,

784
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.430
uh,

785
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:48.560
of the two brothers.

786
00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.610
And of course there is the philosophically minded Socrates.

787
00:40:52.611 --> 00:40:53.090
Again,

788
00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:56.750
each of them seems to represent in a superior way.

789
00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:57.920
Uh,

790
00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.080
the key components of the human soul,

791
00:41:00.081 --> 00:41:01.040
the appetitive,

792
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.960
the warlike or spirited,

793
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:03.561
uh,

794
00:41:03.561 --> 00:41:05.450
and the rational together.

795
00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.840
These figures farm a kind of microcosm of humanity.

796
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:16.690
Each of the participants in the dialogue represents one of the specific classes

797
00:41:17.031 --> 00:41:22.031
or groups that will eventually occupy the just city to which Plato or Socrates

798
00:41:23.091 --> 00:41:26.120
gives the name [inaudible] the beautiful city.

799
00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.760
<v 1>All right.</v>

800
00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:37.570
<v 0>In the five minutes or so that remain,</v>

801
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:38.020
let's,

802
00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:43.020
let's just talk for a moment about the first conversation with the head of the

803
00:41:44.651 --> 00:41:45.760
family capitalists.

804
00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:49.660
We don't need to look at this a great length.

805
00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.620
I want you can,

806
00:41:50.621 --> 00:41:55.621
I'm sure in your sections you might want to talk about the arguments a little

807
00:41:55.721 --> 00:42:00.160
more specifically that are used in two ds in these first three sets of

808
00:42:00.161 --> 00:42:02.080
conversations between capitalists,

809
00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:02.381
Paula,

810
00:42:02.381 --> 00:42:03.540
Marcus and Thrasymachus.

811
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.960
The question,

812
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:05.890
more importantly,

813
00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:06.760
the question,

814
00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.470
I don't know that it's more importantly,

815
00:42:08.471 --> 00:42:13.471
but the question I want us to examine a little bit here in the time remaining is

816
00:42:13.511 --> 00:42:14.860
what is what again,

817
00:42:14.861 --> 00:42:15.131
these,

818
00:42:15.131 --> 00:42:18.640
these characters represent capitalists is his name,

819
00:42:18.641 --> 00:42:19.960
implies capitalists.

820
00:42:19.961 --> 00:42:20.860
What does that mean?

821
00:42:20.861 --> 00:42:21.580
Do you know?

822
00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.090
Head,

823
00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:22.923
yes,

824
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:23.980
half of his head,

825
00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.290
the head of the household,

826
00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:31.980
but also clearly the claims of a age of tradition,

827
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:34.263
of family.

828
00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:39.400
And at the beginning of the dialogue when Paula Marcus has brought his friends

829
00:42:39.401 --> 00:42:40.330
back to the house,

830
00:42:40.331 --> 00:42:45.190
we see the aged father capitalists use just returning from prayer.

831
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.520
He has just returned from performing certain act of ritual sacrifice and he

832
00:42:51.551 --> 00:42:53.920
greets Socrates in many ways.

833
00:42:53.921 --> 00:42:55.390
As a long lost friend,

834
00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.480
perhaps you have had this experience yourself,

835
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:59.740
a slightly,

836
00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.200
always slightly uncomfortable one.

837
00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:05.770
When you bring a group of your friends,

838
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:06.220
uh,

839
00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.480
back to your house,

840
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.690
you're going to have a,

841
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:13.690
you're expecting to have a good time and your grandparents is there and says,

842
00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:14.621
oh,

843
00:43:14.621 --> 00:43:17.160
it's so good to see a bunch of young people,

844
00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:17.590
La,

845
00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:17.840
uh,

846
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.300
I want to talk with you.

847
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.901
And,

848
00:43:19.901 --> 00:43:20.320
uh,

849
00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.420
it's always slightly uncomfortable,

850
00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:22.930
uh,

851
00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:23.770
moment too.

852
00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:24.461
You might say,

853
00:43:24.461 --> 00:43:25.294
we are all,

854
00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:25.900
uh,

855
00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.040
Kev experience,

856
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.420
uh,

857
00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.750
of this kind of thing.

858
00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:30.100
Uh,

859
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.350
everybody knows it from either end.

860
00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:33.430
I'm not a grandparent,

861
00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:34.293
thank God,

862
00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:35.290
but,

863
00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:36.123
uh,

864
00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.900
I feel the same thing often when Mike's son brings his friends that I've maybe

865
00:43:40.901 --> 00:43:42.680
that I've known for a long time.

866
00:43:42.681 --> 00:43:43.420
And uh,

867
00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:43.691
how,

868
00:43:43.691 --> 00:43:44.620
how are you doing?

869
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:46.170
They don't want any,

870
00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:46.670
hmm.

871
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:47.503
Want to get away?

872
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:48.643
Uh,

873
00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.100
and Socrates does something rather,

874
00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:51.530
uh,

875
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:51.690
uh,

876
00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:52.523
Brock,

877
00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:53.943
uh,

878
00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.250
tell me [inaudible] what's it like to be so old?

879
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:59.140
What does it like to,

880
00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:03.910
to be like you and do you still feel the need for sex?

881
00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:06.291
You know,

882
00:44:06.291 --> 00:44:09.910
can you imagine that saying that to someone's grandfather?

883
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:13.160
Cause you a little idea of the character of Socrates

884
00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.880
and capitalists is so happy.

885
00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:17.360
Oh,

886
00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.950
thank God I'm past that.

887
00:44:18.951 --> 00:44:19.491
He says,

888
00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:19.761
you know,

889
00:44:19.761 --> 00:44:23.780
thank God I no longer feel this erotic desire.

890
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.930
And at my old age I can spend my time.

891
00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:28.460
What do you think young man,

892
00:44:28.461 --> 00:44:29.420
that's all I did.

893
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:31.470
I was thinking about sex all the time.

894
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.080
And when I wasn't thinking about that I was making money.

895
00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.320
But now I've had my fill of both.

896
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.320
And I can spend my later years,

897
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:40.870
my law,

898
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:41.370
my Dick,

899
00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:43.200
the twilight of my life,

900
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.230
turning to the things about the gods,

901
00:44:46.231 --> 00:44:49.040
performing sacrifices commanded by the gods.

902
00:44:49.041 --> 00:44:49.291
When I say,

903
00:44:49.291 --> 00:44:52.290
why does Plato Begin this way?

904
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.393
Well,

905
00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:54.930
carefulness is,

906
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:55.800
as is,

907
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.491
should be clear,

908
00:44:56.491 --> 00:45:01.491
the very embodiment of the conventional in both senses of that term.

909
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:02.191
He,

910
00:45:02.191 --> 00:45:04.590
he's not a bad man by any means,

911
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:10.040
but he is a thoroughly unreflective one and an attacking capitalists as he does.

912
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:16.140
Socrates attacks the embodiment of conventional opinion,

913
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:17.390
the know most,

914
00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:17.911
uh,

915
00:45:17.911 --> 00:45:19.050
supporting the city.

916
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:19.740
Uh,

917
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:24.740
no the way Socrates manipulates the dialogue or the conversation capitalists has

918
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:26.810
sticked.

919
00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:28.980
Keffeler says that the pious man,

920
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:29.970
the just man,

921
00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:30.850
uh,

922
00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:33.960
practices justice by sacrificing to the gods.

923
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:39.180
And Socrates turns that into the statement that justice means paying your debts

924
00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:41.820
and returning what is owed to you.

925
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:43.590
Uh,

926
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:45.840
capitalists in an easy going manner,

927
00:45:45.841 --> 00:45:46.674
agrees.

928
00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:47.601
And then soccer,

929
00:45:47.601 --> 00:45:47.971
he says,

930
00:45:47.971 --> 00:45:48.121
well,

931
00:45:48.121 --> 00:45:52.620
what would you think about returning a weapon that you had borrowed from a

932
00:45:52.621 --> 00:45:55.020
friend or someone who was in a,

933
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:55.640
uh,

934
00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:55.890
you know,

935
00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:56.910
very depressed.

936
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:59.220
We might say depressed frame of mind.

937
00:45:59.280 --> 00:45:59.570
Would,

938
00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:00.870
would that be just,

939
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:01.430
uh,

940
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:02.880
how do you explain that?

941
00:46:02.881 --> 00:46:03.720
Would you do that?

942
00:46:03.721 --> 00:46:06.270
If justice means paying your debts,

943
00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.660
giving back to each what,

944
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.513
what is owed?

945
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:10.200
And at that moment,

946
00:46:10.201 --> 00:46:13.860
capitalists excuses himself from the dialogue and says,

947
00:46:13.861 --> 00:46:14.910
rather abruptly,

948
00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:15.390
uh,

949
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:16.790
I have to go out and,

950
00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:17.061
and,

951
00:46:17.061 --> 00:46:17.271
and,

952
00:46:17.271 --> 00:46:18.001
and continue,

953
00:46:18.001 --> 00:46:18.780
continue,

954
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:20.400
continue my sacrifices,

955
00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:21.070
uh,

956
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:21.430
in,

957
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:22.110
in the,

958
00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:22.943
in the garden.

959
00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:24.151
Socrates,

960
00:46:24.151 --> 00:46:24.781
in other words,

961
00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:29.781
has broken the bond of tradition and traditional authority that holds the

962
00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:34.590
ancient city and the ancient family together.

963
00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:36.970
Capitalists is banished from the dialogue.

964
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Tread tradition is banished and we never hear another word about it for the next

965
00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:45.600
400 or so pages.

966
00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:46.500
Uh,

967
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.120
that's the way Socrates,

968
00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:48.690
uh,

969
00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:49.523
begins,

970
00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:49.980
uh,

971
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:50.520
this,

972
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:50.880
uh,

973
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.260
dialogue or that's the way Plato has Socrates beginning.

974
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:54.991
And,

975
00:46:54.991 --> 00:46:55.410
uh,

976
00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:55.621
we'll,

977
00:46:55.621 --> 00:46:56.190
we'll look,

978
00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:58.230
we'll look a little more at some of these,

979
00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:58.540
uh,

980
00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.090
in our class for next time,

981
00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:02.730
and then move into the characters,

982
00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:03.000
uh,

983
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.120
of adding a mantis and Glaucon in any way.

984
00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:07.350
Start your reading,

985
00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:08.910
continue your reading and your,

986
00:47:08.911 --> 00:47:09.720

So enjoy yourselves.
