1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.610
Because it's a makeup class.

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.580
We'll do something a little special because we're going to show a clip.

3
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.443
A movie,

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.903
uh,

5
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.343
uh,

6
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.760
did I think is particularly appropriate out is we get into it.

7
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:15.840
I'll tell you why.

8
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.850
Stupid about a five minute segment from a film called the third man.

9
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.940
Has anyone ever seen it?

10
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.110
Okay.

11
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.610
Maybe more than I thought.

12
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.390
Uh,

13
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.040
just to set up this scene,

14
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:30.990
for those of you who have seen it more,

15
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:32.750
for those of you who haven't this,

16
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.040
this is a film was made in 1948,

17
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.090
uh,

18
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.080
called the third man,

19
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.320
uh,

20
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.320
from a Graham Greene short story and it takes place in post World War II,

21
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.720
Vienna and the clip,

22
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:46.710
we're going to see,

23
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.510
uh,

24
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.190
the most famous part of the movie,

25
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.210
uh,

26
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.471
cakes,

27
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:54.630
poster of a conversation between two old friends.

28
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:57.620
One of them played by Orson Welles,

29
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:58.380
uh,

30
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.970
is in a black market,

31
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.830
a racket in,

32
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.220
uh,

33
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.053
in Vienna,

34
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.821
uh,

35
00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:08.310
and is making a living doing something very bad,

36
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.700
uh,

37
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.690
in the black market.

38
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.040
And in this scene,

39
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:14.280
he's trying to convince an old school friend of his,

40
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.900
uh,

41
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.290
played by Joseph Cotton to join a join this thing.

42
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:19.891
He is also,

43
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:24.510
I should say the Orson Welles character has also faked his death.

44
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.381
Uh,

45
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:28.500
so no one except his immediate,

46
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:29.010
uh,

47
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.350
conspirators node knows he's still alive.

48
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:32.310
I should have said that.

49
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.690
He's faked his death.

50
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:38.691
And here he has a scene with his old school friend played by Joseph Cotton and

51
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:44.151
he's trying to convince him to come into his black market racket.

52
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.790
So here,

53
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.050
here comes a third man,

54
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.840
a good sane,

55
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.441
and it's,

56
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:50.274
um,

57
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.400
it's good because I think it conveys something of the flavor of Machiavelli's

58
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.733
thought,

59
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.910
not Italy for 30 years under the Borgias.

60
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.630
This is Machiavelli's time,

61
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.660
bloodshed and murder and Leonardo Da Vinci and the renaissance for sweat under

62
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:13.560
Switzerland for 500 years' peace and democracy.

63
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.311
We did it,

64
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:15.600
produce the cuckoo clock.

65
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.853
Um,

66
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.750
and,

67
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.030
uh,

68
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.860
talk about that in a moment.

69
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.390
But I,

70
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.050
I want to talk begin by talking about who was Machiavelli,

71
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.670
how do we read the prints?

72
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.790
A marquee value was a Florentine,

73
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.010
and to know that,

74
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.430
uh,

75
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.560
is to know virtually everything you need to know about him.

76
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.550
Uh,

77
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.680
I'm exaggerating,

78
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.730
but,

79
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.061
uh,

80
00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:39.361
I do.

81
00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:40.440
So to make a point,

82
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.260
Florence was a republic.

83
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.440
It was a city state in Machiavelli,

84
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.470
spent a good deal of his adult life in the service of the republic living in

85
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:54.930
Florence,

86
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.211
uh,

87
00:02:55.211 --> 00:02:58.740
the center of the renaissance at the height of the renaissance,

88
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.170
Machiavelli wished to do for politics what his contemporaries like Leonardo Da

89
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.710
Vinci and Michelangelo had done for art and sculptor.

90
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.481
In other words,

91
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:15.130
he hoped to revive in some way to spirit of the ancients of antiquity,

92
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.300
but to modify it in the lights of his own experience and does,

93
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:22.840
he puts it in the dedication of his most famous book.

94
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.490
He writes this book,

95
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:29.440
the prince is a product of long experience with modern things into continuous

96
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:34.000
reading of the ancient ones in Machiavelli,

97
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:39.001
we have what we have come to call modernity given its first and most powerful

98
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:41.644
expression,

99
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.970
but Machiavelli was not a,

100
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.770
an ordinary Florentine.

101
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.200
He grew up under the rule of the [inaudible] and I'd had is to say the first

102
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:55.150
family of Florence,

103
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.390
uh,

104
00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.390
and live to see them deposed by a Dominican friar by the name of Savannah,

105
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:06.421
Rola Savonarola attempted to impose a kind of theocracy and Florence,

106
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.470
uh,

107
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.060
sort of Christian Republic of virtue,

108
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.330
but the Florentines being what they were,

109
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:17.443
uh,

110
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.620
rejected this idea and the rule of Savannah Rola was short lived and in its

111
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:24.700
place,

112
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.250
a republic was reestablished,

113
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.940
a where Machiavelli occupied the office of Secretary to the second chancery,

114
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:34.930
a kind of diplomatic post,

115
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.940
which he held for 14 years from 1498 to 15,

116
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:40.774
12.

117
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.140
And after the fall of the republic and the return of the meditate to princely

118
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:47.974
rule there,

119
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.560
Machiavelli was exiled from the city,

120
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.340
from politics to a smaller state that he owned on the outskirts of the city.

121
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.630
And you can visit it today.

122
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.660
And it was here from a place of political exile that he wrote his major works,

123
00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:07.204
the prints,

124
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.410
the discourses on Livy and the art of war.

125
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.760
And it was from here also that he wrote voluminous letters to friends seeking

126
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:20.620
knowledge about politics.

127
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.280
Machiavelli was a kind of political junkie,

128
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:27.670
you could say in things happenings,

129
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.420
uh,

130
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.650
in Italy and elsewhere.

131
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.040
And in one of these letters,

132
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:33.760
a famous letter to his friend,

133
00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:35.830
a man named Francesco Vettori,

134
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.600
he describes how he came to write his most famous book.

135
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.820
And I want to read a passage from that letter.

136
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.530
And it was also,

137
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:49.531
I should say on the basis of this letter with this why I asked people from time

138
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:51.970
to time to remove their caps,

139
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.620
uh,

140
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.110
in a,

141
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.090
in the classroom from the house of study.

142
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.680
This is the way Machiavelli study.

143
00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.960
When evening comes,

144
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:00.794
he writes,

145
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.270
I returned to my house and go to my study at the door.

146
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:08.810
I take off my clothes of the day covered with muck and dirt,

147
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.350
and I put on my regal and courtly garments.

148
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.160
And decently reclothed I entered the ancient courts of ancient men were received

149
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:20.150
by them lovingly.

150
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.410
I feed on the food.

151
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:24.170
That alone is mine and that I was born for

152
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.601
there.

153
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:30.020
I am not ashamed to speak with them and to ask them the reasons for their

154
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:33.350
actions and they in their humanity reply to me.

155
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.070
And for the space of four hours every night,

156
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:38.300
I feel no boredom.

157
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.830
I forget every pain.

158
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.070
I do not fear poverty and death does not frightened me.

159
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.910
I deliver myself entirely unto them.

160
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.680
And because Dante says that to have understood without retention does not make

161
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:52.514
knowledge.

162
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.140
I have noted what capitol I have made from their conversations and have composed

163
00:06:57.141 --> 00:07:02.141
a little work on principalities where I delve as deeply as I can into

164
00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:03.890
reflections on this subject,

165
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:04.724
debating,

166
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.870
debating what a principality is of what kinds they are,

167
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.340
how they are required,

168
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.330
how they are maintained and what the why they are lost.

169
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.180
So there Matthia valley gives you,

170
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.240
gives us a sense of the seriousness with which he approached his subject,

171
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.410
how he studied and what it was he came to.

172
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:28.244
Right.

173
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.070
Let me just say from the beginning,

174
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.460
uh,

175
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.530
the prince is a deceptive book.

176
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:34.760
Uh,

177
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.210
what else would we expect from a name,

178
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:39.860
from the name of a man?

179
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:40.430
Uh,

180
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.220
that has become synonymous with deception.

181
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.140
It is a work,

182
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:50.140
the prints that everybody has heard of perhaps has some preconception about.

183
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.460
Uh,

184
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.460
I was checking the web yesterday and I found a new book about Machiavelli,

185
00:07:57.921 --> 00:08:00.890
which none of these ever fail to surprise me.

186
00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:05.891
This one is called the suit Machiavelli and guide to men's fashion.

187
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.883
Check it out.

188
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.753
Uh,

189
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.140
who knows.

190
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.090
Machiavelli's name is everywhere.

191
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:19.210
It is applied to everything from corporate executives how to do men's fashion.

192
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:26.000
Everybody knows or thinks they know what his work is about.

193
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.040
His name again,

194
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.900
is synonymous with deception,

195
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:30.763
treachery,

196
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.270
cunning deceit.

197
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.720
Just look at the cover of your book.

198
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.150
Look at his face,

199
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:39.470
look at his smile.

200
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.350
Really more of a smirk.

201
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:43.880
Uh,

202
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.560
he seems to be saying,

203
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.840
I know something you don't know.

204
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:54.220
The difficulty with reading Machiavelli today is that we all think we already

205
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.030
what he knows,

206
00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.800
and that is false.

207
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.760
Mocking your valley was a revolutionary

208
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.840
in the preface to his largest book,

209
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.070
the discourses on Livy.

210
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:13.071
He compares himself with Chris to Christopher Columbus for his discovery of what

211
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:18.261
he calls new modes and orders would Columbus had done for geography.

212
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.130
Machiavelli claims he will do for politics.

213
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:26.730
That is to say discover an entirely new continent,

214
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:28.020
a new world,

215
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.251
so to speak,

216
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:30.810
the new world of Machiavelli,

217
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.120
Machiavelli's new world.

218
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:38.130
His new modes and orders will require clearly a displacement of the earlier one

219
00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:41.400
of the previous one.

220
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.130
When Machiavelli wrote,

221
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.701
of course,

222
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:49.050
the dominant form of political organization was the empire,

223
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.910
or to speak more precisely the Christian empire,

224
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.340
the Holy Roman Empire.

225
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:56.671
It was,

226
00:09:56.671 --> 00:10:01.671
it was known in the time of Machiavelli was the successor to the ancient Roman

227
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.240
state,

228
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.400
the older Roman Empire.

229
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.560
Both of these empires had aspired to a kind of universality,

230
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.320
and this universality was given expression in Dante is famous treatise,

231
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.740
the Monarchia of monarchy that set out a model for a universal Christian state

232
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.150
based on the unity and oneness of the human race.

233
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.590
Under a Christian ruler,

234
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.480
Machiavelli rejected this idea of the empire in harked back instead to the model

235
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.060
of Republican Rome.

236
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:45.150
And there is much in his writing that recalls the sort of extraordinary virtues

237
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:50.010
and capacities of the citizens of the ancient Republican city state.

238
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:56.030
But you might say just as Machiavelli broke with the dominant model of Christian

239
00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:57.030
universalism,

240
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.810
so too did he reject the ancient model of the small autonomous republican state.

241
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:11.180
He makes this clear in a famous passage at the beginning of chapter 15 of the

242
00:11:11.581 --> 00:11:12.414
prints,

243
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.730
and I just wanted to read that passage as well

244
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:16.591
here.

245
00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:17.610
Machiavelli's tears,

246
00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:19.890
I depart from the orders of others.

247
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.200
I depart from their modes,

248
00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:23.034
he says,

249
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.360
but since it is my intent to write something useful to whoever understands it,

250
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.130
it has appeared to me more fitting to go directly to the effectual of truth of

251
00:11:32.131 --> 00:11:34.170
things then to the imagination of it.

252
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.580
In many have imagined when things here of Plato perhaps,

253
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.560
but also to Christianity,

254
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:45.540
many of imagined republics and principalities that have never been seen or known

255
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:50.541
to exist in truth for it is far from how one lives to how one should lives.

256
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:57.020
That he who lets go of what is done for what should be done learns his ruling

257
00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.930
rather than his preservation.

258
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:00.850
In other words,

259
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.283
no cities,

260
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.630
no platonic cities and speech,

261
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.690
no Augustinian cities of God.

262
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:08.680
Uh,

263
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.760
we will only look,

264
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:12.400
he says to the effectual truth of things,

265
00:12:12.401 --> 00:12:14.230
the effectual truth of the matter,

266
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.510
not the imagination of it or the utopia of it.

267
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:23.080
That passage is often taken to be the beginning of Chapter 15,

268
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.230
the essence of machiavellian realism,

269
00:12:26.231 --> 00:12:29.320
a kind of rail politic as it were.

270
00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:33.940
His appeal from the art to the is to take one's bearings again from the

271
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:35.410
effectual truth of things.

272
00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:36.630
Just uh,

273
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.470
this seems to be in many ways the essence of his teaching to be sure.

274
00:12:41.471 --> 00:12:46.210
And Machiavelli focuses on key aspects of political reality,

275
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:50.470
which are often ignored by thinkers like Plato and Aristotle,

276
00:12:50.471 --> 00:12:51.304
murders,

277
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:52.690
conspiracies,

278
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.010
coup d'etat.

279
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.490
These are the kinds of political phenomenon phenomena.

280
00:12:57.491 --> 00:12:58.301
He is interested.

281
00:12:58.301 --> 00:13:03.130
He seems to be more interested in the evils that human beings do.

282
00:13:03.131 --> 00:13:05.140
Then the goods to which they aspire.

283
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.050
You might even say that Machiavelli takes delight in demonstrating,

284
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:12.790
much to our Chagrin,

285
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.480
the space between our lofty intentions and the actual consequences of our deeds.

286
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:26.170
And yet it would seem to me there is more to Machiavelli valley then the term

287
00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:27.730
realism connotes.

288
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.350
Although that is certainly important

289
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.010
in this passage,

290
00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:34.030
Machiavelli announces his brake,

291
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:34.531
indeed,

292
00:13:34.531 --> 00:13:39.510
his repudiation of all those who have come before,

293
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.130
all those who have come before

294
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.280
he both replaces and yet reconfigures according to his own lights,

295
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:54.460
elements from both the Christian Empire in the Roman republic to create a new

296
00:13:54.981 --> 00:13:56.960
form of political organization,

297
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.060
distinctly his own,

298
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.840
what we might call today the modern state Machiavelli is the founder did

299
00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:09.200
discover the inventor of the modern state.

300
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.120
This modern secular sovereign state was refined and developed in the decades and

301
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:26.140
centuries after Machiavelli and the writing of hubs of lock of Rousseau,

302
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:31.860
just say nothing of contemporary 20th century writers from both the right and

303
00:14:32.051 --> 00:14:33.820
the left mocks vapor.

304
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:39.300
Carl Schmidt to a man and Italian philosopher named Antonio Gramsci.

305
00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:40.420
Yeah.

306
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.970
Who was the author of a book,

307
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
interestingly called the modern prints based on Machiavelli himself,

308
00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:50.860
Machiavelli's state itself,

309
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.990
universalist ambitions in many ways,

310
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:57.200
much like it's Christian and Roman predecessors,

311
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.550
but this is a state he believes that has now been liberated or at least or

312
00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:06.551
emancipated from Christian and classical conceptions of virtue.

313
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:12.890
The management of affairs is left to those people who he calls princess,

314
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.710
which is the machiavellian usage,

315
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.740
designates a new kind of political founder or leader endowed with a new species

316
00:15:21.561 --> 00:15:22.430
of ambition,

317
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.700
love of glory and elements of Prophetic Authority that we might call charisma.

318
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:33.420
<v 2>Okay,</v>

319
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:38.420
<v 0>but just what was the nature of the revolution contemplated by our founder,</v>

320
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.550
Machiavelli,

321
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.930
the founder of modern political science?

322
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:48.710
Consider just for a moment the title in dedication of the book,

323
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:54.050
the prince appears on its surface to be a most conventional work.

324
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.690
It presents itself in the long tradition of what has come to be called the

325
00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:00.970
mirror of princes.

326
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:06.430
Books that give a kind of guide to the do's and don'ts of princely behavior.

327
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.433
Fair enough.

328
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.270
It seems to go back a long,

329
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.163
long time.

330
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:19.770
And the appearance of conventionality is supported by the opening words of the

331
00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:23.500
book in his dedicatory letter.

332
00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:28.010
The first words are first line out of his mouth are,

333
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.320
the first lines are,

334
00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:30.460
it is customary.

335
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:31.923
He says,

336
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:37.030
it is a work intended to ingratiate himself to Lorenzo de Medici,

337
00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:42.450
the man to whom the work is dedicated accustomary prints a traditional prince

338
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.820
who has just regained his power.

339
00:16:45.821 --> 00:16:46.660
But look again,

340
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.170
consider the structure of the first three chapters.

341
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.630
All States,

342
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:58.900
all dominions that have held in do hold empire over men are either republics are

343
00:16:59.571 --> 00:17:00.620
principalities.

344
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.830
He says in the opening sentence of chapter one

345
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.680
have distinguished two kinds of two and only two kinds of regimes,

346
00:17:09.681 --> 00:17:12.830
republics and principalities as the only ones worth mentioning.

347
00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:16.130
He goes on to distinguish two kinds of principalities.

348
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.170
There are hereditary principalities like those,

349
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.620
uh,

350
00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.510
currently run by Lorenzo,

351
00:17:23.511 --> 00:17:24.320
which are required,

352
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.430
which acquire their authority through tradition and bloodlines,

353
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.590
hereditary blood lines.

354
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:34.790
And then he says there are new princes in new principalities.

355
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.960
Machiavelli then asserts that his book will deal only with principalities

356
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.043
leaving.

357
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.110
He says the discussion of republics for elsewhere.

358
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.570
What one is tombs is discourses on Livy,

359
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.410
which he was already writing by this time.

360
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.690
But then Machiavelli goes home to tell the reader that the exclusive subject of

361
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:55.524
this book,

362
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.280
the entire exclusive subject will be the new prints.

363
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:00.510
In other words,

364
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.550
not Lorenzo at all,

365
00:18:02.551 --> 00:18:06.100
but precisely princes who have or will chew,

366
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.690
achieve Dera Authority through their own guile,

367
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.260
their own force or their own veer to,

368
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.520
to use the famous machiavellian term that I want to talk about later.

369
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.833
The true,

370
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:19.591
in other words,

371
00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:24.120
recipient of this book must be necessarily the potential plants.

372
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:29.150
That is to say someone with sufficient political audacity to create their own

373
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:30.863
authority,

374
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.070
who is not simply received it from the past,

375
00:18:35.071 --> 00:18:37.380
but to create their own authority.

376
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:42.410
Maybe one could even say Machiavelli's prince is in a way the first truly self

377
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:43.860
made man.

378
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:51.360
So what then is the character of this new prints and how does he differ from

379
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.870
more conventional modes of princely or political authority?

380
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.800
And in one of the most famous chapters of the book,

381
00:18:59.801 --> 00:19:04.801
chapters six entitled of New principalities that are acquired to one's own arms

382
00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:06.820
and virtue.

383
00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.710
There's that word again,

384
00:19:08.711 --> 00:19:11.440
veer to one own arms and virtue.

385
00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:16.120
Machiavelli discusses the character of the modern prints,

386
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.983
the new prints,

387
00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.740
a prudent man he writes,

388
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:24.700
should always enter upon the pads beaten by great men,

389
00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:30.210
and imitate those who have been most excellent so that if its own virtue does

390
00:19:30.311 --> 00:19:31.960
not reach that far,

391
00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.630
it at least is in the odor of it.

392
00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.270
We at least come within,

393
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:37.931
you might say,

394
00:19:37.931 --> 00:19:41.050
sniffing distance of their greatness.

395
00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:42.851
Once you do,

396
00:19:42.851 --> 00:19:43.331
he says,

397
00:19:43.331 --> 00:19:46.420
what Archer's do when attempting to reach a distant target,

398
00:19:46.421 --> 00:19:48.490
namely aim your bow high,

399
00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.930
knowing that the force of gravity will bring the Arrow down.

400
00:19:52.931 --> 00:19:53.561
In other words,

401
00:19:53.561 --> 00:19:56.800
set your sights high knowing you will probably fall short.

402
00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.010
So who are the greatest examples?

403
00:20:00.011 --> 00:20:03.850
He says of princely rule that the prudent man,

404
00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.540
interesting choice of words the prudent man should imitate.

405
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.103
<v 1>Okay.</v>

406
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:15.230
<v 0>And here Machiavelli gives a list of those heroic founders of peoples in states,</v>

407
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:16.853
Moses,

408
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.510
Cyrus,

409
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.750
Romulus,

410
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:19.590
Theseus,

411
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.353
and so on.

412
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.800
It's one examines their actions and lives.

413
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:26.971
He writes,

414
00:20:26.971 --> 00:20:30.600
one does not see that they had anything else from fortune.

415
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.630
Then the opportunity which you gave them,

416
00:20:33.631 --> 00:20:38.340
the matter enabling them to introduce any form they pleased.

417
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:43.760
Notice in that sentence he uses those areas Tutelian terms form and matter that

418
00:20:43.801 --> 00:20:46.860
we spoke about in relation to the Aristotelian regime.

419
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.600
They had nothing else from fortune.

420
00:20:49.601 --> 00:20:50.530
He says again,

421
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.910
then the opportunity,

422
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:55.720
the occasion that gave them the matter,

423
00:20:55.721 --> 00:21:00.220
enabling them to introduce any farm they pleased.

424
00:21:00.221 --> 00:21:03.220
In short Machiavelli claims,

425
00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:07.990
these were founders who created in a way ex Nihilo out of nothing.

426
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:13.860
They only had the occasion and a kind of formless matter upon which they could,

427
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:15.941
uh,

428
00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.970
adopt and impose any farm they took.

429
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.020
And they had of course,

430
00:21:20.021 --> 00:21:25.021
the strength of mind as well as the audacity and cunning to take advantage of

431
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:27.280
this situation.

432
00:21:27.281 --> 00:21:28.750
Such opportunities.

433
00:21:28.751 --> 00:21:30.310
He writes such occasions,

434
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.590
made these men successful and they're excellent virtue enabled the opportunity

435
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:36.580
to be recognized.

436
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:41.200
Hence their father lands were ennobled by it and they became prosperous.

437
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.220
They took advantage of their opportunity,

438
00:21:47.221 --> 00:21:51.430
seized their opportunity and impose their own farm up upon it.

439
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:57.030
And it is here that Machiavelli introduces his famous distinction between armed

440
00:21:57.461 --> 00:21:58.900
and unarmed profits.

441
00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.420
All the armed profits,

442
00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:01.901
he says,

443
00:22:01.901 --> 00:22:05.200
conquered and the unarmed were ruined.

444
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.050
This seems to be,

445
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:08.620
and,

446
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.430
and is clearly a kind of classic statement of share,

447
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.020
Machiavellian power,

448
00:22:14.021 --> 00:22:14.854
politics.

449
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:20.190
All politics grows out of the barrel of a gun is a famous 20th century

450
00:22:20.741 --> 00:22:21.670
Machiavellian.

451
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.480
Uh,

452
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.410
once put it,

453
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:24.570
uh,

454
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.660
on the armed crossfits conquer the unarmed lose,

455
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.050
but there seems to be more to it than this.

456
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:32.830
Uh,

457
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.950
Machiavelli compares the prince to a profit.

458
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.050
Why does he use that language?

459
00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.610
What is a profit?

460
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:40.750
Uh,

461
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.890
the most obvious answer is a person to whom God speaks.

462
00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.353
Uh,

463
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:49.150
Machiavelli's armed profits,

464
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:49.960
uh,

465
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.960
may not be religious figures and they are not necessarily recipients of divine

466
00:22:55.691 --> 00:22:56.524
knowledge,

467
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:58.030
but they seem to be,

468
00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.020
at least on his account,

469
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.080
people have exceptional personal qualities that allow them to bring laws to be

470
00:23:05.171 --> 00:23:07.000
law bringers law givers,

471
00:23:07.001 --> 00:23:08.860
shapers of institutions,

472
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.250
and also reformers of opinions,

473
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:12.970
uh,

474
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.040
that govern our lives.

475
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:21.150
Machiavelli's armed profit is more than just a gangster like Orson Welles and

476
00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:24.790
that part he is a teacher.

477
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.650
And to kind of educator,

478
00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:27.520
uh,

479
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.353
as well,

480
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.150
you might even think in your class and your sections.

481
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:38.160
How or in what ways does Machiavelli's armed profit differ in important ways?

482
00:23:39.611 --> 00:23:44.611
Both from Plato's philosopher King as well as Aristotle's notion of the

483
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:48.650
[inaudible] as their sort of magnanimous statesman.

484
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:55.150
Although this kind of talk about armed profits always when is characteristic of

485
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:56.240
Machiavelli.

486
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.240
He likes this kind of tough talk.

487
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:00.680
Uh,

488
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:05.680
he clearly recognizes that there are clear exceptions to his rule about armed

489
00:24:06.651 --> 00:24:07.484
profits.

490
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:09.920
Who comes to mind most vividly,

491
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:16.270
who in other words is not present in Machiavelli's list of great profits that

492
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:18.320
one should imitate?

493
00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:22.283
<v 1>Yes,</v>

494
00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.930
<v 0>most of hobbyists perhaps certainly to his contemporaries.</v>

495
00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:30.931
Jesus who triumphed through words in teaching alone.

496
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.880
He had no troops.

497
00:24:33.881 --> 00:24:34.780
He had no arms.

498
00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.480
He established a religion first,

499
00:24:37.481 --> 00:24:38.740
a sect you might say,

500
00:24:38.741 --> 00:24:39.640
than a religion.

501
00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:41.530
Then eventually an empire,

502
00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.270
the holy Roman Empire that was established in the name of that teaching words

503
00:24:46.271 --> 00:24:49.180
may well be a powerful weapon,

504
00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:49.890
uh,

505
00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.340
as powerful as a gun.

506
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.350
And then you might say,

507
00:24:53.351 --> 00:24:55.300
what is Machiavelli himself?

508
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.900
What is the teaching of who is Machiavelli?

509
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.540
But an archetypal unarmed profit.

510
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:03.610
He has no troops.

511
00:25:03.611 --> 00:25:04.960
He has no territory.

512
00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:06.940
He controls no real estate.

513
00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:08.770
He's been banished.

514
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.230
Yet he is clearly attempting to conquer,

515
00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:16.320
comparing himself to Columbus to conquer in large part to the transformation of

516
00:25:17.021 --> 00:25:19.240
our understanding of good and evil,

517
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.260
a virtue and vice in order.

518
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:23.891
In other words,

519
00:25:23.891 --> 00:25:25.300
to make people obey you,

520
00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.280
you must first make them believe,

521
00:25:27.281 --> 00:25:29.140
you know,

522
00:25:29.141 --> 00:25:29.974
prophetic.

523
00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.710
Machiavelli's prophetic prints,

524
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:33.461
in other words,

525
00:25:33.461 --> 00:25:38.461
must have some of the qualities of a philosopher as well as a religious reformer

526
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.520
trying to reshape and remold human opinion is specially opinion over,

527
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:46.181
as we say,

528
00:25:46.181 --> 00:25:47.200
good and evil,

529
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.180
just and unjust.

530
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.300
What does this reformation,

531
00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:55.120
so to speak or transformation consist of?

532
00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:01.150
You might even call this Machiavelli in the garden of good and evil,

533
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.170
midnight in the garden of good and evil for Machiavelli.

534
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:10.663
<v 1>Okay,</v>

535
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:11.703
<v 0>one,</v>

536
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:14.203
one,

537
00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:15.963
uh,

538
00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.170
point often

539
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.800
I attributed about Machiavelli is that he introduced a new kind of in moralism

540
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:25.990
into politics

541
00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.230
in that famous chapter,

542
00:26:29.231 --> 00:26:30.280
Chapter 15,

543
00:26:30.281 --> 00:26:30.731
he says,

544
00:26:30.731 --> 00:26:32.680
he sets out to teach the prince.

545
00:26:32.681 --> 00:26:34.180
How not to be good

546
00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.330
striking formulation.

547
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.960
He will teach the prince how not to be good and it perhaps the most important

548
00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:47.190
book on Ana Machiavelli ever written.

549
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.860
The author of that book declared Machiavelli to be a teacher of evil,

550
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:58.080
like what to think about that a teacher of evil is that what is all he was

551
00:26:58.081 --> 00:27:00.000
questions of good and bad

552
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:05.160
virtue and vice appear on virtually every page of the prince.

553
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:11.310
He is not simply a teacher of political pragmatism of how to adjust means to fit

554
00:27:12.001 --> 00:27:12.834
the ends.

555
00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:18.020
He seems to be offering nothing short of a comprehensive revolution

556
00:27:18.151 --> 00:27:19.200
transformation.

557
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.480
If you want to use the Nietzschean language,

558
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:26.570
Trans Valuation of our most basic vocabulary about good and evil,

559
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:32.730
Machiavelli doesn't reject the idea of the good.

560
00:27:32.731 --> 00:27:34.140
Rather he redefines it.

561
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.660
He's continually speaking and in fact,

562
00:27:38.661 --> 00:27:41.630
I would suggest and virtually every page of the book,

563
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:47.350
he's continually speaking the language of virtue is word veer to which a word

564
00:27:48.531 --> 00:27:51.470
that retains the Latin root for the word man.

565
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.250
Vere,

566
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:57.250
we're man and veer to a word that is perhaps best translated or by our word

567
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.040
manliness.

568
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:07.750
What distinguishes Machiavelli's use of this language of veer to manliness is

569
00:28:11.021 --> 00:28:16.021
that he's six two located in certain extreme situations such as political

570
00:28:16.071 --> 00:28:16.904
foundings,

571
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.590
changes of regimes,

572
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.633
wars,

573
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.880
both domestic and foreign kinds.

574
00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.960
What distinguishes Machiavelli from his predecessors in many ways is his attempt

575
00:28:29.361 --> 00:28:32.000
to take the extra ordinary situation.

576
00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:36.770
The extreme situation can the extremes of political founding,

577
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.540
conspiracies wars,

578
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.490
coups is takes them,

579
00:28:40.491 --> 00:28:42.170
is the normal situation,

580
00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:46.640
and then makes morality fit that extreme.

581
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:52.590
His examples are typically drawn from situations of human beings or politics in

582
00:28:54.081 --> 00:28:59.081
extremists with the very survival or independence of a society is at stake.

583
00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:02.870
In those situations you might say,

584
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:07.900
and only in those situations is it permissible to violate the precepts of

585
00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.370
ordinary morality.

586
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.690
In those situations,

587
00:29:11.691 --> 00:29:13.850
one must learn as he says,

588
00:29:13.851 --> 00:29:15.290
how not to be good,

589
00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:20.360
to have to violate the conventions in cannons of ordinary morality.

590
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:25.390
Machiavelli takes his bearings from these extreme states of emergency and in his

591
00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:27.764
own way,

592
00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.401
six,

593
00:29:28.401 --> 00:29:29.540
to normalize them,

594
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:34.870
to present them as as the normal condition of politics.

595
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:43.150
Machiavelli's preference for these extreme situations expresses his belief that

596
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.800
only in moments of great crisis with the very existence of a state is it risk?

597
00:29:50.651 --> 00:29:53.500
Does human nature truly reveal itself?

598
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:59.100
We finally or fully understand what people are only in the most extreme

599
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:00.580
situations.

600
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.740
The paradox that you know,

601
00:30:02.741 --> 00:30:03.551
might say,

602
00:30:03.551 --> 00:30:05.930
runs throughout all of Machiavelli's,

603
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:07.263
uh,

604
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.133
morality

605
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.990
is it the very possibility of group virtue grows out of,

606
00:30:13.991 --> 00:30:17.980
and in fact is even dependent upon the context of chaos,

607
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:18.963
violence,

608
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.020
and disorder that always threatens political world.

609
00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:23.620
Think of it,

610
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.160
I mean,

611
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.690
think of many of our great political models or heroes.

612
00:30:28.691 --> 00:30:33.010
What would the Duke of Marlborough has been without Louie the 14th.

613
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.700
What would Washington has been without George the third?

614
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.750
What would Lincoln has been without the slave interest?

615
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:41.441
What would,

616
00:30:41.441 --> 00:30:43.300
Churchill has been without Hitler?

617
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:44.980
In other words,

618
00:30:44.981 --> 00:30:49.981
his point is that good is only possible because of the prior existence of bad.

619
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:55.990
Good is founded upon evil and even the greatest goods.

620
00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.590
The founding and preservation of cities often require a murder.

621
00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:01.370
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

622
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:04.910
<v 0>What was Romulus is murder of remiss or canes?</v>

623
00:31:04.911 --> 00:31:05.960
Murder of Abel,

624
00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.420
but a kind of murder,

625
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.200
uh,

626
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.030
that founded that at the basis of the founding of cities and civilizations.

627
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:17.570
One thinks in a way of wells as line.

628
00:31:17.571 --> 00:31:21.470
And the third man when he looks down from above and said,

629
00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:22.873
says,

630
00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.373
uh,

631
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:29.330
if I gave you 20,000 pounds for every dot that stopped moving,

632
00:31:29.331 --> 00:31:34.331
would you really tell me to keep my money requires for Machiavelli?

633
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:39.970
The founding of regimes requires that kind of cold and cruel calculation.

634
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:44.791
Of course,

635
00:31:44.791 --> 00:31:48.030
it's being used in the movie just to support a criminal enterprise.

636
00:31:48.031 --> 00:31:48.300
No,

637
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.710
not the founding of a city.

638
00:31:49.711 --> 00:31:50.131
And you might,

639
00:31:50.131 --> 00:31:53.610
we might investigate that as well,

640
00:31:53.611 --> 00:31:58.320
but Machiavelli does not deny that in ordinary times and what we might call

641
00:31:58.321 --> 00:32:00.180
times of normal politics,

642
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.480
the ordinary rules of justice prevail.

643
00:32:03.481 --> 00:32:08.481
He also shows however it normal politics is itself dependent upon extra ordinary

644
00:32:09.211 --> 00:32:10.044
politics,

645
00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:15.170
periods of crisis and arche instability revolution where the normal rules of the

646
00:32:16.381 --> 00:32:17.640
game are suspended.

647
00:32:17.641 --> 00:32:19.170
It is in these times,

648
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:19.801
you might say,

649
00:32:19.801 --> 00:32:23.970
when individuals have extraordinary virtue in capacity,

650
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.070
prophetic qualities is,

651
00:32:26.071 --> 00:32:27.570
he calls it in chapter six,

652
00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:29.970
are most likely to emerge

653
00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:36.270
while the Aristotelian statesmen just to make a contrast for a moment is most

654
00:32:36.271 --> 00:32:41.090
likely to value stability and the necessary to achieving it.

655
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:46.670
The machiavellian prints seeks war because it is only,

656
00:32:46.671 --> 00:32:47.150
again,

657
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:52.150
in the most extreme situations that one can prosper and be prosperous.

658
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.250
Think about the lines again from the movie,

659
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:56.240
uh,

660
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.050
under,

661
00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:57.830
uh,

662
00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:00.110
for 30 years under the Borsch eyes,

663
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:00.981
violence,

664
00:33:00.981 --> 00:33:01.520
murder,

665
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.001
terror,

666
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:02.834
bloodshed,

667
00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:08.140
but what did it produce greatness of an unprecedented type stability,

668
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.810
democracy and brotherly love,

669
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.673
peace.

670
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.800
What does that produce mediocrity,

671
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:17.420
the cuckoo clock?

672
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:22.130
There might be a little more of nature suggested and that then,

673
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.180
then Machiavelli,

674
00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.420
but I think the machiavellian overtones are,

675
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:27.710
are very evident.

676
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.201
I mean,

677
00:33:30.201 --> 00:33:31.460
consider just the following.

678
00:33:31.461 --> 00:33:32.600
Every child,

679
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:33.710
every one of you,

680
00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:38.711
every one of us was brought up to know that one must never do wrong,

681
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.970
even if good consequences are seeing to follow.

682
00:33:43.971 --> 00:33:47.150
It is never right to give bad examples to others,

683
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.180
even if one expects good to come from it.

684
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:51.671
Hit.

685
00:33:51.671 --> 00:33:56.030
Machiavelli breaks these rules about not giving bad examples.

686
00:33:56.031 --> 00:34:00.500
Virtue is not associated with the classical conceptions of moderation,

687
00:34:00.501 --> 00:34:01.251
of justice,

688
00:34:01.251 --> 00:34:05.120
if self control or what the Christian virtues of faith,

689
00:34:05.121 --> 00:34:06.290
hope and charity,

690
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:11.960
virtual virtual means for him if kind of manly self assertion,

691
00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:14.510
audacity ruthlessness,

692
00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:19.870
a reliance on one's own arms and calculated use of cruelty to achieve ones.

693
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:22.363
And

694
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:28.990
the model of Machiavellian veer too is the renaissance statesmen and General

695
00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:32.443
Cesare Borgia.

696
00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:38.600
And it's very interesting that Orson Welles made a movie not so often seem today

697
00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:40.460
about Cesare Borgia.

698
00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:47.350
I want to leave you with reading one passage from the prince chapter seven in

699
00:34:48.351 --> 00:34:53.351
which Machiavelli illustrates the kind of veer to uh,

700
00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:59.120
Cesare represented and that he wants to recommend for those who follow him

701
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:03.110
once the Duke,

702
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:04.880
that's Cesare himself.

703
00:35:04.881 --> 00:35:07.490
Once the Duke had taken over the Romania,

704
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.250
an area outside of Florence,

705
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:11.810
he founded,

706
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:15.860
had been commanded by impotent lords who had been ready to disk readier to

707
00:35:15.861 --> 00:35:20.861
despoil their subjects than to correct them and given their subject subject

708
00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:23.630
matter for disunion not union.

709
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:26.030
So Cesare put there,

710
00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:26.481
he says,

711
00:35:26.481 --> 00:35:26.870
Messer,

712
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:30.200
Ramiro d Yorko accrual and ready man.

713
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.240
To whom he gave the fullest power.

714
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:38.470
So Cesare set up as a lieutenant of his to impose order on this area and to whom

715
00:35:39.961 --> 00:35:42.600
he delegated to the fullest responsibility.

716
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:48.230
In short time he goes on Ramiro reduced it to piece in unity with v with the

717
00:35:49.081 --> 00:35:51.330
very greatest reputation for himself.

718
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:56.550
Then the Duke judge that such excessive authority was not necessary because he

719
00:35:56.551 --> 00:36:01.551
feared it might become hateful and he set up a sort of civil court in the middle

720
00:36:01.561 --> 00:36:05.430
of the province with the most excellent president where each city had its

721
00:36:05.431 --> 00:36:10.431
advocate and because he knew that the past rigors had generated some hatred for

722
00:36:11.441 --> 00:36:16.441
a mural to purge the spirits of that people into gain them entirely to himself.

723
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:21.240
He wishes to show that if any cruelty he had been committed,

724
00:36:21.241 --> 00:36:22.740
this had not come from him,

725
00:36:22.741 --> 00:36:24.120
from Cesare,

726
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.400
but from the harsh nature of his minister.

727
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.910
And having seized this opportunity,

728
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:30.470
get,

729
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:31.860
get that language,

730
00:36:31.861 --> 00:36:33.180
sees the occasion,

731
00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:34.770
seize this opportunity.

732
00:36:34.771 --> 00:36:39.771
He had him placed one morning and the Piatsa in two pieces with a piece of wood

733
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.420
and a bloody knife beside him.

734
00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:47.670
He had him cut into the bloody knife and a piece of wood behind beside him the

735
00:36:47.671 --> 00:36:49.860
ferocity of this spectacle.

736
00:36:49.861 --> 00:36:54.861
Machiavelli concludes left the people at once satisfied and stupefied,

737
00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:02.540
and that of course is Machiavelli's veer to princely virtue.

738
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.900
What you do to leave the people satisfied and stupefied what we might call

739
00:37:10.471 --> 00:37:10.801
today,

740
00:37:10.801 --> 00:37:12.030
shock and awe.

741
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:14.633
Okay,

742
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.810
next week we'll continue this learning math.
