Speaker 1:          00:02          So how does one construct a dose response curve? Well, you need data. The data going essentially empower from three sources, animal bioassays where the toxicity is studied in relatively large number of animals, human epidemiological studies, which are often conducted in specific subpopulation, which can be as a regionally specific or occupationally specific. Finally, toxic effect can you studied in basic cell lines, which is much faster but has limited relevance to toxicology here provide the table of challenges that are associated with each study time. Animal studies I journey preform at relatively high doses, so in order to preform a meaningful dose responsibility creation, scientists have to extrapolate that to a much lower dose. This studies are expensive and take a long time and consequently cannot perform on a very large number of chemicals for him off humans obviously a lot different from rat. Therefore, certain physiological information is required to extrapolate from animals to humans or us around sorting.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Factors need to be applied. Clinical and occupational studies suffer from a lot of similar problems is they're relatively expensive and incorporate complex exposures. Is I difficult to differentiate? A human is exposed to many substances. Therefore it's relatively difficult to isolate one specific soft on psalms as larger Rick and consequently it's very difficult to establish a cause and effect scenario. Similarly, it's difficult to study a lot of chemicals and furthermore it's difficult to study effect that Omarion common in the population because one we'll have to get a huge sample size of people to assess row health effect. Finally, in vitro cell bio assays have many advantages because they are fast, they are cheap and they're able to screen many chemicals in a short period of time. However, since their applicability to human is even more limited and animal studies, since bacteria watch further evolutionary moved from humans, it is not common to to make dose response curves based on cell bio assays.

Speaker 1:          02:33          As I just explained some effect of very rare in the population. This is especially relevant when it comes to tumors. Some lymphomas and other blood cancers are extremely rare and therefore hard to detect. Any given. This slide basically demonstrate is that if a disease has a prevalence in the population of 0.01%, which is relatively hot, it would require thousand animals to detect it was the probability that is high enough is a for when studying rare diseases, it is very difficult to get the right number of animals. That's the limitation of toxicology data is low dose extrapolation. As you already know, at very low doses, it's almost impossible to notice an effect, um, on a reasonable number of animals. Therefore, you had to administer a higher dose to see a response. Consequently, you're not sure how the curve behaves in a lower doses. As you can see from the left panel is the graph. You have some data points, but none of them go all the way down to zero. Therefore, you can make approximations about that question a we'll region in the bottom left, but the dose response curve down there is not certain and that is a part we care about. Since exposure to the real world, I usually much lower. It was in those in the laboratory.
