Speaker 1:          00:04          Toxicity being done. Again, it's all about dose response. Um, this is, this is important. The dose response relationship is based on observed data from experimental animal human clinical studies or cell studies. Uh, it's based on observed data. We're going to return to this because a lot of what we talk about when we were discussing risk and a risk numbers, our extrapolations from observed data knowing what is an actual data point versus what it's an extrapolation is not a small concern. This is why dose response is so crucial and essential and fundamental. It establishes causality that the chemical has induced the observed effects. Why am I emphasizing that so much? Because in toxicology, in risk assessment, on all of the discussions that you hear about, um, uh, environmental issues, it is so often correlations. You will hear an awful lot about correlations. People will get, um, uh, very certain and whipped up about correlations.

Speaker 1:          01:26          Everybody in this room, I'm sure, knows the difference between correlation and causality. Without a dose response curve, it is impossible as far as I know, to determine causality. This is the mechanism to determine causality. Uh, even with dose response curves, yeah, it's challenging, but that's why dose response curves are so, so important and establishes the lowest dose, uh, uh, that, uh, which the effect occurs. Um, and this is going to be important when we discuss thresholds and determines the rate at which the, the, uh, the injury builds up. Uh, and the slope of the dose response curve is going to be very important. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:20          This, this graph is for responses to the same dose. Okay? So we're going to see dose response curves that are going to have the changing dose and responsive. This is all to the same doubts. So remembering that when we talk about dose response curves, we're talking about percentage response. This is recognizing that at a particular given dose that you're going to respond to it differently than I am, uh, differently than, uh, than you are. That, um, that there are going to be some people that are particularly resistant, uh, some people that are going to be particularly susceptible. And so you work for the FDA, you worked for the EPA. Who were you going to protect? You've got to set these levels. Are you going to protect these folks? Well, if your Osha, the occupational safety and health administration, well then you're looking at healthy workers. That's what historically these levels have been, have been set for.

Speaker 1:          03:31          But do you want to protect for the, the most, um, uh, susceptible population? Do you want to protect for infants? Do you want to protect for compromised individuals who may already have pulmonary issues? Do you want to protect for people who may already have chemical sensitivity? How do those policies play out? If you protect for, for the been part of this curve by setting your, uh, your standards, what does that mean economically? What does that mean for commerce? What does that mean? So these are, um, practically pragmatic important questions. All right, this is your first dose response curve. This is the dosage over time and milligrams. This is the response and percentages of people responding to whatever the, uh, the effect is that you're measuring. You can tie this to any particular type of response. You're going to have confidence limits around here. Uh, as you'll see, you'll have zero, uh, and we call that a threshold.

Speaker 1:          04:53          Okay. Uh, at what point does a, do you actually see an effect? Now remember, only these are the data points. You might think that to be a trivial trivial point, but the, again, the ability, uh, and the, uh, it's very common to extrapolate beyond the data points because when we're running tests, I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself. When we run these types of tests, you need to have a data point. You need to see an effect. Sometimes you need to go to very high doses in order to see any effect. And so you'll have data points and they lead to extrapolate back in order to set a standard. Okay, we'll talk more about that over the next couple of classes. So you'll see over over time increased dose you, uh, we'll see a, uh, a curve. This is the classic, the classic s curve for lethal dose. LD 50 is perhaps the most common, commonly used a data point. Uh, uh, commonly used a standard by which people made measure things, the dose at which half of the population dies. Okay. Um, are there, it's, it's mice or whatever kind of, um, now say that you have, so here the 50% level, this is the dose that you, uh, that you're going to see lethality.

Speaker 1:          06:37          So when we look at LD 50s, for different substances, you have ethyl alcohol at a 10,000 milligrams per kilogram. Uh, as you go down some of your innocuous substances, he got down to nicotine at one milligram per kilogram. Then you start getting into some of the most toxic substances known, uh, dioxin, the most toxic synthetic substance, uh, botulinum toxin, a couple orders of magnitude more, uh, more toxic. Just as a, as an aside, Casper at in duels is the reference that is largely considered the Bible of toxicology if you ever want to refer to it. Um, so you can see, what do we have? One, two, three, four, five, six, 79 c crossing better than 10 orders of magnitude and in terms of toxicity. All right.

Speaker 1:          07:37          All right. So comparing two different shaped, the, the shape of the, uh, of the dose response curve is going to be a important here. You'll see a different thresholds. The data points aren't outlined here, but two different thresholds, uh, that, that start before you start seeing an effect. But the, this, the shape and slope are going to be important. All right, so here's two different toxicants. Toxicant a toxicant be, uh, this is the, the dose at which a 10% of the population is responding. Here's the, the, uh, the dose at which 15%, 50% of the, uh, uh, of the population is responding. You can see the difference between the two. So if we look at, uh, the distribution, these become important because in many cases you're going to want to know not only the toxic dose, but the effective dose. Imagine what we're talking about is a drug or pharmaceutical, right?

Speaker 1:          08:54          Um, if you have a dose response curve for the effective dose here and you're measuring the, the ability for us, uh, something for a drug to stop headaches or whatever it is and the, and the toxic knows to, um, that is going to kill you instantly, right? Then you're going to need to know the, uh, the, the slope and the, and the shape of these curves because you're going to want to have the, uh, the largest gap between those, those two. Uh, uh, those two curves. Why? So the effective dose for 50% of the population is going to still be at a place where there is no toxic effect, right? But if you say, hmm, all right, but if I want to get it to 90% of the population, then it's going to be toxic for what maybe 3% of the people. Does that sound familiar when you're watching the commercials for Dick's, for different drugs and at the end of it, they are talking really fast and a listing off all of those people.

Speaker 1:          10:23          A very small percentage of the population I'll go into and I won't even list off some of the things that they say on TV. It's just terrible. Uh, so it's going to have all of these wonderful things. It's gonna make you happier. It's gonna make you Tyler. It's gonna. Uh, but a few people have experienced Dah, Dah, Dah. All of that comes from dose response curves. So take that and say, all right, well that's good. I understand it. For drugs, when you start thinking about other substances, all of the chemical substances that we use every day in our, our society, it's the same types of decisions that, uh, that need to be made. So if we were to just say, all right, well we found a substance that, um, uh, that's used in, in baby bottles and, um, uh, knowing what the, what the effective dose, the performance versus the toxicity are, those types of cost benefit questions as simply part of the decision making process and, uh, and regulation questions.

Speaker 1:          11:34          Okay. All right. So, um, two dose response curves can have very, very different, uh, shapes and slopes. So he starts saying that his, uh, uh, again, the effect of dose, We, uh, uh, and the toxic dose here at a dose of 20 milligrams per kilogram, 20% of the people are going to be, uh, affected. But up here at 40 milligrams, uh, it's going to be effective or for 70%, but the difference between here it's going to be toxic for almost no one here is going to be toxic for half of the people that, that use it. Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:19          Two terms are going to need to know, uh, no way and low AOL, no observed adverse effect level low observed adverse effect level crucial to understanding this and they need to remember is that they are actual data points. Okay. That becomes important because there can be wide gat orders of magnitude gaps, uh, and at different dose levels. Um, so sometimes they're in human clinical studies when it's things like pharmaceuticals, uh, it's often experimental animal studies when it's on things like, uh, uh, uh, environmental issues. No Al the highest data point at which there was not an observed toxic or adverse effect, low oil. The lowest data point at which there was an observed adverse or toxic effect. Let's take a look. Okay, so dose response curve here. No effect, no one response. Actual data point. This is your know AOL nodes or low al. Uh, the, the lowest point at which there was an observed toxic effect.

Speaker 1:          13:41          Okay. Why is the, why are these two data points? So, uh, so important it's because these are the points that are used as the called the jumping off points for setting standards by which you can be exposed to something. So that's called the reference dose. We'll reference dose is what you're going to encounter often when you start looking at what is considered acceptable exposure to, to something. Okay, we'll reference dose. I mean they say, well, I know that mercury is bad, but what's the reference dose? What is it that I can be exposed to? Bisphenol a, lead, whatever else. The uh, the family, it's the brominated flame at times. What is the reference dose is going to be the question for the reference dose is what's considered an acceptable level to be exposed to. And the way the, uh, the reference dose is constructed is by taking the no aal the, the, the lowest level, which no observed effect was seen, uh, divided by uncertainty factors.

Speaker 1:          14:59          Okay. So data point referenced us not a data point, okay? So real empirical number derived number, okay. Uh, why is that crucial? Important? Because uncertainty factors and these types of things can range. I put 10 to a thousand. I've seen even higher uncertainty factors in that. So they'll say, well, we know that we saw toxic effect at this, but we're going to put it a thousand or 10,000 times lower for it to be acceptable because of these uncertainty factors. What are some of the uncertainty factors? Most of the time you're not going to have testing done on humans. You'll have clinical trials for pharmaceuticals for most everything else. You're not going to have that kind of data. So that can be a factor of 10 because you're going to extrapolate from animals to humans. Differences in humans, uh, susceptibility. So healthy worker to infant. Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:07          If we concerned about protecting infants and we only have, even if we do have human data, unhealthy workers, we're going to put an another factor in a 10 adjustment factor for subchronic data sources. If you go, if you're going from a sub chronic to acute adjustment factor when the low [inaudible] would, if you don't have a no observed effect level. So at every dosage you gave, you saw an effect. When you only have a low ale, you put in another factor of 10 a adjustment for when data complete, which is very frequent, okay? Um, because you're never going to have all of the data, all of the tests. So let's see, one, two, three, four, five orders of magnitude. Alright, so this is, this is what we're dealing with with some of the toxicological challenges. Um, um, not only making policy setting standards, but these are the fundamental handles that we're going to use when we start thinking about, okay, that's what makes something toxic. How are we going to make something nontoxic? How are we going to practice green chemistry? How are we going to design the next generation of molecules? All of these are the factors that we're going to consider it.
