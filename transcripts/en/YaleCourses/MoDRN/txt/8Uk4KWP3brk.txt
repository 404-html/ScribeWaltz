Speaker 1:          00:04          What I'd like to obviously focus on for, for this class is, um, some of the green chemistry approaches. Not going to take a deep dive, but just give you a flavor of some of the approaches that are, that are used. Uh, there's a whole science that has emerged over the past at least 20 years, uh, inherently safer processes. Uh, a person out of the UK named Trevor collects is considered the, the founder of this, uh, this area inherently safer chemical processes. Um, and it's looking at exactly what we've been talking about, how instead of reacting and preventing exposure, um, do you understand the inherent nature of the materials that are being used so that they are intrinsically either incapable or dramatically less capable of causing an adverse consequences? MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:12          So I give one example. Our friend, phosgene, we all know as acutely, acutely lethal, but yet still used and very, very wide, uh, uh, large scale, uh, applications. So a methyl ISO cyanide. So the way that you make methyl isocyanate, uh, on a large scale has always traditionally been done using phosgene large quantities of phosgene to, to make this. And so, uh, phosgene being the COC seal two shown here to make not the lie. So signing dupont came up with an alternative, um, uh, after, by a good friend named Leo man's arm out of two plant after the Bhopal incident that, uh, that we're not gonna use postiion anymore. We came up with a catalyst, we're going to be able to use carbon monoxide, um, which, while deadly is not looks good by comparison to fires team, uh, and so you'll start off with the, with the methylamine use carbon monoxide and a catalyst, and you'd get through methyl lysozyme completely eliminating phosgene from the equation.

Speaker 1:          02:30          Sulfuric acid is used in giant quantities, has always historically been used in giant quantities to make nylon. So when you think of the volumes of nine line that a produced and that it has in two different steps, come up with stoke geometric quantities of sulfuric acid that's necessary. And you start thinking about those quantities and you start thinking about the accident potential for those quantities of self uric acid was, um, the alternative of getting rid of it actually. And one step using, uh, uh, uh, basically they're solid acid catalyst. So instead of sulfuric acid, that catalytic solid acid catalyst, this one's a titanium silver silicate. The other one is a zeolite. So now you don't have, um, the same kind of liquid. You don't have the same kind of vapor, uh, that, uh, and all of the cascading consequences of, of sulfuric acid. This is a solid acid catalyst, easier, handled, easier, contained, dramatically less accident potential from using solid acid catalysts like, uh, like zeolites.

Speaker 1:          03:47          Uh, so this is a big, a big step forward. Uh, the synthesis of Sinai. Uh, the traditional way that you produce cyanide is, uh, uh, is using a process where you're going to be combining methane and ammonia. Um, but at the same time, because the first step is so into thermic, you need to put in so much energy that you are actually combusting, um, uh, an an air combustion of the methane, uh, with, with oxygen, uh, in order to drive that first step of the reaction, um, which now we have ways of doing a catalytically, uh, with an external energy, a sauce instead. And so it's a much, much cleaner reaction. Yeah. Still producing cyanide. Uh, and so some of the other green chemistry, nothings are, uh, uh, just doing a, uh, a process using Puma mud and he'd, or using sodium cyanide and, uh, and uh, and sulfuric acid. Why would you care about whether or not it's sodium cyanide or hydrogen cyanide from an accident potential standpoint? What formed is hydrogen cyanide come in? What phase? What's that? Gas. Gas. What is sodium cyanide salt. So from an accident potential, why do you care the gas in the gas in a solid pretty much equal when it comes to accident potential now? No, it's not. Uh, so, uh, gas has a much, much harder to, to handle.
