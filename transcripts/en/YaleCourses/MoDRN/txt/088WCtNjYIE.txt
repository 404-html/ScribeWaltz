Speaker 1:          00:04          I thought it might be helpful to go through very quickly. Three of the major, uh, processes of deriving chemicals from petroleum feed stocks. So the first feed stock I wanted to look at is methane. So natural gas, this is what's even before fracking. This has been a major source of chemicals in the United States. And so the process is here. Um, don't have to worry about every one of these arrows, but if you look at the things that are coming out, so at the top you have methane is coming in. So natural gas, there's also something called a natural gas liquids that often contains propylene. Propylene is,

Speaker 2:          00:46          yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:50          it's a three carbon molecule. So those are the two major inputs. And then we can look at the things that come out. So hydrogen gas is a very important synthetic building block. Um, ammonia and urea, you can say, well, wait a minute, that that's not in natural gas. So we're adding nitrogen atoms are being introduced here. And why would we be producing so much ammonia and urea? What's that going to get used for? Yeah, fertilizers. So basically ever, I mean, some very large percentage of our biome, our body mass is based on nitrogen that comes out of these processes. Um, methanol is one of the largest use solvents to scenic acid formaldehyde. A couple of interesting compounds over here. I, so Butyraldehyde uh, another unusual chemical, it kind of pops up here is to Ethel [inaudible] acid. Does anybody have any idea what that's used for? So it has to do with plastics.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Um, most of the PVC plastic that gets used, uh, needs plasticizers to make it soft or flexible. Yes. So this is being fed directly into plasticizer use. What kind of summarize a slide then? So we're, we're taking these, these one carbon three carbon feedstocks and we're making fertilizers by introducing nitrogen, making solvents, making plasticizers. And if you look at the molecular structures of these compounds, they are also one carbon two co carbon and we're starting to build up to higher carbon numbers here, right? So, uh, even, uh, to Ethel Hex, no luck acid, that's c eight compounds.

Speaker 1:          02:27          And then looking at the Olefin processes. So this is an even more con, uh, complicated flow diagram. But again, let's look at the things that we're going in here. So raw materials, uh, there's some salt is going in that's kind of interesting, right? So it's sodium chloride, there's oxygen is coming in and very large amounts. Uh, naphtha is one of the oil fractions. And then, uh, there's basically cuts of all Finnick of hydrocarbons that are coming directly from crude oil. And so what's coming out here I think should be a lot of recognizable chemicals. So caustic soda. Uh, how about vinyl chloride? What does that get used for? Does that ring any bells? Yeah, PVC plastic. So, uh, we can start filling in kind of our recycling triangles. So there's a PVC is our number three. Uh, how about HDPE? Ldpe people know what those are.

Speaker 1:          03:24          What does the P stand for Paul? We have families, so we've got number one and two. Um, ethylene oxide, it's actually used directly in a lot of shipping. So when people, uh, transport produce around the world, they fill the shipping containers with ethylene oxide gas, it's extremely toxic. So it's supposed to keep, you know, prevent biological contamination, prevent mold growth, prevent other organisms. For getting into it, but it's also extremely toxic to people and it's a highly explosive. And when we get into the accidents lecture, we'll see that a lot of the US chemical safety board videos, unfortunately I have been dealing with ethylene oxide explosions and it can do an awful lot of damage. A FNOL and acetone. We'll, we'll come back to in a second. Here's a styrene that should be a pretty easy one, right? So polystyrene and we just got our number six.

Speaker 1:          04:14          Um, spr is a styrene butadiene rubber that's basically synthetic rubber. So whenever anybody talks about rubber and it's not coming from the tree, that's basically what it is. And then Polly ice supreme. What, what does polyisoprene get used for? It's a tire is basically, so the number one use of polyisoprene is going into tire manufacturing. I guess I should have added the propylene. So we're making poly polypropylene, so we've got, or one, two, three, four, five, six recycling triangles already. And then number seven, we'll cover poly lactic acid. So that, that's basically it already we've got all of our major plastics out of the two first petroleum cuts. We've looked at and then I wanted to come back to these funnel and acetone points here cause this, this helps further illustrate a point that professor and assets was just making. So this is bisphenol a, we were just talking about the phosgene.

Speaker 1:          05:14          That's, this is the other chemical that goes into reaction with phosgene to make polycarbonate gets used in epoxy resins. And this is when it comes from, it comes from funnel and it comes from Acetone. And kind of the philosophical question here is do people use it because it's the best performing chemical in this application? I mean we said in the very beginning of class, if there's something like, I don't know, 44 million, 48 million known chemicals, what are the chances that this one that's two steps away from raw olefins are going to be the, this is going to be the best performing chemical for a given application. It's often not the best performing chemical, but it's just so cheap. It's so available because it's right at the beginning the chemical food chain, so to speak. And so one of the strategies that we'll see for, um, biobased chemicals is to try and come up with something similar. If you can get something that's just one or two steps away from sugar or Chitin or you know, switch grass, then maybe you have this same kind of advantage.

Speaker 1:          06:17          And so the last major petroleum based cut that I wanted to talk about is the nap one, not the, uh, is mainly used to derive what's called Btx, the benzene, toluene, xylenes. And so looking at the things that come out of this, again, um, benzine is a useful product and its own right styrene. So, um, again, the polystyrene plastic, uh, Phallic and hydride is the other piece of the plasticizers that we were just talking about. So that's the Thal late part of the pathologic is the valid part of those plasticizers. And then last thing that comes out here is dimethyl tariff alley.
