Speaker 1:          00:04          So, uh, literally the, the science of toxicology is the, uh, is the science of poisons. Uh, it is the study of adverse affects on, uh, on humans, but really on life generally.

Speaker 1:          00:24          So when we start thinking about what is, how is it is and what is toxic, we, we have a range of things because toxicity is really any kind of biological adverse consequence, right? But nobody would suggest that they were all created equal. So if we look at this, this scale, things that we largely consider less serious as it were, are the things that are reversible if something causes you to, to tear up. But when it's a, you know what, I'm in closets you to tear up, but when you remove the angina goes away and there's no lasting damage. So it's reversible. It's not really debilitated, debilitating, a tear up for a, for awhile. Don't see for awhile, but, uh, not life threatening. So that's down here with rashes, caused headaches, et Cetera, et cetera. And then of course, what we consider more serious, irreversible debility, a debilitating life threatening everything from birth defects, uh, nervous system, uh, uh, damage, cancer, etc. Etc.

Speaker 1:          01:32          This is perhaps the most important slide of today's lecture. This is the relationship between these toxic effects. So we're going to be talking about and, uh, uh, the physical chemical properties of the chemicals that we've been discussing for the past weeks. All of these different types of toxicity, wide range of toxicity, different toxic pathways that we'll discuss are directly derived from these physical chemical properties. You cannot have these different toxic effects without the right combination or depending on your perspective, the wrong combination of physical chemical properties in order to make it happen. We're going to be talking a lot about how these chemicals get into our bodies and how they react with different biological receptors. All of these different steps, all of these key aspects are related to these and a wide range of other physical chemical properties. So if you're wondering what the link is, this is it. This is at the foundation. Why have we been talking about all of the physical chemical properties for the past week? All of these different physical chemical properties because of this.
