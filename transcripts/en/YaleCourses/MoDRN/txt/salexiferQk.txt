Speaker 1:          00:03          We are going to talk about molecular design through reduced toxicity and how you go about designing safer chemicals. Okay. Um, talked a lot about toxicology and the basis of toxicology. And so let's, uh, just for a minute or to review what we knew starting with a principal for. Um, so we want to make sure that we preserve the function of whatever molecules we're producing while we reduce toxicity. And I should say other hazards generally because we know that toxicity is only one particular type of hazard. Alright. So we're reviewing, we know that uh, all hazard is simply based on the physical chemical properties of a molecule. Um, in those properties we're a direct reflection of its, of its structure, uh, and so is subjected to design in the same way we can design things. I think I've said to be blue or red or brittle and flexible. We can design things to be more or less toxic. I have to emphasize the, generally speaking, why don't you can find anecdotes about how to do molecular designed to reduce toxicity. This is a relatively new area for systematic scientific investigation. This is not something that has been a, uh, a practice, uh, of, uh, of chemistry very long.
