Speaker 1:          00:04          The 12 principles of green chemistry shown here. Substances in the foremost of the substance use and a chemical process should be chosen to minimize the potential for accidents, chemical accidents including releases, explosions and fires. Okay. Um, we've talked a lot about the nature of feedstocks and nature of energy than nature of waste. Um, but not so much about accidents. And yet, uh, accidents are kind of consequential. Um, this is one of the, uh, the worst accidents. Um, and certainly in US history, Texas city, Texas. So it was a shipping, a shipping ammonium nitrate, and you have a giant barge shitting on the, on the harbor of, uh, Texas city, Texas doc and ammonium nitrate is a fine powder. And the one thing you don't want us to, to have that power to turn to dust. So there's, there's a lot of ways to, to cover or contain that powder, um, in order to make sure you don't get dust.

Speaker 1:          01:26          One of the things that you could contain and coat that that powder with is do you have and others it's wax could cover and contain it with wax, but you don't want to do that. And nobody has ever done that again since Texas city taxes because pretty, it's a pretty good a first approximation to say there was no Texas city, Texas. Uh, on April 17th, um, almost 600 killed, 3,500 injured. Uh, when this, this blew up, this explosion took place. Also had again, a ammonium nitrate explosion. And this isn't to loose France. Uh, 3.4 on the Richter scale, uh, over 2000 injured, 30 killed 800 plus hospitalized in Toulouse, France, uh, 27,000 housing units.

Speaker 1:          02:35          This was a Wharton international, the subsidiary of the Morton Salt, uh, commercial, just in case you don't think thinking can happen in Manhattan. This happened about 10 years ago, uh, uh, in Manhattan. This is, um, this was waste dispose this one, is it a paper mill? Uh, so different kinds of reactive hazards. Um, this is chemical processing in Montana. That's his first chemical. This was only minor injuries, but of course the plant was a itself ruined specialty plastics. So we've got paper, we've got plastics, we've got uh, uh, the one in Manhattan, I think it was printing, uh, insulation products. This is a gun about 10 years ago. Combustion explosion repackaging. Okay. So I'm going to tell you about love canal. Who knows about Lumpkin? Anybody? I feel like I'm almost in a history lesson, but don't consider this a history lesson because we're going to see that this is all too relevant today. Love Canal neighborhood in upstate New York back in 1950, 300 chemical soul, the plot of land for a dollar to the town after dumping 21,000 tons of toxic waste into this, this hand, it took until the sediments kill all of the miscarriages. The neurotoxic effect in the cancers came to light. Uh, and it was declared an ecological disaster area essentially. And the federal government had to locate or relocate 800 families.

Speaker 1:          04:16          They had to essentially by the time, uh, because it was an environmental disaster. Anyway.

Speaker 2:          04:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:25          Hi, speech time speech Missouri. This was the early eighties. So what chemical company that a waste hauler and said, we want you to get a bit of our waste, paid him $3,000 for a truck load to get rid of their hazardous waste. And they decided, well, for dust control, we're going to split this hazardous waste on the dusty roads. And this one happened to be an area that's a little bit before a flood, a flood prone cuts into the drinking water. Dioxin levels are, we're 2000 times higher than that file. An Agent Orange, a chemical warfare agent, uh, again, can Swiss miss characters neurotoxic effects. And a 1983, the, uh, the government had the purchase the town for $32 million the entire town and everybody was essentially an environmental refugees. The Cuyahoga River, the Cuyahoga River as a, uh, is anybody from Ohio.

Speaker 1:          05:30          Um, so the Cuyahoga or whatever, it doesn't look like this anymore, luckily, but in 1969, uh, person to play it, it's not the first time in person to his first and to planes a lot. But in 1969, a picture was taken to made the cover of life magazine, which was big at the time. And, and people said, you know, we don't want an owl river is bursting into flames. Uh, that's, that's bad. Um, and so my favorite slogan about, um, the Cuyahoga river is it somebody said in the Cuyahoga, you don't, if you pull it and you don't so much drown as d components, um, it was just that pollutant. Okay. So just in case you think that this is a history lesson and that these things don't exist today, let's talk about some of the Aternity today. Today in our chemical products, consumer products, electronic products, we are using chemicals that are capable of disrupting, uh, eloquent system, reproductive and developmental, uh, of, of fetuses to the point where the composition of these chemicals that are playing a role as to whether or not, for instance, I will be a grandparent, whether or not my project, you will be able to reproduce.

Speaker 1:          07:04          They will influence what the Iq of your children might be. That's absurd. And we can talk a lot more about that right now. If mother's milk were attempted to be sold on the shelves as regular milk, it's too contaminated in many, many countries with the impurities are persistent bioaccumulative and toxic substances. Remember we talked about the body garden and all of us, um, have these persistent bioaccumulative and toxic substances. They tend to accumulate in fat and mother's milk as a depository for that.

Speaker 1:          07:54          And many of these products are either directly applied to or meant for children. Uh, we'll talk about things such as Piss Spinall, a in baby bottles and different valets and rubber duckies and the consequences of those, those substances today, not in the 80s, none in the 70s. None of the 50s talks about pharmaceutical ways. We mentioned that. What about pharmaceuticals in the environment, not just for manufacturing, but when all pharmaceuticals are throw it away and use pharmaceuticals, the ones that are in your body that can excrete it now have biologically active levels of pharmaceuticals in the environment and things such as our drinking water.

Speaker 2:          08:46          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:47          Industrial chemicals in rivers and streams of, I have the example of his 77%. The small mouth bass from the Mississippi River are Intersex. Intersex, but they, because of these endocrine disrupting chemicals are believed to be changing gender. These are also affecting the Florida panthers. 90%, uh, of the, uh, of have this farm is abnormal in developing countries. 70% of the industrial waste dumped untreated into the water. In 2010, the noise generated 30 million tons of plastic waste and 7% was recovered from the cycling.

Speaker 2:          09:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:39          And this is our current energy portfolio. Talk about,

Speaker 2:          09:44          yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:45          Whether it's Fukushima, whether it's the BP oil spill, um, coal mining. Um, we have quite a, a series of unintended consequences. Somebody tells me what Paul Paul is. Why do we care about both hall?

Speaker 1:          10:09          That's the likes of Simon. How's it was chemical ruptured valve was helping. People are still hand waving as to exactly what it was. When you caught by. Would love to say that it's sabotage. I have no idea. I don't really care. What we should all care about is that when this toxic gas was released, uh, 5,000 were killed immediately. 5,000 people died immediately in their homes. It's estimated that another 18,000 died in the following two weeks. And the thousands more diet of, uh, diseases related to the, the gas poisoning all the time. Think of the worst terrorist tragedy that we could imagine. Uh, that's happened. It doesn't compare to this things that we restructure our laws and our society about, uh, doesn't compare to this. When you take a look at the potential for accidents like this today, not them today, the potential what chemical accidents, um, that can kill many thousands of people instantly still exist.

Speaker 1:          11:27          I'd recommend that everybody take five, 10 minutes or go to the, uh, something called the Chemical Safety Board website. It will take you through all of the chemical accidents that are happening today that'll run order investigation, west Texas where people will, uh, 15 people were, were killed instantly and level of the town year ago. Uh, and Alon Alon. Uh, my biggest challenge is understanding why everybody isn't a up in arms about a West Virginia and why that is somehow to my perspective being taken by her too much in this dry. Uh, but the, the point of this, this class, this whole course is not a two to rail against the bad, but to use the tools of green chemistry to invent a different path and to understand the situation as it is in order to design things so that they're different in the future.
