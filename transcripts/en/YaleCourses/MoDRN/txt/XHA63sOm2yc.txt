Speaker 1:          00:04          There are a wide range of places where putting chemical design has taken place. This is just a small sampling and I'll try to talk through just a few of them before we, uh, as we wrap up. This is called [inaudible]. It's an, uh, an antique pilot. It's a marine pesticide. There used to be a company based in Philadelphia called the Roman Hoss companies has been bought out by Dow. Okay. So an antique pilot is something that you put on the bottom of a boat. You can also use it for other things such as, uh, cooling pipes, etc. Etc. But basically you want to get rid of things like algae or seaweed or barnacles and diatoms the cost of scraping the ship. Uh, if, uh, if those things accumulate, the cost of it being out of service just builds up. Um, and so the idea of needing a antique tolerances, it is important.

Speaker 1:          01:04          So whether it's the amount of fuels that you use, the greenhouse gases, um, all of those associated with the use of those fuels, it all adds up. Uh, the way that the violence are applied is you blended with the, the ship paint and then the, uh, the, the file once I suppose to kill the barnacles or the seaweed, um, as they try to attach and slowly leach to the surface in order to, um, to, to form the layer or resilient or resistant layer. This has been the dominant Antifa island for many, many, many decades. Uh, try butyl tin oxide, um, kind of like a spider.

Speaker 1:          02:03          So it's half life in seawater is both six months. So just the bio concentration factor is 10 to the fourth. Now, the chronic toxicity is a concern, whether it's, um, what it does to a seawall, whelks oyster shells, a snails, higher mammals such as dolphins and whales. Uh, there has been concern known for quite some time. It was banned by Japan, I'm guessing, because they care for the whales. Um, and by the, uh, International Maritime Organization, uh, and an o three. So what would you want to have her, an ideal, uh, antifouling I want it to degrade rapidly. Nonhazardous and environmental conditions limited by available, uh, availability toxical into target on an organism's minimum bio concentration. Right? So this is what was invented by a Roman hat. Um, and this one, the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge award a number of years ago. Um, so this is the four or five tie Klara, um, to an octal actual fires alone alone, we'll call it Tcli.

Speaker 1:          03:25          Okay. The good news about this is it, um, while it is, and this is an important distinction, it is acutely lethal to those things that it wants to kill. So the reason that I chose this example is because there are times when your function is to eliminate LG seaweed, barnacles, et Cetera, et cetera. Um, so this actually is acutely lethal, uh, to those target organisms. So pesticides in general are by definition a lethal to is humbling, but it has no chronic toxicity. Um, very small halflife halflife is less than an hour. A bio concentration rather than 10,000 is a 13, by comparison and partitioning to this sediment, which means low bioavailability. And this is just the breakdown process of the, uh, the Coi and dramatically different toxicity profile. Um, the, the difference between the predicted environmental concentrations in the no effect concentration.
