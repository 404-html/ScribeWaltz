1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,840
We are going to talk about
molecular design through
reduced toxicity and how you

2
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:14,130
go about designing safer
chemicals. Okay. Um,

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,170
talked a lot about toxicology
and the basis of toxicology.

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,290
And so let's,
uh,

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,630
just for a minute or to review what
we knew starting with a principal for.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,333
Um,

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,810
so we want to make sure that we preserve
the function of whatever molecules

8
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:40,230
we're producing while we reduce

9
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,600
toxicity.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,060
And I should say other hazards generally
because we know that toxicity is only

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,920
one particular type of hazard.
Alright.

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,080
So we're reviewing,
we know that uh,

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,100
all hazard is simply based on the physical
chemical properties of a molecule.

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,250
Um, in those properties we're
a direct reflection of its,

15
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,090
of its structure,
uh,

16
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:15,091
and so is subjected to design in
the same way we can design things.

17
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:19,590
I think I've said to be blue
or red or brittle and flexible.

18
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:24,460
We can design things to be more or
less toxic. I have to emphasize the,

19
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:25,440
generally speaking,

20
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:30,441
why don't you can find anecdotes about
how to do molecular designed to reduce

21
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:31,794
toxicity.

22
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,820
This is a relatively new area for
systematic scientific investigation.

23
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,920
This is not something that has been a,
uh,

24
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:48,390
a practice, uh, of, uh,
of chemistry very long.
