1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,500
To get started on Ketalysis. So one
of the principles of green chemistry,

2
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:08,640
it's way down there at number nine.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,270
There's clearly a lot of
benefits that can come from it.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,960
And the wording of the
principal is pretty careful.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,870
We'll come back to this selectivity
issue in a minute cause that's pretty

6
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:19,704
important.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,900
So to figure out whether your processes
really turning out to be green based on

8
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:28,130
a catalyst or not, you would want to
start out looking at the 12 principal.

9
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:31,600
It was just kind of go down
the list one through 12. Uh,

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,690
is the catalyst toxic or not?

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,260
Is it actually used in sub
Stuckey metric amounts?

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,910
And that that's a serious
consideration because you,

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,060
you'll find in some of the literature
that there are cases where, uh, you know,

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,500
even though the substance is not changed
during the course of the reaction that

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,880
has to be present in such
a large amount that it,

16
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:55,650
it's kind of questionable to really call
it a catalyst that on a mass basis it

17
00:00:55,651 --> 00:01:00,030
may actually be more than your reagents.
Um,

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,880
so considering 12 principles related
to auxiliaries and special materials,

19
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,770
sometimes using a particular catalyst
might require that you use a toxic

20
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:14,820
solvent. It might require a
moisture, free conditions,

21
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:15,990
oxygen free conditions.

22
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:20,580
All of these things might counteract the
positive benefits that you're getting.

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,560
The principles about abundant renewable
resources. You can make catalysts from,

24
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:29,400
from virtually anything. Uh, then what
happens at the end of the reaction?

25
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:31,770
Can you reuse it?
Can you separate it from the product?

26
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:35,850
That's a really big deal in pharmaceutical
chemistry because people taking the

27
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:40,020
drugs don't want to be taking
random elements from the
periodic table with their

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,800
medicine. And then it's very common
that you can add a catalyst, a reaction,

29
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,680
and it might be too good of a catalyst.
It might go uncontrollably generate heat,

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,740
uh, generate product too quickly. Um,

31
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,340
we'll come back to that later in the
semester when we talk about chemical

32
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,140
accidents,

33
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,660
but you have to ask all these questions
and then applying these at different

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,190
parts of the lifecycle.

35
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,290
So you almost have to consider the
catalyst itself as a chemical product that

36
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:11,940
you would, you would think
of. Um, ordinarily. So again,

37
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:16,020
going through the life cycle of
raw materials, manufacturing,
use and end of life.

38
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,800
So when we consider the raw materials,

39
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,640
we've talked a lot about whether
the carbon comes from hydrocarbons,

40
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:24,600
petroleum fractions,

41
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:28,200
but also thinking about metals because
virtually anything in the periodic table

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,870
can be used in catalysts.

43
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,570
So if you look at a chart of
here are all the elements are,

44
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,180
are lined up in order from
lowest atomic numbers.

45
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:41,670
So here's hydrogen and lithium all
the way up to the, uh, the higher,

46
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:44,250
these are 90.
So uranium up in 92.

47
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,660
And you see this sort of general trend
that is you get heavier and heavier that

48
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,920
the abundance goes down quite a lot.
And this is a logarithmic scale.

49
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:57,330
So there's a difference of at least
nine or 10 orders of magnitude between

50
00:02:57,331 --> 00:03:02,331
something like aluminum and say
Rhodium or palladium osmium.

51
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,050
And so when you do have a choice
and a catalytic system, it may be,

52
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,560
doesn't always make sense to use something
that's only produced on the scale of,

53
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,440
I don't know, a ton per year or
something like, um, you know,

54
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,770
copper or cobalt. These
tend to be produced on the
scale of Giga tons per year.

55
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,903
So the,

56
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:27,190
the impacts of choosing a particular
element to be in your catalyst are pretty

57
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:28,504
far reaching.

58
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,850
And some work that came out of the
forestry school here at Yale, uh,

59
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,420
out of Tom gratefuls group. This, this
publication just came out this year.

60
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:43,050
They did a study on whether certain
elements have good substitutes available.

61
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,070
And the reason for this,

62
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:48,610
there's a lot of metals have
restrictions on the supply chains there.

63
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:52,690
There's vulnerabilities to supplies either
for political reasons because certain

64
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:56,830
countries control access or just abundant
reasons of abundance that there's not

65
00:03:56,831 --> 00:04:00,050
a lot of the stuff in the ground to
begin with. And it turns out for,

66
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:04,360
for many elements, these ones that
are, that are red, uh, there's,

67
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,100
there's not any other, well, right now
at least there's not any other, uh,

68
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,190
element or technology that can
replace the use of these metals.

69
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,570
So what that means is if you're tasked
with coming up with a new catalyst,

70
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,920
you might say,
okay,

71
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:22,570
I have this great manganese catalyst that
I want to use to do biomass conversion.

72
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,520
I'm going to make all this, uh, you know,

73
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,100
useful chemical building block
from a renewable resource.

74
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,120
But if right now manganese is being used
in some other application that can't be

75
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:31,954
substituted,

76
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,990
then you have to think about is it
pulling away from something that's really

77
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:39,010
critical? Or You could also use this
as the flip side to say, all right,

78
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:39,880
well why is,

79
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,010
why is Rhodium so poor in terms of the
available substitutes and that might be a

80
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,030
good area to focus research attention.
Um,

81
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,180
and the interesting thing that,
uh,

82
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,210
also coming out of all work
is that virtually all of
these elements tend to get

83
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:59,120
used almost in combination.
So something like an iPhone has a,

84
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,150
what does it like 90 or a hundred
different elements in it? So the, um,

85
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,530
it, it's pretty common that
you find technologies that
are hitting a lot of these

86
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:12,180
red boxes and then you have to start
asking these questions about priority

87
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:14,980
priority. Do we need
to have, uh, you know,

88
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,790
Europium and our smartphone or do we
need to be saving that Europium for some

89
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:23,110
other medical use or water
treatment type of views.

90
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,070
So going along the life cycle,

91
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,450
you could think about manufacturing
of the catalyst itself.

92
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:35,950
So the catalyst doesn't usually does not
just magically come out of the ground

93
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:37,540
or off of a tree or something.

94
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,530
A lot of catalysts have
very complicated syntheses.

95
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:44,830
So they take energy to do
the chemical reactions.

96
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,490
There's waste that's associated
with those different reaction steps.

97
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,850
And then you have to consider the toxicity
of the other materials that are going

98
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,920
into the build,
the catalyst.

99
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,790
And then in terms of the use when
you're actually applying the catalysts.

100
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,130
So we talked about selectivity,

101
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,320
is it giving you a good set
of products that you want?

102
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,220
And then you'll see these numbers come
up over and over again in the literature.

103
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:09,590
And we'll talk about these in
the coming classes as well.

104
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,830
These are basically metrics
on the catalyst performance.

105
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,790
So the first one I think is
pretty, uh, pretty intuitive.

106
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,290
It's just how much product you can
make per mole of catalyst. So that's,

107
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,470
this is the key number that's going
to tell you about whether your sub

108
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:28,730
stoichiometric or not.
And then adding a time dimension.

109
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:32,690
So basically the same thing, mall as a
product per mole catalyst per second.

110
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,980
And you'll see there's,
you can hit the full spectrum.

111
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:40,790
So there's really terrible catalysts
that could do one turnover per day.

112
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,160
And there's really amazing catalyst.

113
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,510
I think the record for synthetic catalysts
are the ones that are used in polymer

114
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:50,900
synthesis.
So converting ethane into polyethylene.

115
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,320
These catalysts can do
millions of turnovers per hour.

116
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,160
And then along these lines you
have to think about safety.

117
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:01,430
Sometimes there are cases we're doing
millions of turnovers and an hour might be

118
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:04,280
generating dangerous pressure
or dangerous temperature.

119
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,000
So all of these things have to
be taken into consideration.

120
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,690
And then end of life. I already
mentioned the pharmaceutical issues,

121
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:12,560
but just in general,

122
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:17,170
can you reuse the catalyst and can you
separate it from product mixture? Uh, it,

123
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,810
it can be very difficult,
especially if you're, um,

124
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,560
your catalyst has a very small particle
size and we're starting to see some

125
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:31,010
innovations and things like attaching
and catalysts and magnetic beads.

126
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:34,310
So here's a photo of a chemical reaction.

127
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,070
The catalyst is all
dispersed and the solution,

128
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,250
and it's probably too small so that you
wouldn't be able to filter this very

129
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,770
effectively.
But by applying the magnet here,

130
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,420
they've caused all the catalyst to lump
up on the side there and then you can

131
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:51,350
just sort of pour off your,
your, uh, product and extra.
