1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,780
So getting back to how chemists can
have some control over this problem.

2
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:12,660
A lot of it does boil down
to the laws of nature.

3
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:17,280
So when you're going to carry
out, uh, a chemical reaction,

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,640
you have to be thinking about the
thermodynamics and the kinetics.

5
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:25,470
So you're starting out a chemical
reaction with raw materials that have some

6
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:29,220
intrinsic energy and then you're
converting them to products that have some

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,680
intrinsic energy.
Um,

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,340
the difference between the starting and
final products is that there are many

9
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:40,080
dynamics, uh, oftentimes though
that to get the reaction to go,

10
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,630
you have to go through this
unstable transition state.

11
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:46,130
So you have to provide extra
energy to get through that,

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,050
that difficult state to the final product.

13
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:54,051
So you may be having to apply quite a
lot of energy to get the reaction to go.

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,330
And this gets into why the
catalyst are important.

15
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:59,400
I think just looking
at the midterm results,

16
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:02,100
people understood what
catalysts do pretty well.

17
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:04,720
But that's basically
to try and bring this,

18
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:09,210
this hump down lower to where
the thermodynamic barrier
is so that you can use

19
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:13,680
the minimum amount of energy possible
to get your reaction to go forward.

20
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,520
So this is one of the major tools
that you'd have at your disposal to

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,420
intrinsically lower the amount of
energy that might be required to make a

22
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:23,670
chemical product or make
a process go forward.

23
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:28,260
So a catalyst design gives
you a huge amount of power.

24
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,570
So at this point I'll try and transition
into how energy is affected or how

25
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:40,740
energy accumulates across the product
lifecycle. So I was just using a,

26
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:42,120
a sort of a lunch container,

27
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:45,780
like you might get from one of the
trucks down there, 10 grams of styrofoam

28
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,360
if we go through different
stages of the process.

29
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:56,361
So the raw materials and manufacturing
polystyrene is coming from styrene and

30
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,200
styrene is made from ethyl benzene
that's made from a benzine plus f Iin.

31
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,590
The benzene comes directly
from a crude oil fraction.

32
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,000
The ethene comes from a natural gas
fraction that contains these other

33
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:09,834
components.

34
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,530
And so the energy that's embedded in this
final product is basically the sum of

35
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:19,670
all the energy that was used
to make these, you know,

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,340
to extract the raw materials and then
go through these very basic refining

37
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:24,174
processes.

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,890
And so even something that's pretty
low on the chemical food chain,

39
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,900
the polystyrene has gone through
of really pretty extensive,

40
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,140
uh,
a set of technologies here.

41
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,380
So there's all kinds of
pumping distillation and
compression and purification

42
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:43,340
steps and thinking about what,

43
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:47,610
what is intrinsic about this and the
molecule and what is just technological.

44
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,690
So the intrinsic factors are
you can't get around, you know,

45
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:55,770
the number of carbon atoms that are being
incorporated into this, this product.

46
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:58,230
That's something that's absolute,
um,

47
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,420
the heat capacity of water. So if you have
anything to do with, with steam or, um,

48
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,250
you know,
waterproof purification,

49
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:08,980
if your heating and cooling water
or you can't get around that,

50
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,430
that fundamental value,
if there are any separations,

51
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:15,430
if things are having to be
separated into oil, water phases,

52
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:16,960
that can't really be changed.

53
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,440
And then dealing with the
boiling points in vapor pressure.

54
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:23,260
So separating out some of these compounds.
So those are the intrinsic factors.

55
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:28,210
And so if you're, you know, if
you have a choice of getting,

56
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,340
say ethene from dif or
ethylene from different sources
that these are the things

57
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:35,380
you would consider. So, uh,

58
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,250
if ethylene has to be separated from
one set of chemicals or another set of

59
00:03:41,251 --> 00:03:43,890
chemicals, you can look at some of
these factors and boiling points,

60
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:44,730
vapor pressures,

61
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,080
and that will tell you intrinsically
whether one process might be more fruitful

62
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,973
than another.

63
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,660
Then the manufacturing itself. So,
uh, when you produce the polystyrene,

64
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,600
you get these little things,
I think they call them nurdles and uh,

65
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,350
you have to basically expand them
into something that has shaped.

66
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,920
So they use either
[inaudible] or hfcs that's,

67
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,680
that's similar to the CFCs we
talked about earlier in the class,

68
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:16,570
but they have more hydrogen in them
instead of chlorine. And again,

69
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:20,230
so that some of the intrinsic properties
you'd have to think about here are, uh,

70
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,560
what are the,
the polymer properties of polystyrene.

71
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:27,070
It's going to have some certain
temperature where it turns from a glassy

72
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:29,050
material into a melt material.

73
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,870
That's something that's
entirely physical and chemical.

74
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,570
And then the blowing agent itself like it,
you know,

75
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:39,520
at what temperature is it a gas? Um,
how compatible is it with this material?

76
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:44,250
Those are the intrinsic materials.
As we go along here, I've,

77
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,490
I've started adding up some of the energy
that's embedded and just this 10 grams

78
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,710
container. So, uh,

79
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,150
so far we're up to something like
what does that, a million, yeah.

80
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:56,440
1 million joules.

81
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,500
So when negligible and most of that so
far is embedded in the actual synthesis

82
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:04,390
of the raw material.

83
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,310
Yeah.

84
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,650
And then, uh, transportation.
So you've made this product,

85
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:12,110
but say it's at a factory
in Louisiana somewhere.

86
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,680
It's got to get up to new haven that
you're either going to put it on a barge,

87
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:18,440
go on a train, it's going to
be on a truck somewhere. Uh,

88
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,750
some of the intrinsic properties here.
I mean,

89
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:24,170
there's a lot of circumstantial things
about how far you're taking it and so on,

90
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:29,060
but, uh, you know, fuel,
energy and densities, which
one of these things you choose,

91
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:33,650
which fuel you're using definitely is
going to be affecting the overall energy

92
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:37,110
consumption. And so we're
adding to the bar here. Uh,

93
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,540
transportation is
increasing the energy load,

94
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,791
the use phase.

95
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:47,480
I mean you could argue whether you
really do anything with the Styrofoam.

96
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,070
Some people might throw it away.
Uh,

97
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,150
maybe rinse it if you're going to put it
in the recycling bin. So if you wash it,

98
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:58,020
if you were to wash it for a few
seconds with hot water in the sink, uh,

99
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,250
you're having to worry about how much
energy is used because of the heat

100
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:04,790
capacity of water.
So we add another little bar there

101
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,690
and then finally, end of life. Uh,

102
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,830
something like polystyrene
really only has two options.

103
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:17,831
You can incinerate it and get some
energy back or you can landfill it and

104
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:19,400
depending on which one of these you pick,

105
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,700
you could have some energy recovery
because Styrofoam is hydrocarbon.

106
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,500
It's good fuel. Or You could
actually have energy costs. So, uh,

107
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,150
running the landfill is very energy
intensive. You have to maintain it.

108
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,460
So I was being generous here,

109
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:37,460
so I added a negative bar so you can get
a little bit of energy back at the end

110
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:41,150
of you incinerate.
But just adding everything up.

111
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:45,500
So in total,
just using,

112
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:48,650
producing and using one of these little
styrofoam containers is about a mega

113
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:50,280
joule of energy.
Uh,

114
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,960
just trying to convert that into
something easier to think about.

115
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:57,530
That's like running a light bulb
for 24 hours essentially. So

116
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,020
all these products are going to have
the energy embedded across all these

117
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:07,730
lifecycle stages.
And so I,

118
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:08,930
I think I've basically covered this,

119
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:13,520
but the design implications
are that as a chemist,

120
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:16,760
if you're going to be building up a
very complex structure from simple raw

121
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:17,594
materials,

122
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,920
you have to be aware of the different
purification and separation steps.

123
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,150
And sometimes as you go
through the literature, that
may not all be very obvious.

124
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:29,450
They may be starting with a raw
material that's already pretty complex,

125
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,310
but you can,
like I said,

126
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:34,700
you can kind of follow it back even if
they don't have this in a certain paper

127
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:39,140
or publication, you can try
and figure out, uh, what it's,
what it's family tree is.

128
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:41,420
Did it come from a petroleum
in the very beginning?

129
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:44,330
Did it come from coal to
come from natural gas?

130
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:47,150
And it should be pretty
simple to trace that back.

131
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,080
Okay.

132
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,520
And I think the final point that needs
to be made is that you can always think

133
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:55,760
about the function as well.

134
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:59,440
And this doesn't have to be polystyrene
lunch containers. It could be fragrances,

135
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:02,720
it can be, um, a dye or whatever it,

136
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,440
if you think about like what the
function of that molecule is, it,

137
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,790
it's not necessarily like in the
case of the Styrofoam container,

138
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,150
there's no reason that your lunch
container has to be made out of styrene,

139
00:08:13,151 --> 00:08:14,050
Benzine and ethylene.

140
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:17,380
That's not the function of it is to
be made out of a certain chemical.

141
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:21,910
It's to provide structure and rigidity
and hold your food for, I dunno,

142
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,720
20 minutes and the same for a fragrance.
You know, the fragrance doesn't,

143
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,860
it's not a requirement that it has to
come from a petroleum fraction. Right?

144
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:33,160
People don't buy their
fragrance because of, you know,

145
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,510
it came from natural gas or petroleum
at the beginning. So they're there.

146
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:42,080
I think this gives you some freedom
to think about alternatives that, uh,

147
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,600
you don't always have to be looking for
efficiencies in this particular system.
