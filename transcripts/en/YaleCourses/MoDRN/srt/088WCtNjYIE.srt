1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,400
I thought it might be helpful to go
through very quickly. Three of the major,

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,040
uh, processes of deriving chemicals
from petroleum feed stocks.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,860
So the first feed stock I
wanted to look at is methane.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,540
So natural gas,
this is what's even before fracking.

5
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:25,830
This has been a major source of
chemicals in the United States.

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,480
And so the process is here.
Um,

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,180
don't have to worry about
every one of these arrows,

8
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:32,040
but if you look at the
things that are coming out,

9
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,460
so at the top you have methane
is coming in. So natural gas,

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,540
there's also something called a
natural gas liquids that often contains

11
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,780
propylene.
Propylene is,

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,623
yeah,

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,410
it's a three carbon molecule.
So those are the two major inputs.

14
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:57,240
And then we can look at
the things that come out.

15
00:00:57,241 --> 00:01:00,900
So hydrogen gas is a very
important synthetic building block.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,740
Um, ammonia and urea, you
can say, well, wait a minute,

17
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,350
that that's not in natural gas.

18
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:10,440
So we're adding nitrogen atoms
are being introduced here.

19
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,380
And why would we be producing
so much ammonia and urea?

20
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:17,820
What's that going to get used for? Yeah,
fertilizers. So basically ever, I mean,

21
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:20,130
some very large percentage of our biome,

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,690
our body mass is based on nitrogen
that comes out of these processes. Um,

23
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,190
methanol is one of the largest use
solvents to scenic acid formaldehyde.

24
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,390
A couple of interesting compounds
over here. I, so Butyraldehyde uh,

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,790
another unusual chemical, it kind of pops
up here is to Ethel [inaudible] acid.

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,530
Does anybody have any
idea what that's used for?

27
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,970
So it has to do with plastics.
Um,

28
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,900
most of the PVC plastic that gets used,
uh,

29
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,540
needs plasticizers to make
it soft or flexible. Yes.

30
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:56,640
So this is being fed directly
into plasticizer use.

31
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,400
What kind of summarize a slide
then? So we're, we're taking these,

32
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,870
these one carbon three carbon feedstocks
and we're making fertilizers by

33
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:08,440
introducing nitrogen, making
solvents, making plasticizers.

34
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,500
And if you look at the molecular
structures of these compounds,

35
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:16,501
they are also one carbon two co carbon
and we're starting to build up to higher

36
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,890
carbon numbers here, right? So, uh,
even, uh, to Ethel Hex, no luck acid,

37
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,560
that's c eight compounds.

38
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,080
And then looking at the Olefin processes.

39
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,070
So this is an even more con, uh,
complicated flow diagram. But again,

40
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:39,040
let's look at the things that we're
going in here. So raw materials, uh,

41
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,070
there's some salt is going in
that's kind of interesting,

42
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:45,570
right?
So it's sodium chloride,

43
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,740
there's oxygen is coming in
and very large amounts. Uh,

44
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,100
naphtha is one of the oil
fractions. And then, uh,

45
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,250
there's basically cuts of all Finnick
of hydrocarbons that are coming directly

46
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:01,090
from crude oil.

47
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,260
And so what's coming out here I think
should be a lot of recognizable chemicals.

48
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:09,100
So caustic soda. Uh, how about vinyl
chloride? What does that get used for?

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,320
Does that ring any bells?
Yeah, PVC plastic. So, uh,

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,920
we can start filling in kind
of our recycling triangles.

51
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:21,650
So there's a PVC is our number three.
Uh,

52
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,660
how about HDPE? Ldpe people know what
those are. What does the P stand for Paul?

53
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,490
We have families, so we've got number
one and two. Um, ethylene oxide,

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,350
it's actually used directly in a
lot of shipping. So when people, uh,

55
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,090
transport produce around the world,

56
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:42,040
they fill the shipping containers with
ethylene oxide gas, it's extremely toxic.

57
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:46,000
So it's supposed to keep, you know,
prevent biological contamination,

58
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:49,120
prevent mold growth, prevent other
organisms. For getting into it,

59
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,930
but it's also extremely toxic to
people and it's a highly explosive.

60
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:55,510
And when we get into
the accidents lecture,

61
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:58,800
we'll see that a lot of the US
chemical safety board videos,

62
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,810
unfortunately I have been dealing with
ethylene oxide explosions and it can do

63
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,800
an awful lot of damage. A
FNOL and acetone. We'll, we'll
come back to in a second.

64
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,430
Here's a styrene that should
be a pretty easy one, right?

65
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:15,340
So polystyrene and we just
got our number six. Um,

66
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,970
spr is a styrene butadiene rubber
that's basically synthetic rubber.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,270
So whenever anybody talks about rubber
and it's not coming from the tree,

68
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:25,450
that's basically what it is. And
then Polly ice supreme. What,

69
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,840
what does polyisoprene get used for?
It's a tire is basically,

70
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:33,841
so the number one use of polyisoprene
is going into tire manufacturing.

71
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,200
I guess I should have added the propylene.

72
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:40,360
So we're making poly polypropylene,

73
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,400
so we've got, or one,
two, three, four, five,

74
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:49,930
six recycling triangles already.
And then number seven,

75
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:52,390
we'll cover poly lactic acid.
So that,

76
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,060
that's basically it already we've got
all of our major plastics out of the two

77
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,960
first petroleum cuts.

78
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,970
We've looked at and then I wanted to
come back to these funnel and acetone

79
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:05,981
points here cause this,

80
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:09,310
this helps further illustrate a point
that professor and assets was just making.

81
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,260
So this is bisphenol a, we were just
talking about the phosgene. That's,

82
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:18,340
this is the other chemical that goes
into reaction with phosgene to make

83
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,940
polycarbonate gets used in epoxy resins.

84
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,050
And this is when it comes from, it comes
from funnel and it comes from Acetone.

85
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,220
And kind of the philosophical question
here is do people use it because it's the

86
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:32,950
best performing chemical
in this application?

87
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,460
I mean we said in the very beginning
of class, if there's something like,

88
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,660
I don't know, 44 million,
48 million known chemicals,

89
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,150
what are the chances that this one that's
two steps away from raw olefins are

90
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:46,930
going to be the,

91
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,050
this is going to be the best performing
chemical for a given application.

92
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,430
It's often not the best performing
chemical, but it's just so cheap.

93
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:59,150
It's so available because it's right at
the beginning the chemical food chain,

94
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,420
so to speak. And so one of the
strategies that we'll see for, um,

95
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,230
biobased chemicals is to try and
come up with something similar.

96
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:10,600
If you can get something that's just one
or two steps away from sugar or Chitin

97
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:15,260
or you know, switch grass, then maybe
you have this same kind of advantage.

98
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,640
And so the last major petroleum based cut
that I wanted to talk about is the nap

99
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,840
one, not the, uh,

100
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,060
is mainly used to derive what's
called Btx, the benzene, toluene,

101
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,020
xylenes. And so looking at the
things that come out of this, again,

102
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,600
um, benzine is a useful product and
its own right styrene. So, um, again,

103
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:41,370
the polystyrene plastic,
uh,

104
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,040
Phallic and hydride is the other piece
of the plasticizers that we were just

105
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:46,671
talking about.

106
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:51,671
So that's the Thal late part of the
pathologic is the valid part of those

107
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,910
plasticizers.

108
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,350
And then last thing that comes
out here is dimethyl tariff alley.
