1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,350
There are a wide range of places where
putting chemical design has taken place.

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,990
This is just a small sampling and I'll
try to talk through just a few of them

3
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:18,690
before we, uh, as we wrap up.

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,390
This is called [inaudible]. It's an, uh,

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,320
an antique pilot.
It's a marine pesticide.

6
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:31,220
There used to be a company
based in Philadelphia called
the Roman Hoss companies

7
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:33,660
has been bought out by Dow.
Okay.

8
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:36,870
So an antique pilot is something
that you put on the bottom of a boat.

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,710
You can also use it for
other things such as, uh,

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,970
cooling pipes,
etc. Etc.

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,320
But basically you want to get rid of
things like algae or seaweed or barnacles

12
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:53,820
and diatoms the cost of
scraping the ship. Uh, if, uh,

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,900
if those things accumulate, the cost of
it being out of service just builds up.

14
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,040
Um, and so the idea of
needing a antique tolerances,

15
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,180
it is important.

16
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,010
So whether it's the amount
of fuels that you use,

17
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,440
the greenhouse gases,
um,

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,660
all of those associated
with the use of those fuels,

19
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,750
it all adds up.
Uh,

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,830
the way that the violence are
applied is you blended with the,

21
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,340
the ship paint and then the, uh, the,

22
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,230
the file once I suppose to kill
the barnacles or the seaweed,

23
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,130
um,

24
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,130
as they try to attach and slowly
leach to the surface in order to,

25
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,650
um,
to,

26
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,650
to form the layer or
resilient or resistant layer.

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,520
This has been the dominant
Antifa island for many,

28
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:58,260
many, many decades. Uh,
try butyl tin oxide, um,

29
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,930
kind of like a spider.

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,040
So it's half life in
seawater is both six months.

31
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,870
So just the bio concentration
factor is 10 to the fourth. Now,

32
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:16,470
the chronic toxicity is a
concern, whether it's, um,

33
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,090
what it does to a seawall,
whelks oyster shells,

34
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,680
a snails, higher mammals
such as dolphins and whales.

35
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,440
Uh, there has been concern
known for quite some time.

36
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,720
It was banned by Japan, I'm guessing,
because they care for the whales. Um,

37
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,820
and by the, uh, International
Maritime Organization, uh,

38
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,890
and an o three.
So what would you want to have her,

39
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:50,880
an ideal, uh, antifouling I
want it to degrade rapidly.

40
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,540
Nonhazardous and environmental
conditions limited by available, uh,

41
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,800
availability toxical into target on an
organism's minimum bio concentration.

42
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:03,100
Right? So this is what was
invented by a Roman hat.

43
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,190
Um,
and this one,

44
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:11,000
the Presidential Green Chemistry
Challenge award a number of years ago. Um,

45
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,860
so this is the four or five tie Klara,
um,

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,500
to an octal actual fires alone alone,

47
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,570
we'll call it Tcli. Okay. The
good news about this is it,

48
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,890
um, while it is, and this
is an important distinction,

49
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,310
it is acutely lethal to those
things that it wants to kill.

50
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:41,311
So the reason that I chose this example
is because there are times when your

51
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:46,440
function is to eliminate LG seaweed,
barnacles, et Cetera, et cetera.

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,380
Um, so this actually
is acutely lethal, uh,

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,480
to those target organisms.

54
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,810
So pesticides in general are by
definition a lethal to is humbling,

55
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,490
but it has no chronic toxicity.
Um,

56
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,080
very small halflife halflife
is less than an hour.

57
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:13,380
A bio concentration rather
than 10,000 is a 13,

58
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,500
by comparison and
partitioning to this sediment,

59
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:19,120
which means low bioavailability.

60
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,770
And this is just the
breakdown process of the, uh,

61
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,140
the Coi and dramatically
different toxicity profile.

62
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,610
Um,
the,

63
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,580
the difference between the predicted
environmental concentrations in the no

64
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:35,590
effect concentration.
