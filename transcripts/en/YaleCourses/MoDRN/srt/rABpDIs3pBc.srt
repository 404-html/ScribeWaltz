1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,470
Green Chemistry, its role in,
uh, advancing sustainability,

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,580
dealing with health issues and
dealing with environmental issues. Um,

3
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:15,990
so did you get the benefits of chemistry
and chemicals in the world without the

4
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:19,140
adverse consequences?
21 words.

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,280
It's the deaf in one sentence.
Definition of green chemistry.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,890
Green chemistry is the design of chemical
products and processes that reduce or

7
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:32,430
eliminate the use in generation
of hazardous substances.

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,190
So what teaching a course on this subject,

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,650
there are journals devoted to the subject.
There are international networks,

10
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:46,170
research networks,
and 35 countries around the world.

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,730
Our presidential awards on the subject,
and I could go on and on and on.

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,850
These 21 words better means something.
If you're going to define,

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,520
uh, uh, an area of focus

14
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,250
like that in one sentence.
So Green Chemistry.

15
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:08,460
So I'm going to just spend
a few minutes about this.

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,240
So first of all,
it'll sound like I'm joking.

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,690
People think I'm joking when I'm talking
about Green Chemistry. Now these green,

18
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:20,280
everything green, this,
green that, but back in 91,

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,730
uh, it wasn't, uh, it wasn't
that way. And people said,

20
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:27,420
how did you come up with this?
Crazy name green chemistry at the time.

21
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,440
And they think I'm joking when I say that,
you know,

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,630
green of course ever been an out of
things of conjuring up images of,

23
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,100
of the natural environment.

24
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,670
Green tree is green leaves and
everything else and it's synonymous with

25
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,350
environmental types of issues.

26
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,320
But in the u s green is
also the color of our money.

27
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,160
And so how do you break that old
myth that we've talked about,

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,270
which is that if you go into
have environmental improvement,

29
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,480
make things more sustainable,

30
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:00,660
it has to cost more and it
has to be an economic drain.

31
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,170
How do you instead meet the economic
goals and the environmental goals

32
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,650
simultaneously?

33
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,650
How do you align those two things so
that market drivers become a catalyst for

34
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:14,730
doing things in a sustainable way?

35
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,540
And that's one of the things that's
at the essence of green chemistry.

36
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:22,800
And quite frankly, one of the reasons
why it has such widespread adoption. Um,

37
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,570
and we can talk a lot more about that,

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,320
but the word chemistry and this chemistry
is the design of chemical products and

39
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:35,820
processes.
So when we're talking about chemistry,

40
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,320
we all know that we're not talking
about a department in a university.

41
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,180
We're not talking about a particular
industry sector narrowly defined as we've

42
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:47,490
been talking about. We're talking
about everything that you can see,

43
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:49,320
touch and feel at the
most fundamental level.

44
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:53,610
How do you understand the
molecular basis of, of our, uh,

45
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,330
products and processes to make
them more sustainable? Okay.

46
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,430
So,
um,

47
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,950
products and processes that's in this why?

48
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:10,580
Because really what we're talking about
and what's absolutely key is the life

49
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:13,030
cycle. I've talked a little
bit about the life cycle.

50
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,790
We're going to talk a lot about the
lifecycle and just a few minutes,

51
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,180
but is it possible to make something
that's benign or therapeutic and

52
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:26,020
beneficial,
a product

53
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,980
that is made an,

54
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:34,981
an absolutely agregious
manufacturing process?

55
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,903
Is that possible?

56
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,703
Yeah.

57
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,070
Does anybody want to remind
me about pharmaceuticals?

58
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,110
How much waste per pound of product
on average for pharmaceuticals,

59
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,680
one ton of waste per pound of product
produced on average across the lifecycle.

60
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,280
Okay. Uh, you'll see different numbers.

61
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,740
The different numbers is because you're
going to get variability from drug to

62
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:05,080
drug.
But the variability is also because

63
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,010
if you measure across the lifecycle from
the origins of the feed stock to the

64
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,640
under the product,
that could be very different if you say,

65
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,050
oh well we're monitoring from gate to
gate when you only what's happening within

66
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:20,290
our manufacturing facility.
So you'll see different numbers,

67
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:25,030
but a ton of ton of ways.
Proprietor product is a good
a general general measure.

68
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,880
Hold it. That could be
a lifesaving drug. Yeah,

69
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:32,230
but you made it in a way that
was tremendously polluting.

70
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,190
What about the opposite?
Can you have a tremendously efficient

71
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,670
manufacturing process
but brings about an uh,

72
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,980
acutely lethal product?
Sure,

73
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,370
absolutely.
The synthesis of mustard gas,

74
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,360
one of the horrible nerve agents have
a worldwide one is one of the most

75
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:03,310
perfectly efficient chemical syntheses
manufacturing process that you could

76
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:04,144
imagine.
That's,

77
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,320
you could argue that it's about as
close to zero waste as many of our

78
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:13,240
manufacturing processes get. Okay. So
in need to look across the life cycle.

79
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:18,241
So we're talking about products and
processes that reduce or eliminate the use

80
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,170
and generation. Okay.
So can you reduce waste

81
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,710
with green chemistry?
Absolutely right.

82
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,950
Can you make a process more efficient
using green chemistry? Absolutely.

83
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,070
Is that where it ends?
Absolutely not. Again.
