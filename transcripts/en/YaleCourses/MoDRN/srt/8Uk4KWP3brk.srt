1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,490
What I'd like to obviously focus
on for, for this class is, um,

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,000
some of the green chemistry approaches.
Not going to take a deep dive,

3
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:18,170
but just give you a flavor of some of
the approaches that are, that are used.

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,003
Uh,

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,340
there's a whole science that has emerged
over the past at least 20 years, uh,

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,310
inherently safer processes.
Uh,

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,120
a person out of the UK named
Trevor collects is considered the,

8
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,520
the founder of this,
uh,

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,360
this area inherently safer
chemical processes. Um,

10
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,210
and it's looking at exactly
what we've been talking about,

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,700
how instead of reacting
and preventing exposure,

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,013
um,

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,260
do you understand the inherent nature
of the materials that are being used so

14
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:03,681
that they are intrinsically either
incapable or dramatically less capable of

15
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,330
causing an adverse consequences?
MMM.

16
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,840
So I give one example.
Our friend, phosgene,

17
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,690
we all know as acutely,
acutely lethal,

18
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,540
but yet still used and
very, very wide, uh, uh,

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,560
large scale, uh, applications. So a

20
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,650
methyl ISO cyanide. So the way
that you make methyl isocyanate,

21
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,743
uh,

22
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:40,770
on a large scale has always traditionally
been done using phosgene large

23
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:45,210
quantities of phosgene to,
to make this. And so, uh,

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,720
phosgene being the COC seal two
shown here to make not the lie.

25
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:56,420
So signing dupont came up
with an alternative, um,

26
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,510
uh,
after,

27
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,510
by a good friend named Leo man's arm out
of two plant after the Bhopal incident

28
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,360
that, uh, that we're not
gonna use postiion anymore.
We came up with a catalyst,

29
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:12,860
we're going to be able to use
carbon monoxide, um, which,

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,850
while deadly is not looks good
by comparison to fires team,

31
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,610
uh,
and so you'll start off with the,

32
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:24,480
with the methylamine use
carbon monoxide and a catalyst,

33
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,190
and you'd get through methyl lysozyme
completely eliminating phosgene from the

34
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,850
equation.
Sulfuric acid

35
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,530
is used in giant quantities,

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,910
has always historically been used
in giant quantities to make nylon.

37
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,710
So when you think of the volumes of nine
line that a produced and that it has in

38
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:47,000
two different steps,

39
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,710
come up with stoke geometric quantities
of sulfuric acid that's necessary.

40
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,280
And you start thinking about
those quantities and you
start thinking about the

41
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:59,630
accident potential for those
quantities of self uric acid was, um,

42
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,640
the alternative of getting rid of
it actually. And one step using, uh,

43
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,340
uh, uh, basically they're
solid acid catalyst.

44
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,900
So instead of sulfuric acid,
that catalytic solid acid catalyst,

45
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:17,530
this one's a titanium silver silicate.

46
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,110
The other one is a zeolite.

47
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,500
So now you don't have,
um,

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,470
the same kind of liquid. You don't
have the same kind of vapor, uh, that,

49
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,710
uh,
and all of the cascading consequences of,

50
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:38,110
of sulfuric acid.
This is a solid acid catalyst,

51
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,420
easier, handled, easier, contained,

52
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,800
dramatically less accident potential
from using solid acid catalysts like, uh,

53
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,380
like zeolites. Uh, so this
is a big, a big step forward.

54
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,890
Uh, the synthesis of Sinai. Uh,

55
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,870
the traditional way that you
produce cyanide is, uh, uh,

56
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:03,871
is using a process where you're going
to be combining methane and ammonia.

57
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,710
Um, but at the same time, because
the first step is so into thermic,

58
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:13,230
you need to put in so much energy
that you are actually combusting, um,

59
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,550
uh, an an air combustion of the
methane, uh, with, with oxygen,

60
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:23,710
uh, in order to drive that
first step of the reaction,

61
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,963
um,

62
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,160
which now we have ways
of doing a catalytically,

63
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,410
uh, with an external energy, a
sauce instead. And so it's a much,

64
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:39,010
much cleaner reaction.
Yeah.

65
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,170
Still producing cyanide.
Uh,

66
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,540
and so some of the other green chemistry,
nothings are,

67
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,590
uh, uh, just doing a, uh,

68
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,520
a process using Puma mud and he'd,

69
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,030
or using sodium cyanide and,
uh,

70
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,900
and uh,
and sulfuric acid.

71
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,910
Why would you care about whether or not
it's sodium cyanide or hydrogen cyanide

72
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,490
from an accident potential standpoint?

73
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,680
What formed is hydrogen cyanide come in?

74
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:21,010
What phase? What's that? Gas. Gas.

75
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:24,700
What is sodium cyanide
salt.

76
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,420
So from an accident potential,
why do you care

77
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,510
the gas in the gas in a solid pretty
much equal when it comes to accident

78
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:38,920
potential now? No, it's not. Uh, so,

79
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,050
uh, gas has a much, much
harder to, to handle.
