1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,250
Toxicity being done. Again, it's
all about dose response. Um,

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,650
this is,
this is important.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,050
The dose response relationship is based
on observed data from experimental

4
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:19,880
animal human clinical
studies or cell studies. Uh,

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,500
it's based on observed data.

6
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:27,501
We're going to return to this because a
lot of what we talk about when we were

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,380
discussing risk and a risk numbers,

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,620
our extrapolations from observed data

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,120
knowing what is an actual data point
versus what it's an extrapolation is not a

10
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:43,260
small concern.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,300
This is why dose response is so
crucial and essential and fundamental.

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,730
It establishes causality

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,040
that the chemical has
induced the observed effects.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,070
Why am I emphasizing that so much?
Because in toxicology,

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,180
in risk assessment, on all of the
discussions that you hear about, um, uh,

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,150
environmental issues,

17
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,110
it is so often correlations.

18
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,140
You will hear an awful lot about
correlations. People will get, um,

19
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,100
uh, very certain and whipped
up about correlations.

20
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,350
Everybody in this room,
I'm sure,

21
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:32,070
knows the difference between
correlation and causality.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,920
Without a dose response curve,

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,780
it is impossible as far as I know,

24
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:44,460
to determine causality. This is the
mechanism to determine causality.

25
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,260
Uh, even with dose response curves, yeah,

26
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,550
it's challenging, but that's
why dose response curves are so,

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,220
so important and establishes
the lowest dose, uh,

28
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,400
uh, that, uh, which the effect occurs. Um,

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,360
and this is going to be important when
we discuss thresholds and determines the

30
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:13,610
rate at which the, the, uh,
the injury builds up. Uh,

31
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,890
and the slope of the dose response
curve is going to be very important.

32
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,330
Okay.
This,

33
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,370
this graph is for responses
to the same dose. Okay?

34
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,940
So we're going to see dose response
curves that are going to have the changing

35
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,150
dose and responsive.
This is all to the same doubts.

36
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,950
So remembering that when we
talk about dose response curves,

37
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:40,080
we're talking about percentage response.

38
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,350
This is recognizing that at a particular
given dose that you're going to respond

39
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:54,330
to it differently than I
am, uh, differently than,
uh, than you are. That, um,

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,440
that there are going to be some people
that are particularly resistant,

41
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,100
uh, some people that are going
to be particularly susceptible.

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,180
And so you work for the FDA,
you worked for the EPA.

43
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,050
Who were you going to protect?
You've got to set these levels.

44
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,160
Are you going to protect these
folks? Well, if your Osha,

45
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,410
the occupational safety
and health administration,

46
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,730
well then you're looking
at healthy workers.

47
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,470
That's what historically these
levels have been, have been set for.

48
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,420
But do you want to protect
for the, the most, um,

49
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,710
uh, susceptible population? Do
you want to protect for infants?

50
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:46,711
Do you want to protect for compromised
individuals who may already have

51
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,190
pulmonary issues?

52
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:52,210
Do you want to protect for people who
may already have chemical sensitivity?

53
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,770
How do those policies play out?
If you protect for,

54
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,620
for the been part of this curve by
setting your, uh, your standards,

55
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,140
what does that mean economically?
What does that mean for commerce?

56
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:12,410
What does that mean? So these are, um,

57
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,730
practically pragmatic important questions.
All right,

58
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,670
this is your first dose response curve.

59
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,180
This is the dosage over
time and milligrams.

60
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,540
This is the response and percentages
of people responding to whatever the,

61
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,520
uh, the effect is that
you're measuring. You can

62
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,980
tie this to any particular
type of response.

63
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,290
You're going to have confidence
limits around here. Uh, as you'll see,

64
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,710
you'll have zero,
uh,

65
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,180
and we call that a threshold. Okay. Uh,

66
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,680
at what point does a,
do you actually see an effect?

67
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,690
Now remember,
only these are the data points.

68
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,520
You might think that to be
a trivial trivial point,

69
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,440
but the, again, the
ability, uh, and the, uh,

70
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,530
it's very common to extrapolate beyond
the data points because when we're

71
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,110
running tests,
I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself.

72
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,790
When we run these types of tests,
you need to have a data point.

73
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,680
You need to see an effect.

74
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Sometimes you need to go to very high
doses in order to see any effect.

75
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,830
And so you'll have data points and they
lead to extrapolate back in order to set

76
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,080
a standard. Okay, we'll talk more about
that over the next couple of classes.

77
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,240
So you'll see over over
time increased dose you, uh,

78
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,290
we'll see a, uh, a curve.
This is the classic,

79
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,490
the classic s curve

80
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,150
for lethal dose.
LD 50 is perhaps the most common,

81
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,340
commonly used a data point. Uh, uh,

82
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,210
commonly used a standard by
which people made measure things,

83
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,540
the dose at which half
of the population dies.

84
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,610
Okay. Um, are there, it's,

85
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,140
it's mice or whatever kind
of, um, now say that you have,

86
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,850
so here the 50% level,
this is the dose that you,

87
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,780
uh,
that you're going to see lethality.

88
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,840
So when we look at LD 50s,
for different substances,

89
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,440
you have ethyl alcohol at a
10,000 milligrams per kilogram.

90
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,580
Uh, as you go down some of
your innocuous substances,

91
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:57,470
he got down to nicotine at
one milligram per kilogram.

92
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,390
Then you start getting into some of
the most toxic substances known, uh,

93
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,650
dioxin, the most toxic
synthetic substance, uh,

94
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,030
botulinum toxin,
a couple orders of magnitude more,

95
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,710
uh, more toxic. Just as a, as an aside,

96
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,570
Casper at in duels is the reference
that is largely considered the Bible of

97
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:25,190
toxicology if you ever want to
refer to it. Um, so you can see,

98
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,500
what do we have? One, two,
three, four, five, six,

99
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:32,501
79 c crossing better than 10 orders
of magnitude and in terms of toxicity.

100
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,350
All right.
All right.

101
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,220
So comparing two different shaped,

102
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,800
the, the shape of the, uh,

103
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,060
of the dose response curve is
going to be a important here.

104
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,040
You'll see a different thresholds.
The data points aren't outlined here,

105
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,330
but two different thresholds, uh, that,

106
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,970
that start before you start
seeing an effect. But the, this,

107
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,980
the shape and slope are
going to be important.

108
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,283
All right,

109
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,670
so here's two different toxicants.

110
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:17,810
Toxicant a toxicant be, uh, this is the,

111
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,180
the dose at which a 10% of the
population is responding. Here's the,

112
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,190
the, uh, the dose at
which 15%, 50% of the, uh,

113
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,970
uh, of the population is responding. You
can see the difference between the two.

114
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:38,000
So if we look at, uh, the distribution,

115
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,140
these become important because in many
cases you're going to want to know not

116
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:48,050
only the toxic dose,
but the effective dose.

117
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,420
Imagine what we're talking about
is a drug or pharmaceutical, right?

118
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,883
Um,

119
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:02,030
if you have a dose response curve for
the effective dose here and you're

120
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,260
measuring the, the ability for us, uh,

121
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,710
something for a drug to stop
headaches or whatever it is and the,

122
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,230
and the toxic knows to,
um,

123
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,170
that is going to kill you instantly,
right?

124
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,970
Then you're going to need to know the,
uh,

125
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,160
the,
the slope and the,

126
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:34,161
and the shape of these curves because
you're going to want to have the,

127
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:38,920
uh, the largest gap between
those, those two. Uh,

128
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,510
uh, those two curves. Why?

129
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,250
So the effective dose
for 50% of the population

130
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,700
is going to still be at a place where
there is no toxic effect, right?

131
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,030
But if you say, hmm, all right,

132
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:02,390
but if I want to get it
to 90% of the population,

133
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,953
then

134
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,400
it's going to be toxic for
what maybe 3% of the people.

135
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,920
Does that sound familiar when you're
watching the commercials for Dick's,

136
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,370
for different drugs and at the end of it,

137
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:23,640
they are talking really fast and
a listing off all of those people.

138
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,300
A very small percentage of the population
I'll go into and I won't even list off

139
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:30,520
some of the things that they say
on TV. It's just terrible. Uh,

140
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,970
so it's going to have all
of these wonderful things.
It's gonna make you happier.

141
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:38,250
It's gonna make you Tyler. It's gonna. Uh,

142
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,790
but a few people have
experienced Dah, Dah, Dah.

143
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,630
All of that comes from
dose response curves.

144
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:51,600
So take that and say, all right,
well that's good. I understand it.

145
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:55,140
For drugs, when you start
thinking about other substances,

146
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,850
all of the chemical substances that
we use every day in our, our society,

147
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,900
it's the same types of decisions
that, uh, that need to be made.

148
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,340
So if we were to just say,
all right,

149
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:13,110
well we found a substance
that, um, uh, that's used in,

150
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,840
in baby bottles and, um, uh,

151
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,910
knowing what the,
what the effective dose,

152
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,760
the performance versus the toxicity are,

153
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,110
those types of cost benefit questions
as simply part of the decision making

154
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:32,610
process and, uh, and regulation questions.

155
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,140
Okay. All right. So, um,

156
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,100
two dose response curves can
have very, very different, uh,

157
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,600
shapes and slopes.
So he starts saying that his,

158
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,610
uh, uh, again, the effect
of dose, We, uh, uh,

159
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:55,611
and the toxic dose here at a dose
of 20 milligrams per kilogram,

160
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,860
20% of the people are
going to be, uh, affected.

161
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,960
But up here at 40 milligrams, uh,
it's going to be effective or for 70%,

162
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,830
but the difference between here it's going
to be toxic for almost no one here is

163
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:15,840
going to be toxic for half of the
people that, that use it. Okay.

164
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,810
Two terms are going to need to know,
uh,

165
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,250
no way and low AOL,

166
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,140
no observed adverse effect level
low observed adverse effect level

167
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:36,210
crucial to understanding this and they
need to remember is that they are actual

168
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:37,780
data points.
Okay.

169
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,440
That becomes important because there can
be wide gat orders of magnitude gaps,

170
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,480
uh, and at different dose levels. Um,

171
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,790
so sometimes they're in human
clinical studies when it's things like

172
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,440
pharmaceuticals,
uh,

173
00:12:56,441 --> 00:13:01,390
it's often experimental animal studies
when it's on things like, uh, uh, uh,

174
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,620
environmental issues.

175
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,620
No Al the highest data point at which
there was not an observed toxic or adverse

176
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:13,390
effect,
low oil.

177
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:18,391
The lowest data point at which there
was an observed adverse or toxic effect.

178
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,450
Let's take a look.
Okay,

179
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,780
so dose response curve here.
No effect,

180
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,830
no one response.
Actual data point.

181
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,490
This is your know AOL nodes or low al.
Uh,

182
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,540
the, the lowest point at which
there was an observed toxic effect.

183
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,560
Okay. Why is the, why are
these two data points? So, uh,

184
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,730
so important it's because these are the
points that are used as the called the

185
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:56,410
jumping off points for setting
standards by which you can be exposed to

186
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:58,540
something.
So

187
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,140
that's called the reference dose.

188
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,080
We'll reference dose is what you're
going to encounter often when you start

189
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:13,081
looking at what is considered
acceptable exposure to,

190
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,820
to something. Okay, we'll reference
dose. I mean they say, well,

191
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,120
I know that mercury is bad,
but what's the reference dose?

192
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,980
What is it that I can be exposed to?
Bisphenol a,

193
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:31,450
lead, whatever else. The
uh, the family, it's the

194
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,060
brominated flame at times.

195
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,370
What is the reference dose is going to
be the question for the reference dose is

196
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,420
what's considered an acceptable level
to be exposed to. And the way the, uh,

197
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:49,620
the reference dose is constructed
is by taking the no aal the,

198
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:54,550
the, the lowest level, which no
observed effect was seen, uh,

199
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,600
divided by uncertainty factors.
Okay.

200
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,870
So data point referenced
us not a data point,

201
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,090
okay?
So real empirical number

202
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,350
derived number, okay. Uh,

203
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,040
why is that crucial?
Important?

204
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,400
Because uncertainty factors and
these types of things can range.

205
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,280
I put 10 to a thousand.

206
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,430
I've seen even higher uncertainty
factors in that. So they'll say, well,

207
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,620
we know that we saw toxic effect at this,

208
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,860
but we're going to put it a thousand
or 10,000 times lower for it to be

209
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:42,410
acceptable because of
these uncertainty factors.

210
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,170
What are some of the uncertainty factors?

211
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,240
Most of the time you're not going
to have testing done on humans.

212
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,690
You'll have clinical trials for
pharmaceuticals for most everything else.

213
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,430
You're not going to
have that kind of data.

214
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,870
So that can be a factor of 10 because
you're going to extrapolate from animals

215
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:03,980
to humans. Differences in
humans, uh, susceptibility.

216
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,520
So healthy worker to infant.
Okay.

217
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,760
If we concerned about protecting
infants and we only have,

218
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,420
even if we do have human data,
unhealthy workers,

219
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,960
we're going to put an another factor in
a 10 adjustment factor for subchronic

220
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,180
data sources.
If you go,

221
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:25,210
if you're going from a sub chronic to
acute adjustment factor when the low

222
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,800
[inaudible] would, if you don't
have a no observed effect level.

223
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,060
So at every dosage you gave,
you saw an effect.

224
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,030
When you only have a low ale,

225
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,530
you put in another factor of 10 a
adjustment for when data complete,

226
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,180
which is very frequent, okay? Um,

227
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,810
because you're never going to have
all of the data, all of the tests.

228
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,430
So let's see, one, two, three,
four, five orders of magnitude.

229
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,890
Alright,
so this is,

230
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,260
this is what we're dealing
with with some of the

231
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,510
toxicological challenges. Um, um,

232
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,590
not only making policy setting standards,

233
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,930
but these are the fundamental handles
that we're going to use when we start

234
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:21,830
thinking about, okay, that's
what makes something toxic.

235
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,900
How are we going to
make something nontoxic?

236
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,850
How are we going to
practice green chemistry?

237
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,610
How are we going to design the
next generation of molecules?

238
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,620
All of these are the factors
that we're going to consider it.
