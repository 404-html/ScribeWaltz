1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,570
What I want you to get out of this,

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,980
this lecture is what are the
questions that can be asked?

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,230
What are the things that you
can demand, um, you know, uh,

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,870
scientists and,

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,860
and folks associated with chemicals to,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,810
to investigate or report.

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,880
So when we're doing an analysis,
you need to say, hold it.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,310
I know that this is going to affect
molecular design and why isn't Xyz being

9
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:39,630
done? Okay? So when we
talking about hazard,

10
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:42,670
we're talking about physical
hazards, global hazards, um,

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,760
plant and animal toxicity and eco hazards.
Uh,

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,090
we're going to focus a lot on toxicity,
but not exclusively.

13
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,970
And so we're going to look at,
uh,

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,900
some of these strategies going
from the types of hazards,

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,560
understanding of mechanism to
the physical chemical properties,

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,090
all the way to the framework.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,660
This is a construct to think about,
um,

18
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,710
the molecular design.

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,580
So when you start looking at the various
strategies that you can take from

20
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:21,030
molecular design, we think about
the, the base of the pyramid.

21
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,820
And at the base of the Pyramid of,
I'm sorry,

22
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:27,960
I should say that it runs from toxical
kinetics to toxic. Oh, dynamics.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,850
Toxical.
Uh,

24
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,560
kinetics those things that allow
the molecules into the body,

25
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,330
a toxicant dynamics,

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,620
the reactions and interactions that take
place once the molecules in the body.

27
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:43,590
It's a good way to distinguish that.

28
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,780
And that goes up in this direction
at the foundation of the pyramid from

29
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:52,830
molecular design in many ways
your most powerful tools.

30
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,050
I right down here.

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,920
The other good thing about this is there
also your conceptually easiest tools.

32
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,170
So we're going to get into levels
of complexity up here that are

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,860
extremely challenging, scientifically,
extremely challenging scientifically.

34
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,130
And there are things that I don't
necessarily problems he necessarily being

35
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:24,360
solved in the next decade or more.

36
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,710
There's a lot of research up here
that is tremendously complex.

37
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,200
But the good news is just because you
can't do everything doesn't mean that you

38
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:37,530
can't do anything.
And so as we talk through these,

39
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,490
I want folks to be thinking about,
oh,

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,010
but people are saying that, that this copy
down and that can't be done. It's true.

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,550
There's a lot that's unknown and there's
a lot the copy done. What I want you to,

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:50,910
uh,

43
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,710
to know is that there's a
tremendous amount that is
known scientifically and can

44
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:59,590
be done today and is being done today.
Okay?

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,690
So when we take a look at these,

46
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,090
these various strategies
at the base of the pyramid,

47
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,810
we got that increasing complexity
as I was, as I was talking about.

48
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,770
But let's go right to,
um, uh, to some of these,

49
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,430
these properties that we can manipulate.
Um,

50
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,710
so right down here,
molecular weight,

51
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,920
are chemists able to control
molecular weight? Yeah.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,990
Why do you care about molecular weight?
Going to be a lot harder to absorb.

53
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,960
It's going to be a harder to absorb.
Throw a membranes. All right,

54
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:38,220
so we go to solubility.
Um,

55
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,710
so we have molecular way solubility.
Again,

56
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,390
why do we care about solubility?
So there are different things. Um,

57
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,630
is it going to build up in our bodies?
Is it going to cross a our membranes?

58
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,690
Why would we care about
volatility? Uh, what's a,

59
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,300
what's something that's particularly
volatile that we're concerned about?

60
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,134
Being in our air?

61
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,910
CFCS makes us it's way all the way up
to a stratosphere electronic charge.

62
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,890
When when something is
charged, it's um, to,

63
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,360
if something has a charge
to it, it's going to, uh,
whether it's in the biosphere,

64
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,650
it might bind to particular particles
like humic acid and also it was going to

65
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:19,330
have uh, uh, usually greater difficulty
crossing biological membranes.

66
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,310
All right,
so molecular weight,

67
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,480
we know that with a molecular
weight of greater than a thousand,

68
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,540
you're going to have
essentially no skin transport.

69
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,960
We know that with a molecular
weight of greater than 500,

70
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,160
you don't what to have essentially no
one transport. It gets into your lungs.

71
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:37,540
It con transport across your lung.

72
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,330
And with a molecular
weight of greater than 300,

73
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,530
you're going to have essentially
no GI tract transport.

74
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,030
So that's, that's really important. Um,

75
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,000
because from where we started,

76
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,710
no ability to get into your body,
no ability to cause adverse consequence.

77
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,560
So volatility. So, um,

78
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:05,010
so we say that if something has a vapor
pressure of less than 10 to the minus,

79
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,110
I'll go here,
tend to the minus three.

80
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,170
There's not going to be
atmospheric dispersion,

81
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,500
not going to get the kind of
atmospheric contamination.

82
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,350
If you have 10 to the minus six store,

83
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,430
you're not going to have a,
essentially any inhalation, uh,

84
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,400
to that, uh, substance and
Ian, any inhalation risk
10 to the minus eight tour,

85
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,730
you're going to have almost no potential
for reaching the lower flammability

86
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:36,460
limit. Okay? So you
start asking questions,

87
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,050
how do I make this substance
maintain whatever function it has,

88
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,620
but I want to make sure that it doesn't
get dispersed in the atmosphere.

89
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,980
I want to make sure that it
doesn't get respired by my workers.

90
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,000
I want to make sure that it never has
the possibility of bursting into flames.

91
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,463
Uh,

92
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,940
these are some of the guidelines
that are able to be derived.
