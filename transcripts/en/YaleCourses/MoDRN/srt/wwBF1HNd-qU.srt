1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,680
The 12 principles of green
chemistry shown here.

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,750
Substances in the foremost
of the substance use and a
chemical process should be

3
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:15,120
chosen to minimize the
potential for accidents,

4
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:19,320
chemical accidents including
releases, explosions and fires. Okay.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,440
Um, we've talked a lot about the nature
of feedstocks and nature of energy than

6
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:28,470
nature of waste. Um, but
not so much about accidents.

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,750
And yet, uh, accidents
are kind of consequential.

8
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,450
Um, this is one of the, uh,

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,040
the worst accidents.
Um,

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,710
and certainly in US history,
Texas city,

11
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:51,570
Texas.
So it was a shipping,

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,840
a shipping ammonium nitrate,

13
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,490
and you have a giant barge
shitting on the, on the harbor of,

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,040
uh,
Texas city,

15
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:07,041
Texas doc and ammonium
nitrate is a fine powder.

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,090
And the one thing you don't want us to,

17
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,530
to have that power to turn to dust.
So there's,

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,790
there's a lot of ways to, to
cover or contain that powder, um,

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,570
in order to make sure you don't get dust.

20
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,310
One of the things that you could contain
and coat that that powder with is do

21
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:35,450
you have and others it's wax

22
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,990
could cover and contain it with wax,

23
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,720
but you don't want to do that.

24
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,750
And nobody has ever done that again
since Texas city taxes because pretty,

25
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:53,160
it's a pretty good a first approximation
to say there was no Texas city,

26
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:56,910
Texas. Uh, on April 17th, um,

27
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,690
almost 600 killed, 3,500
injured. Uh, when this,

28
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,940
this blew up, this explosion
took place. Also had again, a

29
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,450
ammonium nitrate explosion. And
this isn't to loose France. Uh,

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,560
3.4 on the Richter scale,
uh,

31
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,880
over 2000 injured, 30 killed 800 plus
hospitalized in Toulouse, France,

32
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,370
uh,
27,000 housing units.

33
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,680
This was a Wharton international,

34
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,130
the subsidiary of the Morton Salt,
uh,

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,870
commercial, just in case you don't
think thinking can happen in Manhattan.

36
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,700
This happened about 10 years ago,
uh, uh, in Manhattan. This is, um,

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,280
this was waste dispose this
one, is it a paper mill? Uh,

38
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,960
so different kinds of reactive hazards.
Um,

39
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,080
this is chemical processing in Montana.

40
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,110
That's his first chemical.
This was only minor injuries,

41
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:13,050
but of course the plant was a
itself ruined specialty plastics.

42
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:17,320
So we've got paper, we've got
plastics, we've got uh, uh,

43
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,030
the one in Manhattan, I think it was
printing, uh, insulation products.

44
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,790
This is a gun about 10 years ago.

45
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:28,840
Combustion explosion repackaging.
Okay.

46
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,570
So I'm going to tell you about love
canal. Who knows about Lumpkin? Anybody?

47
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,590
I feel like I'm almost
in a history lesson,

48
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,100
but don't consider this a history lesson
because we're going to see that this is

49
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:44,020
all too relevant today.
Love Canal neighborhood in
upstate New York back in 1950,

50
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:45,550
300 chemical soul,

51
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,580
the plot of land for a dollar to the
town after dumping 21,000 tons of toxic

52
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,310
waste into this,
this hand,

53
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:59,770
it took until the sediments
kill all of the miscarriages.

54
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,520
The neurotoxic effect in
the cancers came to light.

55
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,520
Uh, and it was declared an
ecological disaster area essentially.

56
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,170
And the federal government had to
locate or relocate 800 families.

57
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,020
They had to essentially by the time,
uh,

58
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,990
because it was an environmental disaster.
Anyway.

59
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,823
Okay.

60
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,850
Hi, speech time speech Missouri.
This was the early eighties.

61
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,670
So what chemical company
that a waste hauler and said,

62
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:37,060
we want you to get a bit of our waste,

63
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,350
paid him $3,000 for a truck load to
get rid of their hazardous waste.

64
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,360
And they decided, well, for dust control,

65
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:44,940
we're going to split this
hazardous waste on the dusty roads.

66
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,600
And this one happened to be an area
that's a little bit before a flood,

67
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,450
a flood prone cuts into the
drinking water. Dioxin levels are,

68
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,190
we're 2000 times higher than that file.

69
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,760
An Agent Orange, a
chemical warfare agent, uh,

70
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,560
again, can Swiss miss
characters neurotoxic effects.

71
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,830
And a 1983, the, uh,

72
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,890
the government had the purchase the
town for $32 million the entire town and

73
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:20,280
everybody was essentially
an environmental refugees.

74
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,430
The Cuyahoga River,
the Cuyahoga River as a,

75
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,890
uh, is anybody from Ohio. Um,

76
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,110
so the Cuyahoga or whatever, it doesn't
look like this anymore, luckily,

77
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,470
but in 1969, uh, person to play it,

78
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,330
it's not the first time in person
to his first and to planes a lot.

79
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,190
But in 1969, a picture was taken
to made the cover of life magazine,

80
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:50,730
which was big at the time.
And, and people said, you know,

81
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,890
we don't want an owl river is
bursting into flames. Uh, that's,

82
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,700
that's bad.
Um,

83
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,020
and so my favorite slogan about,
um,

84
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,450
the Cuyahoga river is it
somebody said in the Cuyahoga,

85
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,670
you don't, if you pull it and you
don't so much drown as d components,

86
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,780
um,
it was just that pollutant.

87
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,453
Okay.

88
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,700
So just in case you think that this is
a history lesson and that these things

89
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,230
don't exist today,

90
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,890
let's talk about some
of the Aternity today.

91
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,490
Today in our chemical products,
consumer products,

92
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,410
electronic products, we are using
chemicals that are capable of disrupting,

93
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,740
uh, eloquent system, reproductive
and developmental, uh, of,

94
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:52,230
of fetuses to the point where the
composition of these chemicals that are

95
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:57,710
playing a role as to whether or not,
for instance,

96
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,530
I will be a grandparent,

97
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,610
whether or not my project,
you will be able to reproduce.

98
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,840
They will influence what the
Iq of your children might be.

99
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,773
That's absurd.

100
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,190
And we can talk a lot
more about that right now.

101
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,270
If mother's milk were attempted to be
sold on the shelves as regular milk,

102
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,990
it's too contaminated in many,

103
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:32,400
many countries with the impurities are
persistent bioaccumulative and toxic

104
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:36,900
substances. Remember we talked about
the body garden and all of us, um,

105
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,660
have these persistent
bioaccumulative and toxic substances.

106
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,400
They tend to accumulate in
fat and mother's milk as a

107
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,480
depository for that.

108
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,950
And many of these products are either
directly applied to or meant for children.

109
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,010
Uh, we'll talk about things
such as Piss Spinall,

110
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:09,011
a in baby bottles and different valets
and rubber duckies and the consequences

111
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,620
of those,
those substances today,

112
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
not in the 80s, none in
the 70s. None of the 50s

113
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,620
talks about pharmaceutical ways.
We mentioned that.

114
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,970
What about pharmaceuticals in the
environment, not just for manufacturing,

115
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,300
but when all pharmaceuticals are
throw it away and use pharmaceuticals,

116
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,780
the ones that are in your body that can
excrete it now have biologically active

117
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:43,451
levels of pharmaceuticals
in the environment and
things such as our drinking

118
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:44,954
water.

119
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,103
Okay.

120
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,210
Industrial chemicals in
rivers and streams of,

121
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,050
I have the example of his 77%.

122
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,310
The small mouth bass from the
Mississippi River are Intersex. Intersex,

123
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,683
but they,

124
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,500
because of these endocrine disrupting
chemicals are believed to be changing

125
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,793
gender.

126
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,910
These are also affecting the
Florida panthers. 90%, uh,

127
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,230
of the, uh, of have this farm is abnormal

128
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,660
in developing countries. 70% of the
industrial waste dumped untreated into

129
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,910
the water.
In 2010,

130
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:33,911
the noise generated 30 million tons of
plastic waste and 7% was recovered from

131
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:36,944
the cycling.

132
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,560
Okay.

133
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,100
And this is our current energy portfolio.
Talk about,

134
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,803
yeah.

135
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,230
Whether it's Fukushima, whether
it's the BP oil spill, um,

136
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,560
coal mining. Um, we have quite a, a

137
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,820
series of unintended consequences.
Somebody tells me what Paul Paul is.

138
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,610
Why do we care about both hall?

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,920
That's the likes of Simon.

140
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,450
How's it was chemical
ruptured valve was helping.

141
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,710
People are still hand waving as to
exactly what it was. When you caught by.

142
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:24,390
Would love to say that it's sabotage.
I have no idea. I don't really care.

143
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:30,020
What we should all care about is that
when this toxic gas was released,

144
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,470
uh,
5,000 were killed immediately.

145
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,250
5,000 people died
immediately in their homes.

146
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,020
It's estimated that another 18,000
died in the following two weeks.

147
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,510
And the thousands more diet of,
uh, diseases related to the,

148
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,060
the gas poisoning all the time.

149
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,150
Think of the worst terrorist
tragedy that we could imagine. Uh,

150
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,123
that's happened.

151
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,360
It doesn't compare to this
things that we restructure

152
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,730
our laws and our society about,
uh,

153
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,290
doesn't compare to this.

154
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,470
When you take a look at the potential
for accidents like this today,

155
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,480
not them today,

156
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,470
the potential what chemical accidents,
um,

157
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,790
that can kill many thousands of
people instantly still exist.

158
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,380
I'd recommend that everybody take
five, 10 minutes or go to the, uh,

159
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,820
something called the Chemical
Safety Board website.

160
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,810
It will take you through all
of the chemical accidents
that are happening today

161
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:46,130
that'll run order investigation,
west Texas where people
will, uh, 15 people were,

162
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,330
were killed instantly and
level of the town year ago. Uh,

163
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,890
and Alon Alon.
Uh,

164
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:57,310
my biggest challenge is understanding
why everybody isn't a up in arms about a

165
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,070
West Virginia and why that is somehow
to my perspective being taken by her too

166
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:07,960
much in this dry. Uh, but
the, the point of this,

167
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,610
this class,

168
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,030
this whole course is not a
two to rail against the bad,

169
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,350
but to use the tools of green chemistry
to invent a different path and to

170
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:25,351
understand the situation as it is in
order to design things so that they're

171
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,160
different in the future.
