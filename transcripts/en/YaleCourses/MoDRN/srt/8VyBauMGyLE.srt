1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,840
So here it's a chart we've seen a version
of before where we're looking at a

2
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:14,970
wide range of different types of hazard.

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,420
All of the things that you wind
up being concerned about is,

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,200
is something going to cause cancer,

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,080
ozone depletion and
global warming explode,

6
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:28,670
break into flames when he act and corrode
my skin, et Cetera, et Cetera, et Cetera,

7
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:31,950
et cetera. Um, all of those things, as,

8
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:36,951
as we know you could draw direct lines
to all of these physical chemical

9
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:42,720
properties, whether or not something's
volatile, whether or not something is, uh,

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,800
is prone to react with positive
charges on negative charges.

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,340
All of these, these properties
and I should say combinations,

12
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,890
combinations of properties,
properties in combination.

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,250
I'm going to tell you whether or not
this stuff is going to be good for you or

14
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:03,900
deadly. Um, you know,

15
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:07,740
it's also going to tell you whether
or not it's going to be useful in a

16
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:11,340
commercial sense or uh, or useless. So,

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,600
uh, and we come back to something that
we've been saying all semester long.

18
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,990
What is it that,
that chemists do?

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,420
They design and manipulate
and exploit this stuff.

20
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:30,150
So if you can design and
use and explain this stuff,

21
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,310
then you have a tremendous
influence over that stuff. You know,

22
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,340
I often say that in the same way that no
one has a greater impact on how a book

23
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:44,520
is going to affect its reader,
then the author,

24
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,890
nobody can have a greater impact
over whether or not, uh, uh,

25
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,990
a building is going to, you know, look
aesthetically pleasing, then it's,

26
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:55,890
then it's architect.

27
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,250
No one is going to have a
greater influence on the
ultimate consequences for a

28
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,640
chemical than the molecular designer

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,590
that's at the design stage that
you have maximum influence.

30
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,710
So I said this is a relatively new

31
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,820
endeavor in a relatively
new scientific endeavor.

32
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,380
Why would that be?
Doesn't that seem counterintuitive?

33
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,220
When I talk to young students,
uh,

34
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,520
elementary school students, uh,
great. Um, so you'll tell them, well,

35
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,880
we are doing this thing called green
chemistry and Liz has making all of these

36
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:42,690
materials and things so that they're
not going to hurt you or hurt the

37
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:46,950
environment and they look at you and they
blink what they're widely utilized and

38
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:51,750
they think, yeah, haven't been doing
this all along. You're kidding me.

39
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,130
And so why not?
Um,

40
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,350
generally it's because of what
we knew and what we didn't know.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,640
So we talked about toxicology evolving
from a descriptive science, uh,

42
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,480
where basically, um, you know,

43
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,710
we've tested things usually on,

44
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,820
on animals and you look to see
what the consequences were.

45
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,180
And knowing that something is toxic is
very different from knowing why and how

46
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,170
something is toxic. Once you know the
why and the how of something being toxic,

47
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,180
then that gives you design handles.

48
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,110
So as it emerged from a,

49
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,800
from a descriptive science
to a mechanistic science
and mechanism of action,

50
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,470
the molecular understanding
of what's going on,

51
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,140
then all of a sudden you hell
of all these design handles,

52
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:48,220
you actually know how to modify
things so that they can be, uh, less,

53
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,110
less toxic in many ways. Uh, uh,

54
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,170
green chemistry is a,
is often called preventative toxicology.

55
00:03:56,171 --> 00:04:00,130
So we moved from describing
to predicting to preventing,

56
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,223
okay.

57
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,120
So how did we emerge in getting
this understanding? Well,

58
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,240
one of the places is from
the pharmaceutical industry.

59
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,790
The pharmaceutical industry for decades
now is a generated a treasure trove of

60
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:19,060
insight on the,

61
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,770
the biological interactions with
these molecules that we make. Okay.

62
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,660
How they're going into our bodies, how
they interact with, uh, various receptors.

63
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,900
But there's a difference between
pharmaceutical chemicals and industrial

64
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:36,980
chemicals.
For instance,

65
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,450
pharmaceuticals are supposed
to be biologically active.

66
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,490
That's what makes them definitionally a
pharmaceutical and active pharmaceutical

67
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:47,470
ingredient.
The vast majority,

68
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:50,920
I often just say 99% of
all of those chemicals,

69
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,240
of all of chemicals that
aren't pharmaceuticals
usually have no intentional

70
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:59,800
biological activity. We can talk
about the exceptions if you want,

71
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:04,510
but generally speaking, industrial
chemicals are meant to be, you know,

72
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,360
to be a lacquer.
I meant to be a color I met.

73
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,320
They're not meant to have biological
activity with pharmaceuticals.

74
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Definitionally the performance of the
chemical is related to its biological

75
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:23,521
activity including reduced toxicity
performance has generally been a whole

76
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:28,720
separate mindset in the development
of industrial chemicals.

77
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,380
So function and performance was
not defined as being part of,

78
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,870
um, uh, it was not defined as
including toxicity or hazard.

79
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,220
It was you had function and
performance and then, oh yeah.

80
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:49,150
And this other consideration you'd have
this thing to worry about rather than

81
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:51,300
having it being merged.
Um,

82
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,970
relatively the volume of pharmaceuticals
is minuscule by to industrial

83
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:00,490
chemicals.
You,

84
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:05,060
you might literally have billions and
billions of pounds of an industrial

85
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:08,510
chemical where a very,
you know,

86
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,860
a very large volume pharmaceutical
might be a ton because why,

87
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,590
you know, the dosage is
milligrams per pill. Uh,

88
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,080
where uh,

89
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,340
and with pharmaceuticals you
have a well defined use scenario,

90
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,760
you're going to put it in a pillar
injection or something like that or an

91
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:31,670
inhaler. And it's going to go into
a person, et Cetera, et Cetera,

92
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,920
where the same molecule that might be
a polymer building block might be a

93
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:40,760
solvent,
might be a other kind of a reactant.

94
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,500
And you can have a wide range of
scenarios crossing all kinds of different

95
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:46,310
sectors,

96
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,450
all kinds of different life cycles
and end of end of life considerations.

97
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,440
So the um,

98
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:58,530
the whole green chemistry molecular design
element steel's liberally from all of

99
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:03,950
those lessons in all of the fundamentals
that pharmaceuticals gave us and

100
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:08,060
translates them into the vast
majority of other chemicals,

101
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,770
the industrial chemicals. But it's a
little bit different. I'm going to,

102
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,250
and this is important,

103
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,560
it's taking the lessons of pharmaceutical
science and turning it on its head.

104
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,600
It's really looking at
the whole thing backwards.

105
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,600
Because when you're designing a drug,

106
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:32,290
you want to make sure that that
drug is able to get into your body,

107
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,230
cross unnecessary biological membranes,
make its way to find a receptor,

108
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,210
um, uh, intact and in
the form that will react,

109
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,890
bind with that receptor,
carry out.

110
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,410
It's it's therapeutic function,

111
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,130
and then be released from the body

112
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,460
with green chemistry,
molecular design for reduced toxicity.

113
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,540
You want to use all of those same tools
to make sure that that molecule can

114
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:07,460
never get into the body, can never cross
the necessary biological membranes,

115
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,020
can never bind to a particular receptor
that would cause a toxic effect,

116
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,930
and it gets out of the body
as quickly as possible. Okay?

117
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,760
So you have to have the same
understanding, the same tools,

118
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,010
but use it in a a very different way.
