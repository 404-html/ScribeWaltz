1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,310
So, uh, literally the, the
science of toxicology is the, uh,

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,950
is the science of poisons.
Uh,

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,030
it is the study of adverse affects on,
uh,

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,780
on humans,
but really on life generally.

5
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,690
So when we start thinking about what is,
how is it is and what is toxic,

6
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:30,590
we,

7
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,590
we have a range of things because
toxicity is really any kind of biological

8
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:38,150
adverse consequence,
right?

9
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,650
But nobody would suggest that they were
all created equal. So if we look at this,

10
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,603
this scale,

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,030
things that we largely consider
less serious as it were,

12
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:51,740
are the things that are reversible
if something causes you to,

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,380
to tear up. But when
it's a, you know what,

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,010
I'm in closets you to tear up,

15
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:01,070
but when you remove the angina goes
away and there's no lasting damage.

16
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,120
So it's reversible. It's not
really debilitated, debilitating,

17
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:10,050
a tear up for a, for awhile.
Don't see for awhile, but, uh,

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,900
not life threatening. So that's down here
with rashes, caused headaches, et Cetera,

19
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:17,900
et cetera. And then of course,
what we consider more serious,

20
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,580
irreversible debility,

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,800
a debilitating life threatening
everything from birth defects,

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,560
uh, nervous system, uh, uh,
damage, cancer, etc. Etc.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,770
This is perhaps the most important
slide of today's lecture.

24
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,830
This is the relationship

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,740
between these toxic effects.
So we're going to be talking about and,

26
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,050
uh,
uh,

27
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,240
the physical chemical properties of the
chemicals that we've been discussing for

28
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:54,074
the past weeks.

29
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,730
All of these different types of toxicity,

30
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,460
wide range of toxicity,

31
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,550
different toxic pathways that we'll
discuss are directly derived from these

32
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:10,610
physical chemical properties.

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,900
You cannot have these different toxic
effects without the right combination or

34
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,140
depending on your perspective,

35
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,790
the wrong combination of physical chemical
properties in order to make it happen.

36
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,190
We're going to be talking a lot about
how these chemicals get into our bodies

37
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,230
and how they react with
different biological receptors.

38
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,850
All of these different
steps,

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,480
all of these key aspects are related to
these and a wide range of other physical

40
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:52,400
chemical properties.
So if you're wondering what the link is,

41
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,970
this is it.
This is at the foundation.

42
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,680
Why have we been talking about all of
the physical chemical properties for the

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,060
past week? All of these different physical
chemical properties because of this.
