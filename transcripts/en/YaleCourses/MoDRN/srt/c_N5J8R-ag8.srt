1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,780
So how does one construct a
dose response curve? Well,

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,370
you need data.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,480
The data going essentially
empower from three sources,

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,230
animal bioassays where the toxicity is
studied in relatively large number of

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,960
animals,
human epidemiological studies,

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,340
which are often conducted
in specific subpopulation,

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,090
which can be as a regionally
specific or occupationally specific.

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,850
Finally, toxic effect can you
studied in basic cell lines,

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,240
which is much faster but has limited
relevance to toxicology here provide the

10
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:46,380
table of challenges that are
associated with each study time.

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,470
Animal studies I journey preform
at relatively high doses,

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,170
so in order to preform a meaningful
dose responsibility creation,

13
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,500
scientists have to extrapolate
that to a much lower dose.

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,360
This studies are expensive and take a
long time and consequently cannot perform

15
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:11,361
on a very large number of chemicals for
him off humans obviously a lot different

16
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:14,010
from rat.
Therefore,

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,250
certain physiological information is
required to extrapolate from animals to

18
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:22,890
humans or us around sorting.
Factors need to be applied.

19
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,020
Clinical and occupational studies
suffer from a lot of similar problems is

20
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:32,580
they're relatively expensive and
incorporate complex exposures.

21
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,100
Is I difficult to differentiate?

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,190
A human is exposed to many substances.

23
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:43,191
Therefore it's relatively difficult to
isolate one specific soft on psalms as

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,390
larger Rick and consequently it's very
difficult to establish a cause and effect

25
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,460
scenario.
Similarly,

26
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,170
it's difficult to study a lot of chemicals
and furthermore it's difficult to

27
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:59,790
study effect that Omarion common in the
population because one we'll have to get

28
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,820
a huge sample size of people
to assess row health effect.

29
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,770
Finally, in vitro cell bio assays have
many advantages because they are fast,

30
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,120
they are cheap and they're able to screen
many chemicals in a short period of

31
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:16,620
time.
However,

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,800
since their applicability to human is
even more limited and animal studies,

33
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,460
since bacteria watch further
evolutionary moved from humans,

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,760
it is not common to to make dose
response curves based on cell bio assays.

35
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,500
As I just explained some effect
of very rare in the population.

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,130
This is especially relevant
when it comes to tumors.

37
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,670
Some lymphomas and other blood cancers
are extremely rare and therefore hard to

38
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:48,160
detect.
Any given.

39
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,580
This slide basically demonstrate is that
if a disease has a prevalence in the

40
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:57,330
population of 0.01%,
which is relatively hot,

41
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,170
it would require thousand animals to
detect it was the probability that is high

42
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:06,070
enough is a for when
studying rare diseases,

43
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,510
it is very difficult to get
the right number of animals.

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,150
That's the limitation of toxicology
data is low dose extrapolation.

45
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,710
As you already know,
at very low doses,

46
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,470
it's almost impossible
to notice an effect, um,

47
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,220
on a reasonable number of animals.
Therefore,

48
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:31,600
you had to administer a higher dose
to see a response. Consequently,

49
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:35,080
you're not sure how the curve
behaves in a lower doses.

50
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,610
As you can see from the left panel is
the graph. You have some data points,

51
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,540
but none of them go all the
way down to zero. Therefore,

52
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:48,250
you can make approximations about that
question a we'll region in the bottom

53
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:48,880
left,

54
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,880
but the dose response curve down there
is not certain and that is a part we care

55
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:58,900
about. Since exposure to the
real world, I usually much lower.

56
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,910
It was in those in the laboratory.
