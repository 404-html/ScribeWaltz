1
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.760
Green Chemistry's role in sustainability.

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.050
So we already talked about the definition of sustainability.
I have to confess,

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.990
I like,
um,
the way I kind of paraphrase it,

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.830
preserving what you can't live without and preserving it forever.
Okay.

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.380
So sustainability is a century's long perspective.

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.160
The decisions you make are not short term.

7
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:28.750
It's not about the next financial quarter.
It's a,

8
00:00:28.751 --> 00:00:30.930
it's not about the next election cycle.

9
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.530
It's about centuries you,
decades and centuries.

10
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.830
So if you are resource planner and you were planning in 1914 what 2014 needed to

11
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:44.220
look like,
you would make sure that you had enough well,
oil for waiting.

12
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.280
You would make sure that you had enough wood for fuel.

13
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.070
It's certainly want to have enough rock software,

14
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:54.210
refrigeration and you're better beef up on the horses for transportation because

15
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:58.920
those horseless carriage things and now we're going to take off,
okay,

16
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.173
what actually happened?

17
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.470
These are the charts where the land use to feed horses peaked at 89 million

18
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:11.991
acres a to less than 3 million in 1961 when they stopped keeping the records

19
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:15.030
because it was irrelevant and useless.

20
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.370
This is the,
what would you use this fuel?
Um,

21
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.690
these are all from department of Commerce went from a high of 5 billion cubic

22
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:29.691
feet in 1900 to less than 500 million acres in 1970 when they stopped keeping

23
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:34.320
the records because they weren't crucial to the economy.

24
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.770
So when you,
there was this great New York Times article,

25
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:45.510
I believe it was in 1896 the talked about the,
um,

26
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.450
the increase in horses for transportation in Manhattan and they projected the

27
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:56.451
increase in population and therefore the increase in horses to transport people

28
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.680
in the increase in the natural byproduct of horses on the streets of New York.

29
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.350
And they projected that in just a few years,

30
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.150
the average height of that natural byproduct was going to be taller than the

31
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:13.350
average person.
So what happened?
Oh,

32
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:17.040
this is at a time when the environmental technology was a bucket and a shovel.

33
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.820
Okay.
So what happened?
Did they ban horses?
No.

34
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.870
Technology intervene to change the equation,
a change,

35
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:27.630
the trajectory that we were on.
You can argue about whether or not cars were the,

36
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:31.140
uh,
and,
and,
and a trolley cars.
And things like that.

37
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:33.420
We're the best long term solution,

38
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.920
but science and technology intervene to change that unsustainable trajectory.

39
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.460
So we start looking at the great challenges of sustainability.

40
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:44.280
Everybody can have their own list,
but certainly,
um,

41
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.720
population has to be up there,
right?
So we're talking that,
uh,

42
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.490
let's see,
since around when I was,

43
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.180
I was born,
we're more than doubled the population.

44
00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:01.510
We went from 3 billion to over seven.
Okay.
Uh,

45
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.250
and the past,
um,
when I was 60 years,
we tripled the population.

46
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.950
And where is that population growth happening?

47
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.500
These are the richest nations of the world.

48
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.930
These are the poorest nations of the world.
Okay,
great.

49
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.110
So that tells us that what we have to do is increase the state of development of

50
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:30.220
the poorest nations in the world.
That will bring about higher quality of life,

51
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.840
higher state of development,
higher learning follows,
uh,
uh,

52
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.750
almost always follows I,
or empowerment and education of women.

53
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.810
And you bring about a stable population growth.

54
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.690
What's the problem with that?

55
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.970
Problem with that is that historically coupled with

56
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.090
increased of state of development has been increased resource depletion,

57
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.640
environmental degradation.
All right?

58
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.100
So the challenge becomes how do you increase the state of development,

59
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:07.810
the quality of life,
while reducing the detrimental effects,

60
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.730
the detrimental effects of,
uh,
uh,
of this economic growth,

61
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.510
avoiding the resource depletion.
Last I checked,

62
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:19.210
and that's exactly what Green Chemistry and green engineering is all about.

63
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.250
How you decrease the,
the adverse consequences,
the hazard,

64
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.640
the toxicity,
the pollution while getting higher performance.

65
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.510
That's what we're going to be talking about this whole semester is how do we

66
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:34.390
manifest this?
This is not going to be theory.

67
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.980
We're going to be seen countless examples of how we're achieving exactly that.

68
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.460
So what we want to do is get a,

69
00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:47.500
the highest state of development and do this kind of leapfrog technology.

70
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:49.870
And we're going to talk a lot about leapfrogs and I'm going to want all of you

71
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:53.860
to know about some of the leapfrog examples.
Okay?

72
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.683
Um,

73
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.950
this is one of my favorite of all of a president Kennedy's quads,

74
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.120
that the great enemy of the truth is very often,
not the lie,
deliberate,

75
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:07.990
contrived,
and dishonest,
but the myth persistent,
persuasive and realistic.

76
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.580
So there's a methodology that you can't have economic development,

77
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.370
you can't have growth,
you can't have increase in jobs,
you can't have,
uh,
uh,

78
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.620
increased quality of life unless you're going to essentially destroy the

79
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:28.270
environment,
use toxic substances.
Green Chemistry is belying that myth every day.

80
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.270
I'm going to talk to you a little bit about some of these.
So let's talk about

81
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.760
energy.

82
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.760
Everybody knows in this room knows that the vast majority of our energy in the

83
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:44.170
world today is generated from nonrenewable sources.
Um,

84
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.780
all right,

85
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.300
so this is the projected increase in consumption of energy over time.

86
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.100
These are the projections and this
is,

87
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.580
is projected to be the portfolio of energy.

88
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.470
Still oil,
still natural gas.

89
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.400
It's still call what Green Chemistry and green engineering sustainable design is

90
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:09.890
all about,
is changing that trajectory,

91
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.240
changing that balance so that though that is not inevitable.

92
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.551
All right?

93
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:21.470
So it's looking at developing alternatives for energy generation.

94
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.120
Everything from photovoltaics,
hydrogen generation,
fuel cells,
biobased,

95
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.403
uh,

96
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.890
in addition to these alternative energy sources that we're going to talk a lot

97
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:34.790
about.
It's also about Catalin Isis.

98
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.560
We're going to talk about [inaudible] and how you can undertake transformations,

99
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.520
for instance,
of one material into another with dramatically lower energy,

100
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.350
with dramatically lower waist,

101
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.340
with dramatically lower material consumption,

102
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.230
global change.
All right.
I hate the phrase global warming.
Um,
I,

103
00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.340
I sometimes use the phrase climatic chaos because what's happening is we're in,

104
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.280
we're adding energy into what's largely a closed system.
Um,

105
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.980
and when you do that,
some places will get warmer,
some places will get colder,

106
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.270
some places will get wet,
or some places will get dryer.
It's not about this,

107
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:22.220
this linear,
uh,
progression.
It's about how you add turbulence into,
uh,

108
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.730
into a system.
And the literal definition of the word chaos.

109
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.890
This is one of the classic,
uh,
pieces of,

110
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.520
of data.
The,

111
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.800
this shows the temperature change over the past thousand years.

112
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.590
This shows the increases in carbon dioxide concentrations over the last several

113
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.400
years.
Um,
and these are the initiatives over time.
Okay?

114
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:52.280
All right.
So I'm telling you this quick story.
One of the most powerful,

115
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.890
um,
greenhouse gasses is not,
um,

116
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.250
is not CO2,
but a lot of the CFCs,

117
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.700
the chloral floral conference and many of these were,
uh,

118
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.210
were used as fire extinguishing agents.
Okay.

119
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.680
This is an example of a technology it's called pirate piratical have a fire

120
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:20.210
extinguishing agent
that didn't use CFCs,

121
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.070
completely eliminated CFCs.
Um,
and so no emissions.

122
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:30.310
It basically serves to make water a more effective fire extinguishing agent by

123
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:36.050
using surfactants in a,
in a formulation.
Okay.
So why do I tell you that?

124
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:39.230
Because CFCs in such a big deal of fire extinguishing agents and they
contribute,

125
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.400
even though there are about 24,000 times more potent a greenhouse gas,

126
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.440
then CO2,
no,
that's not why I'm telling you until you this.

127
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:51.700
Because one,
you can use the science and technology of,

128
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.860
of this technology to use and other applications.
More importantly,

129
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:01.000
when this fire extinguishing agent was used in a,
uh,

130
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.810
and an oil tanker fire on the Bosphorus Straits,
Lloyd's of London,
uh,

131
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.960
estimated that this would take,
uh,

132
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.800
10 days to put out in this fire extinguishing agent,

133
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.360
put it out in 12 and a half minutes.
So what does that mean?

134
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.520
Come back to JFK?
The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie,

135
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.960
it's the myth.
The myth is the green products with Nahko went to work as well.

136
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.780
Then if you're going to get an environmental benefit,

137
00:09:29.781 --> 00:09:31.500
if you're not going to have environmental degradation,

138
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:33.870
you're not going to get the pro form.
It's on the function that you want.

139
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.830
I am going to show you,
your going to discover,

140
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:42.831
you're going to research examples over and over again that are more functional,

141
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:48.300
higher performance,
and uh,
environmentally beneficial and sustainable.

142
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.390
So how do we change the equation?
It's not about just CFCs or,
uh,

143
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.440
all the,
all the like,

144
00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.910
how do we make greenhouse gases so that,
that actually,
um,

145
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.800
uh,
functional,
uh,

146
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.670
how do we take CO2 and,

147
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.600
and build it into our polymers and plastics?
It's being done.

148
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.940
Brilliant work by uh,
a company founded by professor jokes,
Jeff Coulton Codec,

149
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:21.030
Cornell,
making new plastics using CO2.
All right,

150
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:26.490
so we know that we have a resource depletion issue that we've talked about that

151
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.570
we know that we were burning a lot of our natural capital a like it's a fire

152
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:35.070
sale.
How do we,
what green chemistry is doing is how do we use bio mass?

153
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.360
How do we use a nano science so that we get the,

154
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.630
the function that we want with dramatically less material?

155
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.740
How do we go into carryout transformations with visible light rather than

156
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.180
chemicals and material?

157
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.500
How do we use carbon dioxide as a feed stock rather than as a waste then,

158
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.540
but when it's a waste,
not a waste,
when it's a value added material,
all a waste.

159
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:06.830
Is this a material or energy for what you have not found?

160
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.560
A valuable endpoint and Titan,

161
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.400
which is a biopolymer or waste utilization.
All right,

162
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.460
I'm going to be wrapping up talking about a food supply.

163
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:26.020
We actually produce enough food.
There's an equitable distribution,

164
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.110
so there's still regional star starvation,
which is tragic.

165
00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.950
But if you take a look at the green revolution that I talked about,

166
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.540
Norman Borlaug,
this is the development since 1960.

167
00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.920
The food production absolutely astounding.
Food production,

168
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.340
the developing countries,
uh,
and industrialized nations,
both.

169
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.700
You have to ask the question,
how did it happen?

170
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.210
That's part of how it happened.
That's part of how it happened.

171
00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:01.420
So how do we get that important performance producing food,

172
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.230
feeding hungry bellies,
but not doing in a way that's,

173
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.600
that's contaminating our drinking water building up in our bodies.

174
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.840
And that's what green chemistry is developing new pesticides,

175
00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:18.040
which are only focused on the target pest and not all of the other beneficial

176
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:19.683
insects,

177
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.370
fertilizer and fruits that fertilizer agiment the draw the fertilizers to the

178
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:28.480
roots so that you don't put 10 times the amount of fertilizer so that you wind

179
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:30.190
up having it going into your drinking water,

180
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.990
but you only put down what is actually going to be,
uh,
taken up by the,
uh,

181
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.420
by the plant methods of using agricultural wastes for beneficial and profitable

182
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:43.870
uses.
So one of the key areas that we're going to talk about is,
um,

183
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.200
toxics in the environment.
Toxics in our body,

184
00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:52.201
and this is one of the great strengths of how you decouple the adverse

185
00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:54.880
consequences of,
of chemicals

186
00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.540
from the performance.
Then we talked about,

187
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.720
as you all know,
I'm a chemist,

188
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.000
I love chemistry,
I love chemicals,

189
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.890
I hate hazard.
I hate on sustainability,

190
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.990
and I ain't going to be the last one that will ever say we ought to stop using

191
00:13:19.991 --> 00:13:23.590
chemicals.
What we need is things that are chemical free.

192
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:28.330
I find that very silly.
We just discussed that everything's a chemical.

193
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.270
The reason that I've,

194
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.640
and on a personal have devoted my professional life to green chemistry is

195
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:43.480
because not because I,
I hate chemistry and it's like chemistry.

196
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:48.400
It's because we can do better.
They'd chemistry can do far better.

197
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:53.440
It's transformed the world and some very positive ways and it's transformed the

198
00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:55.990
world and some very consequential and adverse ways.

199
00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:01.420
And one of the things I know as a person who's been involved in green chemistry

200
00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:03.970
for a lot of years now,
um,

201
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:10.230
is that we can get the benefits without the adverse consequences.
