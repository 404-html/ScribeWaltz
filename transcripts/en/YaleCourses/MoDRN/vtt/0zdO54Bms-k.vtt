00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.880
Stay with the planet was still in the,
uh,

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.570
and the overview background section of this class.

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.280
And so if you say,
I think that we're going big picture.
You're right.

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.250
We're going big picture right now and we're going to drill down.

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.910
But what I want to do is talk about where we are currently and two to do a uh,

6
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.870
a full treatment of that is of course,
absolutely impossible.

7
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.910
So I can do almost little more than metaphor.
Uh,
but let's,

8
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.650
let's try,
so this is a demonstration that maybe some of you saw,

9
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.860
but it's the earth and 10 seconds,
okay?
What does that happening?

10
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.360
It means while you're waiting for this,

11
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.590
I want you to take a deep breath and I want you to hold that breath.

12
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.060
I want you to do this.
Literally,
I want you to do it literally.

13
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:00.270
I want you to take a deep breath and watch it or hold it for 10 seconds.

14
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.220
10 seconds is very long,
but I want you to get a feel for what 10 seconds is.

15
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.883
<v 1>Okay?</v>

16
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.310
<v 0>Exhale.
That's 10 seconds.
We got 10 seconds.</v>

17
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.960
You've got it locked in.
All right,
10 seconds.

18
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.630
42 children were born 40 in the poorest nations in the world.

19
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.440
10 seconds,
10 seconds.

20
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.850
4,100 worth of damage was done to the global economy through polluting,

21
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.840
close to waters,
and totaling 13 billion in year,

22
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.120
10 seconds,
119 tons of hazardous and toxic waste,

23
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.680
or out into the world.
10 seconds.

24
00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:55.510
Two people died from drinking bad water.

25
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.380
A 1 billion don't have access to clean drinking water.

26
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.290
And 2 billion don't have access to sanitation.

27
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.350
<v 1>Ah,</v>

28
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.180
<v 0>almost 4,000 tons of fuel consumed.</v>

29
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.340
2000 tons of co two is added to the atmosphere.

30
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.810
2 billion people don't have access to electricity,

31
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.630
and Paul billion don't have adequate supplies.
Furniture.

32
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.960
Three children died of preventable diseases,
malaria,
pneumonia,
measles,

33
00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:34.760
malnutrition,
dysentery.
Of the three children that die to be,
to have babies.

34
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.120
And the last 10 seconds,
four acres of rain forests were destroyed.

35
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.390
All right?
So any one of those things is,
um,

36
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.490
is of concern.
