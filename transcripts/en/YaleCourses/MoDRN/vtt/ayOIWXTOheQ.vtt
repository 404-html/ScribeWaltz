1
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.950
Okay.
So when we look at the system of toxicants versus,
uh,

2
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.793
other toxicants,

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.430
a systematic toxicant is one that's going to affect the entirety of your body.

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.730
Okay?

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.230
So when you start thinking about something like a potassium cyanide that is

6
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:26.670
going to affect a cell's ability,
um,
uh,

7
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.520
uh,
to,
um,
uh,

8
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.720
to absorb and utilize oxygen [inaudible] uh,
uh,

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.280
that's going to be something that's not unique to any particular organ.

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.020
That is going to be a systemic effect.
Okay.
Um,

11
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.460
target specific toxicants are going to,

12
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.840
uh,
as,
as it would suggest go after a particular,
um,

13
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.510
uh,
organ or tissue.
For instance,
when we,
uh,

14
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.060
we started thinking about the central nervous system.

15
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.930
Led is a particular target organ at,
uh,
uh,
letters,

16
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:11.310
a particular agent for central nervous system development.

17
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.260
Um,
mercury can be a central nervous system.

18
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.413
Um,

19
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.490
toxicant when we start thinking about classes of chemicals such as ISO sinaits,

20
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:26.940
they may affect the immune system,
ethanol and Acetaminophen.

21
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.210
The liver tobacco smoke as best as ozone,

22
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:35.211
all can affect the respiratory tract and under a UV light can affect the eyes.

23
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.580
Various metals can affect the kidney.
Um,
and,

24
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.943
uh,

25
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.210
give the example here of they promo chloral propane is in fact in reproductive

26
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:48.840
dough.

27
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.840
So what we're looking at is different pathways to manifest toxicity.

28
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.860
Some can go throughout your whole body,
some will affect specific target organs.

29
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.670
What is some of the factors,
again,
key slide,

30
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.850
the factors affecting chemical toxicity.
So the uh,

31
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.960
the form and the inherent,
um,

32
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.010
chemical activity of some,

33
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.800
how reactive is the chemical,

34
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.820
how Seibel as the chemical.
Uh,

35
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.600
when we talk about the electronic properties and the polarizability,

36
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.100
all of those factors are important.
The form of the substance,

37
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.180
whether or not the substance is a gas,
a liquid,

38
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.520
a solid,
when you start thinking about the kind of toxicity,
uh,

39
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.980
related to nano toxicity nanoparticles,

40
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.340
whether those substances are of a certain size and aspect ratio aspect ratio

41
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:57.170
being the,
um,
the combination of Linkedin with,
uh,

42
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.550
that's important to as best as that's to mammals substitutes.

43
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.940
So the character of the molecules itself are going to be a crucial,

44
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.930
um,
about whether or not there's going to be toxic.
Uh,

45
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:15.330
we already talked about dosage and the um,
uh,

46
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.280
the amount of time of that dose

47
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.340
exposure route.

48
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.810
So the same substance if,
uh,

49
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.040
if swallowed versus inhaled,
um,
uh,
uh,

50
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.170
versus rubbed on your skin
or any other route,

51
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.560
uh,
can have different,
different effects,

52
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.350
the ability to be absorbed,
uh,
something that uh,
they'd can't be absorbed,

53
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:50.440
can't cause toxic effects.
The metabolism rate,

54
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.730
whether or not you're able to break this down into something that is non toxic.

55
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.880
So the activation that's going to affect it,

56
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.550
a distribution within the body,
again,

57
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.880
if it only stays within your digestive system,
it gets excreted,

58
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.620
can't spread to other organs.
It's not going to,
um,
uh,

59
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.940
be able to cause a problem,

60
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:14.320
excretion rate directly related to that presence of other chemicals.

61
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.080
This is something that we're going to return to.

62
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.600
So are you ever exposed to one chemical at a time?
No.

63
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.350
We're all swimming in a sea of chemicals all the time.
What you eat,

64
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.930
what you breathe.
All of those things can either,
uh,

65
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.280
affect things in our,
uh,
in a positive way from a,

66
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.190
um,
from a,
uh,

67
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.870
toxicological standpoint or negative.
In other words,

68
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.950
a toxicant can be chaperoned across a biological membrane.

69
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.250
We're going to talk a lot more about that in just a minute,
but simply saying,

70
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.020
oh,
this substance is toxic or not toxic isn't always the whole story.
