1
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.490
So bio degradation,
there's a lot of definitions out there.

2
00:00:07.491 --> 00:00:12.491
A lot of them are sort of political and regulatory and in the details,

3
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.060
but the most basic definition of biotech decoration you'll see out there is
that,

4
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.421
you know,

5
00:00:17.421 --> 00:00:20.810
the bio part means that there needs to be some sort of biological activity going

6
00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:24.140
on and that there should be some kind of change taking place.

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.280
And that's really it.

8
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.340
And all the details are about what kind of biological organisms and then what

9
00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:32.570
kind of changes are taking place.

10
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.950
So the most commonly accepted

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.710
definitions of vibe Degra biodegradability that you'll see in commercial

12
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:46.310
products,
like when something is advertised as being bio degradable,

13
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.940
there's often come from the Oec d guidelines and they have a couple of

14
00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:54.410
categories.
There's ready biodegradability and ultimate biodegradability.

15
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.800
And you can see these are,
these are pretty complicated definition.

16
00:00:57.801 --> 00:01:02.801
So the ready biodegradability test is you'll have some kind of organic chemical

17
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.070
that dissolves in water and do you set up a 28 day test and sometime during that

18
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:14.360
28 day test you have to either will not either you have to remove 70% of the

19
00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:19.361
dissolved organic carbon and achieve a certain level of theoretical oxygen

20
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:24.460
demand or co two production within a 10 day window.
So cut all that.

21
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.400
So thinking about these different requirements,

22
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.360
if we think back to the early classes when we're talking about stoichiometry,

23
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.490
what,
why,
why would we be talking about oxygen demand and CO2 production?
What,

24
00:01:36.491 --> 00:01:39.290
what's happening to the,
to the organic chemical.

25
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.080
So we have some generic carbon in there.
What's going on?

26
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.400
What's the reaction?

27
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.730
So what,
what's reacting?
Yeah.
So yeah,

28
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.000
some sort of oxygen and it can be Otu gas.

29
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.060
I mean biological organisms are very complicated.

30
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:06.110
There may be some sort of catalyst involved inside the cell,
inside the bacteria.

31
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.740
And then your product is c o two and so you can calculate it as we did earlier

32
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:17.000
in class based on how much carbon is in your compound.

33
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.230
What is the theoretical amount of oxygen that you would need and then what's the

34
00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:23.540
theoretical amount of co two that you can produce.

35
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.930
So those numbers are very easy to come up with theoretically.

36
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:29.510
And then you basically sat the test to measure that.

37
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.610
And the reason why they're doing this,

38
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:35.990
this 10 day window in a 28 day test is you could imagine a couple of different

39
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:39.410
scenarios.
So if this is a time component,

40
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.360
and let's say this is co two production,

41
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.360
so if something is really quickly biodegradable and you know bacteria loves it,

42
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.250
you might expect something kind of like this.

43
00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.400
So you get really rapid production of co two and then eventually it runs out of

44
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:04.930
the chemical,
right?
You could have something that looks like this,

45
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:07.570
that maybe the bacteria is not familiar with this substrate.

46
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.500
And then over time it adapts to it and then starts

47
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.193
consuming it.

48
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.420
And then you can also have situations where the bacteria just doesn't know what

49
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:24.400
to do with it at all.
And if you're lucky,
maybe you get five or 10%.

50
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.100
So something like this,
this could,

51
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.160
you could achieve your 60 70% biodegradation in a 10 day window and something

52
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:36.550
like this,
you know,
your 10 day window,

53
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.670
both of these are considered essentially readily biodegradable.

54
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:46.240
So in some 10 day period you're getting rid of virtually all of the,

55
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.770
the carbon

56
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.730
and then ultimate biodegradability is kind of a step down.
That just means that,

57
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.780
uh,
instead of a 10 day window,
you've done it in a 28 day window.

58
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.350
So it's not as fast,
but it still gets the job done.

59
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.301
And then the,

60
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:09.301
the level of complexity can get almost a arbitrarily

61
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.250
complex that,
uh,

62
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.580
thinking about different organisms that you might encounter in different

63
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:20.110
situations.
So,
um,
wastewater treatment,
bacteria versus soil,

64
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:23.890
bacteria,
aerobic versus anaerobic.
So this is,
uh,

65
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.600
an important consideration because we were just talking about c plus o going to

66
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:33.070
see o two is that aerobic or anaerobic?
So that's Arabic.

67
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:38.050
So under aerobic conditions you have your C's going to see oh two.

68
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.040
Um,

69
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.040
we have like an would be going to an x and s mean to sox and so on.

70
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.830
Um,
metals,
I'll just put m for metals are going to be going to

71
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.200
metal oxides and then under anaerobic conditions.

72
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.770
So there's no oxygen present.
You have reducing environment.

73
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.150
Does anybody know what,
what carbon's going to under reducing environments?

74
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.771
So where,

75
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:10.420
where would you encounter Arabic biodegradation like surface

76
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.570
and like moving water?
Um,
if you're,

77
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.680
depending on what type type of compost you're doing,

78
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.330
so compost where they're mixing it continuously.

79
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.610
How about anaerobic?
Where,
where,

80
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.800
where do we to peer about methane emissions and ammonia emissions?

81
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:34.801
Most landfills are packed so tightly that there's essentially no way for the

82
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.230
oxygen to penetrate down into where the organic stuff is.

83
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:42.010
And so the anaerobic bacteria thrive under those conditions.

84
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.990
So not everybody will choose to use OEC DEF OACD definitions.

85
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:50.560
There's also ISO methods,
EPA methods,
STM methods.
And there,

86
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.990
there are literally dozens if not hundreds of them.

87
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.200
And that basically just speaks to the complexity of bio degradation pathways

88
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.110
that um,
you know,
each organism is going to have its own enzymes,

89
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:07.120
its own catalysts,
and probably different intermediates.
So the,

90
00:06:07.121 --> 00:06:12.121
the methods that go with actually tracking biodegradation are pretty labor

91
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:14.320
intensive.
So,
uh,

92
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.640
a lot of them have to do with measuring either your starting material directly

93
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.530
or measuring these different gases.
So that's what these,
uh,

94
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.460
this dissolved organic carbon doc die away.

95
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:30.970
That would be tracking disappearance of the carbon,
uh,

96
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.080
CO2 evolution o two consumption.
There's different gas detecting technologies.

97
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.790
And then to this point about like,
uh,

98
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.390
oxygen depleted water versus oxygen rich water.

99
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:46.130
There's all types of different matrices that you can look at.
So soil,
um,

100
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.400
different types of aqueous environments.

101
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.220
ANAEROBIC digesters are big one because a lot of people are setting up these bio

102
00:06:53.221 --> 00:06:57.400
gas facilities where they're shoveling organic stuff into,
uh,
an,
uh,

103
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.400
an anaerobic reactor on purpose because they want to capture the methane gas.

104
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.741
And there,

105
00:07:02.741 --> 00:07:07.010
there are tests where you can simulate composting at different temperatures.
So,

106
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.080
um,
in compost bacteria are used to having higher temperatures.

107
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.040
You have to model that.

108
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.330
And then there's processes where you might introduce some other chemical

109
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:17.871
techniques.

110
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:22.871
So helping the bio degradation along by using something like photochemistry if

111
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:27.500
the chemical reacts with,
with,
um,
with light or,

112
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.150
um,
like UV radiation,
uh,
uh,

113
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.510
foot,
uh,
hydrolytic chemistry can also help these things along.

114
00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:39.410
And that might help shorten some of these induction periods where the bacteria

115
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:42.350
may not know what to do with the chemical in the very beginning.

116
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.800
But if you're sort of pushing that process along through photo chemistry,

117
00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:47.040
then you can get,

118
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.900
get it to look more like this rapid profile.
