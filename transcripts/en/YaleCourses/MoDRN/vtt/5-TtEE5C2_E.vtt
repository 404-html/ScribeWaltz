WEBVTT

1
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.660
So we've said a number of times that traditional feedstocks are petroleum based,

2
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.820
that we understand that there are issues with petroleum based feed stocks in

3
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:25.320
terms of uh,
depletion,
finite resource,

4
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.720
uh,
many of them are linked to particular types of toxics and,

5
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.600
uh,
that are inherent in those feedstocks.

6
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.610
And there's a significant,
uh,
uh,

7
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.730
area of development in green chemistry around the use of renewable feedstocks,

8
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:48.420
alternative feedstocks that,
uh,
that might be,
um,

9
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.760
might not have the same challenges as petroleum.
Right.

10
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.860
So what I'd like to do is just show you a few things at the,

11
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:59.220
at the cutting ends that have been really accomplished,
uh,

12
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.180
and recognized through the presidential green chemistry challenge and woods and

13
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:07.380
Richard Wall is a professor down at the University of Delaware.
Um,

14
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.690
anybody here at blue hen.
Okay.
The University of Delaware.

15
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.940
And He,
he's,
uh,

16
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.930
we've collaborated with a professor will on a number of things,

17
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.230
but he is just a tremendously creative chemical engineer.

18
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.660
And one of the things that he's developed as a whole new series of composites,

19
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.060
uh,
biobase composite and you see it's derived from,
uh,

20
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.510
everything from,
uh,
flax,
vegetable oils,

21
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:42.720
lignin cellulose and chicken feathers,

22
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.030
chicken feathers,
really chicken feathers.

23
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.230
So one of the things that,
uh,
he's,

24
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.490
he's designed these composites for wide ranges of,
of materials,

25
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.150
a wide range of applications.
For instance,
um,

26
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.990
has he put these composites into hurricane resistant housing and had the

27
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.520
demonstrated out it down after Katrina?
Yes.

28
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.790
Has he used these composites for a large wind turbines,

29
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.850
uh,
that,
that need the kind of strength and flexibility,
uh,

30
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.530
that are about a football field long,
some of these giant propellers?

31
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.600
Yes,
but the one that I actually really like is when he

32
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.370
put it in a,

33
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.370
and used it as a replacement for alternative feedstock for a silicon chip.

34
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.210
And let's say you're making computer chips out of chicken feathers.

35
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.370
And he said,
yeah,
because the,

36
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.620
the nano structures and the sizing of the chicken feathers actually had at the

37
00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:53.820
time it was conducted a higher clock speed than the,

38
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.750
than the Intel chip that it was replacing.
Uh,

39
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.070
so it is not,
we always returned to this.

40
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.130
It's not just about using green chemistry or alternative material to do things

41
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.650
that either the same or a little bit worse and you have to sacrifice.

42
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.640
It's how do you get higher performance by,
uh,

43
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.450
by using these alternative processes.
So yes,

44
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.920
does it consume less water and energy and produce less ways to,

45
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.710
yeah,
but it's about the performance of these new composites.

46
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.600
I should say that all of these that I'm going to be discussing today are able to

47
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:42.220
be found on the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award website run by the

48
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.054
EPA.

49
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.160
<v 1>All right.</v>

50
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.480
<v 0>Then there's Jeffcoat another,
um,</v>

51
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.040
good green chemist who was recognized and he's made a whole series of,

52
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.540
of new,
of new polymers.
Um,

53
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.810
his feedstock is carbon dioxide.
Okay.
So,

54
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.063
uh,

55
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.780
we know that a polycarbonate cross,

56
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.430
his name a carbonate,
uh,

57
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.820
has CO2 and its and its backbone.

58
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.580
So he is found ways of uh,

59
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:27.830
and Torical elating reacting and getting the CEO to,
uh,

60
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.330
could also do it with carbon monoxide because of the of the catalyst that he's,

61
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.780
uh,
these invented to,
to be in Turkey lived there.

62
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.540
So why do,
why do we care about this?
Why is it,

63
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.580
why is this such a good thing too to use co two as a feed stock for polymers,

64
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.560
that's plenty of CO2.
So here's the thing,
a lot of chemical products,

65
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.830
our feed stock driven the major part of the cost for a wide range of especially

66
00:04:59.961 --> 00:05:03.650
high volume,
um,
materials,
the cost of fee,

67
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.600
the feedstock is what's going to drive the price of the product and many,

68
00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:11.570
many different types of commodity products.

69
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.130
So if you take something that is not only a waste,

70
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.200
so maybe it's a,
maybe it's zero,
zero cost,

71
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.060
but now people are paying to get rid of erotic to capture it,
etc.
Etc.

72
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.010
Then all of a sudden that becomes a really good economic equation.

73
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.590
Now it's easy to start asking.
The cast came and questions of,
well,

74
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.660
how do you get that feed stock?

75
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.650
Is it really coming out as pure Sio two or do I have to separate it from other

76
00:05:42.651 --> 00:05:44.210
gasses and what kind of energy do I have?

77
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.590
So there's a lot of questions that need to be honest.
Bioamber um,

78
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.830
this is,
uh,
another,
uh,
uh,
uh,

79
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.860
ability to make a bio based material feedstock to make succinic acid.

80
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.240
Succinic acid is because it's one of those so called platform chemicals that

81
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.070
that uh,
a lot of people might not care about succinic acid itself,

82
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.960
but instead it's a,
it's what you can make from,
uh,
six,

83
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.710
six succinic acid.
They talk about,
um,
uh,

84
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.220
not even a gen genetically engineering or making things from,
uh,

85
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.530
from bio organism.
This is a modified eco eco like catalyst.
Uh,

86
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.030
we could go into a lot of the fact that,
oh,

87
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.840
most of these biobased processes are taking place in,

88
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.160
in water rather than using organic solvents and all of the issues associated

89
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:41.870
with that.
Um,

90
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.040
but I wanted to point out that,
uh,

91
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.910
this method for producing 600 gas costs 40% less than the traditional petroleum

92
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:56.690
based food and consume 60% less energy.
Okay.
Again,

93
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.630
you're going to hear me say this a thousand times until you've driven crazy

94
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.670
green chemistry cannot,
must not be a,
well,

95
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:07.370
it's going to cost you a little lid more and it's going to perform a little bit

96
00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:11.990
less.
This needs to always show those,
um,
those advantages.

97
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.810
Genomatica another example of a building block chemical.
This is um,

98
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.730
this chemical is essential to the Olympics.

99
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.160
Why is it essential?

100
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:30.140
The Olympics could not be held today without BDO.
Why?

101
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.800
Cause it's used in making spandex.

102
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.250
The Olympics can be held without spanned x.

103
00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:41.510
We know that I watch the Winter Olympics,
I see speed skating.

104
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.160
Um,
anyhow,
I also wanted to point out again,

105
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.400
consumed 60% less energy and has a 70% a smaller carbon footprint and the cost

106
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:57.920
is projected to be 15 to 30% less than the petroleum based manufacturer.

107
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.690
I just toss this one in there.
Maybe because,
uh,

108
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.880
instead of just talking about chemical building blocks,

109
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:09.410
here's an example of Patel hotel that is making a printer toner.
Uh,

110
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.470
so he's saying,
Oh,
do they make any consumer products?
Yeah.

111
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.300
So here at silver printer toner,

112
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.590
who knew that 400 million pounds of printer toner we used,
uh,
uh,

113
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.510
every year I showed him.

114
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:24.560
But if it gets 25% market penetration,
uh,

115
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.100
it's looking at 360,000 tons of co two reduction,
uh,

116
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.480
a year.
Um,

117
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.490
this is not only a naturally base pesticide,

118
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.660
but it's also a thousand times less toxic to humans and 44 times less toxic.

119
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:49.910
Then the two common pesticides that are used,
uh,
currently,
uh,

120
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.650
and it's effective at 10 to 34 times smaller,
uh,
application,

121
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.131
uh,

122
00:08:55.131 --> 00:09:00.131
rate and is expected to replace 1.8 million pounds of organophosphates.
