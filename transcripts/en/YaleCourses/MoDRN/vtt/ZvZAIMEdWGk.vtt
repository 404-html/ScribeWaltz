00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.430
One of the most infamous cases of a drug being introduced was thalidomide and

2
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:16.800
Thalidomide,
uh,
was,
uh,
was used for morning sickness story and pregnancy,

3
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:21.220
primarily in Germany.
A little bit in,
uh,
uh,
in the UK.
Uh,

4
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.070
it was introduced in Germany in the 50s,

5
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:30.130
was used widely at least until the mid sixties.
Um,

6
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.780
and so,
um,

7
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.450
it's estimated that somewhere between 7,000 to 10,000 children were born with

8
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.430
dramatic,
a malformation of,
of limbs,
uh,
uh,

9
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.740
so called thalidomide babies.
This is the difference between,

10
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.630
uh,
uh,

11
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.140
the Terada Gin and the morning sickness drug that one bond,

12
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.870
cause you remember a in three dimensional space,

13
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.710
a bold a bond is coming out toward the,

14
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.520
toward you in three dimensional space and a dash bond is going away from you in

15
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.180
three dimensional space.
Merely the orientation of the,
uh,

16
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:19.920
of that one bond means that this one does,

17
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.880
uh,
does not fit into the DNA major groove.

18
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.440
If you imagine the grooves of the double helix,
and it's fine,

19
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:31.320
it's a great drug for morning sickness,
but here,

20
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.790
because it can't fit into that groove,
it brings about,
uh,

21
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.720
genetic mutations,
which,
which make it act as a birth defect agent.

22
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.850
Um,
so,

23
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.470
and when this was originally produced,

24
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.970
it was produced as,
um,
what's called a racemic mixture,

25
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.890
meaning that both are made at the same time and equal proportions.
