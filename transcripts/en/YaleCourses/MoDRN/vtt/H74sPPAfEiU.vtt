00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.310
So focusing in more on this,
this water energy connection,

2
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.720
I kind of touched on this at the beginning,
but so producing water needs energy.

3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.020
Uh,
if you're pumping from underground pumping from the river,

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.290
you have to treat it.
You have to transport it somewhere,
uh,

5
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.790
in the end use.
You've got to,
you know,
put it up in a storage tower somewhere.

6
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:26.520
You've got to build more infrastructure.
All these things need energy.

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.130
And then when you're producing energy,
you need water.

8
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:33.570
So if you're extracting crude oil,
uh,
you know,
fracking,

9
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.940
obviously you're injecting large quantities of water into the ground.
Um,

10
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.650
cooling is a huge use of water.

11
00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:45.300
So if you go to any power plant or any plant that needs to be cooled,

12
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:48.480
they'll often have these giant cooling ponds that process a lot of water

13
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.280
hydropower clearly,
and then emission controls as well.
So,
uh,

14
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.240
CO2 capture and scrubbing of,
um,
say like,
uh,

15
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.010
Nox sox compounds would need water as well.

16
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.800
So this is kind of a,
unfortunately a,

17
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:07.800
a positive feedback loop that the more water you produce,

18
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:11.310
more energy you need and more energy produced,
the more water you need.

19
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.810
And you can do some kind of rough calculations just based on water consumption

20
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:22.110
and electricity production values.
Um,

21
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.480
this is kind of back of the envelope,
but approximately when we generate energy,

22
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:30.750
we're,
we're using about two gallons of water for every kilowatt hour.

23
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.860
So I'm coming back to the styrofoam container energy,

24
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.470
a styrofoam container example from before.

25
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.460
So we said producing and using one of these styrofoam containers is about a mega

26
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:45.450
joule of energy.
So to produce that energy,
that's about half a gallon of water.

27
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:50.451
So every one of these containers has essentially half gallon of water embedded

28
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:52.860
in it.
And that's not direct water use.

29
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:54.660
That's just for the energy that went into it.

30
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:56.700
So if you're using any other water to,

31
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.530
to wash this or in the manufacturing process that,
that adds to this,

32
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.620
this burden.
So like professor nastiness was saying,

33
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:09.240
if you are in the United States and you're buying styrofoam containers from

34
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:10.430
China,
uh,

35
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.470
you're in fact importing water from China because they're producing their energy

36
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.160
there to do all the manufacturing and then it's being shipped into the United

37
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.993
States.

38
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.110
Another really common area where we would see this direct energy and water

39
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.850
connection would be through something like desalination where,
uh,
you know,

40
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:33.720
what we saw at the beginning of the oceans are 97% of the water and the earth,

41
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.540
if you want to take advantage of that,
get some fresh water,

42
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.150
you'd force it through a membrane,
separate out the salt,

43
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.430
get less say line solution.

44
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.600
But you have to be applying a pretty high pressures to do this.

45
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:50.160
So I'm looking at typical seawater in the U S or Middle East,

46
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.710
you would have to be applying,
um,
you know,

47
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:55.800
600 to 1200 pounds per square inch of pressure.

48
00:02:55.801 --> 00:03:00.801
That's obviously a very large energy requirement and you start seeing this,

49
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.310
um,
don't,
don't worry about all the differences between these,

50
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:05.680
but this is just some,
um,

51
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.760
sales materials for different membranes that are used in desalination.

52
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.240
And the main metric you use to compare all these membranes is kilowatt hours per

53
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.250
thousand gallons of water.
So,
uh,

54
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.360
each gallon of water that you produced by this technique is going to have,
uh,

55
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.410
a pretty substantial amount of energy consumption.
