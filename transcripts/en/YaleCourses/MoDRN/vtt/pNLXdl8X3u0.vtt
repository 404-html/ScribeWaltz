1
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.780
What is some of the strategies to do this,

2
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.500
uh,

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.500
modify or actually break a mechanism of action that would lead to toxicity.

4
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.440
So when you know,
the,
the mechanism of,

5
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.430
of what has to happen in the body in order to cause a toxic effect,
you,

6
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.040
um,
you make that greatly disfavored through,

7
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.480
through molecular design or you make an impossible,
um,
change the,

8
00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:37.470
the various reactive functional groups that you know are related to that

9
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:42.090
toxicity.
You reduced or eliminated bioavailability.
We've talked about a lot.

10
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.260
Um,
you reduce the need for associated,

11
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.330
uh,
hazardous substances.
What do I mean by that?
Well,
we'll talk more about it,

12
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:56.331
but sometimes the molecule that you're using isn't what you're most worried

13
00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:59.340
about.
However,

14
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.930
it requires the use of another associated substance.

15
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.320
One example might be paint.

16
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.750
Maybe you've made the perfectly innocuous die and that's fantastic,

17
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.370
but that di can only be used in a particular paint solvent system and that

18
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:19.760
solvent system is as bad.
What you've,

19
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.960
what you've done is you've shifted your hazard concern from a that molecule to

20
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:30.840
the fact that it requires a different,
uh,
toxic substance.

21
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.000
And we talked a lot last session about the design,
uh,
of,
uh,

22
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.690
end of useful life phonic life.
So we are,

23
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:42.790
the mechanism of action is known.
The,
the first one,
uh,

24
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.820
it's possible to,
um,

25
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.440
to design the molecule so that electronically it can't carry out those

26
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:56.370
reactions.
And in order to bring about toxicity,

27
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.440
it is just not able to react.
Um,
and that is,
um,

28
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.550
that's always going to result in lower toxicity with the reactive functional

29
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:13.100
groups.
There are whole classes of,
uh,

30
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.090
of different chemicals that we know bring about toxicity.

31
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.520
Uh,
we know that certain types of electro files,

32
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.980
those electron loving,
um,

33
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.470
molecules are going to carry out reactions in the body.

34
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.690
If you make something less electrophilic,
if you move that electrophilic group,

35
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.620
you're going to drastically does favor the ability for that to do it.

36
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.520
So changing the reactive functional group,
a,
um,
a night trial,

37
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.910
that's a c triple bond and,
uh,

38
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.060
nay trials are widely used in industry,
are being any groups

39
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.820
widely used in industry for wide range of,

40
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.820
you'll note that it might wind up being able to release cyanide

41
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.960
by moving away from,
uh,

42
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.390
the use of an eight trial group substituting in another group,

43
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.220
you'll be able to move to a less toxic alternatives.

44
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.623
Uh,

45
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.050
we've talked a lot about reducing or eliminating bioavailability since we know

46
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:28.711
how to design molecules that have a different log kows [inaudible] partition

47
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:34.610
coefficient that we all remember,
uh,

48
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.030
whether or not something's going to be respirable and be able to breathe in by

49
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:44.230
changing that,
we can get out of the zone of,
uh,

50
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.460
of bioavailability.

51
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.770
And I already mentioned that different types of,

52
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.520
uh,
using the example of paints that it requires solvents,

53
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.850
different types of plastics that require particular types of additives that we

54
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.860
have already visited.
There can be a carcinogenic sometimes,
uh,

55
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.720
uh,
endocrine disrupting,
moving away from,

56
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.110
from those substances requiring these or these other hazardous substances.

57
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.570
And then we covered a lot of ground last,
uh,
last week,
uh,

58
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.450
on the end of useful life.
