WEBVTT

1
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.010
We produce a lot of water and a kind of a shocking amount of it and gets lost.

2
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.500
Uh,
the quality matters.

3
00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:14.520
So just like all those fuels had to go through numerous purification steps.

4
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:19.500
Obviously we want clean water for a,
whether it's drinking or chemical processes,

5
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:24.020
chemical processes may even be more sensitive than humans are to the wall water

6
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.800
quality,
uh,

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.960
in terms of chemistry versus society.
Uh,

8
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.420
water and energy are both competing against,
you know,

9
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:37.710
making a chemical versus keeping somebody warm and healthy and fed and

10
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:42.210
everything.
Water has to be distributed across large distances.

11
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.750
It's directly tied to the environment and pretty much every way.

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.510
And uh,
the more you invest in it,
the more quality you get.
Just like,

13
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.570
you know,
fuels.
The more,
the more complicated your system,

14
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:58.920
you can get a nicer fuel out,
you know,
clean coal,
clean diesel,
whatever.
And then,

15
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.910
uh,
on the political side,
it's also very heavily regulated.

16
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.790
So,
and I think pretty much everyone has a good idea of that.
Water is,

17
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.450
a lot of things are competing for water.
Um,
as a chemist,

18
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.480
if we're doing a reaction that needs a little bit of water,
that,
you know,

19
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.360
that's really important to us,
but,
uh,
you know,

20
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:23.160
people in other parts of the world are having to deal with water for a lot more

21
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.300
critical things to them.

22
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.100
Industrial water is just one of one box out of many,
many,
uh,

23
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.610
boxes and the overall,
uh,
water cycle.

24
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:36.780
So we have to be pretty cognizant of if we're going to set up a chemical process

25
00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:39.690
that uses water or in fact just uses energy at all,

26
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.700
how that's going to affect these other applications.
So again,

27
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:46.020
just like energy,
the,

28
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:50.560
the critical drivers that there's just not a lot of water for increasing demand.

29
00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:54.060
So,
uh,
although there's plenty of ocean water,

30
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.150
pretty much everybody wants groundwater and freshwater for chemical processes as

31
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:05.181
well as drinking and basic needs and the amount of fresh water that's available

32
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:11.300
looks like a pretty big number.
But then when you start to look at,
uh,
this,

33
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.290
this is a number just for the u s itself,

34
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.330
how much we process or touch in some way.
Uh,

35
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.580
every year these numbers are,
I mean,

36
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:23.880
they're five orders of magnitudes five orders of magnitude apart.

37
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.050
But if you consider just the quantity of water,
it's,
it's pretty impressive.

38
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:31.500
I think that we're affecting that much of the,
the global water supply.

39
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.560
And if you were to multiply this across the whole world,

40
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:38.100
this would obviously go up probably another order of magnitude.

41
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.800
And why that's important is that different parts of the world have different

42
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:46.560
access to water.
Sure.
Everybody's pretty familiar with that.

43
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.920
And so why this matters for chemicals is if you're producing,

44
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:54.420
say a chemical in India as opposed to producing a chemical in Canada,

45
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.530
uh,
if you're having a very water intensive process,

46
00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:02.170
you're going to be having creating much larger impacts and some of these

47
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:05.590
countries as opposed to areas where the water is plentiful.

48
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.690
So the,

49
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.830
the national labs have produced the same kind of flow charts like we saw for

50
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:14.200
energy and they're kind of set up the same way.

51
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:18.310
So here are the sources over on the side,
uh,
surface water,

52
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.630
either fresh or salty and then groundwater,
fresh or salty,

53
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.530
and then the different uses.
So a domestic,
here's the,

54
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.570
the industrial use and then what happens to the water in the end?

55
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:36.370
So a lot of it just gets re,
uh,
discharged or,

56
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.910
uh,
spent,
uh,

57
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.120
discharge to the ocean and then either completely consumed or evaporated back

58
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:45.190
into the global water cycle.

59
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.940
And so if we look at the commercial and industrial cause this is where chemicals

60
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:49.540
are.

61
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.480
One of the important things is that a lot of it is being drawn from the public

62
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:55.250
water supply.
And the reason that's important is because the,

63
00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:59.000
the public water supply is one of the most heavily purified system.

64
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.610
So it has all these embedded impacts associated with that technology.
So,

65
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.690
um,
you know,
we,
we don't just drink directly from the river.
It has to go through,

66
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.680
uh,
you know,

67
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.760
settling stages filtrations there's usually a chemical processes applied.

68
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:14.470
All those things have their embedded energy.

69
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.290
Some of those processes have their own water requirements.

70
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.270
And then for then finally it's getting into the industrial process,

71
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.490
which may be again tweaking it even further before or finally it gets released.

72
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.100
And just like we saw for energy with losses and transmission lines and we see,

73
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.930
uh,
arguably worse and water systems because a lot of the water infrastructure,

74
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.200
especially in the u s was built a hundred years ago,

75
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:45.610
if not earlier and has not been maintained very well.
So I'm

76
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.010
looking at some of the large water systems in the u s there's Philadelphia,

77
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.150
more than 30% of the water is just lost in the pipe system.
So they're applying,

78
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.000
they're extracting a lot of groundwater there are treating it.

79
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:03.001
And then a pretty large proportion of that is just going back into and to the,

80
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:07.800
um,
to places where it's not going to be used.
And,
I mean,

81
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.260
this is only a couple of water districts across the u s but you can start to

82
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.000
kind of consider the added up impacts from,
uh,

83
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.100
just the losses themselves and then the financial value if you're not entirely

84
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:23.830
motivated by the environmental impacts there clearly,
uh,

85
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.400
economic impacts that can be associated with this as well.
