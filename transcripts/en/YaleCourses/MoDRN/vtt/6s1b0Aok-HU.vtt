WEBVTT

1
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.310
A key concept in this course,
we'll be lifecycle.

2
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.130
So these are the different lifecycle stages,
material extraction,

3
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:17.880
material processing,
manufacturing use,
and we'll call it waste management.

4
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.980
Ideally,
we'll,
we'll talk about ways of,
we're not talking about end of life,

5
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.380
but rather closing loops.

6
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.500
Why is life cycle thinking going to be absolutely essential to,
uh,

7
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.110
uh,
green chemistry discussion as sustainability discussion?

8
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.240
Let's go through it.
Uh,
so,

9
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.560
oh,
when we look at the origins of our feedstocks,

10
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.630
it would be very possible to produce a product that is nontoxic,

11
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.990
affective,
performs great.
You know,
a little kid could chew on it,

12
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.883
no problem,

13
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.700
but yet do it in a way that results in dramatic ecological damage.

14
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.920
But you might say that that's a,
that's a rarity right now.

15
00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:19.000
That's pretty much the,
the rule of the road.
What did we say about the amount of,

16
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:23.080
uh,
uh,
of waste generated per,
uh,

17
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.300
per pound of product for manufacturing generally?
Yeah.

18
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.510
So we're talking about 90% of all of the material that goes into manufacturing

19
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.520
winds up immediately his weight.
And it's the character,
not the amount,

20
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.230
the character,
the nature of the inherent nature of those materials.

21
00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:48.730
That is crucially important.
Is it to pleading?
Is it renewable?

22
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.930
Is it inherently toxic?
All right,

23
00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:57.100
so we know what manufacturing is,
is a conversion of raw materials into products.

24
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.370
So looking at the design and the production of goods and

25
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.520
manufacturing needs to add value in order for it to be really considered

26
00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:07.354
manufacturing.

27
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.920
Although there are a lot of businesses that it's very questionable.
Um,

28
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.140
so is manufacturing important?

29
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.400
These are the different industry sectors and this is a billion tons of waste.

30
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.070
Waste generated manufacturing waste are significant to say the least.

31
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.890
When you take a look at the annual waste generator,
this is a EU data.
Uh,

32
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.770
uh,
manufacturing wastes are,
are significant,

33
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.270
but these other,
uh,
Eric,
now a quick aside,

34
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.370
energy production,
very little waste,
1%.

35
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.020
What does that mean?
It means,
and we'll talk about this,

36
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.500
that the petrochemical industry is one of the most materially efficient

37
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.690
industries that the world has ever seen.
Almost.

38
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.360
If you only got a 99% efficiency for many of the petrochemical processes,

39
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.060
you'd be fired.
You'd be shut down,
it'd be out of business.

40
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.840
The degree to which they are so excellent at efficiency and can say,

41
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.560
oh,
well good then that,
then that's perfect.

42
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.750
That's why we talk about life cycle because it's not all about efficiency.

43
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.830
It's not all about one life cycle stage.

44
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.770
Okay.
What about the use phase?
They say,
Oh,
I'm,

45
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.620
I meet a washing machine and I made it from a,

46
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.160
from a new barrel renewable resin and I,

47
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.030
and I'm going to recycle the whole thing.
Where's the impact?

48
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.200
Was the environmental impact,
uh,
of a,
of a washing machine.

49
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.060
It's in the use phase,

50
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.690
the energy consumed in the use and the water consumed in the US,
et Cetera,

51
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:53.990
et cetera.
Um,

52
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.373
<v 1>okay.</v>

53
00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.670
<v 0>What about,
um,
is use important?</v>

54
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.830
Think about those products where they use is of necessity.

55
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.910
Discipline of,
remember I laws of thermodynamics.

56
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.640
Chlorofluorocarbons,

57
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.410
whether it's in sprays or or whatever it is,
propellant.

58
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.180
These will wind up in the ozone layer.

59
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.430
Solvents wide range of solvents are amongst the highest,

60
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.380
uh,
emissions,
air emission,
uh,
chemicals known coolin's.

61
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.500
Pesticides and fertilizers necessarily have to be distributed in the environment

62
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.750
to function.
It's why they wind up in our groundwater.

63
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.030
It's why they wind up in our drinking water.
Okay.
Is End of life important?

64
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.230
Yeah,
it kind of speaks for itself,
I guess.
Yeah.

65
00:04:48.231 --> 00:04:52.430
That's the base camp of the Himalayas.
Anybody want to go for a track?

66
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.603
<v 1>All right.</v>

67
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.050
<v 0>Okay.
So we need to have lifecycle thinking.</v>

68
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.120
This is not a life cycle analysis class.

69
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.470
We're not going to do a rigorous lifecycle analysis,
lagers,

70
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.570
rigorous lifecycle assessment.
However,
if we don't think across lifecycle,

71
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.720
then we will do exactly the wrong things by shifting the problem from one life.

72
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:20.890
So locals lifecycle stage to another,
and you're going to find them.

73
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:24.730
That is so often the essence of greenwashing.
