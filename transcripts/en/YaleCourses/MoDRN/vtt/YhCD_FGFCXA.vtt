00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.260
In many cases it's a substance properties as well as genetic factors play a role

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.540
in adverse health effect.

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.950
This us as they explored her conditions of are important.
For example,

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.100
primos chemical exposures such as smoking or alcohol abuse can play a large role

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.270
in disease.
Develop age is another key factor.

6
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.620
Children,

7
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.620
elderly often most susceptible to diseases in case of children fast ingestion

8
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.380
rate compared to that body weight.

9
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.370
A person and poor health is always the most susceptible to environmental risks

10
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.030
because their body is already out of alignment and no longer exists in

11
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:46.470
homeostasis.

12
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.740
Of course some people are just more predisposed or resistant to certain forms of

13
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:57.370
infection or sort of forms of contaminant.
However,

14
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.500
that does not help us on a large scale in green chemistry because as a rule they

15
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:07.500
also get all these have to take care of the least resistant proportion of the

16
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:11.550
population and therefore we're able to design chemicals that did not produce

17
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.700
Heather's into narcos risks to everyone.

18
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.730
Equally obviously in the real world are exposed to many chemical companies at

19
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:25.650
the same time.
Everything that chemical and in some rate or another,

20
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.140
it is likely to enter your body.
However,

21
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.690
the different combination of chemicals can have very different effects.

22
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.680
For example,

23
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.400
cigarette smoke and heavy as best as as porter multiply the risk of cancer and

24
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.420
in this case chemical exposure does not work like math two plus two equals two

25
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.273
four.

26
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.260
The three types of basic chemical interaction is there is antagonism when one

27
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:55.380
chemical is reduces the fact of another.

28
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.500
That is the function of antidotes,
antidotes,
uh,

29
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:04.830
I'm taking this sticks to the effect of poisons is therefore to reduce the

30
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:08.760
effect of the poison and keep you alive.
Additive toxicity.

31
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.290
It is simply that when you exposed to two chemicals,

32
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.650
it is like edit concentration of the two chemicals together.

33
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.730
So alcohol and aspirin add together to increase toxicity.

34
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.080
Finally does it as a synergistic effect.

35
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.440
Synergistic effect makes things a lot a lot worst,

36
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.080
such as as best as in smoking,
as best as damages,

37
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.100
lungs smoking can further that effect by interacting with the damaged tissue in

38
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:41.820
a different way and therefore causing cancer progression.

39
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.600
Pesticides and fertilizer act in much the same way.

40
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:49.170
Where exporter to Bose multiplies the effect.

41
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.060
We don't exist in a world where we're exposed to one chemical in a controlled

42
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:58.020
environment,
when in just existed in natural laboratory or whatever,

43
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.550
exposed to [inaudible] of chemicals all the time.
So as the interactions,

44
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.180
while my daughter always be important can play a key role,

45
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.350
just like interaction,
self,
environment with your genetics.
