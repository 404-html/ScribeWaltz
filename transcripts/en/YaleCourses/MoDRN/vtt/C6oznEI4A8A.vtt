1
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.393
What does the catalyst

2
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.240
speeds up the reaction and what,
what makes it a catalyst?

3
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.590
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.360
<v 0>Yeah.
So it,
it speeds up the reaction and itself is not consumed in the reaction.</v>

5
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.420
There are all sorts of things you can add to a reaction to make it go faster.

6
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.680
But unless you can get it back or unless it's regenerated in the process,

7
00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:30.820
it's not a catalyst.
Um,
and so we

8
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.800
typically think of,
you know,
chemical reactions.

9
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.520
You have molecules that are kind of just bouncing around and the,
you know,

10
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:44.280
whether there's a reaction or not,
you have molecules,
they're moving around,

11
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:47.560
they're hitting each other,
they're hitting into the walls of whatever flasks,

12
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.390
clarion,
and it's just kind of this random mosh pit.

13
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.600
And for you to have a reaction,

14
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:58.800
you need to have molecules hit and exactly the right way.
Uh,
and you know,

15
00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:00.420
they're bumping into each other all the time.

16
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:04.800
Say there's a one in a million chance that two molecules will hit just the right

17
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:05.634
way.

18
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.330
That's actually really good odds because molecules are bumping into each other

19
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:10.980
about a billion times a second.

20
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.900
So that react about a million times per second if it's one in a million chance.

21
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.830
Um,
so in reality,
you know,

22
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:23.580
the chance of having a productive reaction when the molecules bump into each

23
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:26.010
other,
it's way less than one in a million

24
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.250
catalysts.
Uh,
well,

25
00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:35.020
so before catalysts you can increase the rate of a reaction by heating it.

26
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.800
Basically all that does is it makes the molecules move faster.

27
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.400
So they bumped into each other more often and they bumped into each other
harder.

28
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.630
Um,
so this can speed up the reaction rate just by having them interact more

29
00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:49.930
frequently.
Or there are some reactions where you need,

30
00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:52.690
there's a certain amount of energy required.
You know,

31
00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:55.810
you have to break a bond first and that takes energy.

32
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.690
And so you need the molecules to hate each other hard enough.

33
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.310
So if it's room temperature,

34
00:02:00.311 --> 00:02:03.470
there might be a reaction that would take 20 million years to,

35
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.750
to reach completion.
But if you heat it up to 120 degrees,

36
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.273
it's duck.

37
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.790
And that's just because the molecules are hitting each other hard enough that

38
00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:14.980
they can actually do the chemistry that's involved

39
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.630
<v 1>soft.
So</v>

40
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.510
<v 0>what do catalysts do?
They can do multiple things,</v>

41
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:25.380
but I'm going to break it down into basically two tasks that a catalyst can do.

42
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.530
And some Kevin catalysts do only one and some do both.

43
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.520
They can increase the frequency that molecules interact.

44
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.960
So a lot of what enzymes do in your body is rather than just waiting around for

45
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:41.970
molecules to hit each other randomly,

46
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.650
the catalyst will actually collect the different reactive molecules and bring

47
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:50.640
them together and put them in the right position so they can react and go on.

48
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.330
And this can actually increase the reaction rate,
you know,

49
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:58.650
a million fold easily just by getting molecules in the right place at the right

50
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:02.550
time.
This is especially true,
you know,

51
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.130
most reactions are just two molecules hate each other.

52
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.750
There are some reactions that require three or four molecules to be in exactly

53
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:11.620
the right arrangement.

54
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.860
And if you think about the statistics of that happening randomly,

55
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.000
the chances are essentially nil that you're going to get four molecules in

56
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:24.001
exactly the right place and position at the right time unless you have something

57
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:27.850
that's bringing them and putting them all in the right place at the right time,

58
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.440
getting the reaction to happen,

59
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.780
and then kicking out the product ready to start again.

60
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.540
So catalysts can also increase reaction rate by,

61
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.070
um,
yeah,

62
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.020
even if the molecules are just randomly bumping into each other,

63
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.580
if they either don't have the energy or there's just some,
you know,

64
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.660
reactions are moving bonds and atoms and electrons around.

65
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.480
And if things are just left to chance,

66
00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.320
sometimes they don't end up in the right place or you know,
it just,

67
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.820
it doesn't necessarily work out.
Right.
So a catalyst can also just,
you know,

68
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.070
given that two molecules interact,

69
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.400
the catalysts can increase the probability that that reaction happens.

70
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.040
So if you can change your million one in a million chances of every collision,

71
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.610
you can change that to every time the molecules come into contact,

72
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.380
there's a 50,
50 chance that they do the reaction.

73
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.780
Your reaction is going to go way,
way faster.
So I have,

74
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.680
before I talk too much more about Ketalysis,
I want to have some demonstrations.

75
00:04:36.681 --> 00:04:41.040
So you have kind of an idea about what we're talking about.
Um,

76
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.960
just some flasks.
There's a little bit of water in the bottom of this one.

77
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.040
I watched them last night,
didn't have time to try.
Um,

78
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.130
but so I'm doing actually,
yeah.
Yeah.

79
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.043
Okay.

80
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.430
So the reaction that I'm going to be doing,

81
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.520
decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water

82
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.453
oxygen

83
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.570
can also draw this out.

84
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.040
So hydrogen peroxide,
this molecule here,
oxygen,

85
00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:47.030
oxygen bond is very weak.
Oxygen is very electronegative.

86
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.560
It really wants electrons and it doesn't like sharing when it's bonded to oxygen

87
00:05:51.561 --> 00:05:55.610
has to share.
And so this bond is really weak.

88
00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.800
Now,
molecular oxygen,
they have to share as well,

89
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:04.010
but there's a double bond between the oxygen.
So it's a lot stronger.

90
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.910
So this hydrogen peroxide is unstable.

91
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.290
Water is very unstable or sorry,
water is a very stable,

92
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.370
so hydrogen peroxide,
unstable water,
stable oxygen,

93
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.140
fairly stable but unstable enough that you can breathe it and live.
And you know,

94
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.490
like we,
we break down oxygen to survive so it's not that stable.

95
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.490
So this reaction generates

96
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.960
fair amount of heat as it goes,

97
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.150
but that doesn't mean that it just happens spontaneously necessarily.

98
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.990
So,
um,

99
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.120
I have a bottle of hydrogen peroxide here,
says 30% on the label.

100
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.500
It's not quite 30%,
it's about 20%.
Now you can kind of see,

101
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.000
it looks like soda.
There are some bubbles on the side of the bottle.

102
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.230
This is just,
it slowly decomposes.
We keep the bottles in the freezer.

103
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.320
So the reaction happens as slowly as possible,

104
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.380
but it's still decomposes.
It releases oxygen slowly.
Um,

105
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.550
you can heat this up to a boil and it will decompose explosively.

106
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.570
You don't want to do that.

107
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.360
Also light can make the reaction go faster.

108
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.590
That's why if you go to the pharmacy and buy a bottle of hydrogen peroxide and

109
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:27.920
it's in a dark bottle,
it's cause light.
Actually breaks it down.

110
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.280
Now the stuff you get in the pharmacy is about 3%,

111
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.950
maybe 10% if you're using it to bleach your hair.

112
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.730
I don't know if anyone's used peroxide for that.
Uh,
I haven't,

113
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:42.290
but I've heard it really hurts.
Um,
this is 30%,
which is why I'm wearing gloves,

114
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.710
a lab coat,
safety caucus.
Um,

115
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:51.070
but basically there are catalysts that will make this reaction go millions or

116
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.470
billions of times faster than it does just at room temperature.

117
00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.180
And so I have,
just so you have an idea,
when we're talking about sub stories,

118
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.390
create sub straight geometric amounts.

119
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.900
I have about 10 milligrams of three different catalysts.

120
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.690
So you have a white powder,
yellow powder,
and a black powder.

121
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:15.090
Yellow powder is iron chloride,
the white powder is sodium iodide.

122
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.823
So we have,

123
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.870
and the black powder is manganese dioxide.

124
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.390
So about 10 milligrams of each of the catalysts.

125
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:41.420
I'm going to put 15 milliliters or approximately 15 grams of the solution in

126
00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:43.320
each of these flasks.

127
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.170
Now the solution is only about a quarter hydrogen peroxide,

128
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.293
<v 1>but</v>

129
00:08:55.020 --> 00:09:00.020
<v 0>it's still several grams of hydrogen peroxide to a 0.01 grams of catalyst.</v>

130
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.220
Here I'm going to add iron chloride to one of these flasks.

131
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

132
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.610
<v 0>You can see solution turns dark.</v>

133
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:19.060
Nothing really is happening now,
you know,
it just looks,

134
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.330
it looks kind of Brown,

135
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:28.190
maybe some little bit of Fizz in there and see some tiny little bubbles.

136
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.800
So this catalyst actually has a pretty substantial induction period.

137
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.200
So the iron chloride itself is not the catalyst.

138
00:09:39.201 --> 00:09:42.350
It's a pre catalyst and it takes a little while for it to react.

139
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:48.370
So that guy's going,
we'll check in on in a little bit later.

140
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.990
Sodium iodide.
This one is nice.
We have this white powder.

141
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.600
It's going to dissolve in this clear solution.

142
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.160
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

143
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.880
<v 0>instantly it turns yellow.
The actual catalyst is yellow.</v>

144
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.340
And we can see this is actually fizzing pretty substantially.

145
00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:18.090
Manganese dioxide last catalyst should be a little more active than that.

146
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.140
Can See.
It's basically just as soon as we add it,
it's decomposing.
Okay,

147
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.690
so here we have comparison three different catalysts of the same amount.

148
00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.090
We have not so good.
Pretty good.

149
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:41.220
And this is going really fast.
Well,

150
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.280
we could also talk about the,
