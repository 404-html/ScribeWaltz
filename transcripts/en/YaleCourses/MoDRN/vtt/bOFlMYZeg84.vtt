00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.580
So what's the take home message from today?

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.160
Take home message from today is not just that it's happening right here in,

3
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.670
in your own backyard and that we only scratched the surface.
Um,

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.790
and when I say that we only scratched the surface,

5
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.070
we didn't talk about a work that's going on and making fuels from algae that and

6
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:26.910
talk about things that are using Titus Hannah and Shell fish shells to,

7
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.460
to purify water and on and on and on.

8
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:31.410
There's so many groups right here in our own backyard.

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.730
But then all of this was done using the 12 principles of green chemistry,

10
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:39.420
the 12 principles of green engineering and some matter of design,
uh,

11
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.280
that a number of these are being,
um,
uh,
are being patented.

12
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:48.880
A number of these are already being spun out into and to companies.
Um,

13
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.440
that it comes back to something that we've said throughout the course of the,

14
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.090
uh,
the course of the semester.
Um,

15
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.070
and that is that tomorrow is going to largely be what we design it to be today.

16
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.270
Looks like it does today because we've designed it to be this way,

17
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.220
either consciously or unconsciously,
that,
uh,
the,

18
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.770
the basic framework of our society and our economy,

19
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.713
the products,

20
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.580
the processes look like they do today because we designed them to be this way.

21
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:32.790
We set up design criteria that made it look like this.

22
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.240
And hopefully one of the take home messages from this semester is that the

23
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:42.450
status quo needs to be displaced,

24
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.020
that the status quo is unsustainable,
that the status quo is largely,

25
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.350
I'm going very quickly off a cliff,

26
00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.180
whether it's we're talking about energy or materials or the wide range of things

27
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:02.460
that we,
uh,
we discussed even today,

28
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.060
that it needs to be displaced and reinvented.

29
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.780
So one of the things that this semester hopefully has given all of you is the

30
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:17.301
tools to be a part of the displacement of that status quo should you choose to

31
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:20.210
do so.
Um,

32
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.880
and I emphasize to be a part of that because I'm fully aware that this class is

33
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.870
diverse set of backgrounds and even more importantly,
a diverse set of futures.

34
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.010
What's really important is that the future needs people in very different roles

35
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.780
to make,
to make it happen.

36
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.440
So maybe you're a chemist or an engineer inventing these new products and

37
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:56.730
processes,
or maybe you're the person who's making the policies,

38
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.240
whether it's government policy or policy that is going to enable and empower

39
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.360
these changes.
Or maybe you're the person that's running the,

40
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.000
the the not for profit group that's,

41
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.890
that's demanding and pressuring and shining a light on the status quo that needs

42
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:19.240
to be displaced.
Or maybe the person in finance that's going to,
um,

43
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.840
provide the investment and venture capital and private equity he needed to make

44
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:26.220
that maybe the person in the,

45
00:03:26.221 --> 00:03:31.221
in the patents a law that actually understands how to provide incentives for,

46
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.100
uh,
allowing change to happen rather than empowering the,
the,

47
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:38.560
the current embedded technology.

48
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.740
I don't have any idea what your future's going to entail and probably needed to

49
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:47.830
you,
no matter how much you think you do,

50
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.260
it's going to take a whole lot of twists and turns.

51
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.910
But hopefully now you have a toolbox that enables you to,
uh,

52
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.770
if you so choose,
uh,

53
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.680
dismantle the current status quo and to a more sustainable one.
