1
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.340
Okay.
So we look at the traditional view of the community,

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.880
have the three pillars,
the economy,

3
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:14.100
environment and society.

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.260
And traditionally we have dealt with these issues as being separate.

5
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.130
Uh,
when you look historically over the past century,

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.400
we have separated these things out as if they are sadly not related.

7
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:33.510
It's only recently,
it's only since the type of Brundtland,

8
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.820
um,
systems thinking over the past 20,
30 years that people have,

9
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.420
uh,

10
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.420
recognize that the traditional solution can actually cause problems.

11
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:51.621
And that if you wind up focusing only on economic growth and job creation,

12
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.400
you can do that in a way that is going to be extremely harmful to,
uh,

13
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.260
for instance your environment or if you,
uh,
uh,

14
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.500
if you focus only and the other side,

15
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:12.150
the way that if you only focus on environment,
you might be impairing

16
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.600
cultural or,
or societal,
uh,
uh,
traditions.

17
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.310
So
an important point is these piecemeal,

18
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:26.500
fragmented solutions also,
um,

19
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.950
are directly related to a lot of the,
uh,
the,

20
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.790
the agendas and mobilizing opposing groups.
Um,

21
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.160
so rather than looking at things as a system where you are looking to optimize

22
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.970
solutions,
you instead I'm mobilizing,

23
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.280
mobilizing agendas and mobilizing opposition.

24
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.330
And too often we tend to focus on short term benefits.
Um,

25
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.740
and that we could go into a long discussion about why that is,

26
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.080
whether it's our current economic valuation models,

27
00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:02.070
whether it's because we have certain election and political cycles or uh,

28
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.480
attention spans is a lot of reasons why we could talk about that.
All right?

29
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.063
Now,

30
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.240
does anybody want to argue that these things aren't interlinked because

31
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.810
certainly we have just a decades if not centuries of data showing that,

32
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.100
um,
you can't play the old kind of a game whack-a-mole with the,
uh,

33
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.490
with these problems where the Taco one and then another one pops up.

34
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.673
Um,

35
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.820
now this is the slide that I think is about as obvious as something can be in,

36
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.500
it astounds me that this is not how many people consciously think about things.

37
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.920
So we know that our economy exists within society to serve society and Society

38
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.950
of course exists within the greater environment.

39
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.580
You would think by listening to some of our discussions that this was up for

40
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:07.204
debate,

41
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.990
that when the economy

42
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.420
is,
uh,

43
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.510
somehow viewed as being equal or more often superior to the society that it's

44
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:25.190
supposed to serve.
There's a great saying that I,

45
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.270
I believe is from Paul Hawkin that markets are a miraculous tool,

46
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.140
a terrible master,
and an even worse religion.

47
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.430
So you start thinking about when we talk about market forces,

48
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.850
the whole reason that these market forces exist is to serve the greater society

49
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.230
and society cannot exist without the natural capital,

50
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:52.690
the natural resources,
the,
the,

51
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.960
they are life giving atmosphere that the environment writ large provides.

52
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.660
So when we start talking about these relationships,

53
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.790
which we are going to need to talk about in depth,

54
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:10.840
we're going to be talking about,
you know,
this chemical producers,

55
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:14.320
this adhesive produces,
this drug's gonna.
It doesn't make economic sense of,

56
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.250
I want everybody to always keep this in mind because again,

57
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.150
it astounds me how long,

58
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.210
how often this relationship seems to be lost in the general discussion.
