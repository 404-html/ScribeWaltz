1
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.760
So the,
the other aspect of water that we have to think about besides the,
um,

2
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.820
you know,
just the,

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.620
the sheer values of it or the sheer amounts of it are the quality.

4
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:17.580
So you guys probably saw this out of the green chemistry theory and practice

5
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:22.581
that you don't really need much of a toxic substances to pollute very large

6
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:25.950
amounts of water.
So,
you know,
a huge problem with like

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.320
dripping oil from cars and things.
If it gets into water supplies,

8
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:34.830
you can essentially ruined very large amounts of water very quickly.

9
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:39.180
And this is a big problem for a lot of chemical manufacturers that just a little

10
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:44.181
bit of byproduct can ruin a water streams for communities and large parts of the

11
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:48.550
country.
Uh,

12
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.470
in the United States we have pretty good numbers on aqueous waste from the toxic

13
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:56.820
release inventory.
Hazardous waste is,
um,
not,
uh,

14
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.490
a huge piece of the pie,
but it's pretty substantial.
I mean,

15
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:02.820
it's 675 million tons per year.
So there's a,

16
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.100
a lot of hazardous waste wastewater being generated and uh,

17
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.010
you know,
for the most part,

18
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.080
a lot of basic chemicals are dealt with in water treatment systems,

19
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:18.720
but a lot we're increasingly finding that a lot or not,

20
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.890
if you go looking for more chemicals,
you often find them.

21
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:27.240
So the US Geological Survey did this survey of um,

22
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.990
water supplies and natural sources in the United States a couple of years ago

23
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.770
and they were finding something like 80% of the sites that they looked at were

24
00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:41.220
containing these different chemicals.
Uh,
so,
you know,

25
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.450
[inaudible] and bug spray,
bisphenol a,
flame retardants,
all kinds of things.

26
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.170
Um,
not all of this is coming from runoff.
Uh,

27
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.520
a lot of these followup research has shown that these things just get through

28
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.690
waste treatment plants because a lot of these chemicals were not around when the

29
00:01:57.691 --> 00:01:59.730
waste treatment plant technology was devised.

30
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.920
And so we're kind of running experiments on ourselves that,
uh,

31
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.580
basically humans and other animals and ecosystems are serving as the,

32
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.200
the filters for these,
these,
uh,
boy streams.

33
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.370
So I just touched on that.
I mean you can have point contamination of water.

34
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.810
I mean this is kind of the obvious thing.

35
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:25.830
If you see like a sewer pipe spewing nasty water,
that's a point contamination.

36
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.670
But then there's also things like agricultural runoff,
um,

37
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.020
leaking of septic tanks and sewer systems and mine drainage.

38
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.710
And how this ties back into energy is that if you're able to capture these,

39
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:42.900
um,
wastes sources,

40
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:46.380
the main way of dealing with them is typically some sort of chemical process.
So,

41
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.600
uh,
given that we're all,
you know,
in,
in an oxidizing environment,

42
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.360
you know,
we're,

43
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.150
we're in an oxygen pretty much the way to deal with aqueous pollutants is to try

44
00:02:57.151 --> 00:02:58.020
and oxidize them.

45
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.880
And a lot of waste treatment plants and processes are trying to basically

46
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.770
combust the chemicals in water.
So kind of fired water.
Uh,

47
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.870
all the carbon is going to go to CO2.

48
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.380
Ideally hydrogen and oxygen would go to water.

49
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.880
And then you'd end up with these same kind of nitrogen and sulfur oxides that

50
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:20.830
you might see from burning something and an engine.

51
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.140
And so you have a lot of choices in what types of chemicals would get used in

52
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:29.590
that,
in those processes.
And all of these,
again,

53
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.970
we'll have different energy impacts.

54
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:35.080
So treating the water you're going to be choosing between things like chlorine,

55
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.260
you're going to be choosing between,
um,
ozone,

56
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.940
maybe ozone at different Ph is I was on with catalysts,
UV rays,
radiation.

57
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:46.690
It takes energy to generate UV light hydrogen peroxide.

58
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:49.940
It's going to take energy to produce hydrogen peroxide.
Um,

59
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.090
the producing the catalyst tio two is one of the most common catalysts.

60
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:58.270
So extracting tio two,
getting it or extracting titanium,

61
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:01.930
converting it to tio two,
getting it in a form that can be used in these plants.

62
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.280
All of these things are going to be contributing to energy.
And so again,

63
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:10.090
we keep saying this,
this energy nexus that um,

64
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.980
there you find tradeoff.

65
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.290
So chlorine and ozone are probably two of the most common water treatment

66
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.030
chemicals.
Uh,

67
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.050
chlorine actually has a lower embedded energy burden than ozone,

68
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.400
but on the other hand,

69
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:29.260
chlorine is potentially more likely to generate toxic byproducts.
So,

70
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.940
um,
some of the,

71
00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:35.440
the supplemental readings we'd given our about things like when chlorine reacts

72
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:38.680
with the organic chemicals,
it doesn't always convert the carbon to CO2.

73
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.810
It converts them to carbon chlorine bonds.

74
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.030
And then you end up with organochlorine chemicals that,
uh,

75
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.600
sometimes are worse than the original compound.
Sometimes they accumulate in,
uh,

76
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.163
in animals.

77
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.630
And so these are the kinds of questions that have to get asked when you,
when,
uh,

78
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.530
a chemical processes generating aqueous waste,

79
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.490
if to start thinking about how is it going to get treated and how much water is

80
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:03.160
it potentially going to affect?
Where's that water going to go?

81
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.880
And is it going to take a lot of energy to deal with that water?
