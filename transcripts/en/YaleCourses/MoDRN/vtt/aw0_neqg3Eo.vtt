00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.210
What is [inaudible]?
Well,

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.830
toxicity basically describes the degree of adverse effects caused by substance.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.900
So if something is more toxic,

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.490
it causes more adverse affects and something less toxic.

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.560
It the severity of adverse effect is lower if any substance can cause an adverse

6
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:21.750
effect.
If it's toxic.

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.030
There's three main types you should know which I toxicants toxins and poison

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.410
toxicants are basically chemicals so they can injure or kill humans,

9
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:33.480
animals or plants.
Um,

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.140
often re I related to manmade substances,

11
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.230
synthetic chemicals and things we tried to minimize in Green Chemistry toxins,

12
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.580
a specific subset just already produced by living organisms.

13
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.040
While we don't necessarily manufacture toxins,

14
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.480
we isolate them and use them as starting materials and intermediate.

15
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.190
And finally poisons a basically a type of toxin,

16
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:03.191
a toxic and that causes an immediate adverse effects will allow dot a little bit

17
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:05.300
about common toxins.

18
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.810
So there's a substances once again tonight produced in nature and often isolated

19
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:14.490
from plants and Fabian's algae,

20
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.720
other species.

21
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.200
So we've probably all heard a lot botulism toxin which produces paralysis.

22
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.120
We've heard about bacterial,

23
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.290
you could toxin which is offered to the cost of food poisoning.

24
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.130
Pretty much all of the world.
Finally ricing which is um,

25
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.750
isolated from castor oil,
uh,

26
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.290
and essentially acts by impeding protein synthesis throughout the body by

27
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.450
interacting with the RNA translational machinery inside the cells and making

28
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:56.631
them incapable of performing its normal functions as disabling homeostasis.

29
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.210
We'll now talk about some toxicants that are not naturally occurring but have

30
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:06.950
been produced by human activity such as as best as,

31
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:09.000
as best as a form of fiber,

32
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.300
often most common forms of crystal and fiber which is deposited onto your lungs

33
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.920
and when,
when inhaled is penetrates through your lungs,

34
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.840
is associated with cancer.
Over time,

35
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.990
lead in the paint is associated with a range of disorders including

36
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:28.980
developmental disorders in children.

37
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.580
And while led paint has been used in America for quite awhile,

38
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.140
it's not anymore in la contemporary issues,
there was dioxin.

39
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.440
Dioxin encompasses a range of chlorinated compounds which I usually persistent

40
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:48.240
the environment due to a byproduct of other reactions and can cause a wide

41
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.580
variety of negative effects.

42
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.680
And Dioxin has been a great example of unintended,

43
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.710
terrible consequences to human health and is considered one of the most toxic

44
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.800
chemicals in the environment.
And finally,

45
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.810
there's both federal aid has been been from childhood bottles because it is

46
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.490
considered to be an endocrine disruptor because it mimics the activity of

47
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:21.370
estrogen ends.
US has endocrine effects.
But,

48
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.880
um,
this,
there's some controversy on the subject,

49
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and no conclusive report have really been issued by the EPA.
