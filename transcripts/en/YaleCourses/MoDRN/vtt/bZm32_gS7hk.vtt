WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.710
So everybody's seen the green chemistry principles over and over.

2
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:10.890
And of course there's the one that gets right to the heart of what we're talking

3
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:12.540
about designing for energy efficiency.

4
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:17.541
So the idea that the chemist has some responsibility to recognize the impacts

5
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:22.140
that arise from their choices of the chemicals and chemical processes.

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.490
So things like this is a little bit focusing on the manufacturing stuff,

7
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:30.980
but this could also apply to raw materials and how you,
uh,
you know,

8
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.400
disassemble or recycled product.
If you're doing things at room temperature,

9
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.820
room pressure,
you're kind of giving yourself a step in the right direction.

10
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.800
If something has to be done and under vacuum under a really high pressure,

11
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.460
really high temperature,
then you're,
uh,
you've got to challenge cut out for you.

12
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.180
So,
uh,
yeah,
I mean,

13
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:56.040
there have been pressures on a energy resources for many,
many years.
Um,

14
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.970
you know,
at,

15
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.970
at times society has been sort of more an agreement about the best way to deal

16
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:03.510
with it.
But,
um,

17
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.870
the reasons why we're concerned about it and I have to do with all these other

18
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:09.780
impacts,
they're all inextricably linked to each other.

19
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:13.920
So the energy choices lead to a co two emissions.

20
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.500
I think pretty much everybody agrees,

21
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.260
even if they disagree on the timeline of when,
uh,

22
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.240
fossil resources are going to be depleted,

23
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.430
I think it's pretty unambiguous that they are being depleted at a rate faster

24
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:30.540
than we can replenish them.
Uh,
the toxicity issues.

25
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:34.230
So a lot of fuels that we are,
or crude,
uh,

26
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.130
energy materials that we extract from the earth or not in pure form.

27
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:41.250
And then we'll,
we're bringing up nitrogen sulfur along with the carbon.

28
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.480
This gets introduced to ecosystems work that are not used to dealing with it.

29
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.410
I'm going to spend a lot of the later part of the lecture talking about the

30
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:54.411
energy water connections because these are really easy to quantify and uh,

31
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.180
they,

32
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.470
they really are kind of linked in a feedback cycle that the more energy use,

33
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:00.510
the more water you use and vice versa.

34
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:04.200
The more water you use takes more energy to produce,
uh,
the water.

35
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.550
Uh,
and then there are the waste issues as well.
So,
um,

36
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.380
some of the obvious ones being nuclear waste to have to deal with the waste

37
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:17.220
materials that are generated.
And then there's also issues of just wasted energy.

38
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.880
So we,
I think we saw some of these charts in the very beginning of the class,

39
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:26.430
but I think it would be useful to revisit them.

40
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.200
So despite all the,
um,

41
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.090
efforts to focus on energy conservation,

42
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:35.590
the trend is very clearly in the opposite direction.

43
00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:39.060
And we saw a lot of hockey stick curves at the beginning of class and that kind

44
00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:41.490
of drives the,
the increase in energy.

45
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:45.960
So we're here somewhere between these two bars,
but,
uh,

46
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.450
we're pretty,
uh,
inextricably on this upward curve right now.

47
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.410
So there's this constant demand for more and more energy.

48
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.080
So if we look at the energy sources,
yeah,

49
00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:02.890
of course we see the same trend broadly.
Uh,
where are we get energy from there.

50
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:07.480
There's liquids,
so essentially petroleum,
fractions,
coal,

51
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.770
it's always been one of the big ones,
natural gas,
renewables,

52
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.790
and then nuclear power.
This data is from 2008.
Um,

53
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.930
of course a lot of things have happened since 2008.

54
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:22.550
We had a pretty big recession that,
uh,

55
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.870
I looked up some more recent numbers and basically that just kind of flat lined

56
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:29.230
a little bit for a couple of years and then resumed the upward curve.

57
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:33.250
So if you can just imagine this stretched out by two or three years.

58
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.250
And then the other thing is that of course with the,
um,

59
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.940
the rise in natural gas production in the u s that,
um,

60
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.060
the natural gas and some of the liquids have bumped up a little bit and Cole was

61
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:48.310
gone down just a little bit.
But for the most part,

62
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.580
these trends have held pretty well to predictions.

63
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.030
So just keep an eye on these numbers quadrillions and BTUs cause it will be

64
00:03:59.031 --> 00:04:00.650
important on some of the later slides.

65
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.710
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.450
<v 0>Okay.
This is a very,
uh,
there's a lot of information and this chart,
so I'll,</v>

67
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:09.520
I'll go through this a little bit slowly.
This comes out of the,

68
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.960
one of the national labs in the U S so we're looking just at US energy use.

69
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.760
So,
uh,
97 quad squad is a quadrillion Btu.

70
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:21.880
So if I go back for a second,
uh,

71
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.040
total world consumption,
if we start adding up some of these numbers,
like one 50,

72
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:30.460
250,
300,
something like three or 400 quad.

73
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:34.840
So it looks like the u s is using close to 25% of the world's energy.

74
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.430
Um,
you'll probably find a more precise number than that.
But ballpark,

75
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.200
that's where we are.
So on this side we have all the different sources.

76
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.070
Uh,

77
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.810
it's broken down a little bit more specifically then the last slide because

78
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:53.950
they've separated out some of the renewables.
Now we have solar,
hydro,
wind,

79
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.400
geothermal are separated.
And then over on this side we have the,

80
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.320
the major sectors,
so residential use of energy,

81
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.020
commercial use of energy,
industrial.

82
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:09.910
So this is going to be a largely responsible to chemical production and in this

83
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.670
set right here,
and then transportation.

84
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.770
And then the last thing they've added here,

85
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:17.080
which is what's kind of a surprise to me.

86
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:20.770
The first time I saw this is how much energy actually gets used as opposed to

87
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:25.280
what gets wasted.
So,
uh,
roughly,
uh,

88
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.130
uh,
50 to 60% of all the energy that's produced is not used productively.

89
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:32.320
It just goes to waste heat.

90
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.880
So our infrastructure is actually very inefficient.

91
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:40.750
So even if some of these industries are,
are doing well with their,

92
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.830
their efficiencies,
uh,
the actual production itself is not.

93
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:48.130
So that bares out in what professor and asked us was just saying that the

94
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:53.131
industrial complex is using the vast majority of the energy that comes in.

95
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.260
So their waste bar is fairly low.

96
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.760
But if you look at something like electricity generation,
uh,

97
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.140
by far the vast majority of that's going to waste.

98
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.910
And so this has to do with the technology that's installed at power plants right

99
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:09.260
now.
So,
um,

100
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.190
waste heat is probably the biggest thing that nuclear reactors,

101
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:14.210
all these different reactors,

102
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:18.200
they are generating Pete in addition to the electricity.

103
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:22.100
So all of that energy is going to be rejected.

104
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.970
Uh,
we talked a lot about energy.
This is another really dense graph.

105
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:32.510
Mckinsey is very good at doing,
putting a lot of information on one slide.

106
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.020
So I'll also try and walk through this,
um,

107
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.550
here.
Uh,
first one,
I'll start with axes.

108
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.680
So this,
they're,

109
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.690
they're trying to calculate what sort of a known energy efficient technologies

110
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:52.880
could be put into practice today to achieve some efficiency gains.

111
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.110
And so if you add up all these different ideas that they have for saving

112
00:06:57.111 --> 00:06:58.970
electricity or saving energy,

113
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.330
then the total value of that energy would be 9,500,

114
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.830
uh,
trillion btu.

115
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:10.670
So that's 9.5 quadrillions nine and a half quads,

116
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.830
energy use,
97 quads.
So in the u s alone,

117
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:20.831
so Mckinsey has identified ideas for about 10% of our energy usage.

118
00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:25.040
So this is kind of the low hanging fruit.
So,
you know,

119
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:29.240
it's great that there's a lot of efficient technology out there and there's some

120
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:34.100
things that people have ideas about to,
um,
to put it put in practice to,

121
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:35.300
to save a little bit more.

122
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.690
But we still got this other 90% of the pie that needs a lot of work.

123
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:42.320
So besides the efficiencies,
there's just that,
the magnitude of the whole thing,

124
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:46.240
there's a lot of energy being used and uh,
you know,

125
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.010
efficiency is going to get you a little bit of the way,

126
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:51.750
but we have to go back and start thinking about some of these,
uh,

127
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.690
intrinsic processes that are leading to the,
to the overall big piece of the Pie.

128
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.860
So I think the last point I wanted to make,
you're a,

129
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.540
it took me a couple of minutes to find these and the nest of information here,

130
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.850
chemical processes is right here.

131
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.910
That's this little sliver right there.

132
00:08:10.911 --> 00:08:14.540
So Mckinsey has identified this little sliver sliver as being kind of low

133
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:17.960
hanging fruit for improving a chemical processes.

134
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.930
There were a couple others that were really related to chemistry.

135
00:08:20.931 --> 00:08:23.720
So cement production,
definitely chemistry in there,

136
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.350
and then a pulp and paper processes.

137
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.720
It gets a little bit of a bar there.
So,
uh,

138
00:08:30.721 --> 00:08:33.590
those are kind of the major chemistry,

139
00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:36.710
a centered processes that are in his overall energy curve.

140
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:41.450
So that's really kind of a drop in the bucket compared to the actual energy use.

141
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:42.284
So

142
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.180
that means there's a lot of work that needs to be done to go further,

143
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:47.771
because this,

144
00:08:47.771 --> 00:08:51.440
this little bit of low hanging fruit is not going to get us far in terms of the

145
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:53.690
overall energy impacts.
