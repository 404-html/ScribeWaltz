Speaker 1:          00:01          Wow. So, um, this my last true confession to you, my class. Um, and is it true I always give you true confessions. I never lied to you in my class. Um, but this is a truly true confession because, um, the fact of the matter is I actually really couldn't figure out how to end the course. Like I can figure out what this last lecture was supposed to be and I really wondered about it. Agonized over it. It's the last lecture. There's all this pressure, you know, sell up. Several of you have emailed me and said, looking forward to the last lecture. And it's like, how can I live up to the expectation? Um, so I decided that, um, I would do two things in the lecture. Um, and the first thing that I'm going to do is talk about the end of the American revolution, which is not an easy thing to do.

Speaker 1:          00:53          And I'm not going to be so good as to actually put my finger on the moment when the revolution ends, but I'm at least going to suggest a couple things about that. And then at the end, you'll see I'm going to come back around and hopefully magically just tie the whole course together. By the end of the lecture, you will for sure notice that some of the things I'm talking about now have references to things I talked about way at the beginning of the course. So I'm trying for symmetry course symmetry. And if you think back in the distant ages of time, um, when this course started, um, I talked on that first, I think the very first lecture I did, um, I used to quote from John Adams and I used a quote from Benjamin Rush. Those are the quotes that are on the top of this syllabus.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Um, and both of them talk about when the revolution supposedly began. So Adam's writing an 1815 said that he thought the revolution began in the minds of the people. And this was affected from 1760 to 1775 in the course of 15 years before a drop of blood was drawn at Lexington. So he says the war quote was no part of the revolution. And then the other quote I read was rush, who in 1776 basically agreed that the war and the revolution were two different things, but then says, um, the American war is over. But this is far from being the case with the American revolution. We have changed our forms of government, but it remains to affect a revolution of our principals opinions and manners. So as to accommodate that them to the forms of government we have adopted. Okay. So when I quoted those at the very beginning of the course, I basically was quoting them to kind of shake up your assumptions about what the American revolution actually was.

Speaker 1:          02:33          You know, if the founders can't even agree, that kind of opens things broadly for us to really talk about what the revolution was today. I'm mentioning them because I actually do want us to think a little bit about if that is, it is all that confusion about when it starts, what can we say about when a revolution ends? And there's definitely a hint about how to discuss that question in both of those quotes, even though they don't necessarily agree. Because both men and one way or another saw the revolution as being fundamentally about what rush called principles, opinions and manners and Adams called a change in the minds of the people. So in a way, they're both saying that a real revolution, a full revolution involves some kind of a fundamental change in principals. And as both men suggest, obviously this isn't something that happens instantly, like a declaration of war or a surrender on a battlefield.

Speaker 1:          03:26          But it's a process and it takes place over years, maybe even over decades. Now obviously if you think about what a revolution is formerly speaking, it's a change of forms, forms of government more than anything else. So it involves some kind of a large scale transfer of power after some kind of a struggle between competing groups, right? So it's like a major shift in sovereignty of some kind. But for the struggle and the instability of the revolution to come to a close, obviously there had to be some kind of a shared agreement about the nature of whatever this new regime was going to be about. What it's ideals were about, what it's shape was going to be. And without that kind of shared agreement on those kinds of things, this new regime would really stay in a state of flux and would be vulnerable to all kinds of continued dramatic and potentially revolutionary change.

Speaker 1:          04:25          So in a sense, what I'm saying here is that revolutions involve both deconstruction and reconstruction and that basically it's one thing to rebel against something and it's quite another thing to construct something in its place that manages to get some kind of general acceptance. And a revolution cannot be said to have ended until both parts of that equation have been met. And I think if you think back over the course of the semester, you can see that during the semester we've looked at both parts of that equation. In a sense. We've looked at the very beginning of the course when we were getting towards the beginning of the war. We've seen how Americans generally agreed about what they were protesting against. But the 1770 1780 1790s revealed, they've weren't necessarily in agreement about what they were fighting for. They didn't necessarily agree about what the most desirable outcome would be.

Speaker 1:          05:28          And we've watched this over the course of the semester. We've seen people basically just figuring out what this new regime is going to be. So we looked at the 1770s we saw how people tried to create constitutions that would reflect whatever this new regime was going to be. And we saw how those constitutions pretty much distrusted centralized power. Unfortunately at the 70s, eighties revealed that that first wave of reform wasn't quite right, but there were some pretty important problems that weren't solved, that there was some new problems that seem to be erupting that maybe hadn't been anticipated before. And then we've seen the result, we watched continental army officers sort of vaguely threatening some kind of coup. And so the, the, the mighty power of George Washington's glasses. Um, we saw soldiers digging their bandits through the windows of the Pennsylvania State House to demand their pay from the Confederation Congress.

Speaker 1:          06:25          We saw indebted farmers and Massachusetts joining and protest to close down the courts. And then of course we saw the independent republic of Vermont and my favorite, the state of Franklin. So clearly there was some pretty widespread discontent and some of the elite also as we heard, were not particularly happy. Many of them wanted some kind of economic stability. Some of them were none too pleased about what they saw as this sort of widespread social instability. So in one way or another, all of these groups felt that the promise of the revolution wasn't really being fulfilled. And the political system that had been put into place during the revolution not only was incapable of dealing with the problem, but in many ways it was fueling the problem. Now, of course, everything in one way or another added up to lead to the constitutional convention, which we discussed.

Speaker 1:          07:20          Um, and as we discussed in the course, a new constitution was by no means a done deal. And in fact, there was some pretty fervent debate over whether or not some individual states even wanted to participate in the whole convention at all. And we've seen some of what people were scared of in those debates about whether or not to go to the convention, a stronger government or even just the new government might open the door to things like an established aristocracy, monarchy, tyrannical centralized power, the rise of a privileged few, over an impoverished many. So in essence, these people are seeing that there might be a big change happening. They don't know what the change is going to be and anything seems possible. And all of those things obviously would represent going back on what the revolution had just gone forth for. So in essence, you see people who had absolutely no sense of political stability or permanence, no sense of what was going to come, no real consensus about the best way to fix it.

Speaker 1:          08:25          Now following the 1780s came a period that obviously we don't cover in this course. My other electric cars covers it and that's the 1790s which saw yet another wave of reform. And this time it has to do with the rise of the federalist Party and the federalists and one way or another were largely about centralizing power. Even more and strengthening the national government even more and controlling and channeling the protest and politicking of the populace. They're not all that comfortable with ongoing popular politicking. And here again, in the 1790s with this sort of counter wave, you also see more instability, more of a sense that there's some kind of potentially drastic change that might be happening just around the corner. So throughout the 17, nine, these people have things in their letters, throw away lines like if this government last another five years, here's what I think we should do.

Speaker 1:          09:20          Um, you can almost feel in some of these letters how frightened in a sense some of these people were who were stepping onto the stage of a new government in this sense of amazing instability. I'm going to offer three quotes because it's, it's amazing to me how similar they are. They all use the same image. It's almost like they went into a room and said, how should we describe being scared in 1789? Oh, I know. Um, so James Madison says in 1789, we are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us. George Washington in 1790 I walk on untrodden ground and good old Pennsylvania Senator William McClay who offered us that quote way at the beginning of the course sitting next to Virginians at dinner and saying that all they talked about was alcohol and horses. Um, Mclean says the whole world is a shell and we tread on hollow ground every step.

Speaker 1:          10:07          Now that's kind of interesting to me that all of those quotes are all saying the same thing, which is basically all of these guys literally are saying, wow, I'm on, is really unstable ground and I have no idea where I'm supposed to be going or what a safe pack is going to be. So throughout the 1790s the federalists countered their sense of social disorder by trying to legislate and administrate their way into order and control. And the alien and sedition acts of 1798 which I'm sure you probably studied in high school, are two of the most extreme examples along those lines. This brings us to Thomas Jefferson and the presidential election of 1800 now significantly for the purposes of this class. Jefferson years later, very modestly called his own election to the presidency, quote the revolution of 1800 right? Not Modest at all. Oh yes. When I came to power, it was the revolution of 1800 and not only that, he said it was as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form.

Speaker 1:          11:08          Okay. He's talking serious revolution. My rise to power was just as significant as 1776 thank you Thomas Jefferson, but you can kind of see that given what was happening in the 1790s in my like amazingly quick and dirty frighteningly condensed version of the 70 nineties that I just gave you, given what the federalists seemed to represent, you could see why Jefferson would have thought that his rise to the presidency was some kind of a return to core principles or revolutionary principles. Now this change of principles wasn't easy. And actually I think it was the whole intensity of the experience of that 1800 election that led Jefferson to experience and describe his election as a revolution that was fought and won. His rise to the presidency came after a seemingly deadlocked tie vote in the electoral college that was thrown into the House of Representatives to decide. So deadlocked was the election.

Speaker 1:          12:05          And so extreme where the fears and expectations on all sides that if the wrong person got the office, the entire nation would come crashing to ruin that two states in two different states. And in one state, I believe the governor was in on it. People were stockpiling arms because they were going to march on Washington and take the government for Jefferson. Yeah, that's, that's amazing. That's America in a sense on the brink of some sort of civil war. If the people are marching on the government to take it for the person who they think should be Jared, it should be president. Um, Massachusetts federalist Fisher Ames at that time fought about this and believe that he understood why this was happening. And I'll, I'll mention here only because it's been a continuing theme in our course. We've seen lots of crying guys over the semester. Washington's really good at reducing people to tears apparently.

Speaker 1:          12:59          Um, and I have to mention here partly because I just really liked Fisher ames cause he's sort of an intriguing character who always says quotable things. Um, but he also, he was in congress in the 1790s and the thing that he's most known for is he made a speech about the Jay Treaty and everybody started to cry. So he reduced congress to tears, which to me is kind of a terrifying image. Congress crying. So Fisher Ames, mighty orator reduce her to tears. Um, here's what he says in 1800 when he's looking around and he's trying to figure out what this all means, the fat really is that there is a want of accordance between our system of government and the state of our public opinion. The government is Republican opinion is essentially democratic. Either events, we'll raise public opinion high enough to support our government or public opinion will pull down the government to its own level.

Speaker 1:          13:55          They must equalize. That's really interesting. So here watching what's happening in 1800 aims is kind of confirming what Adams and rush were suggesting and the quotes that I started out by discussing for a revolution to end forms and public opinion have to equalize in some way and before they do things remain unstable. So in a way, what all of these guys are saying is that revolutions end when public opinion conforms with new post revolutionary forms of governance. And until that happens, revolutionary change is still entirely possible. Once that happens, once the sort of new car smell is dissipated from a new government and the government could be taken for granted, is kind of the normal state of affairs and it's endorsed by a majority, then it becomes much harder to stage some kind of full scale revolution from outside of the government. So in essence, revolutions and when the public mind declares that they do, it's up to the public.

Speaker 1:          15:01          Now that's a nice big, broad general discussion about defining the bounds of the American revolution. But what does that really mean? Like, what are we really saying here and how can we show it? How do you actually show public opinion changing and eventually conforming with the new government? Well, what am I that you can begin to do? This is to find a wonderful primary source that includes all kinds of eyewitness testimony about one person's ideas and how they changed over time. So I bring to you today the recorded recollections of George rubber, twelves Hughes, a New England shoemaker. I know he's popped up once or twice in one or two of the books we've read and he's popped up once or twice for good reason because it's hard. It's harder to find comments from people who are not lofty founders. It's hard to find recollections and memories and thoughts about the revolution in a broad sense from average Americans because number one, they don't spend a lot of time off and sitting down and losing on paper.

Speaker 1:          16:00          And number two, their papers don't get saved as often as an elite politicians papers get saved. So people always quote George Robert twelves Hughes because he's there and he's thoughtful. And he actually went back and talked about his entire life and his life spans this entire period. He was born in 1742 he dies in 1840 so he lives a really long time. And he ended up being one of the last surviving veterans of the revolution, or at least that people knew about. So because of that in the 1830s he was interviewed so that he could talk about his recollections, things of his life that he saw as being significant. So let's look for a minute at what Hughes can show us. For one thing you can see in some of the stories that he told and the way that he tells them some kind of subtle but actually pretty significant changes in the public mind that were unleashed by the revolution.

Speaker 1:          16:57          So for example, one of his earliest memories was of having to bring a pair of shoes to John Hancock. And as he recalled the occasion, all these years later, he was terrified. And he says he's first ushered into the kitchen where his type of person belongs. And then Hancock says, no, no, actually I'd like to thank this guy personally. So then he's ushered into the sitting room and he mumbles a little speech. He didn't quite know what he was supposed to say or how to say it and he's really embarrassed. And then Handcock actually ask him to sit down, which terrifies him even more. And then worst of all, Handcock says, let me drink to your health and wants to do the whole glass clinking thing. And he says, I'd never done the glass clinking thing. I didn't know what I was doing. We did the glass clinking thing and then he basically ran away as soon as he could without being rude.

Speaker 1:          17:42          Now he was Mary of this whole episode. Even all of these years later shows really sort of colonial era difference at work or this is not someone who's just respectful of John Hancock. This is someone who is scared of interacting with someone who that above him in society now. He's lived in Boston and the 1760s and seventies seventies this is very handy for us obviously because then he offers us eye witness testimony about other kinds of sort of floating in the air opinions that we're developing at the time. So he certainly, you can see when he's talking about his experiences, shared the feelings of many of his neighbors in Boston in the 1770s in his later years, he remembered how much he really hated the British soldiers that were occupying Boston. He actually remembered that one of them had a pair of shoes made and then never paid for them.

Speaker 1:          18:35          So it's a really specific, I hate the British memory. He also remembers watching an 18th century mugging in which I'm a soldier, knocked a lady down and stole her bonnet and stole her MF. So he remembers ugly British soldier moments from Boston. And then on March 5th he says that when he heard noise in the street, he ran to see what was happening and he saw British soldiers firing on American civilians and his response really say something because he immediately ran home to arm himself. He grabbed a cane and he ran back to the uproar. And when a soldier tried to grab the cane out of his hands, he was insistent that he had a right to carry whatever he pleased. Now that's really interesting because here you see Hughes, he's defending his fellow Bostonians literally and physically, and he's clearly, I suppose an insisting that he has a right to hold on to that cane defending his rights to.

Speaker 1:          19:26          But what you see is that he's taken action almost instinctively. It's not like he saw what was happening and said, this is a revolutionary moment. I must go home and grab my club so that I can say I was there at the beginning phases of the American revolution. I mean, he, he, he just sees what's happening in the street. He's upset. It's his neighbors. It's people from Boston who are getting shot at and he instinctively is just drawn in to what's happening. So clearly his sense of involvement and unfolding events is growing, particularly given that he next took part in the Boston tea party. Obviously that's a very deliberate choice to take part in a protest. And then he fights as a soldier during the revolution, which I guess is the ultimate way in which you show that you're part of a cause. And then he went back to being a shoemaker and then he became an aged veteran of the revolution.

Speaker 1:          20:13          Oh, and one thing I can't help mentioning only because whenever I talk about George, Robert twelves Hughes, I always mention this because I just love the fact that it exists. Um, he had, I think, well actually I know he had 15 children. Um, but what's wonderful about that fact is that, um, his 11th son was named 11 and his, his 15th son was named 15. And I just love the guy, George Robert twelves Hughes has the humor. I don't know if his sons were really thrilled about being named 11 and 15. Um, but I just love the fact that he did this and that we know that that makes me even happier. Okay. So, so what does his show us besides very bizarre naming habits? Um, for one thing, his recollections offer a great example of the ways in which the revolution inspired average Americans to become politically active.

Speaker 1:          21:02          He was literally drawn into the action first defending his neighbors and his town, but over time, obviously feeling like he was taking part in some kind of a larger cause. So in essence, he helps us see how the revolution could politicize someone. And you kind of see this in action. Obviously with the Hancock story, you could see what a real sense of pre-revolutionary difference felt like. Now, of course, the revolution didn't just stamp out difference, but a politicized public was a public that understood that it had rights and that it could demand them. And eventually the American people would not show that kind of fear and trembling before a member of the supposed elite. So basically eventually the American public would find their voice and this idea that the public had a voice and had a right to express it is the sort of general changing of public opinion that would ultimately connect to the nation's new form of government.

Speaker 1:          22:01          So basically you see the sort of beginning of a chain reaction that might actually lead to the end of the revolution. You can see patterns unfolding that represent pretty major changes over a long stretch of time. Now obviously it's not just average American citizens who are being shaped by the revolution. The elite were profoundly effected by it as well. And for one obvious thing, suddenly they were presented with this opportunity to create and shape a new government for a new nation. And they knew that this was a pretty rare opportunity. So even as they're doing it, they know that this is not something that happens very often. Just listen to how John Adams discussed what he felt like was the change that he experienced over the course of his life. And this is in one of the letters I mentioned this at the beginning of the course.

Speaker 1:          22:47          These great letters they write to each other in their old age. So here writing to Jefferson, Adam says, when I was young, the summa Bonem or the sort of ultimate height in Massachusetts was to be worth 10,000 pounds. Sterling ride in a chariot or carriage, be a kernel of a regiment of militia and hold a seat in His Majesty's Council. No Man's imagination aspire to anything higher beneath the skies. So Adams is thinking back and he's here basically suggesting that the revolution and its aftermath expand the horizons of an entire generation. Now he's talking about the elite, but you could expand this to include the American citizenry as well. Cause then a variety of ways. The revolution shook things up. And in doing so it expanded People's horizons. Now I use the word citizenry and I did that really deliberately. Um, because all Americans did not have their horizons expanded during the Revolutionary War.

Speaker 1:          23:46          And this is something clearly we talked about in class and you've talked about in sections that's linked to some of the discussions that we've been having about how radical the revolution was or wasn't. So the elite, like everyone else, we're profoundly effected by the revolution. But of course they're not the people who get to decide the fate of the revolution. If the American public who gets to make that decision, it's their opinions of the new government that are going to either make or break the government and the revolution. And during the period covered by this course, we've seen the beginnings of a long period during which public opinion would continue to change sometimes really dramatically concerning just what this new government and this new nation was supposed to be. Now I'm not going to end by continuing here to talk about the end of the revolution because it isn't just the events of the revolution that mattered even when they're ending.

Speaker 1:          24:40          It's actually how we remember them. That matters because the way that we remember history obviously really determines its meaning and its impact. So basically history and how we understand our history can have a profound effect on the here and now. In a way, this is what Jefferson referred to, I think a couple of lectures back. I talked about the dead hand of the past. Jefferson wanting to like every 19 years, let's make a new constitution. Um, that's kind of linked to that Jeffersonian idea of the dead hand of the past. And since history could have that impact on the present, depending on how you understand it and that dead hand of the past, it can be a pretty heavy hand at this point. Basically, I need, I need, I need to tell you an anecdote. I actually do need to tell you an anecdote. Um, as I was reading the lecture this morning, um, I was writing about the dead hand of the past.

Speaker 1:          25:33          And I guess whenever I use that phrase, I think at this one particular letter I found, which actually is relevant, so I'm not being completely random. Um, it does have something to do with the dead hand of the past and history. It actually also has nothing to do with the American revolution, but it really shows you how the past can have an enormous weight on the present. And it's also just an amazing little piece of paper that I found and it has to do with this letter that I found when I was rummaging through, um, the, the Addams family correspondence, which is indeed what it's called, the Addams family. So the, the John Adams family correspondence, and I found this letter from John Quincy Adams. I wasn't looking for it, but I found this letter and he was overseas, uh, when his father was running for president. And he clearly, he really wants to know if his father one, and it takes a long time for news to make it across the ocean.

Speaker 1:          26:22          So what I found was first one letter in which he's writing, do you know what happened in the election? And then I found a lot of them and he keeps me writing to people and writing to people saying, do you know, do you know, has my father won the election? Who's won the election? What's happened in the election? So I can't help. But now I'm like following the trail because I have to find the letter where he finds out. Right. And you would assume, I assumed that I found that letter. He would say something, you know like, ah, this is a great day for America, or I don't know, something, something lofty and you know, w vision, this sort of looking out, aw, junk with the Adams ask. So finally I find the letter and I'm going to paraphrase it and with my own bad paraphrasing here, but the point will be true.

Speaker 1:          27:04          He basically says, Oh God, I'll never live up to this. The first thing he thinks is now I'm going to have to be president too. That was amazing to me. Like I really felt for John Quincy Adams, like you suddenly got a quick flash of what it felt like to be an Adams or particularly the Addams family had a habit of picking one Adams progeneration and then dumping all of their expectations on that one. Adams clearly John Quincy Adams is this generation's guy. So there's, this certainly gives you a sense of, I want to say dead hand of the past, I guess. I guess it's the live hand of the past because it's his father, this poor guy. Like anything his father does, he's clearly like, oh damn, I have to be president too. She's amazing. Um, but concrete, a concrete example of what I'm talking about here. Um, and it certainly shows how the next generation beyond the founding generation really felt like they had to live up to the achievements of what had gone before them.

Speaker 1:          28:06          Now, as far as the people who had gone before them, as far as the fathers are concerned, they knew that they were becoming history. And so they thought about the making of history and the writing of history a lot. To me the most, the most concrete example, um, of people becoming history is something that happened to poor Thomas Jefferson in his old age. You know, I wonder if any of you ever seen a life mask. You know, there's death masks in life masks, death masks are obvious, but there do exist life masks as well. So again, Jefferson's old age, someone went to Monte Cello and they wanted to make a life mask of him. I don't know who this guy was, but he wasn't good at his job. So whatever he did, he did it wrong. And his, his daughter later said, she came into the room to see the guy with a hammer and chisel, like trying to chip the plaster.

Speaker 1:          28:56          You're like, oh my God, I killed him, you know, like the plaster hardened and they couldn't get it off. So Jefferson's like basically thinking this is so bad, this is really bad. He really like was terrified that that was the end for him. He literally almost became history. He was his dream. He was gone. Luckily they can pick out the plaster off and, and he survived. But aside from the fact that he almost melted into plaster, um, obviously that whole cohort of people had really strong feelings about the story of the revolution, about how that story should be told. And they were not in love with the whole idea that the founding period is some kind of golden age of patriotic perfection. They did not see the revolution is some kind of divine strike of Providence. They did not see themselves as demi gods. And here I'm going to turn to John Adams, which always makes me happy.

Speaker 1:          29:49          Um, who did a really good job in his old age of answering letters from strangers who wanted to know, tell us about the revolution, what really happened and an answering. He did a great job of basically popping bubbles of myths, you know, he, he basically said over and over again in one way or another, you know, revolution wasn't some kind of golden, wonderful moment. Now, like the other founders, he actually lived to be 90, so unfortunately he had a lot of these letters. Um, I think Jefferson, I think I was back to say Jefferson I think got more, which obviously would make Adam's really mad. Like even now I was thinking about him more than me. Um, but I think all of these guys were getting these letters from people basically in one way or another saying, you know, tell us what was it really like?

Speaker 1:          30:36          Like, what was it like, what happened when you signed the declaration? What happened? What was it really like? Jefferson in particular was driven crazy. I mean, Jefferson Jefferson doesn't normally emote on paper in a deep kind of sincere, like he's not thinking hard way. They always get a sense, he's thinking really carefully about how he expresses himself. Um, but when he's riding to Adam's in their old age, he gets, he's really just sort of Vince about this whole like strangers writing letters and asking about history thing. So he says he complains from sunrise to one or two o'clock and often from dinner to dark, I am dredging at the writing table and all this to answer letters into which neither interest nor inclination on my part enters. And often for persons whose names I have never before heard. And in this letter, Jefferson estimates that an 1822 he got 1,267 of these letters from people, just strangers.

Speaker 1:          31:31          Tell us about the declaration. He called it the burden of his life. And then at one point in this letter, and this is where I felt like he really hit like Jeffersonian bottom, he's, he's like whining and whining and he's going on, I hate this, I hate this. Well, they stop, you know, probably out of the thinking sends them to me. I have something to say. Um, but finally at this point in the letter Jefferson just writes, is this life it's so weirdly modern. You know, that's like something we have probably all said at one point is this life, please stop writing me the letters. His life actually got worse on this front. You got it. You're feeling bad for the founders here. Um, people didn't just like daily gym with random letters. Strangers made pilgrimages to Monte Cello. It became like a tourist attraction and he was still living in it.

Speaker 1:          32:21          And so strangers would come and just swarm around macho, like peering in the window, you know, like, oops, I broke the glass, you know, like trampoline the car. And he got so overwhelmed by this that he basically after a while left my cello and lived in one of his other homes for a while. Like I just can't take it. I'm abandoning my house to the strangers. I'm going to go live in my other house for a little while. And that's why actually those of you who've been to mount a cello and you've seen his little sanctuary, there's a look, a little area that's really his and has sort of all his books and his bed and it's really their doors that can lock it off to everything, which is really rare for a real reason because that was, that literally was his sanctuary. That was like the swarms are outside lock, lock, lock, lock, like you're not coming in.

Speaker 1:          33:06          So I think, I think it wasn't fun being a founder and basically that's what Jefferson is showing us here. Um, but whether or not they were happy old founders, the founding types who are answering these letters, we're really trying to shape the telling of the history of the revolution and different founders I'm sure had different messages and some are probably happier than others or more optimistic than others. I think James Madison was like optimistic to the end. Um, Adams, as I said before, spent a lot of time sort of punching holes and myths about the revolution that already were circulating in the 18 teens in the 1820s. So over and over and over again, he told people that there had not been some kind of unanimous, patriotic, glorious moment as it seemed to have been looking from the distance of time. So in response to one letter, he insisted that the revolution was not a big wave of unanimous patriotism as he put it.

Speaker 1:          34:00          Every measure of Congress from 1774 to 1787 inclusively was disputed with acrimony and decided by a small majorities as any question is decided these days. Right. I saying, you know, it's not like we were like, yes, independence. You say, you know, sometimes it was like one or two votes that we decided this and then it goes out into history and all the people know is we voted yes and it seems unanimous and it really wasn't even iconic. Revolutionary moments he thought should not be viewed as the sort of blurry is moments of triumph. He in one letter he recalled what he was thinking as he watched people, his fellow congressmen signed the Declaration of Independence and he said, I could not see their hearts, but as far as I could penetrate the intricate foldings of their souls. I then believed and have not since altered my opinion, that there were several who signed with regret and several others with many doubts and much lukewarmness.

Speaker 1:          34:53          He said, he's saying, okay, even while they're like signing the declaration, it's like, I don't think some of these people actually really want it to be signing it at all. And some of them I think kind of wish they were somewhere else not signing it, which is not the image that's floating around at this point about what the revolution was. So people were disagreeing. He's saying back in the revolutionary era, they came to the majority. They weren't sure about what they were doing. They didn't even like what they were doing sometimes and their decisions weren't always good. He out. Of course. That's something to say about that as well. So he said in a different letter, I say, we did not make more mistakes now than we did in 1770456789. He's clearly making a point here. When I was copying this, I was like, how many more?

Speaker 1:          35:38          (808) 018-0280 three it's like, I get your point. We made a lot of mistakes through the whole revolution. He's saying it was patched and Piebald then as it is now and ever will be world without end, nor were battlefields any more sank. Sacrosanct is Adam put it. Adam's put it. We blundered at Lexington at bunker's hill where indeed did we not blunder except Saratoga and Yorktown where our triumphs redeemed. All former disgraces. So Adams is insisting much of the time, you know, we weren't all that great like we made mistakes back then. We didn't always entirely believe what we were doing. It wasn't that different from how it is now. The Revolution was not some golden age of perfection and Adam summed all of this up in a letter that I like because in some way, I don't know. It seems a little more direct than some of these other letters and it, if it was a while, you'll hear the way he phrases it.

Speaker 1:          36:35          He wrote this letter in 1811 and he said to this one correspondent who said, you know, I revere the fathers, I, you know, I want to be like them. Oh, you know, all the things he's getting in all of these letters. And he says, I ought not to object to your reverence for your fathers, but to tell you to tell you a great secret as far as I am capable of comparing the merit of different periods. I have no reason to believe we were better than you are. He has like being really straight forward about this. Now all of those quotes of course are from the sort of lofty Adams, you know, the far seeing items, the sage Adams, they're not from the Adams. I was just referring to a few minutes ago, which is the, I don't get any respect. John Adams and he's there too and mean.

Speaker 1:          37:14          Both of those things were there at the same time, which also tells you something. When you read the correspondence of his old age, he sort of veering back and forth between, I am a lofty founder. Why won't anyone recognize me as a lofty founder? I'm a lefty founder, please. Someone recognized me. He has all these letters where he's like, you know, no one will ever make a monument to me. John Adams, so sorry, but my, my point here is that to Adams and to many others, you're not supposed to look at history as this sort of golden, perfect moment that's drastically different in that sense, from everything since innocence to these people worshiping the founding era or worshiping the American revolution as a golden age actually did more harm than good. The revolution had been all about beginnings, about beginning traditions and patterns of governance, about beginning new constitutions.

Speaker 1:          38:09          But these beginnings were actually supposed to go someplace they were supposed to lead to something that actually would survive and be shaped by future generations. So I think to this whole generation, this idea of sort of worshiping the founding era as a golden age made it seem as though the time for that kind of work had ended as though there was a glorious, wonderful creative moment when things could be done. Uh, now that time is gone. And you could see that in Adam's letters to that he says often about the future. Well, you know, maybe it will be a brighter page or maybe it'll be a darker page. I don't know. It's up to you. But he assumes obviously that what they've been doing isn't some like dead end moment at which who knows what will happen next. He actually assumes they've started something that in one way or another, they assume it's going to continue.

Speaker 1:          38:59          So clearly the time for that kind of creative political work hadn't ended whenever the random date is that we decide the American revolution ended. And in a sense it hasn't ended as the founding generation. Well, new American citizens are always responsible for their government. They control its destiny, right? They decide when revolutions start, they decide when revolution stop, they control the destiny of the aftereffect of revolutions. So I guess in a sense, and this is where I was really struggling this morning, I was like, what would be the ultimate message I give to you? It's so hard when you teach courses on the founding period because everything you say has weird resonance in the present. As I'm kind of saying here and I don't want to have weird resonance, I just want to sort of give something to you guys. Um, so related to what I'm saying here, maybe the ultimate message of the sort of ground level message or this course is your opinions matter and your actions out there in the world politically and otherwise are going to matter too.

Speaker 1:          40:02          That's in essence what these founders are saying when they're saying don't treat us like demi gods, like where some lofty population that will never come again. Then when we set something in motion and the whole point of the thing that we set in motion is that you're supposed to make it run, right. It's actually about you. We may be memorable guys. I might want to be a more memorable guy than I am, but it's all about you. It's all about you. That's what's supposed to keep it running in the end. Okay. Um, I want to, first of all, thank you for laughing at my jokes all semester. Obviously, one of my favorite things to do is to tell stories and lecture courses are moments where you're completely my hostage and I get to it sometimes as I'm writing a lecture, as as today, I'm like, oh, this isn't related, but I'll find a way to rope it in to the lecture so then I can give it to you. So I have greatly enjoyed myself this semester. You've been, you've been wonderfully receptive. You asked, when I went to sections, you asked wonderful questions, you're engaged with the material. After lectures, you guys kept coming up to me and asking good questions, which was impressive and doesn't always happen in electric cords. So I want to thank you because it makes me really happy if you guys are really engaged with what I'm talking about here. So thank you very much.
