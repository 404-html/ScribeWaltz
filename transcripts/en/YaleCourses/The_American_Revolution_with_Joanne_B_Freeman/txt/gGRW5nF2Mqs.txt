Speaker 1:          00:01          Tuesday, we ended with the angry response in the colonies to the passage of the stamp act. 1765 I talked about, I described Patrick Henry. We had a first, our famous revolution moment number one, Patrick Henry speaking out in the Virginia House of Burgesses, talking about what he dramatically called his colonies, dying liberty. And at the very end of the lecture, I mentioned that in May of 1765, the Virginia House of burgesses past some protesting resolutions, ultimately known as the Virginia resolves, I think I said resolutions on Tuesday, and let's stick with resolves. The Virginia resolves and the Virginia resolves said there were a number of different obviously resolves and the Virginia Resolve. They said that the colonists had come to Virginia with equal rights to all British subjects. That the colonial charter confirmed that, that Virginia is had the right to be governed by their own legislature and that the Virginia legislature had never forfeited.

Speaker 1:          01:08          It's right to impose taxes on the colony of Virginia. I'll repeat that again. Um, the Virginia resolves May, 1765, Collin has had come to Virginia with equal rights to all British subjects. Colonial charters confirm that Virginians had the right to be governed by their own colonial legislature and the Virginia colonial legislature had not forfeited. It's right to impose taxes on the colony of Virginia. Now, how's it burgesses passes these resolutions. But in Virginia, they weren't even published in the local newspaper. However, they were published in Rhode Island. Okay. I really don't make this up. Like I feel like you're going gonna you're going to accuse me of planting Rhode Island randomly throughout this course and I'm not. It's really, it's there all by itself. Um, Rhode Island. And why Rhode Island, I can't tell you, but indeed by happenstance, someone in Rhode Island, it circulates the, resolves a circulating. People are reading them and they're talking about them, but it's somebody in Rhode Island who publishes the Virginia resolves in a Rhode Island newspaper.

Speaker 1:          02:13          However, what this person does when he publishes these results is not only publish the ones that were actually passed, but there are two additional results that get published right alongside the ones that were passed. Um, these were not passed and possibly weren't really even discussed, and they're more radical than the other resolutions, but they're put right alongside with no differentiation. And these two unpassed more radical resolutions, say quote, His Majesty's Leach people, inhabitants of this colony are not bound to yield obedience to any law or ordinance whatsoever designed to impose any taxation upon them. Okay? That's a much bolder statement than what I just said was happening in those Virginia resolves. And then this sort of more radical unpassed resolution number two that got published said that anyone who asserted that anyone except the Virginia Assembly could directly tax Virginia was quote, an enemy of this, His Majesty's colony.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Okay? Those are two really strong statements. The Virginia House of Burgesses did not pass. Those did not resolve those, but they get published in Rhode Island right alongside the ones that were passed and resolved. And so they go circulating throughout the colonies. Making Virginia look a lot more radical than it was at that particular moment. So news of this sort of new radical version of the Virginia resolves get spread throughout the colonies and colonies are then inspired to pass resolves of their own. So it's an, it's an out of Rhode Island moment. However, it is Massachusetts that first suggests United colonial action. So in June, uh, 1765, the Massachusetts Assembly sins, a circular letter to all of the colonial assemblies and a circular letter is kind of what it sounds like. A letter intended to circulate to all of the colonial assemblies, inviting them to meet in a congress in New York in October of 1765 quote to consider, have a general and United dutiful, loyal and humble representation of their condition to his majesty and the parliament, and to implore relief.

Speaker 1:          04:29          Okay, so it's a United response, but it's also beautiful, loyal and humble. So on the one hand, the fact that there's going to be some kind of a United colonial statement is interesting and forceful, but on the other hand, due to full, loyal, humble, we're not, we're not this, we're not near declaring independence here. We're just kind of imploring relief, making a statement that, excuse us, we are your humble and obedient subjects and we don't really like this. Thank you very much. So it's, it's that kind of a statement. Nine colonies responded, New Hampshire declined to participate. Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia couldn't participate because their governors didn't convene their assemblies to elect delegates. So there were no delegates elected. But all in all, there were 27 men who took part in what came to be known as the Stamp Act. Congress. Right? Easy enough to remember the Stamp Act Congress, which meant for much of October in 1765 okay.

Speaker 1:          05:23          The Stamp Act, Congress, the Stamp Act. Congress was actually the first of what we're going to see is a series of extra legal organizations created outside of the regular colonial political system to resist and reform British policies. Okay. So it's it's a significant action on the part of the colonies and ultimately the stamp act. Congress passed a series of declarations and they kind of echo some of the resolutions and declarations that had been circulating and they're going to sound not drastically different from some of the logic that I've been talking about in the last lecture or two and I'll just mention four of the resolutions passed by the Stamp Act Congress. They declared that they owe their allegiance to the crown like any British subject. They declared that they were entitled to the Rights and liberties of any British subject. They said that British subjects in the colonies could not be taxed without their consent and they declared that trial by jury was the right of every British subject in the colony.

Speaker 1:          06:31          So you can see they're really their statement saying, well, you know where British subjects like any other British subjects and were demanding the rights and liberties of other British subjects. Now it's important to note the resolutions are not saying that parliament had no right to regulate trade in the colonies. They're just saying that parliament cannot directly tax the colonies without their consent. So again, it's, it's a direct statement. It's a strong statement, but it's a respectful statement and it's not boldly sort of altering, at least in the minds of the colonists and enormous change of policy. They're kind of stating what they think the state of things is. So clearly the stamp that Congress is a step towards colonial unity, it's a significant step. Now actually I want to add at this point, um, the answer to a question that someone asked at the end of class on Tuesday that he's working over there.

Speaker 1:          07:25          I think that was yes, uni, it was a really good question. I answer questions and then I actually answered them in class. Um, it was a really good question. And the question was, um, did anyone in parliament actually oppose the stamp act? And if they did, what was the logic? It's actually a really good question. And although I knew the answer was yes, I couldn't tell you very much detail about that. Yes. So I went and did a little research. Um, and it's interesting. Um, most members of parliament assumed that the stamp act was, I suppose you could say constitutional or that it was, you know, above board proper that there was nothing wrong with it as far as procedurally and most members of parliament assume that the colonists would agree it's constitutional above board. There's nothing wrong with it as far as the fact that it exists.

Speaker 1:          08:07          The stamp act is perfectly proper. Some members of parliament, and not a lot, but some did admit that maybe parliament was treading on dangerous ground, but even these people didn't worry about the stamp act on constitutional grounds. They didn't say, wow, I wonder if we have the right to do this. Rather they worry that maybe the colonists were going to be unhappy because the stamp act may be would seem too burdensome or they worried that maybe the colonists would think this was some kind of an aggressive display of parliamentary power. But members of parliament were actually not worried about this. Seeming as though it's something that wasn't proper, wasn't allowable, wasn't supposed to be done within the confines of the British imperial system. So basically what you're seeing here is sort of a version of what I've been saying in a variety of different ways so far in this course, I've been talking about different mindsets, developing and both sides sort of not necessarily understanding that there are different mindsets evolving here.

Speaker 1:          09:04          What you're seeing here is basically members of parliament just fundamentally not seeing that the colonists had developed a different understanding of the workings of the British imperial system and those members who were worried about the act, they were worried about it being unpopular or maybe seeming too strong, but they were not worried about any larger sort of legal rationale as one member put it. I thought this was kind of a neat quote. We are working in the dark and the less we do, the better. I know that's a great quote because it's basically a member of parliament saying, I'm not entirely sure, like we don't really know what we're doing and we don't really know how they're gonna respond. So we actually need to be careful with what we're doing because we just don't know what the response is going to be. They're not gonna, they may not like it.

Speaker 1:          09:45          They actually, it was only one member of parliament who was a planter in the West indies. One Guy who predicted, I think the stamp act is going to produce discord and confusion in the colonies. Right. One guy. So probably afterwards he was the guy saying, yeah, told you you should have listened to me. I told you I knew. Okay. So that's the answer to that question. It's a really good question because I had just never looked that up in any detail before. Okay. So so far we've largely been talking about speechifying paper pushing resolves declarations, newspaper announcements. But in Boston we're now about to see some physical resistance because there some radicals decided no more words action. And these Boston radicals is, you're about to see, they deployed a long held colonial tradition of resistance. They basically planned a mob action. Now it's important to note that mobs in early America weren't sort of wild, violent, out of control.

Speaker 1:          10:48          You know, all kind of actions in a way that we're sort of part of the political system. Something that people were supposed to do when they felt outraged. I mean, it was sort of a way of venting popular protest, and usually early American mobs were pretty conservative. They were usually focused on protecting the good of the community from things like unfairly high food prices are illegal business practices. Normally they weren't really excited about tearing things down. Normally they involve some marching and some yelling. There was a lot of effigy burning and then people went home. So early American mobs again, are almost kind of procedural. This sort of what happens when you're upset and you're a member of the public and it's not only sort of average members of the public is not only the masses taking part in these kinds of protests. All levels of society might take part at one time or another.

Speaker 1:          11:40          So in the summer of 1765 some Bostonian's decided they're going to take advantage of this tradition, a group of Boston radicals who eventually call themselves the sons of liberty. So here's yet another. Now we're starting to get to the part of the course where these things come out of my mouth. And you're like, Ding, Ding, Ding, Ding, ding, revolutionary war moment sounds of liberty. We had the master camera, we're gonna have another one by the end of the lecture today, but here's one sons of liberty, Boston. So these radicals decide they're going to take action and the sons of liberty, basically our artisans and shopkeepers who want to act in resistance to the stamp act. Samuel Adams, who's really more a member of the elite, but he nevertheless was kind of a champion of the artist class and he's among their number two. So let's look for a moment what the sons of liberty decide to do and how it works out.

Speaker 1:          12:29          Okay, so basically in Boston at the time there were two really large fraternal organizations of artisans. There was one in the north end of Boston, there was one in the south end of Boston. And the sons of liberty think, well, you know, you have these sort of organized groups like clubs of artisans. Why don't we enlist the aid of one of them? They're sort of already organized. They already have a leader. Maybe we could get them to help us. It's some sort of organized protest against the Stamp Act. So they appealed to the south end group who agrees to take part in some kind of a protest. So now we have this radical group, the sons of liberty who have named themselves and they're organized enough to have names. We have an organized force of men and we have a focus desire to protest against an act of parliament.

Speaker 1:          13:16          So this is on its way to being a different kind of early American mob action than these other ones might have been. Okay. So in Boston, the poor guy who is the stamp agent, the stamp distributor is named Andrew Oliver. This is the person that you do not want to be at this particular moment. Okay. So Andrew Oliver is the one who's going to be giving out or selling the stamps. So obviously this group of men, they want to do a mob action. They decide, okay, Oliver is the target. So first they go to his dock, side warehouse. They assume actually that that's where the stamped paper is going to be. So they just destroy the warehouse. I mean like destroy it. Then they go to Oliver's house and throw rocks and basically break all of the windows. Then they take an effigy of Oliver and they stamp on it.

Speaker 1:          14:08          Okay. That's not my point. And that's actually their foot, right? The stab back. We're still paying all of her hug lackey, early Americans with their wild sense of humor. Um, bad puns of early America. That's the first of these courts. So they stamp on Andrew Oliver. Oliver responds logically enough by resigning as stamp distributor, which I think was a wise move. Okay. You think that, thank you very much. I'm going home to my broken window house now. No more stands for me. Okay. Not long after that. Maybe within two weeks, that same group of men turn on Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson, who seemed like a friend to the stamp act. This time the mob goes to his house and they destroy it, and I don't just mean rocks at windows, they go to Hutchinson's house, they smashed the windows, they break in the doors, they smashed the furniture, they cut the paintings, they trashed the clothing.

Speaker 1:          15:04          They cut down the trees in his garden and they were in the process of removing the roof when daylight stopped them. Okay, so this is on the one hand, it's sort of a weird mob. They're like, you know, excuse me, can you pass me that hammer? I've got to remove the shingle. You know, they're really like they're industrious mob action, but they're literally completely tearing apart. Hutchinson's pretty sort of spiffy mansion in protest. Um, attacks on stamp distributors and other colonies followed. And there were a lots of resignations of staff agents. I'm not doing the job. Thanks. I love my house. I don't want to do this anymore. So the result of all of this kind of action is that by November of 1765 when the stamp act is actually going to go into effect. So first of all, the act actually hasn't gone into effect yet.

Speaker 1:          15:54          Everything I've talked about is leading up to it actually going into effect. So November, 1765, it's due to go into effect, but people aren't quite sure what to do. Do we ignore it? Are there actually any stamp agents left? Maybe you don't have to ignore it because nobody will sell stamped paper. I don't know. And some people did just choose to ignore the act. Others went further and decided to boycott British goods, which has, we're going to see further into this course with sometimes a really effective way to protest against the mother. Country basically hit economically and that's bound debt make an impact. But in the middle of all this, Grandville ministry fell not because of the stamp act, but because of insider politics. The colonists saw this as providential Greenville's gone. Clearly it's assigned from providence that we are meant to succeed here to come out of this looking better than things were when we were in the middle of it.

Speaker 1:          16:54          The new prime minister is the Earl of Rockingham. Now the Earl of Rockingham had strong connections with London merchants. London merchants clearly are people who are going to be deeply effected by colonial boycotting, so they want the stamp act repealed. So we've got this new prime minister, the Earl of Rockingham. He's in with the merchants who are being hurt by the boy cut. The idea now is it would be a fine thing if we could figure out a way to repeal the stamp act, but the problem of course is figuring out how to repeal it without seeming weak while holding your ground and rocking them. Eventually did repeal the stamp act in March of 1766 but to save face, he assigned blame to the wounded British economy. He did not say anything about colonial rights. He said, well, the economy's suffering and so we will repeal the stamp act. He also passed at the same time the declaratory act, the declaratory act, which declared in short that parliament could pass laws for the colonies quote in all cases whatsoever, gave the declaratory act of 1766 really strong statement.

Speaker 1:          18:05          It's like, yeah, we're going to repeal the stamp act, but we're going to pass this other act that says, you know, no, we could basically pass laws for you however we want to pass them so we're not caving. We're just sort of giving it on this one little point now to Britain. The Declaratory Act asserted their control over the colonies. They're legal control over the colonies in all cases to the colonists because it mentioned legislation but not taxes. It seemed to suggest that maybe they had made their point that parliament is not going to assert taxation. So in a way, the declaratory act makes things worse. It worsens ongoing misunderstandings between parliament and the colonies. The British not fully understanding the colonial mindset about the workings of the empire, the colonists not viewing their own logic as exceptional in any way. They assume that their logic has been understood.

Speaker 1:          19:02          The declaratory act also didn't really encourage compromise because if you think about it, moderates on all sides were discredited. In England, the Declaratory Act asserted parliamentary power. So it's a strong statement of power in the colonies. Radicals rule the day because it seemed as though they'd made their point. So as far as the colonies were concerned, the stamp act crisis move many to accept radical leadership, it appears to be working. It also revealed to the colonies the power of uniting the colonies to bring pressure against England, which also seemed to have worked. Now, once again in the middle of all this, the prime minister yet again is replaced. Clearly this is not the time to be a prime minister in England. It's kind of a rocky time going on. So, um, rocky time was not meant to be upon the early of Rockingham goes down in this rocky time.

Speaker 1:          19:54          Um, and Charles. Yeah. And I heard a Groan. I didn't do it on purpose. It just sort of happened. I'm sorry. It's a bad plan that I take full responsibility for it. Um, but they are only rocking him. His ministry falls. Charles Townsend takes his place. Charles Townson the new prime minister and he's given the task of balancing the budget in 1767 and like Granville before him. Townson first looks to England itself and issues new taxes in England. But again, he still needs more income and he does next turn to the colonies and he devises a scheme that he thinks isn't going to be too upsetting to these sort of touchy colonials. He says he's going to proceed quote with great delicacy, right? Cause it's clear now they get upset over there. I get upset. We need to be careful. I'm going to proceed with great delicacy.

Speaker 1:          20:45          He understands their sensitivity by this whole issue of taxation. So he decides he's going to ask for customs duties on items that the colonies import from Britain like glass, silk, paper, paint, and t. You can see, you can see where we're going. Um, but this is not an internal tax. This is an external tax. It's not a tax on things within the colonies. It's not a tax on legal documents is not a tax on PA playing cards like the Stamp Act. It's an external tax. It's customs duties and light before Townson wants the money raised by this to go to pay for royal administration in the colony. So also the money raised, isn't it? Going back to England, it's going to be spent on the colonies. Townson also reorganized the custom service in the colonies, basically tossing out old customs agents who had been bought by colonial merchants and putting handpicked men in their place.

Speaker 1:          21:45          So all in all towns and thought surely these are tame enough measures that the colonists aren't going to object to them at the scenes as though they're accommodating. They're mild, nothing very dramatic being done here. These come to be known as the towns and acts of 1767 and sure enough, the initial response to the Townson x is relatively weak, but colonial anger is raised yet again by a publication by a colonist named John Dickinson. He's a Pennsylvania and he's in Pennsylvania and he writes a series of letters. First they appear in a Pennsylvania newspaper there eventually published in other colonial newspapers. And then finally they're put together and published in a pamphlet. This is all in 1767 and the pamphlet is named letters from a farmer in Pennsylvania to the inhabitants of the British colonies. They have very literal titles and these days is one of them, John Dickinson, Pennsylvanian letters from a farmer in Pennsylvania to the inhabitants of the British colonies.

Speaker 1:          22:51          Now Degas, and actually when you read these, he's pretty moderate in tone and most of what he does is he uses past precedent to argue against the right of parliament to directly tax the colonies. He asserts directly, we're not talking about independence, we're just talking about past precedent. However, he also says, and this is a quote from him, we cannot be happy without being free. We cannot be free without being secure in our property. We cannot be secure in our property if without our consent, others may as by right, take it away. The tax is imposed on us by parliament. Do this, take it away. That's really clear. Direct logic, right? We can't be happy without being free. We can't be free without being secure in our property. We can't be secure in our property without our consent. Others may take it away and parliament seems to be taking it away.

Speaker 1:          23:45          So Dickinson isn't arguing anything amazingly new here, but he's certainly stating it with real clarity and real power. And he also appears to be saying, well, you know, some of that stuff we learned from that whole stamp act thing. I think they apply as well to this new towns and to act thing. He appears to be drawing a pattern. So letters from a farmer in Pennsylvania ultimately has an impact. It's a strong statement up in Boston. There was also some writing going on and there Samuel Adams, who was in the Massachusetts Assembly wrote a circular letter that he sent to other colonies, yet again another circular letter. And this time it's a circular letter protesting against the Townson Act. And it's moderate, but it's criticizing the ax. It does deny. It's where this isn't about independence. We're not trying to rebel here, but it does urge joint colonial resistance to the towns and acts.

Speaker 1:          24:45          Now, back in England, many people urged a lenient response to this. I mean it's, it's, if you think about it potentially, it's a scary thing. You have this guy, this radical guy in Boston whose urging joint colonial resistance to an act of parliament. So, um, as you will see, some people get rather upset by this, but not everybody. Some people say, well, okay, let's not overreach, respond. Let's not overreact. However, the British Secretary of state, Lord Hillsborough really saw this as organized resistance and refuse to stand for it. So in 1768 privately consulting with the Kings, so kind of doing this off on the side, he instructed the governor of Massachusetts to dissolve the Massachusetts Assembly unless they took back the letter. He also sent a letter to all royal governors telling them to ignore the Massachusetts letter or else he would dissolve their legislatures to.

Speaker 1:          25:42          Okay, that's it. There's a strong statement for you that's clearly bound to make. Collin is get very, very upset. Hillsborough also knowing that people are going to get upset, urged General Thomas Gauge who's commander in chief of the army and at the time was posted in New York, he urges gauge in New York to prepare his troops in case they're needed in Boston. Okay, so he's anticipating there might be a response. It would be nice to have troops potentially ready to go to Boston. So now troops are being organized. There's threats about dissolving assemblies and communication between the colonies in the form of a circular letter is being discouraged. So clearly if you're a colonist at this point there appears to be a plan of repression, right? It plan, there seems to be a system of tyranny. There seems to be some kind of organized attack on colonial liberties.

Speaker 1:          26:37          And I'm emphasizing plan and system and organized because next week that's the direction we're going to be going with the lectures. We're going to be looking at what I call the logic of resistance or how does all of this add up in the minds of the colonists? What's what, what are they drawing, what conclusions are they drawing based on actions that are happening. And as we'll see in the lectures and in the readings for next week, um, there's a lot of conclusions being drawn about an actual system of tyranny, which is a very 18th century way of kind of looking at it. So colonists are wondering if there is a sort of system of repression being put in place. Meanwhile, parliament eventually in 1770 repeals most of the towns of debts but does preserve the tax on tea, partly for revenue. And partly to prove that they still have the right to tax the colonies.

Speaker 1:          27:25          So we're, we're half seeing revenue raising and half seeing an argument here, and probably there was an assumption on the part of parliament that by repealing most of the acts, things would quiet down. But as events in Boston, we're about to prove this would not be the case. As we're about to see between 1768 and 1774 Boston really ends up taking center stage and thanks in part to the actions of Samuel Adams who really is, you'll see today a brilliant propagandist and a man with a really fierce sense of his rights, his British rights and his grievances as an English subject. And I will add that Samuel Adams did brew beer. He actually is. Samuel Adams is associated with beer. So truth in advertising who? I have no idea. That's an accurate portrait of Sam Adams.

Speaker 1:          28:18          Sam Adams is too ugly. Oh, poor Sam Adams. I feel very bad now. Oh well he's not attractive, but I don't know what he's ugly. I feel I feel bad and I'm going to have to find a way to redeem Sam Adams. Thank you very much. No wonder I didn't think it was entirely an accurate portrait of Samuel. Okay. And yet he is associated with beer. Okay. Um, so Sam Adams, he's going to have a moment October of 1768 troops actually arrive in Boston at the instigation of Massachusetts Royal Governor Francis Bernard, who's alarmed at this sort of radical rumblings that he's hearing parliament makes things worse by in December of 1768 by proposing that the ring leaders behind that circular letter that seems like organized resistance, that they should be brought to trial for treason and using an obscure law. They say that they should be brought to trial for treason in England.

Speaker 1:          29:19          They should go to trial in England. Okay. Again, not something that's going to make call and it's really happy. Not surprisingly, when you have the next election for the assembly in Massachusetts in 1769, a large number of radicals get voted in and this new assembly passes logically enough radical resolutions. Again, largely the work of Samuel Adams. The, sadly not good looking. Samuel Adams, um, who declared in these resolutions that no man can be justly taxed by or bound and conscience to obey any law which he has not given his consent in person or by his representative. Okay. That's a, that's a stronger statement than the ones we've had before. What he's saying here, formerly like other colonial assemblies, the Massachusetts Assembly with saying, well, parliament can legislate for us, but they can't directly attacks us without our consent. But this statement says parliament can't legislate for us if we have no say in the process.

Speaker 1:          30:24          Bang. That's a very strong statement. So clearly there's a lot of, um, emotions that has been raised about what the British administration is doing. It's being vented in radical resolves like that. The arrival of troops in Boston in 1768 ended up really focusing these feelings of grievance, these, this anger, they sort of passions. You have troops being sent to Boston at a moment where people are angry at the British, surely enough, you can see that the columns are going to vent their feelings towards the soldiers troops being sent to Boston. Increase colonial assumptions that they are being treated as second class citizens, as lower class subjects as people who are not equal to other British subjects within the empire. And Samuel Adams said this really clearly in a newspaper article written at the time he wrote, it is well known from the first landing of the troops that the truth behavior was to a great degree, insolent and such as looked as if they really believed that we were a country of rebels and that they were sent here to subdue us.

Speaker 1:          31:35          Right? Again. Now Adam's is propagandizing so he's always saying things with a sort of extra twist. But what he's saying is it was very clear that when the troops arrived, they were treating us like lowly rebels and that they were sent here to subdue us. Okay. So given all of these feelings, fears about a tyrannical standing army vets and saw that sort of system of tyranny, it makes sense that when these troops arrive in Boston relations are not going to be good between people in Boston and soldiers in Boston, which brings us to get another sort of bell ringing revolutionary war moment. Um, a particularly note worthy active resistance in Boston later memorialized by clever colonial propagandists as the Boston massacre, right? That's how we know it today. They gave it, Collins gave it that name. It's, it's, it's a snappy name, right? We kept that name.

Speaker 1:          32:21          We liked that name. It really has some zing. Makes a political point. So let's look for a minute here at the details of the Boston massacre, partly because they're really interesting. As you'll see, it's just a really interesting incident. But also because I think if you look at how the colonists and the soldiers are interacting, it really will reveal something about the dynamic of colonial British relations at the time. Now first off, it's important to understand that the Boston massacre wasn't this little isolated moment of conflict between soldiers and citizens between 1768 and early 17, 70 tensions were building between the colonists and the troops. And in early 1770, there actually were a number, several different outbursts of hostility between townspeople and soldiers in Boston. So an example on March 2nd Samuel Gray, a rope maker asked to passing soldier if he wanted a job. And when the soldier who was probably underpaid said, yeah, actually I could use as a second job.

Speaker 1:          33:26          Gray laughed and said, good, go clean my outhouse. This did not make the soldier happy. So the soldiers slugged grey and grey hit back and other people, soldiers ran out and other Collin, it's ran over and there was a fight. There was a street fight. A few days later, March 5th another fight broke out when another civilian said something insulting to another soldier and they began punching each other and there was another street fight and that would be the first in a series of increasingly agitated clashes on that day. March 5th, 1770 that's going to end in gunfire. But obviously the, the Boston massacre is not the first moment of conflict. Now later that evening, there's a series of little outbursts. That day, March 5th later that evening, a small boy walking out on the street began taunting a soldier and the soldier responded by knocking him down. Well, the boy got up, went off, found some other colonists in the street and complained that a soldier over their head knocked him down.

Speaker 1:          34:29          Okay, so in this environment that's going to really get a lot of colon, it's upset. So a little ring of people surrounds the kid like he's knocking down a kid, we need to go get the soldiers, right. So a small group of colonists heads off to the barracks to actually a cost the soldiers, but they're held off by guards. Soon thereafter someone begins ringing the bell of the Boston Meeting House. And normally when you ring the bell of the Boston Meeting House, that's a signal for fire and is a serious thing in a place full of wooden buildings, right? So if the bell is ringing, that means, oh my God, there's a fire and everyone does what they should do. When there's an alarm, a fire, right? The, the bell goes off and doesn't, it doesn't. It doesn't. Some people run into the street thinking that there's a fire. Now from this point we have several accounts are a number of cans about what happened.

Speaker 1:          35:17          Some of them conflict. And we're going to be looking at two accounts today. We're going to be looking at one by British General Thomas Gauge. I mentioned before, the commander in chief of the British army in America, he's posted in New York, but he had gotten a very detailed report about what happened in Boston from his soldiers, his officers and men on exactly what they think they experienced, and then the other account is by Samuel Adams. Radical propagandists. Clearly it's going to be a very different point of view. Okay, so gage sends a very detailed report to a member of the king's cabinet in London based on what the British soldiers in Boston told him, assuming that the colonists in general were insolent and we're pushing to get more than they deserved. Gage says in his statement, he suspects that the entire thing was deliberate. He thinks that there is some colonists who probably prearranged what happened.

Speaker 1:          36:11          Arm themselves with sticks, rocks, bricks and snowballs. I'm sorry if it snowballs. Just never sounds like a scary weapon to me. Even though bad things happen here, and I know I would not like to be hit with a snowball, but it's not like a brick. But that snowballs or everyone's complaining about snowballs and these accounts, you'll see somehow it just makes it seem less serious. I don't know why, but anyway, he thinks it's deliberate. He thinks the colon is prearranged. Did that they arm themselves with sticks, rocks, bricks and snowballs planned the ringing of the bell so that Bostonian's would rise up at the signal and attack the soldiers. Okay, so this is what gauge assumes, and here's gauges account. Many people came out of their houses supposing a fire in the town and several officers on the same supposition we're repairing to their posts, but meeting with mobs were reviled, attacked, and those who could not escape knocked down and treated with great in humanity.

Speaker 1:          37:01          Right? Those crude, nasty colonists are treating the soldiers very badly. Different mobs paraded through the streets, passing the several barracks and provoking the soldiers to come out. One body went to the main guard where every provocation was given without effect for the guard remained quiet from thence. The mob proceeded to a sentinel, a single sentinel posted upon the custom house at a small distance from the guard and attacked him. He defended himself as well as he could calling out for help. Okay. There's like one guy according to this account and like the mob attacks, the one guy standing in front of the Customs House and people ran to the guard to give information of his danger. So according to gauge, people see this one guy getting attacked by a bunch of people in. They actually colonists run to get other soldiers to help the one guy. So according to gauge his account, they're not all crazy radicals in Boston.

Speaker 1:          37:49          Some of them are out there helping us. Captain Preston hearing the sentinel was in danger of being murdered already. We got to murder really fast. He detached a sergeant and 12 men to relieve him and soon after followed himself to prevent any rash act on the part of the troops. This party, as well as the sentinel was immediately attacked. Some colonists throwing bricks, stones, pieces of ice and snowballs. Once again, the snowballs at them, whilst others advanced up to their band nets and endeavored to close with them to use their bludgeons and clubs calling out to them to fire if they dared and provoking them in the most appropriate language. Right? Again, rude colonists behaving badly, so we have a group of soldiers, they're lined up in front of the customs house running to protect a fellow soldier supposedly being murdered at the hands of a crude and angry mob armed with sticks and rocks and snowballs.

Speaker 1:          38:44          Okay, let's segue over to Adams. Adams writes a series of newspaper essays for the Boston Gazette describing the same incident, often quoting testimony from the trial of the soldiers that obviously it takes place after this incident, but also obviously quoting them and telling the story with his own radical flare. Now remember here the different reasons for these accounts, and this is actually a great example of the importance of thinking about the nature of historical evidence, who things are written to and why they're written has a lot to do with how you interpret them, right? You have these two documents being written for really specific reasons to a very specific audience. So gauge is trying to explain to royal authorities a shooting that never should have happened. He has to somehow justify this. So he's appealing to the people he sent the letter to whoever this world authority was and he has to assume that other world authorities are going to see it.

Speaker 1:          39:40          He's appealing to them as fellow sophisticated Englishman who understand the nature of things out in this sort of frontier, colony area, crude colonists, upset colonists. So in a sense gauge is offering sort of an extreme version of some typical English sentiment among about the colonies. Adams is riding to the colonial public and he's trying to raise a public outcry against the soldiers and obviously by association against the British administration. And clearly Adams is going to want it to pick these soldiers as cruel and tyrannical as all standing armies are. So when it sentence Adams, it's certainly going to be offering an extreme version of some colonial sentiment at the time about the soldiers and, and maybe about the British administration generally. Okay, so here is Adam's version. From the moment when the bell starts to ring, the ringing of the bells alarm, the town it being supposed by the people in general, there was a fire. As the people came into the street, the boy who had been knocked down told them that the century had knocked him down. Okay. And I'm actually quoting, so this you can't blame me for this. The boy says century knocked me down, points at the soldier and says, there is the son of a bitch that knocked me down. I love that. That detail is in the newspaper. And that's another one of those things that like they said that in 1770 they did. Um, other people heard this and cried, kill him.

Speaker 1:          41:08          The century ran to the custom house, steps knocked at the door but could not get in. Excuse me, they're going to kill me. He primed and loaded his gun and leveled it and told the people to stand off and call to the main guard. Various where the dispositions and inclinations of the people at this point, the cooler sort advise to go home. The curious, we're willing to stay and see the event and those whose feelings were warmer, perhaps partook of the boys resentment. And here he's trying to justify like, okay, there was some crazy radical guys, but they were probably upset with the boy, right? They weren't really angry. They were just, of course they'd be upset. The boy was attacked. The soldiers moved to help the century standing alone before the mob, Adam said the soldiers moved quote with a hottie air. They push their band nets and dammed the people as they went along.

Speaker 1:          41:55          And when they arrived at their post, one witness who is a young gentlemen of a liberal education and an unspotted character declared that one of the soldiers whom he particularly named loaded his gun, pushed him with his band and damned him. Ooh, okay. So here, according to Adams, there's this route imperious British soldier treating the young gentleman of a liberal education and unspotted character, like a lesser being. Okay, so now both narrators have gotten us to the same point. We have soldiers lined up, they've just very visibly loaded their guns in front of them stands British. Captain Preston with WHO's in command of the men and in front of Preston is an angry crowd. So according to gauge at this point, Preston soldiers behind him, crowd in front of him, he's, he's trying to calm the situation down and supposedly he's asked, are you going to ask those soldiers to fire on us and presences?

Speaker 1:          42:48          Yeah. See, the guns are behind me and you're in front of me. No, really wouldn't be a good idea for them to fire now because I'll die, right? He's like, no, it's a good point, I think. But all he could say had no effect. And one of the soldiers receiving a violent blow instantly fired captain Preston turned round to see who fired and received a blow upon his arm, which was aimed at his head. And the mob at first seeing no execution done and imagining the soldiers had only fired powder to frighten them, grew more bold and attacked with greater violence, continually striking at the soldiers. He didn't get their guns and pelting them and calling out to them to fire. And we have captain Preston, his description of what he heard from the crowd. He says the crowd was yelling, come on you rascals.

Speaker 1:          43:31          Bloody backs, lobster, scoundrels, great little string of insults. Fire. If you dare, you dare not fire. Okay, so gauge goes on. The soldiers at length perceiving their lives in danger and hearing the word fire all around them. Three or four of them fired one after another. And again, three more in the hurry and confusion. Four or five persons were unfortunately killed, unfortunately and more wounded. Okay, so that's basically the end of gauges account. Clearly in his account, the soldiers are under serious attack. Adam's tells a different story. Adam says, yes, the crowd was yelling at the troops, but they had insulted the crowd and loaded their guns. Yes, they had sticks, but everybody was carrying sticks these days because everyone was scared of the soldiers. So everyone naturally walked around in the streets with sticks. Now. Maybe that's true. Which tells you a lot about the streets of Boston, or maybe it's not, in which case it's really creative.

Speaker 1:          44:23          Yes, the crowd, he hit it, the soldiers guns, but they were trying to push them away. So Adam said it's not an uncontrolled mob. It's actually a group of people carrying their normal everyday sticks pushing in to here. Captain Preston answered the question about whether or not he was going to order the troops to fire at this moment. Adam says, one of the soldiers was hit by a stick, staggered fired his gun at the crowd upon which several soldiers fired and says Adams, they reloaded their guns. They were gonna fire again. Some of the crowd moved away. One man went up to a soldier and asked him to his face if he was going to fire. And supposedly the soldier said yes by the eternal God, at which point the colonist knocked him down. I love all the detail at this point, press and called out to his men not to fire and they stopped.

Speaker 1:          45:07          And here Adam says, I am no soldier and never desired to be one. But I appeal to those who are, whether the words don't fire our words of command and the British army, one of, there's not some other word which soldiers are taught to understand more proper to be given on such an occasion, which would have prevented such Rashma. So here he's saying the guy didn't even call out like cease fire. He said, don't stop. Great. Thank you Captain Preston. And then Adam's describes the people who died. He makes special note of the fact that gray, the rope maker who insulted the century by asking him to clean the outhouse is killed in the clash. Coincidence or murder Adams is good, right? And so here Adams is tossing out the suggestion that maybe the troops were just looking for an excuse to fire on the townspeople and I'm really get that nasty gray plotting maybe.

Speaker 1:          45:58          And the British too, as you've heard, are wondering if maybe this is a plot on the part of the colonists. Maybe they're actually just trying to rob the customs house. And this whole thing was an elaborate ploy by the colonist just to rob the customs house behind the guard. So you can really see from these two accounts and from the details contained within them, the animosity and the sense of alienation between the colonists and the soldiers on both sides. And you can also see really dramatically the fears on both sides, that there's some kind of a plot. There's some kind of a plot of resistance or tyranny depending on which side you're on. Somehow this is organized and it's not good, and it has to be stopped. And both sides have come to that same point. And I will stop there and we will continue next week onto the logic of resistance.
