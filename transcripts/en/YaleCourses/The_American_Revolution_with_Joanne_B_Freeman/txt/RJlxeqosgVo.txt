Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. So a quick review of what we covered on Thursday in the first of these two lectures in which I'm going to be talking about the war and hopefully as you hopefully remember, we began by talking about the British and the logic of their actions during the war. And I talked for a little while about a number of their logistical disadvantages, like um, problems getting supplies and then dragging them all over the American countryside. Like the large expanse of land that the British confronted. That was one big battlefield in a sense. The ways in which some kind of traditional battle strategies, war strategies didn't necessarily work so well in this campaign. And along the same lines that they were different kinds of challenges that the British faced in fighting against a citizen army. Um, I talked about how Britain couldn't turn its back on the rest of the world, particularly France.

Speaker 1:          01:10          They had to keep an eye on what France was doing in France is you're going to see in today's lecture is going to play a large role. And then finally I talked about the simple fact that for the British to when they needed to stamp out a widespread rebellion over large expansive land, while the Americans didn't necessarily have to defeat the British to emerge victorious, they just had to keep fighting long enough to exhaust British supplies and funding and energies. And I also mentioned, um, a few mistaken assumptions on the part of the British, like the way that they consistently underestimated the Americans. And then along similar lines, the ways in which they consistently overestimated the amount of loyalist support that they were expecting to find in the colonies. And I spent time in Thursday's class going into those kinds of details before talking about phases of war and strategies and things like that because they help us to understand the logic of British military strategies throughout the war.

Speaker 1:          02:16          I think it's really easy to look back on any historical event, but I think it's particularly true for the American revolution that leads to the American founding. It's easy to look back and blame the loser for making dumb mistakes, but they were really logical reasons for what the British did during this campaign. And that's part of what I'm trying to bring out in last week's lecture and in today's lecture that there were logical, logistical reasons why they did what they did. There are equally logical reasons as to why the war ultimately had the outcome that it did. Um, but all of those things that I talked about in the last lecture at the start show how the British were acting under pretty challenging circumstances and they were guiding their decisions and doing whatever they decided to do based on whatever information and insight and tradition they had at hand.

Speaker 1:          03:04          So their actions have a logic. And I, I bring that up at the start of this lecture because it's part of what I've been doing overall in this class over the course of the semester. And that is throughout whatever I've been lecturing about. Um, I've tried to explain the logic and reasoning behind people's choices and decisions to give you a view of unfolding events from the viewpoints of people who were there. Now, of course, it's just inherently interesting to look at historical events from the viewpoint of people who are there. So that's part of the reason why I do this because it's interesting and it's fun and I find it fascinating, but more important, I actually take this approach because I want to emphasize the idea that the revolution wasn't inevitable. It wasn't an inevitable event, it wasn't a good revolt against bad people. It was actually a product of individual choices, individual actions on all sides.

Speaker 1:          04:01          And that's ultimately what history is all about, right? It's about people making choices and then taking action. And particularly in the case of the American founding period, I think it's an important thing to remember because it's easy to forget that the revolution and its aftermath warrant inevitable or inherently right? And it has to do with our nation's founding. So it's natural to sort of assume those things. But neither one of those things helps us to really understand what was unfolding as the revolution unfolded. So basically in all of my classes, I always try to counter this sort of seeming inevitability of things in the founding period by really trying to recreate the logic of decisions at that time in that moment. So that's part of why I've been focusing in that way throughout the semester. But okay, back to the decisions of the revolution. Um, and Thursday's lecture, the bulk of my lecture on Thursday was spent discussing three of the four faces of the revolution.

Speaker 1:          04:59          Um, and again, hopefully you remember I defined these phases based on shifts in British strategy at various points. So the British would shift their strategy, the Americans would respond, and then that phase would continue until there'd be a new shift in a new response. Um, just to review very briefly here, the first phase lasted until roughly July of 1776 and was largely guided on the part of the British by the assumption that just a little coercion and maybe a little sign of reconciliation would be all of the Americans needed to sort of push them into backing away and would bring matters to a close. That phase lasted through July, 1776 and at that point the British stepped up their strategy by deciding to seize New York, seemingly one of the major cities in the colonies. And again, by sort of traditional war standards, you get a major city, you turn the tide of war.

Speaker 1:          05:55          Plus the British were hoping that if they could sort of separate new England from the rest of the colonies, they might isolate the troublemakers up in New England. And again, maybe that would draw things to a close. Um, in part at that point, the British were underestimating the intercolonial and inter regional bonds that were beginning to be forged throughout the conflict thus far. And they also were over estimating what it would mean along those same lines to isolate New England. So that strategy obviously didn't end things which leads us to the third phase which began in 1777 and that phase largely consisted of the British trying to subdue the middle colonies now states by 1777 again, sort of the basic assumption being keep going for those major cities and if we get enough of those major cities, they're going to have to cave. So now Philadelphia and Pennsylvania become major targets in this third phase.

Speaker 1:          06:53          And then I ended the lecture by talking about America's shocking victory at the battle of Saratoga, which ended up being a real turning point in the war. And I'm going to go a little bit more into that reasons why that's the case today. But I do want to mention at the, at the very end, after I finished my lecture on Thursday, a few people came up to me with questions about precisely how the Americans won at Saratoga. Cause I just sort of generally talked about problems with supplies and then the Americans won. And a few people had questions. Well, what actually really happened? So I'll offer just a little bit more detail here to give you a sense of how it is that the Americans came to have this unexpected victory. So remember at that point, British General Howe is headed off to Philadelphia as part of the major sort of, um, attempt of that third phase of the war.

Speaker 1:          07:42          So General John per going is up north with his army and Lo and behold, part of the continental army under her ratio gates general Horatio gates, attacks Burgoyne and gates, part of the army is joined by another part of the continental army, led by General Benjamin Lincoln. Also militia men from nearby areas individually and in groups began heading to Saratoga when they sort of got a sense that something major was happening there. So by October 7th of 17, 77, there were roughly 11,000 American troops all told facing roughly 5,000 British troops under Burgoyne. So now we're going isn't a little bit of trouble. And how couldn't help him because he's down in the south somewhere. And for a little while for going thought that there might be another group of British soldiers led by Sir Henry Clinton coming to save the day. Clinton and his men did not come to the rescue.

Speaker 1:          08:44          So per going is in trouble. And to give you just a little sense of what I'm talking about here, um, here's a quote from a British lieutenant who actually took part in the battle and he writes that on October 7th in his regiment, quote, our Canon, we're surrounded and taken the men and horses being all killed, which gave them the Americans additional spirits and they rushed on with loud shouts when we drove them back a little way with so great a loss to ourselves, it evidently appeared to retreat was the only thing left for us. Okay? So that's a British soldier taking part describing massive deaths. The Americans get cheered by what's happening and sort of surge. And the British come to the realization that they're going to have to retreat. So Americans ultimately wage a war on the actual fort at Saratoga and ultimately breach the fort and per going withdrew his army to the heights of Saratoga.

Speaker 1:          09:39          He lost roughly 600 men, which was about four times the number of Americans that are killed in that battle. And that's the moment where we're going meets with his chiefs of Staff and decides that at this point what they need to do is actually surrender. And I mentioned at the very end of Thursday's lecture, the surrender ceremony when both sides were sort of so shocked at what was unfolding that they, everyone was sort of quiet and the Americans sort of had their eyes down supposedly because they couldn't quite believe what was happening in front of them. Now I'm going to mention one last fact regarding Saratoga that I just sort of stumbled across today actually. But I thought it was really interesting because it relates back to my earlier point about the British overestimating the amount of loyal support that they had in America after he lost the battle.

Speaker 1:          10:28          We're going ends up going back to England and he ends up getting examined by parliament to explain exactly what happened at Saratoga. That must've been really fun for Burgoyne. And here are just one or two sentences from his testimony before parliament. He said with the Tories have risen, why did they not rise round Albany and below it? At the time they found Mr. Gates army increasing Mr. Gates, not general gates army. A critical insurrection from any one point of the compass within distance to create a diversion would probably have secured the success of the campaign. So there is, we're going talking to parliament and saying, where were the Tories? Like just a little action. Some diversion on the part of American Tory's might've saved the day, but where were they? I didn't. They weren't there. So he's puzzled and he's partly blaming that for what happened at Saratoga. So the victory at Saratoga accomplished important things militarily.

Speaker 1:          11:27          Of course, psychologically it was a tremendous victory for the Americans after a series of somewhat less inspiring battle moments. But in many ways, the most important impact of the battle of Saratoga was on the world stage because when news of the battle reached Europe in December of 1777 it gave some credibility to the American cause, particularly in France, which the Americans had already been eyeing as a potential source of support during the war, and that makes sense. Given Francis Longstanding and muddy to England, it makes perfect sense that the Americans think, hm, maybe even the French, you're going to come eight us as we're fighting against their longtime enemy. Now, Franklin, Benjamin Franklin was in Paris at this point when the news begins to reach Europe, he is serving as an American ambassador and while he's in France, he proved that among his many talents, he had an amazing talent at self promotion because although he was an extremely cultured American, he was incredibly shrewd at playing the American in Paris.

Speaker 1:          12:39          Basically he knew what the French sort of expected Americans to be like and they thought Americans are going to be the sort of simple, pure, virtuous, natural backwoods been. So there's Franklin, he's in the splendor, the grand splendor of the French court, and he dressed really, really simply. And many of you have probably seen this image. He always wore this sort of for cap. Like, I just went out and killed myself on animal and now I'm wearing this hat, you know, like, yeah, I'm a backwoods philosopher, was basically the role he was playing was the sort of amazing, rustic, natural backwoods American philosopher. He continually presented himself in that way, which really stood out among all the splendor of the French court. And the French absolutely adored it. He became a sort of fad of the French court. There were countless portraits and images made of him.

Speaker 1:          13:31          He was put on dishes. He was put on medallions, uh, as Franklin himself, put it in my face is now almost as well known, is that of the moon, right? They just adored him in France. Apparently Franklin also knew how to enjoy himself and France because a little later in the war, one of Washington's aids was sent to France to control Franklin. Sort of keep him from having a little bit too much fun. Um, let's just say that Franklin who was in his seventies at this point, so he's, you know, advanced in age, Franklin liked the ladies and the ladies liked Franklin and particularly given that he was the fad of the court, I think Franklin had a very enjoyable time in Paris. And so Washington, one of Washington's aids actually gets sent to sort of babies had Benjamin Franklin. Now all of this adulation of Franklin irked John Adams.

Speaker 1:          14:22          Surprise, surprise. John Adams really sort of on some fundamental level thought that he, he deserves some too. And Franklin was so beloved, it really proved irksome to Adams. He had kept a diary and in the diary he tend to do record adulation moments of Franklin. Like here's another one of those darn moments where they just loved this guy. Um, and I want to offer one just so you can get a sense of what this would have been like. I guess both for Adams and Franklin. Um, this is from Adams diary from his journal from April 29, 1778 and this is what Adam's writes. After dinner we went to the Academy of Sciences Voltaire. And Franklin were both present and they're presently arose. A general cry that Miss Your Voltaire, I Miss Your Franklin should be introduced to each other. This was done and they bowed and spoke to each other.

Speaker 1:          15:11          This was no satisfaction. There must be something more. Neither of our philosophers seem to divine what was wished or expected. They, however, it took each other by the hand, but this was not enough. The clamor continued until the explanation came out. It'll Folsom plus Aalf ponces right? They have to, they have to embrace themselves. French style, the two aged actors upon this great theater of philosophy and frivolity then embraced each other by hugging one another in their arms, kissing each other's cheeks, and then the tumbled subsided. So there's Franklin sort of everyday existence in Paris, which was pretty extreme. So Franklin is, they're living it up in Paris. He's there when news of Saratoga reaches France on hearing the News, France decides ultimately that they're going to formally recognize America as an independent nation. Obviously with Franklin and Adams and others helping things along, and upon recognizing America as an independent nation, the French went one step further and agreed to enter the war as allies to the Americans.

Speaker 1:          16:17          So obviously Saratoga happens, the news gets to Europe, France hears it, and those are two major developments. France recognizes American independence. France joins the war on the side of the Americans. With this agreement, this really major two agreements for the first time, there seemed to be a remote possibility that the Americans might actually have a chance of being victorious. This is a major, major ally that's just signed up on the American side. Not only did the French bring credibility to the American cause, but of course they also brought military supplies and most important of all is we're going to see a little later in the lecture they brought the French navy. America at this point is still figuring out how to have a navy. So having the French navy was of huge importance. Now it's important to note at this point that it's not the dynamic here isn't that the French were so inspired by the nobility of the American cause that they decided they would join the war with the Americans there.

Speaker 1:          17:21          That is true for some French individuals. I'll talk a little bit more later on in the lecture about the Marquis de Lafayette. He's one of a number of people who actually were inspired by the American cause. But as a nation, the French were particularly eager to help the Americans because they assumed that after the war they might be able to take over much of the lucrative trade with America that the British had controlled before. So basically joining America in this war effort was an investment now that they thought would probably pay off later. And of course add to that the fact that by aligning themselves with the Americans, they're now fighting their long term, long time enemy, the British. So that makes it an attractive proposition as well. So in February of 1778 France signed two treaties with America. The first was the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, the Treaty of Amity. And comers that said that France recognized the United States as a sovereign nation.

Speaker 2:          18:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:31          It also said that France had trading privileges with America as a favored nation, but America preserved the right of free trade. Second, France signed the Treaty of alliance

Speaker 1:          18:46          that would go into effect if war erupted between England and France because of the first tree, which indeed it did five months later. So basically the first tree of Amity and Commerce is signed. Britain and France now decide they're warring and then Francis. Okay. Now the Treaty of alliance is going into effect. We are now officially allied with America. The stated purpose of the Treaty of alliance was to assure the quote, liberty, sovereignty and independence, absolute and unlimited of the United States, France renounced claims to the mainland of North America, east of the Mississippi, or to the Bermuda islands if captured by America. In return, France asks the United States to recognize whatever France might capture in the West indies. In other words, a France capture some British islands in the West indies. America says, fine, we'll recognize that for sure. America was given a free hand to conquer Canada. Yay. Conquer Canada could think we got that in the treaty. And then, um, both sides agreed not to negotiate for peace without consent of the other.

Speaker 1:          20:02          So now you've got Britain and France in war against one another. And with that, the American revolution becomes something of a world war because Spain and the Dutch ultimately join on the side of the French. So now Europe and European powers and their own disputes also ended up playing a role in who siding with who during the revolution. Now it's really important to note at this point that with the involvement of other European nations, and particularly with the involvement of France, America became far less of a central concern to the British who now felt compelled to send thousands of soldiers to the west to guard against French invasion, which means that less manpower was available to fight in the United States, the West indies, or what at the time that would have been known as the sugar islands where the truly great prizes as far as colonies were concerned, they were greater prizes than the North American colonies.

Speaker 1:          21:08          That's where the real money was in, in the sugar islands. So some British manpower very naturally went right to the indies to protect British properties from the French. At this point, feeling a little desperate because of the French American alliance. The British actually make one last stab at reconciliation. They're persistent though. As we'll see in a few minutes. They made some misjudgments that ultimately did not achieve the success of this attempt. On February 17th, 1778 lord north proposed in the House of Commons be conciliatory propositions. The conciliatory propositions, February 17th, 1778 and the propositions called for the repeal of all of the acts that Americans had found obnoxious. Right? Okay, well take it all back. No standing army in time of peace in the colonies. No changes in colonial charters unless colonial assemblies request them. England would agree to consider American representation in parliament or if American's preferred to recognize the American Congress as a permanent institution.

Speaker 1:          22:26          Right? Suddenly England's like, okay, we'll take back all the things you hate if we just end this now based on those propositions, a conciliatory propositions, a British commission was sent to America with instructions to deal with the continental Congress by this point in a sense. Um, it's also could be called the confederation Congress, but I'll talk more about the confederation later on. Um, to deal the continental congress as if it was a legal body. But Congress refused to appoint commissioners to meet with a British commissioners. Instead, they considered the propositions on their own in Congress and then sent a letter with their response to the British commissioners as Henry Lawrence, who's the president of the congress at the time. Put it in this letter, the acts of the British parliament, the commission for your sovereign right, your sovereign, not our sovereign and your letter. Suppose the people of the states to be subjects of the crown of Great Britain and her founded on the idea of dependence, which is utterly inadmissible.

Speaker 1:          23:30          And Lawrence then went on to add that, you know, if the British wanted, the Americans would be happy to talk about peace if the king would either admit American independence or withdraw all of his forces from America. So it's a British are ready to do that. The Americans say we're willing to talk to you otherwise, no, there were not willing to admit that we're dependent on you in any way. This is utterly inadmissible. Take them back. So clearly it's too late for what could have been some pretty radical propositions at this point. We come to the misjudgments because the British commission made the fatal error when they realize that that angle wasn't going to work. They tried to bribe some high ranked American officials, including George Washington, who they offered to make a Duke. If George Washington would agree to their terms as one of the commissioners put it, Washington is certainly to be bought honors, we'll do it.

Speaker 1:          24:25          And I'm assuming that you know the commission somewhere or others thinking back to Washington and the French and Indian war and he's an ambitious guy and he actually wants military honors. So the British were thinking we can buy him, like show them a couple honors. He's an ambitious guy. We've got him. They also attempted to bribe Franklin as well. Again, showing some misjudgment on the part of the British towards either one of those men. Um, and also assuming clearly how wonderfully attractive British honors would be, that they would easily seduced either one of these two men. Neither one of them was attracted to this British honors. We're not going to sway them from their cause. So not surprisingly, both sides of this British effort where a complete flop.

Speaker 2:          25:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          25:11          Now we're about to advance to the fourth and final phase of the war. But I do want to mention something else that happened in the winter of 1777 before I move on to this fourth phase. And that is the, uh, the American armies and camp men at valley forge.

Speaker 2:          25:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          25:31          They're Americans for time, had really serious problems getting supplies and these supplies are always a problem generally, partly because the congress, the continental Congress does not have a way of insisting on anything. I mentioned back when we talked about organizing a war, the continental congress was not very strong, couldn't demand things from the states, could just ask, so supplies, organizing supplies was a problem, but at valley forge they became a serious problem. Even just basic supplies like food, partly because of the weakness of the continental congress as well as a simple lack of organization and actually some graft as well. So men were starving some of them half naked, some froze to death, hundreds of horses starve to death. The army didn't dissolve or mutiny at this point, which actually says something, but the experience of valley forge suggested to some of the men at Washington's headquarters that there were problems with the weakness of the continental congress.

Speaker 1:          26:31          And I'm going to come back to this lesson in future lectures when we begin to talk about the articles of confederation and the lead up to the constitutional convention because the experience of Revolution taught some people are led, some people to believe that they had learned some hard lessons about what wasn't present there as what were during the war as far as the government was concerned and led them to believe something stronger needed to be there. So in some ways, um, working at Washington's headquarters during the war, it was like a little nationalist creating machine where people at the center who saw how things were so hard to organize because of the weakness of the continental congress. Many of those people ended up believing that there needed to be a stronger government after the war that will come in future lectures. Okay. That brings us to the fourth and final phase of the war.

Speaker 1:          27:22          It's the southern campaign. The southern campaign lasted from 1779 to 1781 and this phase is marked by a decision on the part of the British to transfer their attention to the south, hoping that by possessing ports of the south closer to the West indies, they can maybe maneuver there fighting better. They can keep their eye on, was ever have whatever's happening in the indies. They can also fight the Americans in the south as well. Here the British again made a faulty assumption because they assumed that the south would be an easy target because they assumed that there'd be a large reservoir of loyalist support, so they really assumed they would seize key southern ports. There'd be all these loyalists there to help them and then they would move their way back north, taking one region after another as they worked their way north. So the British sailed to the Carolinas.

Speaker 1:          28:21          They took Charles town, South Carolina, which was the most important city south of Philadelphia. They then left behind British general Charles Co Cornwallis with kind of a mopping up crew in the south while the rest of the army began to move north to attack the rest of the continental army. Between 1779 and 1781, there was a series of battles between the Americans and the British in the south. American suffered defeat after defeat. They persisted, but they were not winning these battles. The British one, Georgia, they already had Charleston and then the British began to pursue the Americans into Virginia and that's where the Americans began to rally. Now, in part, this is due once again to supply problems. This time for the British army, um, for Cornwallis, the British supply lines were stretched to their maximum and continued fighting was beginning to take a real toll on Cornwallis his forces who suffered worse losses than were expected, particularly considering they hadn't really expected much in the way of losses at all.

Speaker 1:          29:33          Also, loyalists remained largely silent in the south, partly because the British didn't really treat them very well. The British didn't do anything to court loyalists and the south. The British ruled captured areas in the south under martial law and made no allowances for loyalists. They didn't grant any power to loyalists. So basically they did nothing to solicit loyalist support, and thus they didn't get much loyalists support. So Cornwallis is following the American army. He limps into Virginia with a supply problem. And while the British army is in Virginia, they plundered George Washington's plantation. Mount Vernon just for like a little zing, you know. Well, as long as we're here, let's attack Mount Vernon. Um, they took slaves as they left George Washington's plantation manager, Lund Washington, to protect the plantation to prevent further damage being done. Actually went on board a British vessel in a nearby harbor and served the British RefreshMints right.

Speaker 1:          30:44          So please don't attack Mount Vernon and maybe you'll even give us back our slaves. And I'm bringing food. Have some cookies. I don't know what they brought, but they forgot. Refreshmints um, this did not please George Washington at all as he wrote to Lund Washington to go on board their vessels, carry them refreshments. Commune with a parcel of plundering scoundrels and request a favor by asking the surrender of my negroes was exceedingly ill judged. It would have been a less painful circumstance to me to have heard that in consequence of your non compliance with their requests. They had burnt my house and laid the plantation in ruins. Not really good judgment on the part of London, Washington. Can you imagine like he, he's sort of on their, on the boat sort of hanging out with the British and he's clearly a relation of the guy leading the continental army.

Speaker 1:          31:41          It's like not good, not good, not good thinking on the part of London, Washington, but so Cornwallis is in Virginia. He forms a new base of action after he's plundered Mount Vernon. He forms the new base of action at Yorktown, Virginia near the coast, planning to fan out into Pennsylvania and Virginia. But just then August 30 1781 a French fleet under French Admiral de Grasse arrived at the Virginia coast with troops. And as we're about to see, this ends up being a really crucial turning point for what's happening in Virginia. And then ultimately for the war as a whole, Washington had troops on land in Virginia, but in the end it was the arrival of the French fleet in the harbor that really decided the battle because basically it's surrounded the British and they had no way to escape the troops, surrounded them on land. They probably would have tried to escape to their ships in the harbor, but now the French fleet was there making that impossible.

Speaker 1:          32:47          If the French fleet had arrived at the wrong time or in the wrong place, this plan would have collapsed and sort of miraculously, they actually get to the right place at the right time for the plan to really go into effect. So the arrival of the French really looks bad for the British and Cornwallis is low on supplies. He's also low on men at this point, and now he's trapped at Yorktown, trapped between American forces and the French fleet, which now put the British under siege. So Corn Wallace is roughly 7,000 men and there actually were some loyalists fighting there, so they didn't antagonize all the loyalists in the south. There was some fighting alongside the British at Yorktown. Cornwallis is roughly 7,000 men held off a siege of roughly 15,000 combined American and French troops for three weeks, which is actually a pretty amazing accomplishment, but ultimately Cornwallis was forced to surrender.

Speaker 1:          33:46          On October 17th, 1781 Cornwallis wrote a terse note to Sir Henry Clinton, who was then in command of the British forces in America. He wrote, quote, I have the mortification to inform Your Excellency that I had been forced to surrender the troops under my command by capitulation on the 19th incident as prisoners of war to the combined forces of America and France. Period. Mortified is a good word. He could not believe what had happened stunned by what happened in this battle and just the incredible drama of the moment. There are actually many, many, many eyewitness accounts of what was unfolding at Yorktown because people understood on all sides that something major was happening. People described during the formal surrender and October 19th the slow passage of the British troops past the eyes of the American troops who are lined up in two columns that stretched for half a mile. The British band played a tune titled the world turned upside down, which they surely felt it was.

Speaker 1:          34:54          Witnesses said that the British looked quote unsold Shirley. And I think what that means is according to another witness, they were very much in liquor. So I'm British, I'm mortified. Not just the Cornwallis, but they're mortified. And basically they were drunk. They couldn't quite believe that this was happening. Someone said that their ranks for broken in their step was irregular. Cornwallis was so mortified that he claimed to be sick and refuse to attend the surrender. And he sent a deputy to surrender his sword to Washington and Washington who's so good at sort of upholding the dignity of the cause, refuse to accept the sword from a deputy and had it delivered to his deputy. So that terms were equal. Washington's always good at this sort of symbolic gesture and Wa and then the British, as they were marching by the American troops, they had to lay down their arms under the terms of the surrender.

Speaker 1:          35:46          And when the British were told to lay down their arms, one witness noted that quote there, mortification could not be concealed. I am a witness that they performed this duty in a very anonymous or like manner and that many of the soldiers manifested a sullen temper throwing their arms on the pile with violence as if determined to render them useless. We're not to be surprised at the pride or the British officers is humbled on this occasion as they have always entertained an exalted opinion of their own military prowess and affected to view the Americans as a contemptible undisciplined rabble. Now here we come to some documents I want to mention just cause I discovered them years ago at the library of Congress and I found them so interesting at the time. Um, it's just something I would never had thought of before, which is the glory of doing research when you're a historian is you just never know what you're gonna find.

Speaker 1:          36:37          Um, and I was actually, I was at the library of Congress. Um, I was actually researching, um, dueling, right? So what, what I really wanted to know was supposedly Americans learned to duel by watching the French during the revolution and they think this is such a great idea. They take it themselves. Sounds dubious to me. But I was researching this to see if I could find any record of this. And I found these letters from between actually British commanders and French commanders during the surrender at Yorktown. And what was fascinating about them is that the British and the French are writing to each other. And what they're both basically saying in their letters is that the British are saying, okay, would you please tell the Americans to step out of the way? Because they don't know how to do a surrender. They don't know what they're doing.

Speaker 1:          37:23          And they're in the way like, just please French commander tell the Americans to step aside. Because they're pesky and they're amateurs and the French are basically writing back to the British and saying, yeah, we understand the Americans are in the way. You know, aren't they cute? Those little Americans, well we'll have the step off to the side like you and I, we know how to really have a real surrender. Don't worry. Like your knees will be tended to. So basically I found these letters in which the French and the English were treating each other as absolute equals and neither one was treating the Americans as equals on the same plane. And it really gives you a sense of how the French and the English were. These sort of long time old world war veterans who even though they were enemies really sort of understood and appreciated each other.

Speaker 1:          38:07          And the Americans are such little sort of pipsqueak newcomers, they're not even on the radar screen. So I thought that was fascinating to find the French and the English, not what I thought I would find. I was like, oh cool. Letters between the French and the British during Yorktown. Hey, wait a minute. The French are telling us to get out of the way. So it was interesting. It really gives you a sense of of sort of American status, relatively speaking, back in England, one witness was with Lord north when he received word of the loss at Yorktown and is this witness wrote north, took the news as he would have taken a shot in the breast for he opened his arms exclaiming wildly as he paced up and down Oh God. It is all over words, which he repeated many times under emotions of the deepest consternation and distress.

Speaker 1:          38:54          So at this point, England, which has already overtaxed, definitely sees no sign of victory on the horizon, decide to commence peace negotiations. Now clearly you can see how French aid had a major, major impact on what happened at Yorktown. And that's on the war in general. The French gave supplies, they gave men, they gave naval support, they gave moral support, they distracted the British in lots of ways. The French had a huge influence on the outcome of the war. Now, I noted earlier that French self-interest played some role in the decision of the French to join on the side of the Americans, but it is also worth noting that there were some Frenchman who came to the aid of America because they actually really did get swept up into the American revolutionary cause and they saw it as a justified fight for freedom in the marquis.

Speaker 1:          39:47          De Lafayette is maybe the most notable example of this. He was really young at the time. He was about 19 years old. He's a marquee, so he's clearly very wealthy. Um, and obviously he was really moved by what was going on in America. So he actually took a large ship, loaded it with men and supplies and sailed to America just to volunteer his ship, his men, his supplies, and himself. Here I am joining the American cause and he ended up being this really beloved figure in America. I mean, Washington really almost treated him like a son when you read letters, uh, that Washington rights and why, why she's not exactly a cozy kind of individual. Um, but clearly he had a lot of affection for Lafayette. But Americans in general really admired and appreciated Lafayette because he was sort of this starry eyed youth who sacrificed for the American cause for no reason.

Speaker 1:          40:39          He just appeared because he was swept into the cause. And between 1824 and 1825 right on the cusp of the 50th anniversary of the declaration of independence, Lafite had actually came back to America for the sort of triumphal tour you have to sort of visit old friends that he met with like Jefferson and Adams. And I think Andrew Jackson like, you know, by 1824 there's a weird conglomeration of people that he's meeting with. Um, but he went on a grand tour of all of America. He went to all of the 24 states and he think he was in his seventies at the time. So He's, he's pretty vigorous. Um, and he was celebrated. He was paraded all over the place. He had receptions where he sort of hung out, like ready to talk to Americans. Americans of all kinds would line up on the street just to see him, to watch parades go by to look at him, enter their city.

Speaker 1:          41:31          So he was beloved at the time. Then was sort of in a way maybe he sort of symbolized French assistance, the French alliance afterwards cause America Americans gave a lot of love to the Marquis de Lafayette. And it's important to note, I mean I'm mentioning Lafayette cause he's maybe the best known figure, but he's not the only freshmen who volunteered to come and fight for the American cause. And actually France is not the only country where people came voluntarily to join the American cause. So back to the French, the aid of the French clearly major, major factor in the American victory. And with the American victory at Yorktown in 1781 the British decided to commence peace negotiations. It is important to note that even though the British have now informally decided that they're going to start negotiating for peace, it doesn't mean that there was an instant cease fire in the war.

Speaker 1:          42:24          There was kind of a fuzzy period here in which there was still a sizable British armed force in America. The British hadn't officially declared surrender. Authorities in London told British forces that they should avoid battle unless attacked and they should begin to evacuate troops. But Yorktown was not really like the instant end of the revolution and there are still skirmishes and battles afterwards. For some time, people don't have any way of really knowing the war is over. There's still a British army there. It's not until June of 1782 that negotiations began in Paris. American sent a commission of Foreman, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, and Henry Laurens. Um, it's interesting to note that even now, okay, Yorktown surrender war over, we're going to have a peace negotiation. Even now, the British still hope that maybe there'd be some way to come to terms with the Americans that would still somehow leave America within the British empire.

Speaker 1:          43:28          They're really persistent. And it wasn't until John Jay arrived in Paris and he's a no nonsense sort of, you know, straight forward person. Jay Actually said, look, we're not going to proceed with peace negotiations unless independence is assumed. Guys. Like, okay, and this is not negotiable. We're independent. We're over. It wasn't until he really insisted that negotiations began and independence was really finally accepted as inevitable by the British. So Britain recognized American independence. They agreed to evacuate all royal troops from American soil. John Adams thinking of New England got American fishing rights off of the grand banks of Canada. Canada appears again. I'd like the fact that John Adams is there working for fishing rights. Look, yeah. Yeah. Independence. Fishing rights. Thank you. John Adams. Um, the American's promised that they would urge state legislatures to compensate loyalists for property loss during the war and agreed that British creditors be able to collect prewar debts.

Speaker 1:          44:33          Even though those two very nice things were agreed to by the Americans. In fact, neither one happened in a very reliable manner and created all sorts of problems because there are a lot of states that were just not really excited about compensating loyalists or about repaying the British. No mention was made of native Americans, many of whom had supported the British for really logical reasons, given their fears about the spreading domination of an independent American republic with settlers swallowing up land. And ultimately many Indian nation simply didn't recognize American claims of sovereignty over their territory for the Americans. Overall independence had been won, but at a high price and actually only the civil war produced a higher ratio of casualties to the nation's population. And still undecided at the close of the war were too obvious. Big major questions. What kind of society was America going to become and what kind of government with the new nation and it states possess.

Speaker 1:          45:40          These are two questions which are going to be talking about in lectures to come on Thursday, I'm going to talk about American society. And then we sort of segue into a discussion of people wondering exactly what's supposed to be happening, what kind of a national something is supposed to be governing over these states. Um, and that's gonna lead us up to why a constitutional convention actually made sense because it didn't make sense to everybody. And it took a while for it to make sense to anybody. So that's to come. Uh, I will conclude there and I will see you on Thursday.
