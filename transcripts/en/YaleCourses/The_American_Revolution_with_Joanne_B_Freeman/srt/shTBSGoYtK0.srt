1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,090
I'm looking out at all of these faces
and I'm assuming that many of you have

2
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:12,810
probably arrived here with some
preconceived notions about the American

3
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:13,321
revolution.

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,900
I'm assuming that at least some of you
are sitting there and in the back of your

5
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:20,250
mind you're thinking declaration of
independence, a bunch of battles.

6
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:21,420
George Washington,

7
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:26,220
a little bit of Paul revere thrown in
and all of those things are going to

8
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:27,570
appear in the course.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,550
But obviously the real American revolution
is a lot more complex than that.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,390
It's more than a string of
names and documents and battles.

11
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:40,770
And as a matter of fact, in many ways,
the American revolution wasn't just a war.

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,890
If you went back to the mid 18th century,

13
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:47,010
went back to the period of the revolution,
or maybe just after it,

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,910
and you ask people how they
understood what was happening.

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,070
Many of them would tell you that the war
was actually only a minor part of the

16
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:56,880
American revolution.

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,140
Some would tell you the war actually
wasn't the American revolution at all.

18
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,070
And you'll see, I should mention that
the syllabus is finally up online.

19
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:07,350
So it's therefore you.
Um,

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,020
but you will see when you look at the
syllabus that at the very start of it,

21
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:13,680
there are two quotes and I want to read
them here because they make this point

22
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:14,514
really well.

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,530
So the first quote is from a letter by
John Adams and he's writing to Thomas

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,130
Jefferson in 1815 and he's heard about
the attempt to write the history of the

25
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:23,911
American revolution.

26
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:28,911
So this is what Adams has to say about
that as to the history of the revolution.

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,880
My ideas may be peculiar,
perhaps singular,

28
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,720
but what do we mean by the revolution?
The war,

29
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,610
that was no part of the revolution. Okay,
there's the moment where you go hook.

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,830
It was only an effect
and consequence of it.

31
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,560
The revolution was in
the minds of the people.

32
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,130
And this was affected from 1760 to 1775
in the course of 15 years before a drop

33
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:58,170
of blood was drawn at Lexington.
Okay.

34
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:02,370
So there we have John Adams saying that
the war was actually no part of the

35
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:05,880
revolution. It's a pretty famous quote,
but it's a pretty interesting statement.

36
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,560
Now I want to, I want to mention here, um,

37
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,970
and it's very early in the course for me
to have more few into liking John Adams.

38
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:14,010
And I'm going to talk more about
John Adams and a few minutes,

39
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,130
but I won't mention here since
I've just read that quote. Um,

40
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,880
if partway through the semester you
decide you're just dying to read dead

41
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:26,880
people's mail, which is basically
what historians do for living, um,

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,500
a great volume to read is actually the
letters that Jefferson and Adams sent

43
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:33,630
back and forth to each other
over the course of their lives.

44
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,570
They've all been pulled together into
one volume and the best part of that

45
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:38,610
volume is the end section.

46
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,730
The letters in which these guys were
writing to each other in their old age.

47
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,330
So you have these two founder figures,
former presidents,

48
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,060
and they're just basically
letting it rip in these letters.

49
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:49,950
They're talking about everything.
They're talking about,

50
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,190
all the things actually you probably
wouldn't talk about normally our religion

51
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,460
politics, who they hate, who they like,

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,160
what they thought of the revolution,
what they thought their own presidency,

53
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:04,780
what they thought of the other guys
presidency, the top 10 founder funerals.

54
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:06,400
Actually there's a little section,
although it's,

55
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:09,280
I think it's the top three founder
funerals, but it's a weird,

56
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:12,790
really interesting range of stuff and
it's just these two people really excited

57
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:17,020
about the fact that they've retired and
all they need to do now is write to each

58
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:19,840
other and really get to know each other
better. So it's a, it's a great volume.

59
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:24,700
It's edited by Lester Kappan. Last name
is ca PPO, and if you're interested,

60
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,410
okay, so that quote I just read is
actually from that series of letters,

61
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,730
Adam saying that the war was no part
of the revolution. Adams does say,

62
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:35,680
well maybe my ideas are
a little bit peculiar,

63
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:40,180
but he's not the only one spouting that
kind of fun. So here's Benjamin Rush,

64
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,050
who I guess in a way you could
say it was doctor to the stars.

65
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:48,490
He's actually this renowned doctor from
the revolutionary and early national

66
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:51,820
period, and he had a lot of
high placed political friends.

67
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,970
So here's Benjamin Rush writing in 1787
there is nothing more common than to

68
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:04,360
confound the terms of the American
revolution with those of the late American

69
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:07,000
war.
The American war is over.

70
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,990
But this is far from being the
case with the American revolution.

71
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,070
On the contrary,

72
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,270
nothing but the first act of
this great drama is closed.

73
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,880
So there you have Benjamin Rush saying
that, boy, this is a common problem.

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,230
A lot of people mix up American revolution
with American war and they're not

75
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:30,400
just one in the same thing. The war
is over. The revolution goes on.

76
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:31,390
And Russia saying this,

77
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:35,920
even as late as 1787 it's four years
after the treaty that ended the war.

78
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,190
We're hitting into constitution
territory and to rush.

79
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,180
The revolution is continuing.
So what do these people mean?

80
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,280
Well,

81
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,840
in part they are expressing part of what
this class is going to be exploring.

82
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,190
They're basically suggesting that the
American revolution represented an

83
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:58,900
enormous change of mindset
as loyal British colonists.

84
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,040
Right,
long standing,

85
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:05,041
loyal British colonists were transformed
gradually into angry revolutionaries

86
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,510
and ultimately into Americans.

87
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,090
Like John Adams suggests the beginnings
of this transformation predate the

88
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:16,390
actual fighting and like
Benjamin Rush suggests,

89
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,030
it doesn't just come to a close
when you sign a peace treaty.

90
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,380
So when you look at things
from this broad view,

91
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,450
the revolution actually
becomes the beginning of a
period in which the American

92
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:30,580
nation was really inventing itself,

93
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,260
and this is a really dramatic kind
of invention. You have an a sense,

94
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:36,810
we're just little
pipsqueaks at this point.

95
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,000
So you have these little pips weeks
and they're actually saying, okay,

96
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:44,320
we reject monarchy. We're going to
turn towards a democratic republic.

97
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,311
They're saying,
yeah,

98
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,130
well we know the power has been
at the imperial center forever.

99
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,880
We're going to turn our backs on that
and pull power into what's basically the

100
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:54,160
margins of the British empire.

101
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,880
They're turning away from an assumption.
The few are in power, and they're saying,

102
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:01,790
well,
what if we try putting the many in power?

103
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,540
Those are pretty dramatic changes
and they aren't. Of course,

104
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:10,490
the only changes people, colonists began
to think about themselves differently.

105
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,150
It's really easy to underestimate the
degree to which individual colonies at

106
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:20,390
that time were really like little
independent nation state colonies.

107
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,750
They were not United in
any sense of the term.

108
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,620
There wasn't any tradition of colonies
being able to communicate between each

109
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,454
other.

110
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,420
It was actually in some ways easier to
communicate with the mother country then

111
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,990
to get some kind of news up
and down the Atlantic seaboard.

112
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,250
Colonist often knew more about the mother
country than they knew about people

113
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:44,090
from other colonies. They, when you
look at correspondence from this period,

114
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,630
people often refer like New Orleans where
we'll refer to southerners as though

115
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:51,820
there are people from a strange alien
country who have weird excellence.

116
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,830
It's hard to know what they say.
They dress so strangely.

117
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,470
It's amazing to think
about the differences,

118
00:06:57,471 --> 00:07:02,471
the degree to which colonies really
stood alone in this time period and this

119
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:07,430
idea that there really is pretty much
no reason to assume that these colonies

120
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:08,690
would have been able to join together.

121
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,900
That's pretty much going to be in the
first two or three lectures of the course.

122
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,220
What we talk about as we try and get a
sense of who these colonists are and how

123
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:18,500
they're ending up moving
their way into a revolution.

124
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:24,970
So this scattered group of independent
colonists gradually came together to form

125
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,440
one United nation. Not
the goal, but the outcome.

126
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,350
Given everything that I just said,

127
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:37,280
you can see why this idea that there
might be a United nation is actually a

128
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:38,780
pretty big surprise.

129
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,110
You can see why a lot of people
assume that it could never work.

130
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:47,030
You can actually also assume why a lot
of people might not even have liked it as

131
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:52,031
an idea and you can even see why after
the constitution goes into effect and the

132
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:55,580
government is getting underway.
Even then,

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,850
people were really just not sure this
thing was going to work. They really,

134
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:00,530
they referred to it as an experiment,

135
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,270
which is really how they viewed it and
it's amazing when you look at letters

136
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,540
from the 1790s you'll see like these
little throwaway comments like a,

137
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,710
if this government lasts more than five
years, here's what I think we should do.

138
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,700
Okay there it's a completely weird mindset
and it's not something that we would

139
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:24,020
assume is there, but this is pretty
much a high stakes experiment.

140
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:30,130
So this class is going to explore this
big shift in mindset and the war will be

141
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:36,830
at the center of this shift and it's going
to do this from a participant's point

142
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,580
of view.

143
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,580
It's going to really grapple with how
things made sense at the time to the

144
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:46,160
people who were there. And I'm going to
go more into that in a minute or two.

145
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,060
I want to talk for just a second about
how the course is organized and have just

146
00:08:51,061 --> 00:08:53,180
for a minute or two about some
of the readings for the course.

147
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,570
The course is partly
chronological and partly thematic.

148
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,460
So we do proceed along. We follow the
narrative of events of how things evolved.

149
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,680
All those nasty act people protesting
have a war to try to figure out what to do

150
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:12,230
after the war. We do follow
that sort of trajectory. Um,

151
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,920
but we're also gonna once in a while,

152
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:18,540
step back and look at the big picture
so that we're not just following events.

153
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:22,620
We're going to be always putting events
in context and the readings for the

154
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:24,690
course going that same direction.

155
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,980
We're going to read Gordon Woods
radicalism of the American revolution,

156
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,390
which is a really great overview of
this time period and also presents an

157
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:33,901
argument.

158
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:37,050
Obviously if you could tell from the
title that the revolution was really

159
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:37,860
radical.

160
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,280
Some people agree with
that and some disagree and
actually one of the discussion

161
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,130
sections is geared around
discussing that very idea.

162
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,800
And by the end of the course you'll
probably have some pretty strong ideas,

163
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,420
not necessarily agreeing with mine,

164
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,000
but based on what you've read and
what I've said and what you thought,

165
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,600
you'll probably have some strong ideas
about how radical was the American

166
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:56,290
revolution.
Um,

167
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,300
we're going to be reading Robert Gross
is the minute men and their world,

168
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:02,490
which you can hear is right along
the lines of what I was just saying.

169
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:06,360
It really gives you a sense of what it
was like at the time for people who ended

170
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:11,190
up doing things like fighting at Lexington
and Concord. We're going to read,

171
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,010
um,
Bernard Bailyn's faces of revolution,

172
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,440
which includes an array of chapters on
different people who played a major role

173
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,240
in the revolution as well as chapters on
the ideals on the ideology or basically

174
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:27,700
the logic of American independence.
And um,

175
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,180
Bailyn is really well known as sort of,

176
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,380
he wrote this amazing book on the ideology
of the American revolution and what

177
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:36,490
you're going to be reading.
He basically took the,

178
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:39,090
a big meaty chunk from that book,

179
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,680
the part that everybody really focuses
on and put it in this book faces of

180
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:44,160
Revolution Revolution.

181
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,090
So we will be reading that as well as
part of the readings for the course.

182
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,760
We're also going to be reading
Ray Raphael's a people's
history of the American

183
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:57,510
revolution, which does just what
the title would suggest it does.

184
00:10:57,511 --> 00:11:01,020
It looks at how different kinds of people,
native Americans,

185
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,210
average rebels, African
African-americans, loyalists, women,

186
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,760
how all of these different
people have different types,

187
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,290
experienced the revolution.

188
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,950
And then in addition to
reading historical scholarship,

189
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,800
we're going to be reading some
of the literature of the period.

190
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,520
We're going to be reading Thomas
Payne's common sense, which I love.

191
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,720
How many of you who've read common
sense before, a good number of you,

192
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:29,520
not kind of sort of, you?
Um, I love common sense.

193
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,340
I think it's an amazing piece of writing.
Um,

194
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,590
and I think when you
read it for this course,

195
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:38,760
you'll get a sense of why it had
such a huge influence at the time.

196
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,290
Um, we're going to read some essays
from the federalist written by Alexander

197
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,090
Hamilton and James Madison and John J,

198
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,350
but we are not going to read them as
prompts. You may have read them before.

199
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:54,351
You may have encountered the federalist
essays as the ground of authority on the

200
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:55,660
constitution.
Right?

201
00:11:55,661 --> 00:12:00,661
How could it not be that when you have
founder type guys talking about the

202
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:04,360
constitution and they were the guys
who were at the convention? Well,

203
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:08,020
the fact of the matter is the federalist
essays weren't intended to be an

204
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:09,220
objective document.

205
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,980
They're actually really subjective and
we're going to look at them in this

206
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,810
course as what they were written to be,

207
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:18,811
which is a really big commercial
advertisement for this new experimental

208
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,780
constitution.

209
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,620
They were actually trying to sell
people on an idea and because of that,

210
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:25,900
as we'll see when we read
that for this course,

211
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,190
there are things in there that maybe are
a little bit exaggerated and things in

212
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:33,700
there that maybe aren't talked about in
great detail in one or two things that

213
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:37,690
probably aren't really true but
it wasn't a good cause. Right?

214
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,810
These guys are saying, I really think
this constitution is the way to go.

215
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,770
Let me say something that's going to
really calm you so that we can go ahead

216
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:45,610
with this experiment.

217
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,030
And of course we're going to be reading
the declaration of independence.

218
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:50,470
We're going to reading the constitution,

219
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,610
we're going to be reading a lot of
documents and letters and other kinds of

220
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,790
assorted items to really give
us a sense of the period.

221
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,130
And at one point I'm even
going to bring in, um,

222
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,510
a newspaper from the period so
that we can actually look at it.

223
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,350
And get a sense of how people are
getting news of the war at that moment.

224
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,810
A lot of these documents we're going to
pull from a book called major problems

225
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:16,510
in the era of the American revolution.
And it's a,

226
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:20,590
it's a nice collection of
primary documents in essays
about sorta related themes.

227
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,610
I'd always makes me laugh when I say that
title because it's part of a series of

228
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:29,080
books and the books are major
problems in the revolution,

229
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:32,860
major problems in the early national
period, major problems in the civil war.

230
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:36,700
So basically all of American history
appears to be a major problem,

231
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,870
which kind of gives me pause.
But despite that, uh, I,

232
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,650
that's a nice collection of things
and we'll be using that for the class.

233
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,540
So that gives you a sense of how the
course is going to flow and what these

234
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,410
readings are going to do.

235
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,880
Which brings me to the portion of the
lecture that I'm going to call Freeman's

236
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:57,760
top five tips for studying
the American revolution.

237
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,570
And I want to explain before I launch
into them, what the heck. I mean, um,

238
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:06,910
basically when I was preparing this
lecture and thinking to myself,

239
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,000
what do I want you to know
about right at the outset,

240
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:14,470
before we even start talking
about the revolution itself?

241
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,870
And I ended up with a list of things that,

242
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:21,190
as I talk about them here may seem
obvious, but the more I talk about them,

243
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:22,900
I think the less obvious they'll appear.

244
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,670
And they're actually really important
to consider in a course that deals with

245
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:32,650
something like America's founding.
There's a lot wrapped up in that.

246
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,150
Just that phrase, I mean, just think about
the phrase, right? The founding fathers,

247
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,540
the founding period,
you just can see the capital letters.

248
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,500
You don't even need to see it in writing
and your mind, it's always capitalized.

249
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,420
We assume a lot of things
about this time period,

250
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:53,750
and it's sort of an iconic period when
you think about American history. To us,

251
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,080
a lot of the people and events in this
time period and the documents at this

252
00:14:57,081 --> 00:15:00,140
time period are kind of
what America is all about,

253
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,390
which is understandable.

254
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,290
But to think about the
founding period as historians,

255
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,000
we need to think differently. We need
to be aware of all of those assumptions,

256
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:15,590
all of that cultural baggage that we
bring when we're looking at something like

257
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:16,820
the American revolution,

258
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,470
we need to be aware of them and then
we need to get past them so that we can

259
00:15:21,471 --> 00:15:25,100
really begin to understand the people and
events of the revolution for what they

260
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:25,640
were.

261
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,640
And that's how I got to Freeman's top
five tips for studying the American

262
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,850
revolution. Five things that you should
bear in mind when studying this period.

263
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,120
Five things obviously that will be
useful to remember throughout the course.

264
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,710
Basically all of them aimed at just
shaking the assumptions right out of us.

265
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,830
And the first tip is actually
really related to that point.

266
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:49,970
The first tip is avoid the dreaded
revolutionary war fact bubble.

267
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,360
And what I mean by that is you're going
to be sitting here and over the course

268
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:56,420
of the semester you're going to hear
a lot of familiar names and events,

269
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,050
Boston Tea Party, George Washington,
the greatest hits of the revolution,

270
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:03,170
the things you know and love
and learned in high school,

271
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,220
they're all going to be here. And hearing
all of these beloved greatest hits,

272
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,450
you may be tempted to sort of sit back
in your seat and drift along the happy

273
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:14,480
familiar events. Ah, the story
of the American revolution.

274
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,120
I love the story of the
American revolution. Well,

275
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:18,860
I love the story of the
American revolution,

276
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:23,000
but there's a different story
of the American revolution
besides all these names,

277
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:27,380
facts and dates that you probably
have arrived here with in your head.

278
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,730
It's a really good dramatic story,
but it's not a string of facts.

279
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,480
So thus the fact bubble, it's not
a fact bubble. The revolution,

280
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:36,710
obviously it's a lot more than that.

281
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:40,700
And you need to sort of almost be aware
of the facts and then allow yourself to

282
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:42,260
step back and look at the big picture.

283
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,760
And John Adams and Benjamin Rush and
others like them would have been the first

284
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:49,790
to tell you like the facts in
a sense are the least of it.

285
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:54,560
So that's tip number one is don't get
lost in the dreaded revolutionary war fact

286
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:57,020
bubble w which I have to say,
it makes me,

287
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:01,520
makes me think of the first
time that I taught this course.

288
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,810
I was actually a brand new professor and
I had just come to Gail and it was my

289
00:17:05,811 --> 00:17:10,811
first course and it was my first lecture
in my first course and I'm actually,

290
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,440
it was in Connecticut Hall,
which for those of you who don't know,

291
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:16,190
um,

292
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,870
dates back to the period when this course
is talking about and was Nathan Hale's

293
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,770
essentially his dorm. So there I am,
I'm like a brand new professor, Gail,

294
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,440
and I'm teaching a course
about the revolution and
it's in a building that dates

295
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:31,710
to the revolution. So I'm having sort of
a wow Yale moment as it is and I'm off,

296
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:33,470
I'm giving, my lecture
isn't, I'm really excited.

297
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:38,270
I give about three of them and someone
raises their hand after about three

298
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:41,570
lectures and they have a kind of a puzzled
expression on their face. I said yes.

299
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,630
And he says, um, excuse
me, professor Freeman,

300
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,460
what are we supposed to be memorizing?
Where are the facts and dates, right?

301
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,690
So as a new professor, my
first impulse was, darn,

302
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:58,620
I forgot the fat suit dates.
I got it wrong.

303
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:04,530
But actually the fact of the matter
is they're not the star of the show.

304
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:06,390
Certainly dates are not
the star of the show.

305
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:09,480
There are dates you're going to have to
remember. So don't think easy street.

306
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,480
There's not a date I have to know.
There will be some dates,

307
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,460
but this isn't a story about dates.

308
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:17,790
It's obviously something a lot more
interesting and a lot broader than that.

309
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,510
Okay.
Avoid fact bubble tip number two,

310
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,100
think about the meaning of words.
Now on the one hand,

311
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:31,170
this may seem really obvious and you
may be sitting here thinking, oh great,

312
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,280
this is going to be a semester of Freeman
saying, what does revolution mean?

313
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,800
What does war mean? Which would be
really, really, really long semester.

314
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,470
And that's actually maybe there
might even be a point where I say,

315
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:45,810
what does revolution mean?
I even kind of sort of said it already,

316
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:49,860
but that's not what I mean when I
say think about the meaning of words.

317
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,870
What I really mean here is be careful
what you assume about words because what

318
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:59,871
seems obvious in meaning
to you now probably meant
something really different in

319
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:04,680
1776 or 1787 and I want to look at one
example because it's a really striking

320
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:08,310
one. And that's the word democracy. Okay?

321
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:11,130
So sitting here in this
room by our standards,

322
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,570
democracy is a good thing,
right? Democracy is a good thing.

323
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,630
Every once in a while it's a professor,

324
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,390
you'd say something and then you think
with her about how it's going to look in

325
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:23,880
your notes. So you'll have all
these notes and then it'll say,

326
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:25,590
democracy is a good thing.

327
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,570
Really sophisticated class we're teaching
here at Yale. Um, but to us it's good.

328
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,240
And two people in the founding generation,
not so much.

329
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,680
They weren't so sure about it.

330
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,100
To them the word democracy signaled a
kind of government in which every single

331
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:48,450
person participated personally,
not a government based on representation.

332
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,380
We're talking mass politics in the
minds of most people in the founding

333
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:54,930
generation.
Just the definition of what chaos was.

334
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:00,780
So just listen to a sentence in one of
the last letters written by Alexander

335
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,800
Hamilton, 1804 the night before
his dual with Aaron Burr.

336
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,250
So he's like sort of speaking to
posterity in case he should die.

337
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:12,420
And this is what he writes.
In this letter I will hear express,

338
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,950
but one sentiment which is that
the dismemberment of our empire,

339
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,780
I love the fact that America's an empire
in 1804 will be a clear sacrifice of

340
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:25,530
great positive advantages
without any counter balancing,

341
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:29,400
good administering,
no relief to our real disease,

342
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,230
which is democracy. Okay, are
real disease is democracy.

343
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,940
Alexander Hamilton.

344
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,120
Now admittedly Hamilton might not be the
shining example of the point I'm trying

345
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:44,460
to make here because he's
not exactly Mr Democracy.

346
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:47,170
So you wouldn't really expect him
to be clapping his hands for it.

347
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,480
But now listen to Thomas Jefferson who
maybe you would brand as Mr Democracy.

348
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:57,890
So Jefferson in 1816 is chatting away
with someone in a letter about what

349
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:01,210
America is trying to do and whether
America is actually achieving it.

350
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,630
And he says,
actually democracy is pretty impractical.

351
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,000
He can imagine it in a town, but
outside of one town, it just won't work.

352
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,740
Again,
really clear.

353
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:15,670
Their sense of what that word means is
really different from our sense of what

354
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:19,400
that word means. Now Jefferson
immediately goes on to add, um,

355
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,500
that democratical I democratical.

356
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,220
But representative government is a good
thing, right? A democracy, not so much,

357
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:30,580
but democratical, which is
a great, the 18th century,

358
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,380
they're always adding ecole
onto the end of things,

359
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:34,300
which could end perfectly
happily with the sea.

360
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,920
This is a great 18th
century sounding word.

361
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:41,200
Democratical democratical representative
government is a good thing,

362
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:42,850
but democracy not.

363
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,480
So the moral of the story is don't
fall into what I call democracy speak.

364
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,970
Don't write papers where you toss
around terms like democracy, liberty,

365
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:55,983
freedom,

366
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:01,350
without really thinking about what you
mean and what they meant as Americans.

367
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:05,170
We're used to tossing those words around,
but to early Americans,

368
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,240
if you think about it too early American
slave holders, words like liberty,

369
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,520
other such words have a much more
complicated meaning. So tip number two,

370
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,720
think about the meaning of words,
which brings us to tip number three.

371
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,700
Remember that founders where people
now as I was writing this, I thought,

372
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,460
oh that's another one of those things
I don't want to see in people's notes.

373
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:30,610
You know, democracy is
good. Founders are people.

374
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,460
Such a highfalutin course. I'm teaching
here. Um, again, sounds really obvious,

375
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:41,461
but what I really mean here is we tend
to forget this pretty simple fact.

376
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,630
We forget that the founders were people.

377
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,890
We assume that they were these all
knowing demi gods who are sort of calmly

378
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:51,250
walking their way through the
creation of a new model nation.

379
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,960
We kind of deify them.

380
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:57,640
We put them up on this sort of awe like
founder mountain top of American history

381
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,190
and it's really,
it's easy to do.

382
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,880
I mean sometimes just listening to
their words or reading their words would

383
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:07,360
inspire you to want to do that.
Here's a random phrase I thought,

384
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:10,900
what can I write here that would be sort
of inspiring founder talk and this was

385
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,680
the one sent two sentences that I came
up with just cause they always stick in

386
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:17,200
my mind because they
sound kind of amazing.

387
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:21,010
This is actually Thomas Paine common
sense in the middle of it. He writes,

388
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,660
we haven't in our power to
begin the world over again.

389
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:30,610
The birthday of a new world is
at hand. Okay, that's really,

390
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:32,430
that's inspiring stuff.
I mean that's,

391
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,640
that's fine writing but that's inspiring
talk and it's supposed to be obviously

392
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:40,210
cause pains. Trying to convince people
that independence is a really good idea,

393
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,400
but these kinds of words,

394
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:46,370
they sort of glorious rhetoric shouldn't
block out the simple fact that the

395
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:50,810
founders were people, they were regular
human beings. They were well educated,

396
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,950
they were thoughtful,

397
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,400
they were sometimes well meaning
they were sometimes hardworking,

398
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:59,330
maybe sometimes not so much.
They were people aiming high.

399
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,300
They were people who did feel
responsible to posterity,

400
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:05,360
but still they were people and to me,

401
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,950
this is one of the really exciting things
about history generally and about this

402
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:14,690
time period specifically we're talking
about people trying to figure things out.

403
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,110
We're talking about the most
basic things about America, right?

404
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,720
It's existence that it is a nation,

405
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,950
that it has a constitution and we're
looking at people trying to figure out how

406
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:27,470
all that stuff is going to be
created and how it's going to work.

407
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,210
These are people who are scared.

408
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,940
These are people who make
dumb mistakes on occasion.

409
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,520
They're figuring it out as they go.

410
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The history of this period is a
history of decisions of various kinds,

411
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,200
and these were hard decisions and they
were being made by people who did not

412
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,710
know the answers.
They're making it up as they go along.

413
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:52,700
I think that's just fascinating when you
just read their correspondence and get

414
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:56,360
a sense of how much they're really
in the dark. There's a, actually,

415
00:24:56,361 --> 00:25:00,170
when you read letters from the period,
a lot of them say the same thing, right?

416
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:01,710
When the government launches,
um,

417
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,830
I think George Washington
and James Madison and a,

418
00:25:04,831 --> 00:25:07,160
a Pennsylvania senator almost
say the exact same thing.

419
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,660
It's almost like they
went into a room and said,

420
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:12,200
so how will we express being scared of
this moment? Ah, here's a good sentence.

421
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,950
They all say, basically, I feel
like I'm walking on hollow ground.

422
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,710
I feel like the ground's going
to break beneath my feet.

423
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:22,340
They've just launched this constitution
and they all are sort of standing there

424
00:25:22,341 --> 00:25:25,940
on the national stage thinking,
what if this all explodes?

425
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,590
Like do we actually know what we're doing?

426
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,730
That's a really fascinating part of
this period to me. Now, of course,

427
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:34,490
sometimes people did try
to figure out the answer.

428
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,590
So in a wonderful sort
of enlightenment way,

429
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,320
and my favorite example
of this is James Madison,

430
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:44,090
who prepared himself ultimately for the
constitutional convention by studying

431
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:48,890
all governments across
all time. You Imagine, Oh,

432
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:53,891
I better go study all of government
ever to get ready for this convention.

433
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,740
But he does. He has a great sort of
enlightenment thing to do. He's thinking,

434
00:25:57,741 --> 00:26:02,420
I will now discover the eternal
patterns of politics, and he's thinking,

435
00:26:02,421 --> 00:26:06,560
if I can do that, then I can reach
for the best I can avoid the worst,

436
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:08,630
and whatever we're going to do
when we make a new government,

437
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,630
maybe we're going to actually do
something better than what's come before.

438
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:14,090
So there's a logic to it as,
as ambitious as it is,

439
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:16,550
there's a logic and he
was serious about it.

440
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:19,580
So it wasn't even just wondering what
happens if I read a lot about government,

441
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:20,870
he actually was serious about it.

442
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:24,890
He even made a kind of a little chart
in which he listed the governments and

443
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:28,520
then listed pros and cons like,
well, what do I think of Sparta?

444
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,640
I mean he sort of amazing, I
mean across all time, you know?

445
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,200
So I love the fact that he did that
founder like thing to do, but there are,

446
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:37,250
you see a person,

447
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:42,030
a really intellectually ambitious person
trying to figure things out. Like how,

448
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,230
how do we know what make, what's his
constitution supposed to look at?

449
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,880
Like how are we going to figure that out?
Okay,

450
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:50,970
I'll just study all of
government and let you know.

451
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,560
So when we talk about
the American revolution,

452
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:00,150
we're talking about people and this
course takes this idea really seriously.

453
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,350
Part of what we're going to be doing over
the course of the semester is looking

454
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:07,560
at the revolution from the
vantage point of participants.

455
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,630
Trying to see how people
at the time understood the
events unfolding around them.

456
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,190
How did the colonists understand
themselves as British subjects?

457
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,720
How did they feel about the British empire
or about the king or about parliament?

458
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,290
How did they come to put
Americanness in the foreground?

459
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,790
How did rebelling against
their own country makes sense?

460
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,640
And that's something I think we also
tend to forget about the revolution.

461
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,840
We think of it as our war you, it's us
against them and them equals the British,

462
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:41,220
but of course we were the British, so
it's something that you don't think about,

463
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:42,450
but people at the time,

464
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,400
certainly in the 1790s people referred
to this as the civil war because that's

465
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:48,240
what it was.

466
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,970
It's just not the way we happen to
think about it because in our mind we've

467
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:54,420
already traveled down the road and we're
already us. But in their mind it was,

468
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:57,840
it was in a sense brother against brother.
It was us against us.

469
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,520
So we're going to try to keep that sort
of thing in mind as we explore how the

470
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:06,030
events of this time made sense at
that time. And I will say here,

471
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,950
we are not going to
forget about the British,

472
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:11,010
so we're not going to have
a Patriot centric course.

473
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,440
The British have a logic
to what they're doing,

474
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,200
whether they're making policy or
whether they're fighting battles.

475
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,010
And we will definitely look at the logic
of what the British are doing as well

476
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:21,510
as what the colonists are doing.

477
00:28:21,511 --> 00:28:25,890
Now I will admit right here up front
that I will be offering you a sampling of

478
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:29,340
really arrogant British
quotes about crude colonists.

479
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,860
And I'm doing that partly because
there's just so many good,

480
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,570
really arrogant quotes about American
colonists that I can't resist sprinkling

481
00:28:36,571 --> 00:28:40,050
them through my lectures and I can't
resist that so much that I have to hear

482
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:44,580
that I just randomly added in because
I have a reason to and so I will.

483
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,121
But it's just,

484
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:48,600
it gives you a sense of how at least
some of the British were thinking and

485
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:52,290
looking at, you know, really these
little upstarts on the margins of empire.

486
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,830
So random, arrogant, British
quote, number one. Um,

487
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,470
and this is from a customs official.

488
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,550
American colonists are a most
rude, depraved, degenerate race.

489
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,240
And it is a mortification to us that they
speak English and can trace themselves

490
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:13,620
from that stock.
Wow.

491
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,250
Even English is a problem, you know,
that's a, that's a statement. Okay.

492
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,350
Arrogant quote number two.

493
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:24,770
And this one I picked us because
it's about George Washington and you,

494
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,630
it's hard to imagine people saying
something arrogant about George Washington

495
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:30,330
who seems to be like
Mr. Symbol of authority.

496
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,410
But here's another British
official official who met
with George Washington and

497
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:38,460
then wrote back home about
what he thought. And he says,

498
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,070
somehow,
and I can't,

499
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:46,600
how he's learned the basics of how to
behave in a court society. It's like,

500
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,860
Ooh, that must have been a
really fun interview too.

501
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:52,360
If that's the attitude this guy had.

502
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,830
So there'll be a sprinkling of that
because at dramatic moments in the war,

503
00:29:56,831 --> 00:30:01,660
there's always someone who steps forward
and offers that point of view that said,

504
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,080
we are going to do justice to
the British side of the dispute,

505
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,510
to the logic behind the
policy that they were making.

506
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,180
Because it's not as though they make
a bunch of dumb policies that make

507
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,260
absolutely no sense and we're righteously
outraged. And then there's a war there.

508
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:15,790
Policies made sense to them.

509
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,820
They didn't happen to always
make sense to the colonists,

510
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:21,940
but that made sense to them. And the same
thing goes with British battle plans,

511
00:30:21,941 --> 00:30:25,210
which looking back in the long view of
time when we start talking about them

512
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,620
might seem a little goofy,

513
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:31,120
but there's actually a lot of logic for
what they were trying to do when they

514
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:35,620
were attacking the colonies.
Oh, and I will also mention, um,

515
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,740
I guess I probably don't have
time to talk about it now.

516
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,740
When I was preparing this lecture,
casting around,

517
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:43,510
trying to figure out what
will I put in the lecture.

518
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,020
I don't know how I came across it,
but I discovered the battle of new haven.

519
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:52,040
Did anyone know about the battle of new
haven? Because I did not know. I mean,

520
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:57,070
I know there's like hostilities around
and I don't know if there's like Yale

521
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,240
Lore that of course you're
all sitting there saying,

522
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:02,200
well of course we all know about the
battle of new haven, but I don't know.

523
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,220
I'm the only one who doesn't know
about the battle of new haven. Um,

524
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,490
but it's actually, it's a good
story. I'm not going to tell it now.

525
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:10,510
I'm going to leave you in suspense.

526
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:12,730
It will appear when we start getting
into the fighting of the revolution.

527
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:15,760
But let me just give you the sneak
preview, which is, it doesn't five.

528
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:20,410
The prep involve the president of Yale
College with a gun in his hand running to

529
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:24,040
fight the British. So it's a, it's
a Yale moment that we have. Um,

530
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,320
so I will talk about the
battle of new haven. Okay.

531
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:31,321
So we aren't going to be looking at
a story of good guys versus bad guys.

532
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,660
We will be reconstructing
opposing points of view,

533
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,840
trying to figure out how those
points have you made sense.

534
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:40,930
And then obviously we'll be able to step
back and say what happens when you put

535
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:43,780
those two opposing points of
view in contact with each other.

536
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:49,180
So tip three founders are people,
which brings us to tip for,

537
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,400
we're not just talking about founders.

538
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,980
The revolution was not just
a quiet conversation between
a bunch of guys wearing

539
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,390
wigs and knee Britches,
right?

540
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:02,170
We sort of have this image
that the revolution is guys
and short pants with wigs

541
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:06,520
in a room doing this, you
know, the entire founding,

542
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:10,180
I think in our minds or it looks like
that, right? So that's not the revolution,

543
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,240
right? That's not what happened.
We're talking about a revolution,

544
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,720
a popular uprising by vast numbers of
colonists fought on American ground by

545
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:21,400
Americans of all kinds.

546
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,220
And it meant different things
to different kinds of people.

547
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:28,990
This is not to say that the founders
aren't important far from it.

548
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:32,650
And as you will gather very quickly
in this course, I love these guys,

549
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:35,140
but I love talking about these guys.
I love writing about these guys.

550
00:32:35,141 --> 00:32:37,930
So I'm certainly not saying
who cares about founders,

551
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,450
but what I am saying is that they're
not the only ones who mattered.

552
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,230
They didn't have their own revolution
while everybody else watched.

553
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,900
We're talking about a popular revolution,

554
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:53,050
grounded on the ideas and actions of
people throughout many different levels of

555
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:57,650
society. Now, somewhat conversely,
this brings us to John Adams.

556
00:32:57,651 --> 00:33:01,250
As I promised at the beginning, John Adams
was coming and here's John Adams. Um,

557
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,160
you'll be hearing from him more than
once this semester and actually you've

558
00:33:06,161 --> 00:33:09,680
already heard from him once. So I
can promise it. That's true. Um,

559
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,240
this isn't because I think the John Adams
is the most important figure from the

560
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:18,680
period. It's not because I think
that he's always right. In fact,

561
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:22,880
the reason I quote him a lot
is he's a brilliant blunt,

562
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:27,070
really direct commentator with,
and this is all important.

563
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,650
You almost need a drum roll here.
He has a sense of humor.

564
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,380
John Adams has a sense of humor.

565
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,370
It's not everyday that you find a founder
with a sense of humor. I can vouch,

566
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,230
there aren't a lot of chuckling founders.

567
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,530
Certainly on paper there's not a lot of
chuckling going on among the founders.

568
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:44,660
Probably in person there was,
but on paper,

569
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:48,710
not a lot of them commit humor
to paper and John Adams does.

570
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,720
He's even self deprecating sometimes,

571
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:54,140
which nobody wants to be self deprecating
on paper when they know that they're

572
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:57,020
going to be a founder.
But John Sometimes is,

573
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,870
and I'm going to offer one
little tiny dumb example.

574
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,760
First thing that popped
into my mind when I thought,

575
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:03,680
well what am I going to say to
show down out of sense of humor.

576
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:08,270
So this is actually from that same
series of letters in their old age when

577
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:09,590
they're writing back
and forth to each other.

578
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:15,130
So Adams is writing to Jefferson and he
signs his letter with this John Adams in

579
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:19,940
the 89th year of his age
too fat to last much longer.

580
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,670
It's just not typical founder Tom.

581
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,230
George Washington is not
signing his letters that way.

582
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,830
But you know Adam's commits
that sort of stuff to paper.

583
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:34,790
What that means is not only is he blunt,
direct and intelligent,

584
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:37,250
but he also even gets
to be humorous as well.

585
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,850
So in atoms we have this
sort of cantankerous,

586
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,770
sometimes bemused, more often
irritated, occasionally self aware,

587
00:34:45,771 --> 00:34:50,771
sometimes really not stubborn book steeped
event experiencing action taking tour

588
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,590
guide.
He's not going to be there all the time.

589
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:57,230
They're going to be long stretches of the
course where we don't find John Adams,

590
00:34:57,231 --> 00:35:00,020
but he's definitely gonna
make repeat appearances.

591
00:35:00,021 --> 00:35:03,050
And in the middle of the course will
even get to tell a really good story,

592
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:05,630
which he actually basically wrote down
and said, let me tell you this story.

593
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,340
So that's, you know, as a historian,

594
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:10,970
what's better than historical characters
doing exactly what you want them to do.

595
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,410
Here's a cool story on the revolution.
You can quote it in your lecture courses.

596
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,320
Good.
Oh,

597
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,440
this actually makes me think of
another John Adams related thing.

598
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:25,550
Before I get to tip number five,
which I will get to, I'm partly,

599
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:27,590
I'm curious about this and partly
I want to mention something.

600
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:32,810
How many of you saw the Hbo
Mini Series on John Adams? Okay.

601
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,620
Goodly number of you. Um, I,

602
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,110
I mentioned that for specific reason. Now
I will say I, I, I of course watched it,

603
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,700
um, and the period when it was airing
with a really interesting period for me

604
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:48,690
because as an 18th century historian
with maybe the only time I've ever been

605
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:52,650
culturally relevant to popular culture,
I was like, it's my moment, right?

606
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,620
People coming up to me and saying, I got
a question about John at him. I'm like,

607
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:58,950
wow, this is great. Um,

608
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,370
so it was an interesting moment when
people actually were thinking about John

609
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,120
Adams.
Um,

610
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,690
and I will say also I watched it with a
few historians and we were prepared to

611
00:36:06,691 --> 00:36:10,260
throw popcorn at the screen and we ended
up pretty much liking it and we were

612
00:36:10,261 --> 00:36:12,870
surprised about halfway through. We
all looked at each other and said, Huh,

613
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,710
it's actually pretty
good. So I don't, I mean,

614
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:20,490
of course there are always things at
any kind of TV or movie production about

615
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:24,480
history gets wrong. So I won't say that
there's nothing wrong in it. However,

616
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:27,720
there is one thing that is wrong and I'm
going to mention it because if you have

617
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:31,350
pictures in your mind from the mini
series as you sit here in this course,

618
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,990
it could be a bad thing to
think that they are accurate.

619
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,670
And what I'm talking about is actually
the F, I think it's the first episode.

620
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:42,150
It is of course, the first episode and
that's the episode where like, you know,

621
00:36:42,151 --> 00:36:46,560
the revolution is beginning and you see
people milling about sort of with fists,

622
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,560
right? That represents the revolution.
You see the beginning of the revolution,

623
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,250
the bizarre thing about the way that
they depict it is apparently according to

624
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:54,930
the producers of this mini series,

625
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:59,160
if there was something happening in
the early stages of their evolution,

626
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,420
John Adams apparently was there. Boy,
they're shooting at Lexington and Concord.

627
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,710
Adam's racing across the countryside
to get to Lexington and Concord,

628
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,950
Boston massacre,
John Adams staring at,

629
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:16,260
so the idea is really that John Adams
still now it's like never off his horse

630
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,520
riding around Massachusetts trying to
be an eye witness to every historical

631
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,640
event. Now I understand that probably
the people who made this thought,

632
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,340
how the heck are we going to
communicate Boston massacre?

633
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,820
Lexie didn't conquered this is a film
about Adams and we can't like say what

634
00:37:29,821 --> 00:37:32,700
items over here while we know turned
to random people out of field shooting.

635
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:37,690
So I understand how narrative wise
why they needed to do this. But um,

636
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:41,420
Adams was not at every store pickle
event in the revolutionary war.

637
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,750
Many and he definitely had an
insider's view of the Boston massacre,

638
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:49,830
but he was not everywhere
in Massachusetts. Okay. Um,

639
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:55,310
that oddly enough brings me to tip
number five in the Freeman guide.

640
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,490
And tip number five is
remember contingency.

641
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,600
Again, obvious thing, but
something we don't think about.

642
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,810
People at the time didn't
know what was going to happen.

643
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:10,560
So Adams could not race to places where
he didn't know the things that happened

644
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:12,660
yet something might be
happening at Lexington.

645
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,030
People didn't know what
was going to happen.

646
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,710
Think for a moment about all of the things
that we assume about the revolution,

647
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:24,120
we assume that the colonists were
right and that the British were wrong.

648
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,330
We assume that a
revolution was inevitable.

649
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,830
We assumed that there was broad agreement
at any one time about what should be

650
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:34,440
done. Right? Of course, we
need to declare independence.

651
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:38,500
Of course the collars are going
to win the war. Of course,

652
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,330
there should be a national union.

653
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,930
Those are all before the things that
I think we do assume and that's,

654
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:46,240
that's a lot of assumptions.
That's a lot of of courses,

655
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,850
but in fact it's important to remember
that people didn't know what was going to

656
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:52,480
happen.

657
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,530
You really need to allow for contingency
because literally what they assumed was

658
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,520
anything can happen.
Anything can happen. Again.

659
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:04,630
One of the things that I love about this
time period is that the emotions are so

660
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:05,464
heightened.

661
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,340
If you're in an atmosphere
where everything's up in
the air and you're in the

662
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:12,340
middle of a revolution or you're trying
to create a government and you literally

663
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:14,770
don't know what's coming
next and anything can happen,

664
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:18,280
maybe I'll get hanged by the king.

665
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,370
Maybe I'll get shot going home.

666
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,660
Maybe America will hate the constitution
so much they will throw rocks at my

667
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:26,980
head. I mean, I don't know.
What they were thinking, well,

668
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:29,260
maybe the constitution will
last for days and then collapse,

669
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,610
whatever they're thinking.

670
00:39:30,611 --> 00:39:34,180
The fact is because they literally
think anything can happen.

671
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,460
Anything can fall apart at any second.

672
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:40,750
The emotions are really raised and it's
why a lot of the rhetoric in this period

673
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:45,040
is so extreme. It's not that these
guys are like trying to be dramatic.

674
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,390
They actually are dramatic.

675
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:48,340
They're feeling that this is
a dramatic kind of a moment,

676
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:50,350
and I don't think you get that sense.

677
00:39:50,351 --> 00:39:55,351
I don't think you get that idea unless
you remind yourself about contingency,

678
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,470
but the fact that there are
no predetermined outcomes
and that anything can

679
00:39:59,471 --> 00:40:03,550
happen. I think particularly when
you're studying a revolution,

680
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,810
it's really important to remember
contingency and we will discover what

681
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:11,650
contingency means in this time period
over the course of the semester,

682
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:15,850
and I will end there. I will see
many of you perhaps on Thursday,

683
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:20,851
I will probably know next week better
about the reality of when we'll be meeting

684
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:21,940
for discussion sections.
