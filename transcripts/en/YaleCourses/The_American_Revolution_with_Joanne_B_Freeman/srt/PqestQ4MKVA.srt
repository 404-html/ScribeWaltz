1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,380
So today we're going to take the plunge
and do the actual outbreak of warfare.

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,010
However, now that I've
teased you that way, um,

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,300
I do actually want us to
get to declare independence.

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,240
If you think about it.
We didn't quite get there yesterday,

5
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:25,350
so I do want us to declare independence,
um, for, for just a few minutes.

6
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:30,150
We're going to close that off and
then we will move on to the opening of

7
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:33,120
hostilities and the logic behind
them and really what they show.

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,280
So thinking back to Tuesday,
Tuesday,

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,850
we ended with a discussion of the,

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,410
the editing of the completed
draft of the declaration.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,140
And I mentioned the Jeffersons.

12
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:54,141
Passage on slavery was cut out of the
final document for any number of reasons.

13
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:57,030
One of them obviously
being that for southerners,

14
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:58,440
that would have been a deal breaker.

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,760
And also because there were all sorts
of inherent in consistencies in what

16
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:04,020
Jefferson had written.

17
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,210
Now the editing process went on for a
few days only it wasn't longer than that.

18
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:12,300
These is actually events are unfolding
pretty quickly here as far as drafting,

19
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:17,140
editing, passing, and moving on with
the declaration of independence. Um,

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,840
and Jefferson did not enjoy the
editing process. Do you ever send,

21
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,770
hated the editing process because he
really thought they were completely

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,860
mangling his beautiful,
wonderful prose.

23
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,050
So supposedly he sat in the corner of
the room in the main chamber of the

24
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:36,830
congress looking really miserable.
Okay.

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,840
Just sort of cringing and wincing
every time they cut another one who was

26
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:42,960
beautiful words or substituted
some other word in there.

27
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,550
So apparently, and we get this
partly from Jefferson himself,

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,700
he looked so miserable that Benjamin
Franklin ended up going over to him to try

29
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:54,710
to cheer him up.
And I'm,

30
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,950
I'm offering this partly because I'm
always trying obviously to get us past the

31
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:03,120
sort of Ah, like American
revolution. The declaration, right?

32
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:07,890
I'm trying to sort of make this human
right. Human documents, human moments,

33
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:08,641
human struggling.

34
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:12,300
So we're now really going to humanize
the declaration of independence.

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,670
So Jefferson says he's sitting there,
where are his words here? Okay.

36
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,671
He said Franklin quote perceived that I
was not insensible to these mutilations.

37
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,180
Okay.

38
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,650
So Franklin saw that according
to Jefferson and how much
I hated the mutilating

39
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:29,484
my document.

40
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,670
And Franklin ends up telling Jefferson
a story and then Jefferson kindly for us

41
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,640
looking on preserve the story so I can
offer you the story that Franklin told

42
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,270
Jefferson basically to distract him while
they were editing the declaration of

43
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:46,104
independence.

44
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,350
So Franklin told this story of a header
named John Thompson and this pattern

45
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:57,900
named John Thompson wanted to open a shop
and he wanted to create a sign to hang

46
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:01,070
over the door and he
planned on having the sign,

47
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:05,320
say John Thompson header makes
and sells hats for ready money.

48
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,790
And then there'd be a picture of a hat.
So that's his plan.

49
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:14,050
But he decides he'll run the signed by
a few of his friends to see what they

50
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:17,590
think. Is that the right sign for him
to put up in front of his new shop?

51
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,290
So he goes to one friend
and the first friend says,

52
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,050
well you don't really need
the word had or do you?

53
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,460
Because obviously if you make
and sell hats, you're a header.

54
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,140
So you can just cut the word header.

55
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,850
The next one says makes you really
have to say makes hats mean.

56
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:36,940
Obviously their hats, you don't
need, the word makes, you can cut.

57
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:41,740
The word makes it's unneeded on the sign.
Another says, why say for ready money,

58
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,240
like what you're going to give away, the
hats, like you can cut for ready money.

59
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,740
And so obviously this goes on and on.

60
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,740
Franklin continues to tell this anecdote
until in the end the sign just is John

61
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,530
Thompson and has a picture of a hat.
Okay,

62
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,010
so Franklin gels with story and
then he says the moral of the story,

63
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:00,910
he even had a moral,

64
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:06,210
the moral of the story is that Franklin
made it tried quote whenever in my power

65
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,450
to avoid becoming the draftsmen of
papers to be reviewed by a public body.

66
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,030
Okay?
Never write anything that a public buddy,

67
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:19,270
we'll edit because you will be very sad
and all of your words will be sliced

68
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:20,104
away.

69
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,040
So that's this little tiny human moment
happening in the corner of the chamber

70
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,310
or the Continental Congress is meeting.
Meanwhile,

71
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,730
they're editing the document on July
2nd [inaudible] 1776 congress votes for

72
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:38,590
independence two days later on July
4th after all of the editing and

73
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:40,000
Jeffersonian cringing,

74
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,290
Congress formally adopted the
Declaration of independence.

75
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,360
So we have declared independence. We've
adopted the declaration of independence,

76
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,290
but obviously now something has to happen
to the document and it wasn't intended

77
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,790
to be something that was sort of filed
away. It was intended, obviously,

78
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:02,650
to have an impact. And there were two
audiences in mind. On the one hand,

79
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,210
people in the Congress did think that if
they declared their intentions and what

80
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:09,400
they were doing in some
sort of a document,

81
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,230
that the outer world people
beyond the colonies, first of all,

82
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,740
would understand what was going on and
then hopefully might even want to offer

83
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,980
aid, right? Any, basically, if they're
declaring independence against Britain,

84
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:23,860
maybe people who don't like
Britain will want to help us.

85
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,490
So first they're thinking
possibly a European audience,

86
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:31,450
but even more important than that, they're
thinking about a domestic audience.

87
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,030
They're thinking about having
the American people under,

88
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,460
not only understand what's happening,

89
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:41,461
but really here this document that
they've tinkered every word over the

90
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,370
congresses, feelings about
what they think is happening,

91
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,410
what they believe is
going on in the colonies,

92
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:49,000
what they are declaring to the world.

93
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,640
And so what happens basically is once
the document is past, it's issued,

94
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,830
the congress sent it out to any number of,

95
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,480
they sent it out to the continental army
many copies so that it could be read to

96
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:04,420
people in the army.
And the continental army comes Tuesdays,

97
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,360
I don't think I forgot the continental
army and George Washington comes Tuesday.

98
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,170
Um, they sent it out to
um, state assemblies.

99
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,060
They sent it out to committees of safety.

100
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:19,061
Basically they found it any number of
avenues to send out this document so that

101
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:20,900
it could be read aloud.

102
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:24,830
And that was the plan wasn't for people
to sort of read this interestingly in

103
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:25,401
their newspaper,

104
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:29,870
but they actually had public
readings of it on courthouse steps,

105
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,190
um, in public squares at
public meetings, town meetings.

106
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,590
It was sort of a performed document.

107
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:40,310
It was being read so people
could hear what independence,

108
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,200
how independence was being declared.

109
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,820
And in response there were all kinds of
public celebrations and demonstrations.

110
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,670
So there were fireworks,

111
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:54,560
there were parades and there was a lot
of symbolic destruction of some of the

112
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:58,700
trappings of the crown.
So basically images of the king,

113
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,240
like on a tavern sign were ripped down.

114
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,970
We're broken into pieces were
burned in bonfires in New York City.

115
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,140
This famous image of this
that you may have seen,

116
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,520
they pulled down a large statue
of the king mounted on his horse.

117
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,020
They actually literally pulled it down
and then later headed melted into bullets

118
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,410
for the war effort. So clearly,
boy, isn't that a slap you,

119
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:24,800
I heard a noise over there. That's
true. It's like King George.

120
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,330
Not only did we tear you down,

121
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:30,620
but we're going to use you to
shoot at you with your own statue.

122
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,350
So obviously independence is a moment,
does an event,

123
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:41,300
it's not just a document. So,
and I should note here too,

124
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,330
that now that independence is declared
what had been colonies are not colonies

125
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:48,860
any longer, right? It feel
like declared independence.

126
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:51,020
And they're saying they are no
longer colonies of Great Britain.

127
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm going to try to remember from here
on out to begin to use the word state.

128
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,250
They're frantically,
and I'll talk more about this on Tuesday,

129
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,340
they're frantically now also worrying
about state constitutions to replace where

130
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:06,170
the royal government government
had been in the past,

131
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,270
but now obviously we're
not colonies anymore.

132
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:13,271
We're moving on to another sort of state
of being and in their mind actually

133
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:14,930
even another word,

134
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:21,110
but of course there's that
obvious looming question at hand,

135
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,500
right? Warfare, conflict, hostility.

136
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:29,501
Something is looming and there's no
clear path as to how whatever's going to

137
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:36,911
happen next is going to unfold or how
it should be played out or even just how

138
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:42,551
these newly declared states
are going to execute warfare.

139
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,690
How should they organize the effort?
How should this war be fought?

140
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,170
How might it possibly be one?
Right?

141
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:56,171
The idea of winning a war against the
power at the might of the British army to

142
00:08:57,721 --> 00:09:00,930
say the least, that would have been
really daunting to these people.

143
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:05,370
The odds would have felt seemingly
impossible. And then on top of that,

144
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,800
what about organizing whatever
effort you were going to take.

145
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:10,560
What about organizing?
How were you supposed to do that?

146
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,850
Particularly given that the continental
Congress says we'll discuss next week,

147
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,110
didn't have any absolute power to
really enforce much of what it did.

148
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,810
Medic making it as we'll see even more
difficult for them to sort of organize

149
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:26,370
and carry out a war effort.

150
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,440
So basically today and Tuesday I'm
going to be talking about the process of

151
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,260
opening a war and organizing a war.
Um,

152
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,540
basically in the process showing
something about the mindset on both sides.

153
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,500
And today particularly,

154
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:44,280
you're going to get a sense
just by looking on ground
level at what's happening

155
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:46,080
between British soldiers.

156
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,290
And I'm going to feel say
colonist cause it's in my head.

157
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:52,770
We'll move on to Americans, but I'm
going to, colonist is right here.

158
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,210
I can't vanish it yet. I'm feeling
very colonial. Like it's my habit,

159
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,810
my British tradition. Um, at any rate, um,

160
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,560
today you're going to get a sense of
the real mindset of the different sides

161
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,390
because you're going to
see people interacting.

162
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,720
And I have a number of different sort of
eyewitness accounts of different events.

163
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,580
So you can get a sense of the logic behind
what people are thinking is going on

164
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,890
as some of these hostilities unfold.

165
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,730
So today we're going to be looking
at conflict in the last two lectures.

166
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,790
We clearly in one way or another
had been leading up to this moment.

167
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,930
So we talked about common sense, talked
about the declaration of independence.

168
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,210
And in discussing both of those documents,

169
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:37,170
I've made several references
to the surrounding mood.

170
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,400
And I think I've used several times
that any of the colonies were on fire.

171
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:45,240
It was pain's a version of what pain
said that the colony seemed to be on fire

172
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:48,570
in 1775 and that's what
inspires him to want to write.

173
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,930
So what we're going to do is basically
look and see what that means.

174
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:53,190
What is pain referring to,

175
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,340
what is happening in 1775 that pushed
him to feel so compelled to write.

176
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,280
So we're going to look at the physical
aspect of events unfolding mostly in 1775

177
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:10,281
a little bit in 1776 the physical reality
of the onset of actual hostilities,

178
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,521
what,

179
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:16,980
what the colonial hostility to the
British soldiers stationed in the colonies

180
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,240
felt like how that was unfolding,
what the British soldiers were doing,

181
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,990
how they thought they were going to
stem the tide of whatever was happening.

182
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,120
But as I've already said in any number
of times in this course, even now,

183
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:33,090
we're on the cusp of some
kind of physical clash.

184
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,240
We're not looking at two competing groups
of people who see themselves as being

185
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:42,120
entirely distinct and separate peoples.

186
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,700
And we certainly seen on both sides a
sort of gradual realization that maybe the

187
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:51,690
logic of governance is
different on both sides.

188
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,090
The logic or the understanding of the
empire is different on both sides of the

189
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:55,924
Atlantic.

190
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,170
But we don't have two people here who
see themselves as enemies societies as

191
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,860
Lord Rockingham put it in
parliament speaking at the time.

192
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,170
He feared that they were looking at quote,

193
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:13,060
the dreadful calamity of shedding
British blood by British hands.

194
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,970
So what we're talking
about here is civil war.

195
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:20,020
That's why I titled This Lecture
Civil War, because that's what it was.

196
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,830
It was a people divided.
There are actually people in at the time,

197
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:28,780
certainly I can think of some in the 1790s
who call the revolution the civil war.

198
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,300
That's what it was.
That's what it felt like.

199
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:34,450
That really sort of drives that home.
Now,

200
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:39,451
the first battles of this war are fought
in 1775 but they don't represent a sort

201
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:46,600
of sudden plunging into the inevitability
of war and it's actually quite the

202
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:49,570
opposite. You'll see that as
these events unfold today,

203
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,930
both sides to some degree really see
themselves as behaving defensively and

204
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:59,050
ultimately they point the finger at the
other side, but in one way or another,

205
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,300
both sides feel that they're trying to
sort of prevent bad things from happening.

206
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,060
Now on the colonial side,

207
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,900
people assumed that they
were collecting arms,

208
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:13,750
that they were creating
local militia units,

209
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,060
that they were beginning
to stockpile weapons,

210
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,130
that this was all a defensive measure.

211
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,220
And at the end of the
first continental congress,

212
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,370
they actually had declared that maybe the
colonies should think about organizing

213
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:31,360
themselves for defensive
measures. So there had been,
again, not a sort of a Jack,

214
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:33,430
a Jack measure from the
first continental congress,

215
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:38,110
but maybe it's time that we actually
should really begin organizing. But again,

216
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,420
this is,
this is seen as a defensive measure.

217
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,960
That same kind of spirit of defensive
protection still infuses the second

218
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,370
continental congress.

219
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,550
And I mentioned in the last lecture the
two things that are happening at the

220
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:52,151
same time.

221
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:56,410
So the congress is trying to figure
out what to do about a possible war and

222
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,530
sending out the olive branch
petition at the same time.

223
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:01,240
Both of those things are
happening at the same time,

224
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,370
so they're not jumping into a war,

225
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,930
they're preparing defensive
measures on the British side.

226
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:12,010
The general assumption was
that a few strategic moves,

227
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:16,360
a couple of really grand
military maneuvers and maybe
one big display of power

228
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,370
and the whole thing would collapse.

229
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,230
That there's no way the
colonists could not be dumb,

230
00:14:21,231 --> 00:14:23,770
struck an odd by the
force of the British army,

231
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:25,510
so whatever it was going to happen,

232
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,660
there'd be one little clash and it would
be over and if they could just sees the

233
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:34,090
weapons and the ammunition and the
things that were being stockpiled,

234
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,690
they could sort of cut things
off before it even got any worse.

235
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:42,130
They could just collect the weapons
and take them away and that the power,

236
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:46,000
the ease with which they would have
marched at this point into New England and

237
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:50,320
seized arms and weapons would show the
colonists that this wasn't worth fighting.

238
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:52,640
It's not a fight worth fighting.
It's not a fight that they could fight.

239
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,620
So by trying to collect weapons,
trying to collect ammunition,

240
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,350
they're trying to stem again,
it's defensive.

241
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,800
They're trying to stop things
from getting worse. Now.

242
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,570
There were a few reasons why the British
would have assumed one little gesture,

243
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:13,490
and it's over. Now, obviously
the most obvious one is
just the British army. Okay?

244
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:18,140
We're talking to you about the British
army and a bunch of colonists who just

245
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:21,170
went out and decided maybe
we'd better drill now. Okay.

246
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,730
So certainly to the British, what
their thinking is, well, please,

247
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,670
you know that against us.
Okay,

248
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,390
we don't even have to worry about that.
But more than that,

249
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,960
the British also thought,
generally speaking,

250
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,170
that the colonists were a lot of
bluster and little more that they just,

251
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:44,150
they had, they had a lot of hot
air, they're in the colonies,

252
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,040
but that there actually
wasn't a lot more to them.

253
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,750
Certainly not a lot of bravery. And the
word cowards is tossed around a lot.

254
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:56,390
And in letters and writings and even in
speeches in parliament from this time

255
00:15:56,481 --> 00:16:01,310
period. So as an example, in the
House of Lords, someone apparently,

256
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,170
um, stands up and says, you know,

257
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:07,970
there are a lot of men in the colonies
who could fight against us if they chose

258
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:12,971
to fight the colonies abound in
men who could serve as soldiers.

259
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,090
So the Earl of sandwich stands
up and this is his response.

260
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,550
Suppose the colonies do a bound in men.
What does that signify?

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,090
They are raw, undisciplined, cowardly men.

262
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,430
I wish instead of 50 or
50,000 of these brave fellows,

263
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,260
they would produce in the field at least
200,000. The more the better. Okay?

264
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:36,540
That's,

265
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,310
that's a really good arrogant British
guy in the world of arrogant British

266
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:42,380
comyns. Believe me, my Lord,

267
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:47,000
the very sound of a canon would carry
them off as fast as their feet could carry

268
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:50,870
them. This is two trifling a part of the
argument to detain your Lordship's any

269
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:54,560
longer. Okay, please. We're not
talking about a real threat,

270
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,650
nor were the British very
impressed at the idea.

271
00:16:57,651 --> 00:17:02,651
That's the whole idea of
colonial civilians dressed
up suddenly in military garb

272
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:06,410
and suddenly positioning
themselves as soldiers.

273
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,650
So one English visitor to the colonies
wrote a letter to a friend in England and

274
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,210
express the same feeling.
He said,

275
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,060
it is a curious masquerade scene
to see graves, sober citizens,

276
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,200
barbers and tailors who never
looked fierce before in their lives,

277
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,720
but their wives,
children or apprentices.

278
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,290
He's always like the little backhanded
guys shoes that they totally,

279
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:34,520
it goes into these quotes so they've only
looked fierce before it. Their wives,

280
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:38,120
children are apprentices strutting
about in their Sunday wigs,

281
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:40,730
in stiff buckles with their
muskets on their shoulders.

282
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,220
Struggling to put on a
Marshall countenance.

283
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,510
If ever you saw a goose
assume an air of consequence,

284
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:52,810
you may catch some faint idea of the
foolish awkward puffed up stair of our

285
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:54,144
tradesmen.

286
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,580
The wig indeed is the most frightful thing
about them for it's very hairs seemed

287
00:17:58,581 --> 00:18:02,280
to bristle up in defiance of
the sh the soldiers. Okay,

288
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,630
that's a wonderful little passage about
exactly what some people thought it

289
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:08,610
looked like they were
doing in the colonies.

290
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,250
General gauge commanding the British
forces in America felt similarly.

291
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:19,410
That basically one big display of force
and they could close things off and you

292
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:24,120
can hear this as well as his impatience
with this sort of ongoing colonial

293
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:28,290
hostility to the troops that were
positioned in the colonies in some threats

294
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:33,291
that he made to some Boston radicals that
he met with in 1775 so according to an

295
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:37,020
account, he, he quote,

296
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,850
swore to it by the living God that if
there was a single man of the kings troops

297
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:45,360
killed in any of their towns
and the nanny of the your towns,

298
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:48,630
your Massachusetts downs,
he would burn it to the ground.

299
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:53,670
What fools you are to pretend to resist
the power of Great Britain. Okay?

300
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:58,020
That to me is like Darth Vader,
what fools you are. I was like, wow,

301
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,840
that's a statement of power. How dare
you hold yourselves against the empire,

302
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,480
the empire.

303
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,480
She maintained the last war 300,000 men
and we'll do the same now rather than

304
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:17,190
suffer the ungrateful people of this
country to continue in their rebellion.

305
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,140
Okay.
It's clear how gage fields,

306
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,050
so the colleges are preparing
to defend themselves.

307
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,090
The British and gauge are
assuming a little display,

308
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:29,310
a forceful and the manner neither side
is assuming there's a pending war and you

309
00:19:29,311 --> 00:19:33,660
can see both of these views and play at
a little event. It's not a big moment.

310
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:38,370
It's actually prior to Lexington
and Concord that plays out also in

311
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:43,371
Massachusetts in February of 1775 on
February 26 gauge decided that he would

312
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:47,220
have some troops moved to Salem,

313
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,510
Massachusetts to seize cannons and guns
that the colonists had collected there.

314
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:52,740
So this is part of that strategy.

315
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:57,150
Well let's just take the weapons away
and we'll march and we'll look impressive

316
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,870
and they will be nervous and
this will be good on all counts.

317
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,920
And I'm going to read from an account
of someone who was there actually,

318
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:09,360
who describes what he saw and
what happened on Sunday 26,

319
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:14,220
February, 1775 my father came home
from church rather sooner than usual,

320
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,440
which attracted my notice
and said to my mother,

321
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,220
the regulars are come and our marching
as fast as they can towards the north

322
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:23,970
fields bridge and looking towards
her with a very solemn face remarked,

323
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,160
I don't know what will be the consequence,

324
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,330
but something very serious and I wish
you to keep the children home. Okay,

325
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:34,560
so you've got a sense of, Huh? There's
like soldiers marching now towards us.

326
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,453
What does this mean?

327
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,960
I looked out of the window just at this
time and saw the troops passing the

328
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:43,350
house and apparently they were playing
Yankee doodle just to be insulting.

329
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,683
Um,

330
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,440
Colonel David Mason had received tidings
of the approach of the British troops

331
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,700
and ran into the North Church during
service and cried out at the top of his

332
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:58,930
voice. The regulars are coming
for the guns. At this point.

333
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,670
Several men ran out to move the
guns and the account continues.

334
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:08,470
My father looked in between the platoons
to see if he could recognize any of the

335
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:11,470
soldiers who had been stationed
at Fort William on the neck,

336
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,000
many of whom were known to him.

337
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:14,890
And that's always an
interesting little detail to me,

338
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,280
be soldiers had been there long enough
that there's just been mingling of

339
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:19,091
soldiers and people.

340
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:22,090
And so here are the troops are marching
and this person's father was sort of

341
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:24,100
going into the crowd to see
if there's someone here.

342
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:26,710
I know I could ask him what's happening
where, why are they coming here?

343
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:29,410
What are their plans?
But he could discover,

344
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:33,760
know familiar faces was black guarded
by the soldiers for his inquisitiveness.

345
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,420
Who asked him with odes what he was
looking at. You can actually hear that.

346
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,960
What are you looking at? Like
get out of the way. Okay,

347
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:45,400
so at this point there's a group of
colonists who see the advancing troops.

348
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,090
They go to this bridge that clearly the
British want to get to in March across

349
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:53,500
to get to the guns and the colonists
pull up a drawbridge so that the soldiers

350
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:54,520
can't go any further.

351
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:59,170
And now we get this sort of great
and somewhat bizarre standoff.

352
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,400
The British commander is standing on
one side and they were calling us on the

353
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:07,240
other side of the drawbridge is up and
the British commander said that his

354
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:11,140
troops would fire if the
colonists don't lower the bridge.

355
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,720
The local militia captain says,

356
00:22:13,721 --> 00:22:16,730
well if you fire then you're
all going to be dead men.

357
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,710
And supposedly the plan of the
militia captain was if anyone fired,

358
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,630
he was going to run at the head of the
British troops and kill him and then

359
00:22:25,631 --> 00:22:27,340
throw himself in the
river and drowned himself.

360
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,700
So he didn't get punished for killing
a British soldier. But he was like,

361
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,900
he had his plan, he was ready to
act. Okay. It's like a good plan.

362
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,830
Um, okay. So at this point soldiers,

363
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,590
civilians are eye witnesses.
It was that,

364
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:45,610
it was a cold day and he noticed that
these soldiers aren't wearing coats and

365
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:47,980
that actually they're beginning to look
really miserable and they're starting to

366
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:50,020
shiver cause they're just standing
there in front of the bridge,

367
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,330
unable to go anywhere.
And meanwhile,

368
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,600
some colonists climbed out on the other
side of the bridge and they're taunting

369
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,010
the soldiers and apparently one
particularly loud person yelled out,

370
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,340
soldiers, red jackets,
lobster coats, cowards,

371
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,540
damnation to your government and everybody
else shut them up because they really

372
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:11,920
didn't want to be fired upon.
Right?

373
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:13,660
It's one thing to just
like sit there and mumble.

374
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,590
It's another to say damnation to your
government and taunt the abrasion to

375
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:19,810
shooting.
At this point,

376
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:23,080
the British commander said that he would
get over the bridge if he had to stay

377
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:26,530
there until autumn. Right? He says,
by God, I will not be defeated.

378
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,100
To which the colonial captain
basically replies and said, yeah, well,

379
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:33,940
I think you already have been defeated
because you're here and the weapons are

380
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:35,560
there and I don't see you moving.

381
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,970
The British commander insisted
that this was the king's highway,

382
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,950
old Mr. James Bar, an Englishman and a
man of much nerve then replied to him,

383
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,700
it is not the king's highway.

384
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,450
It is a road built buddy owners
of the lots on the other side,

385
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:55,070
and no king country or town has anything
to do with it. Okay. King's highway,

386
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:58,580
my foot. So now the British
commander is stuck, right?

387
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:01,910
He doesn't want to lose face. He's not
going to surrender to these colonials.

388
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,380
He wants to do something. So this to me
is the most amazing part of the story.

389
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:10,520
He actually proposes to the militia
captain that if he and his men are allowed

390
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:11,660
to cross the bridge,

391
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:17,060
he promises that they will march
50 feet turn around and March back.

392
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:21,770
Right. It's like I won.
I got across the bridge.

393
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,830
They're not going to go after the weapons.
It's just a symbolic victory.

394
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,850
Like they got what they wanted,
the colonials back down,
we'll just march 50 feet,

395
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:31,610
we'll turn around and then march
away and that's exactly what happens.

396
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,870
They let them cross. They march,
they turn around and they march away.

397
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,740
Apparently with the troops marching to
the song, the world turned upside down.

398
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:43,400
We see. We're going to see that again in
the when there's an actual war, but okay.

399
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:44,720
Little symbolic.
Okay,

400
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:48,020
well maybe I didn't entirely lose
face kind of moment by the British.

401
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,460
So there you can see pretty literally
the British assuming that a little

402
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:57,110
marching, a few threats,
everything will fold. They'll
seize weapons, end of matter.

403
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,580
That didn't happen here.

404
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,330
You can see in the colonist sort
of standing there defensively,

405
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,690
not wanting to cause trouble,
but also not turning around and running.

406
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,370
They're defending.

407
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,660
Now at roughly this same
point back in England,

408
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,620
even as some members of parliament were
sneering at the idea of these sort of

409
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:20,150
fighting colonials and as soldiers were
trying to stave off trouble by seizing

410
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,090
weapons and ammunitions,
others in parliament,

411
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:28,091
we're actually thinking of trying to
extensive conciliatory gestures and maybe

412
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:31,010
that would actually end this
before it became a lot worse.

413
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,870
And in particular in the House of Lords,

414
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:37,220
William Pitt made a number of
proposals trying to smooth things over.

415
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:38,480
All of them were rejected.

416
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,860
So he proposes that perhaps they
actually couldn't recognize colonial self

417
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:47,330
government. Okay. That didn't go very
far. Surprise. Um, eat said, okay,

418
00:25:47,331 --> 00:25:51,740
well what about withdrawing British
troops from Boston? Rejected.

419
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,290
Instead in February, 1775 new England
is declared to be in rebellion,

420
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,440
but now we have one last
stab at reconciliation on
the part of the British Lord

421
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:03,494
North,

422
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,620
and I'm mentioning this here because I've
already talked about the olive branch

423
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:10,070
petition. In a way, this is the
equivalent on the other side of the ocean.

424
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:13,610
What we were going to see
here is one attempt to extend,

425
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:18,200
one more offer that maybe maybe at
this last second will stave things off.

426
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,090
People are trying to find a way out of
the problem and really struggling to find

427
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:28,070
some kind of mutual ground.
So Lord North passes a resolution.

428
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:33,071
It's ultimately called the conciliatory
resolution and it proposed that any

429
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:38,741
colony that contributed to the common
defense and supported the civil government

430
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:44,621
and the administration of justice would
be relieved of paying taxes or duties

431
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,360
except as needed to regulate commerce.
I'll repeat that.

432
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:53,420
The conciliatory resolution and February
17th 75 it proposes that any colony

433
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:57,090
that contributes to the common defense
and supports the civil government and the

434
00:26:57,091 --> 00:27:01,230
administration of justice
would be relieved of paying
taxes or duties except as

435
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:02,640
needed to regulate commerce.

436
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,540
Many in parliament were somewhat
stunned by this gesture.

437
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,620
Even though obviously parliament
is not giving up any of its rights.

438
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:12,090
It's just making a nice offer,

439
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:14,610
but it's not saying we
don't have the power to tax.

440
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:18,510
We're just saying we won't tax.
But many in parliament were stunned.

441
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,750
There's one observer said,
uncertainty, surprise, distraction.

442
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,640
We're seated on every countenance.

443
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:28,410
When this plan came forth to some the
seem to be backing down to others that

444
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:32,280
seem beside the point that basically
what the colonies needed was firmness and

445
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:33,330
these kinds of concessions.

446
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:36,510
We weren't really going to do anything
but the resolution goes forward.

447
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,490
North sends it on to the colonies.

448
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,650
He very deliberately did not send it to
the continental congress which he didn't

449
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:44,484
recognize,

450
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:49,020
but instead he sent it to individual
colonial assemblies thinking that if some

451
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:53,670
of them, even just the
handful of individual colonial
assemblies agreed to this,

452
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,240
then the colonies would be divided and
this is an example of something we're

453
00:27:57,241 --> 00:28:01,230
going to see again and again and again
in a variety of ways in the process of

454
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:02,070
fighting the war.

455
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,820
It's a really common assumption on the
part of the British that all they need to

456
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:08,890
do is just divide the colonies and that
there are any number of ways in which it

457
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:12,690
will be really easy to just
sort of ruin their loyalties,

458
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,720
turn them against each other and then
this whole thing can be brought to a close

459
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,380
and what we'll see is what they're
underestimating. On the one hand it's,

460
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:20,670
I've already talked about in lectures,

461
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,940
we've seen how hard it is for the
colonies to do anything jointly,

462
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,940
but we've also seen if
there's an outside threat,

463
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:32,220
they actually come together relatively
effectively for short period of time.

464
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,900
So at the British are underestimating
here is that actually there is some unity.

465
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:41,490
There is a sense of United cause
because of an outside threat.

466
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,960
So north pass is the resolution.
Um,

467
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:49,260
obviously it did not go far enough at
this point for the colonial leaders.

468
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,800
It's still maintained the
right of parliament to
basically do what it wanted to

469
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:53,760
do with taxes.

470
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,120
But also in addition to not being enough
of a gesture towards reconciliation,

471
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,410
the timing was really poor because it
didn't reach the colonies until after the

472
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:08,460
outbreak of fighting at
Lexington and Concord. Now,

473
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,800
given what I described at Salem,

474
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:16,050
you can see the continued logic of what
the British troops were attempting to do

475
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,460
at Lexington and Concord. Basically,
they want to seize powder.

476
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:23,010
They want to see his arms, they want to
get the weapons, they're gonna March.

477
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,200
They're going to have
an impressive display,

478
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:28,080
grabbed the stuff and leave
and make a big impact.

479
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,150
Americans were very closely
watching the troops by this time.

480
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:37,170
They knew as soon as the troops
set out that they were marching,

481
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:37,981
even though the troops,

482
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:41,130
apparently we're trying to be somewhat
secretive about what they were doing.

483
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,960
And here we have the famous Paul Revere
moment and the Poor William Dawes,

484
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:49,270
the poor neglected Willie's cause
like me too. He was there too.

485
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:53,200
He was riding along both of them. Paul
Revere and William Dawes, uh, writing,

486
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:57,070
basically telling people that the
British regulars are on the move.

487
00:29:57,071 --> 00:29:57,940
They're on the march.

488
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,050
Meanwhile the British are marching
towards Lexington on their way to Concord,

489
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:06,400
which is where the arms are and they're
beginning to become nervous because

490
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:10,180
before they get to towns they can
hear the church bells ringing.

491
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,110
So basically some things going on in that
town and we haven't gotten there yet.

492
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,600
So somehow or other,
they know we're coming.

493
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,140
One soldier later described how a quote,

494
00:30:20,141 --> 00:30:25,141
very genteel man in a carriage stopped
and told them that there were 600 armed

495
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:29,530
men waiting for them on Lexington
common. Okay. As we'll see,

496
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:31,360
there were not 600 are men.

497
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,430
There were maybe roughly 70 men who
heard the church bell knew that was a bad

498
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:39,940
thing, grabbed their weapons and went to
Lexington, common in her sort of steady,

499
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:40,420
they're okay.

500
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:45,420
Not 600 the British entered Lexington
at about four o'clock in the morning.

501
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,970
They saw this group of about
70 people on Lexington.

502
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:51,490
Common supposedly yelled rebels,

503
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:56,470
disperse America's later claim that what
they said was you damn rebels lay down

504
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:58,420
your arms.
So Americans always hear the,

505
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:03,580
if there is a sliver of the Americans
here at at which point a gun was fired and

506
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:07,750
it's unclear who fired the gun.
But when that gun was fired,

507
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:11,590
the British opened fire. There were
a few American shots and return.

508
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:15,430
The American commander told his men
quote to take care of themselves,

509
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:17,230
which means run if you want.

510
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,980
And so they did leaving behind eight dead,

511
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:23,440
roughly eight dead and 10 wounded.

512
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,850
And now the British continue
on pushing onto Concord,

513
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:31,330
which is why they came there in the first
place to get the powder that's being

514
00:31:31,331 --> 00:31:35,080
stored there. And they actually
met more militia men on the way.

515
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,780
And when they marched on them,
these people actually fled,

516
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,630
which is in a sense what
they really expecting.

517
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,540
The British began to destroy
these colonial stores,

518
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,430
the ammunition and the weapons.
Meanwhile,

519
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:52,870
the colonist collected near the North
Bridge to stop the British and a few

520
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:57,370
British shots were fired. Americans fired
a few shots back before they withdrew.

521
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,190
Again,
it's only a temporary retreat,

522
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:02,950
so the Americans keep doing something
and then fleeing and then coming back and

523
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:03,310
then fleeing.

524
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:06,820
It's a temporary retreat on the parts
of the colonist because as a British

525
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:10,990
officer later reported as they left
Concord after they destroyed these

526
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:12,840
ammunitions quote,

527
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,900
we were fired on from houses and behind
trees and before we had gone a half mile,

528
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,340
we were fired on from all sides,

529
00:32:18,341 --> 00:32:22,030
but mostly from the rear where people
had hid themselves in houses until we had

530
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:25,330
passed and then fired.
The country was an amazing,

531
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:28,630
strong one full of hills,
woods, stone walls,

532
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:31,990
which the rebels did not fail to
take advantage of in this way.

533
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,240
We marched between nine and 10 miles.

534
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,310
Their numbers increasing from all
parts while ours was reduced by deaths,

535
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,730
wounds,
and fatigued.

536
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:46,340
And another officer later recalled that
he heard colonist and actually even saw

537
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:50,850
some of them standing in the road
yelling out king Hancock forever. Okay.

538
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,490
Where that came from,
I can't tell you,

539
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:56,300
but they're out there sort of
declaring their political cause.

540
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:02,330
This is hardly what the British expected.
And for that matter, in a sense,

541
00:33:02,331 --> 00:33:06,590
the colonist didn't expect
that sort of event to unfold.

542
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,340
But this level of colonial resistance
to the British was a surprise as another

543
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:15,290
British soldier put it.

544
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:20,710
The enthusiastic zeal with which these
people have behaved must convince every

545
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:26,501
reasonable man what a difficult and
unpleasant task general gauge has before

546
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:29,970
him.
Even women had fire locks.

547
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,110
British response on the one hand is,
oh, okay. They didn't just melt away.

548
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,510
This will be unpleasant for general gauge.

549
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,970
All told roughly 250 British
soldiers were killed.

550
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,920
Roughly 95 Americans for the British.

551
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,010
Obviously this suggests that
little display of military might,

552
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,040
might not be enough for the colonists.

553
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:58,880
It revealed the existence of an
honest to goodness, physical threat.

554
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,840
As John Adams put it,
Lexington was proof that quote,

555
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,650
if we did not defend ourselves,
they would kill us.

556
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,650
I don't always just states it.
Okay.

557
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,380
Almost immediately,

558
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:16,880
people from both sides began
to use the clash as propaganda,

559
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,060
basically playing it up so
that they seem defensive.

560
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,130
And the other side seems as
though it's the aggressor.

561
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:27,170
So colonists sent writers out to tell
people in other towns and other colonies

562
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,380
about how the British had killed
every person they came across.

563
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,920
Women and children, they driven
pregnant women into the street.

564
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:38,510
They shot dead old men. You know, it's
like anything we can think of. They did.

565
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,490
So obviously they're exaggerating a bit
what happened in Lexington and Concord,

566
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,950
but British accounts
were no less creative.

567
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,970
The British accused Americans
of scalping dead and dying.

568
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:52,640
British soldiers claiming quote,
they were full,

569
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:57,020
as bad as the Indians for scalping and
cutting the dead man's ears and noses off

570
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,620
and those they get alive that are wounded
and can't get off the ground. Okay?

571
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:04,910
They're scalping live men. Those colonists
is what the British are charging.

572
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,880
They claim that the
Americans had fired first,

573
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,510
that Americans didn't fight fair
because they were hiding that they were

574
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:14,870
cowardly because they were lying on
their bellies hiding instead of standing

575
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:17,930
upright, which is how a traditional
army was supposed to fight.

576
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,430
But both sides clearly are positioning
themselves as being defensive.

577
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:26,690
At this point in June,
June of 1775,

578
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:32,020
the English got more evidence that the
Americans weren't just going to run when

579
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:37,721
colonists attempted to station themselves
on breed's hill in overlooking Boston,

580
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,500
not bunker hill actually, but retail, um,
and the Americans were thinking, well,

581
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:45,840
this will be very strategic if
we go to the top of this hill.

582
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:46,950
It overlooks Boston.

583
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:50,820
It's a good place for us to have power
and control over the British see that as

584
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:55,560
well. And they attack to
prevent the colonists from
taking control of that hill.

585
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,960
That conflict is later called
the battle of Bunker Hill.

586
00:35:57,961 --> 00:35:59,580
It should be the battle of breed's hill,

587
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,650
but although the British ultimately
did claim the hill and could claim a

588
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:07,650
victory,
it was a pretty expensive victory.

589
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,940
They lost roughly 1000 out of 2000 men.

590
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:17,250
They had enormous casualties.
The Americans lost roughly 400 men,

591
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:21,270
so the British really suffered a
lot of losses and at this point,

592
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:25,020
gauge learned a lesson as he observed.

593
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:28,170
After seeing all of these clashes,
the colonists were quote,

594
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:33,270
not the despicable rabble, too
many of suppose them to be, wow,

595
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:35,760
there are less of a despicable
rebel than I thought they were.

596
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,030
These people show a spirit
and conduct against us.

597
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,630
They never showed against the French,
which I also think is interesting.

598
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:43,291
What he's saying is,
well,

599
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:46,650
we thought we knew these people from that
French and Indian war and they weren't

600
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:50,850
too impressive then, but they're
actually behaving differently now.

601
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,660
Everybody has judged of them from
their former appearance and behavior.

602
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,450
When joined with the king's
forces in the last war,

603
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,730
which has led many integrate mistakes,

604
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,940
they are now spirited up
by a rage and enthusiasm.

605
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:08,090
As great as people were possessed
of colonists also learned a lesson,

606
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,590
and you can see this most dramatically
in New York state, New York.

607
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,490
At the time,

608
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:18,660
there were a number of conservatives and
loyalists who were in power in New York.

609
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,850
It wasn't a radical colony.
Um,

610
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,160
they had actually sent more conservative
delegates to the first continental

611
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:26,820
congress.

612
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,150
There had even been talk in New York
about not sending delegates to the second

613
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:34,440
continental congress because good men
got corrupted when they went to hang out

614
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:37,500
with those scary radical guys
in the continental congress.

615
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:42,770
And basically the crown saw New York as
a good thing because they were sort of

616
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:45,330
more loyal than many
of the other colonies.

617
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,200
That's New York before the
events I've talked about today,

618
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:53,010
after these events,
New York made something of a turnaround.

619
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,530
They hanged Lord North in effigy,

620
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:01,220
they seem seized arms belonging to the
city and distributed them to citizens.

621
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:06,030
And ultimately the British marched out
of New York City and retreated to a ship

622
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,170
in the harbor with the colonist grabbing
at their baggage and their ammunition

623
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,333
as they left.

624
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:16,020
So that obviously shows that there
is an impact all over the colonies.

625
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:21,021
People began to feel the need to prepare
for war as one colon his throat in July

626
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,880
of 1775 travel through whatever
part of this country you will,

627
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:31,830
you see the inhabitance training,
making fire locks, casting mortars,

628
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,750
shells and shot and making salt.

629
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:38,751
Peter Philadelphia was decorated with
flags announcing liberty or death.

630
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,980
People are really now
motivated with a real,

631
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,330
I guess rage and enthusiasm is a good
way of putting it at these recent events.

632
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,620
So now you can,

633
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:52,621
you truly do get a sense of
how the colonies were indeed
set on fire in 1775 you

634
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:58,270
can see what it is that
pain was responding to.

635
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:04,290
You can see why in January of 1776
when common sense was published,

636
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:09,580
why it had the impact it did because
people were ready to hear its message.

637
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:13,810
They were willing to at least begin to
consider independence because of what was

638
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:17,890
unfolding in 1775 things.

639
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:21,610
We're at a difficult point at this point
and if you step back and just look at

640
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:23,830
the larger logic of what's going on,

641
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:28,600
you can really see how difficult it would
have been defined your way out of this

642
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:29,434
situation.

643
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:34,750
The British administration couldn't
really yield to demands of the continental

644
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:38,920
congress without sacrificing its
sovereignty over the colonies.

645
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,480
And I suppose in their eyes
also humiliating itself
before the eyes of the world

646
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,550
along similar lines.

647
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:50,730
The con is couldn't really back down
about their demands without seeming to

648
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:55,240
surrender what they consider to be
some of their fundamental rights.

649
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:58,870
And they suspected British attempts
at conciliation anyway because they,

650
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,100
every time the British made any sort of
gesture that seemed to be moving in the

651
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:06,100
right direction, their thought was,
well, yeah, they're trying to appease us.

652
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,930
So we stopped protesting, but they're just
going to be tyrants underneath it all.

653
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:11,381
There's,
there's,

654
00:40:11,381 --> 00:40:16,300
they're basically trying to make us
quiet so they can impose Tierney upon us.

655
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,820
But I do want to point out, and I've just
described all of these dramatic events,

656
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:26,500
men being killed, battles,
people rate, storing arms,

657
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,180
a lot of drama.

658
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:34,090
But I've talked about 1775
throughout this entire class, right.

659
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:37,930
And independence isn't declared
the roughly a year later.

660
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,091
Again,

661
00:40:40,091 --> 00:40:44,950
which is a really dramatic way of
seeing that war is not inevitable,

662
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,580
that people are struggling to avoid it
even as they're doing all of this and

663
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:52,840
taking all of these actions and acting
in the moment at what's unfolding.

664
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,390
Even after Lexington and Concord,

665
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:00,870
in July of 1775 the continental congress
still sends out that olive branch

666
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,893
petition.

667
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,570
The American saw themselves as
Britain's as well as Americans.

668
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:12,870
They were defending their
rights as British subjects
and only over time did they

669
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:16,360
really gradually work their
way towards independence.

670
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,590
They had first assumed that there was
a small group of corrupt government

671
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:24,670
ministers who may be were leading things
the wrong way. Then they decided, well,

672
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:27,400
maybe it was parliament
that was the problem.

673
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,660
And only when the last prop
of the British constitution,

674
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:34,580
the monarch proved death to their cause.

675
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:39,770
Did colonist begin to feel
that independence might
be possible and ultimately

676
00:41:39,771 --> 00:41:44,660
maybe it was going to be necessary.
Okay, so where does this leave us?

677
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,260
Well,

678
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:50,260
obviously it leaves us with a really
enormous looming challenge facing the

679
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,270
continental Congress,
right?

680
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,540
Think about the kind of El Congress
doesn't really have any power.

681
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:59,240
All these delegates in there and now poof,

682
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:03,860
they somehow have to help organize a
United war effort with no mechanism for

683
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:07,010
doing anything in a
United organized manner.

684
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,250
And I'm going to end the
lecture by letting John Adams
sum up this challenge at

685
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:13,401
this point,

686
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:17,030
what it felt like to be in the
continental congress at this scary point.

687
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,220
And he wrote this letter in 1775
to whose wife actually to Abigail.

688
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:28,090
And he wrote when 50 or 60 men have a
constitution to form for a great empire.

689
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:32,900
I liked the fact that it's a great
empire already. At the same time,

690
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:37,901
they have a country of 1500 miles extent
to fortify millions to arm and train a

691
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:43,550
naval power to begin an extensive
commerce to regulate numerous tribes of

692
00:42:43,551 --> 00:42:48,551
Indians to negotiate with a Standing
Army of 27,000 men to raise pay.

693
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,420
Visceral and officer,

694
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:55,220
I shall really pity those 50 or 60 men.
Okay.

695
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,060
So that's Adam's saying, boy,
I'm not looking forward to this.

696
00:42:59,061 --> 00:43:01,490
This is going to be an enormous task.

697
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,210
And what we're going to be looking
at Tuesday is that very thing.

698
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:10,160
How do you hold a war? How do you
begin to organize this kind of effort?

699
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,620
What were the things that
Congress immediately did?

700
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,630
George Washington is going to appear.

701
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:17,270
That's one of the things the continental
congress does at an early point,

702
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,180
is find,
try to create a continental army,

703
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:23,390
and Washington walks onto the
national scene at this point.

704
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,380
So we will look at the unfolding of the
war from a different angle. Next week.

705
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:28,760
I will stop there.
