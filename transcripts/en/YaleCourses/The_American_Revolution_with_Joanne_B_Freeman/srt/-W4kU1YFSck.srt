1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,820
So let's actually begin today's lecture.
Um,

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,970
which is I've titled Ever at variants
and foolishly jealous intercolonial

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,730
relations.
And the,

4
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:19,260
the quote part of that title ever at
variance and foolishly jealous actually

5
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:24,261
comes from a colonist named Joseph Warren
who was writing to a friend probably

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,250
1766, I think. It doesn't matter.

7
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:31,110
It's actually the quotes not
highly significant for you,

8
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:34,890
but the point of it is he was writing to
a friend and what he says to his friend

9
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:37,680
is,
until the passage of the stamp act,

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,810
the colonies had always been quote,
ever at variance and foolishly jealous,

11
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:46,110
which is kind of going to be the point
of today's lecture ever at variance and

12
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:48,630
foolishly jealous,
but now with the stamp act,

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,970
but people seem to be a
little bit more United.

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,800
So today's lecture is the
foolishly jealous part. And um,

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,380
on Tuesday we plunge into the stamp act,

16
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:03,360
which moves us to the more United part
and actually begins a sort of series of

17
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:07,410
events that are actually going to
build up to a logic of resistance.

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,380
So I'm going to be talking today about
basically intercolonial relations about

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,500
how people in the different
colonies viewed each other
about how the colonies as

20
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:23,280
entities interacted with each other.
And towards the end of the lecture,

21
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:28,281
I'm going to talk about colonial attempts
before the 1760s for them to unite

22
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:33,600
colonial attempts to unite and act
together. And as we're going to see today,

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,720
they weren't really amazingly
successful, those attempts. So,

24
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,300
and there were only three of them
that I'm going to talk about,

25
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,010
but unity is not taken for granted that
I suppose will be one message of today's

26
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:46,470
lecture. Don't take unity,
colonial unity for granted.

27
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,760
And that's going to lead us up perfectly
to the next lecture on the Stamp Act

28
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:51,211
crisis,

29
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:55,680
which is then going to have people
shifting a point of view because of the

30
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:59,430
crisis at hand. Okay.
So basically in a way,

31
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:02,880
today's lecture as the third and
last in a series of lectures,

32
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:07,290
it's really been laying the groundwork
for our immersion into colonial conflict.

33
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,290
So we've looked at the links between
colonists and the mother country.

34
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,440
We looked at aspects of colonial
life and settlement that were kind of

35
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,450
distinctly colonial American.

36
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,950
And now we're sort of laying the last
plank in of the British American mindset

37
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:24,210
at the time. And that's how the colonies
were relating with each other. Okay.

38
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,000
And I again,
I sort of,

39
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,450
and Freeman's top five tips that I
offered in the introductory lecture that I

40
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:32,940
gave top five tips towards understanding
the revolution. And I said,

41
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:34,660
remember contingency.
Um,

42
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,740
and I suppose that's a sort of sub
theme of today's lecture because we,

43
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,900
we so assume the logic and um,

44
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,370
inevitability of a unified nation
at some point down the pike.

45
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:47,570
I think it's really easy for us to forget
some of the things that I'm going to

46
00:02:47,571 --> 00:02:48,450
be talking about today,

47
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:53,451
which all add up to unity did not make
sense a lot of the time now I think to

48
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,190
really appreciate ultimately
how significant the first
little glimmerings at

49
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,090
union were.

50
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,980
We first have to understand the vast
differences between the different colonies

51
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,880
and the different regions because
people at the time definitely did.

52
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,860
They were always complaining and remarking
on people from other regions about

53
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,980
how weird they were about
their bizarre manners,

54
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:22,420
about the weird way they dressed about
their strange attitude constantly.

55
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,710
People from all regions,

56
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,900
all colonies sort of remarking in and not
necessarily favorable way about people

57
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:33,220
from other places. And I want to start, I
want to offer you a couple examples. Um,

58
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,900
and I want to start with Thomas Jefferson,
who in the seventies and eighties,

59
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,410
um,

60
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,300
devoted some of his energies to
explaining America to a French audience.

61
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,180
And as you'll hear in
some of these quotes,

62
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,670
he's going to definitely be
sounding like a Virginian. Um,

63
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,200
and of course what's interesting to
note about Jefferson is I'll quote him

64
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:55,220
another time in today's lecture.
Um,

65
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,710
Jefferson strongest remarks about America
or American character are always made

66
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:03,280
to a foreign audience, right? He
doesn't make them to Americans.

67
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,760
So like notes on the state of Virginia,
which has some remarkable passages in it.

68
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,130
He didn't think that Americans
are going to be reading that.

69
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:13,660
That was actually for a French audience
and it sorta came back across the ocean.

70
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,030
So a lot of what I'm going
to be quoting here today,

71
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,510
he was not quoting for Americans.
He's actually speaking to the French,

72
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:22,150
which you can say a lot of blunt
things to the French that you wouldn't

73
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:26,200
necessarily say to fellow
Americans. So, okay. In 1786,

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,570
um, he wrote to a French correspondent
who clearly had written to him in some way

75
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,250
and said, you know, tell
me about America. Um,

76
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,610
so Jefferson writes back,

77
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,270
and I'm going to talk a little bit
about his view of all of the states,

78
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:41,770
but in this particular instance,

79
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:47,130
he writes back and says he's very curious
about why Rhode Island is opposed to

80
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:50,650
every useful preposition. Okay.
Road. I told you about Rhode Island.

81
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:52,270
I fore warned you about Ra,
Rhode Island.

82
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,060
We have to have a Rhode
Island moment here. Um,

83
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,400
because it appears it's
going to appear again.

84
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:00,260
I mentioned also the Connecticut
was going to appear again. Um,

85
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,030
Rhode Island was particularly troublesome.
Um,

86
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,710
it was actually the last date to join the
union and it actually joined the union

87
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,010
after the Constitution had
already gone into effect.

88
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,420
So when Washington becomes president
and he goes on his first grant triumphal

89
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:20,770
tour, oh, I will no, go around the nation
showing everyone that I am president.

90
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,180
He first swing through the north and
he actually refuses to cross the border

91
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:29,710
into Rhode Island because Rhode Island
is a foreign country and he doesn't want

92
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:32,290
to go there. Okay. He was making
a kind of strong statement.

93
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,580
Rhode Island wasn't
really happy about this,

94
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:37,620
but it was their fault because they
hadn't ratified the constitution yet. Um,

95
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,720
a really popular thing to do at the
time in taverns was to drink 12 toasts,

96
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,980
not 13 as a deliberate insult
to Rhode Island. It's like,

97
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:51,840
so they aren't Rhode Island. Of course
you also get to drink 12 toasts that day.

98
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,670
That's the other happy thing about that.
But at any rate,

99
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,620
so Rhode Island is an issue.
It's going to come up again today even.

100
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,830
So Jefferson was trying
to figure out what is,

101
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,500
what is the deal about Rhode Island
and here is what he explained how he

102
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:06,890
explains it.
Rhode Island's geography accounts for it.

103
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,840
With the aid of one or two observations,

104
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,500
the cultivators of the earth
are the most virtuous citizens.

105
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,070
It's very Jeffersonian merchants
are the least virtuous.

106
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,760
The ladder reside principally
in the seaport towns,

107
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:22,400
the former in the interior country.
Now,

108
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:25,820
what happened then of the territory
constituting Rhode Island and Connecticut,

109
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,620
the part containing the seaports was
erected into a state by itself and called

110
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:34,070
Rhode Island and that containing of
the interior country was erected into

111
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:37,010
another state called Connecticut.
For though it has a little sea coast,

112
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,110
there are no good ports in it hands.

113
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,740
It happens that there is
scarcely one merchant in the
whole state of Connecticut.

114
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,730
While there's not a single man in Rhode
Island who was not a merchant of some

115
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:48,860
sort. I guess probably a
little bit of an exaggeration.

116
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,690
This circumstance has decided
the characters of the two
states and the remedies

117
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,790
to this evil are hazardous.

118
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,300
One would be to consolidate
the two states into one. Right.

119
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:00,650
That's a really popular idea.

120
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,980
Another would be to banish
from Ireland from the union.

121
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,860
Thank you Thomas Jefferson.
Is Anyone here for Rhode Island?

122
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,910
There are no Rhode Islanders
I bashing safely. Wow.

123
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,960
No one can come get me one time
someone did say, excuse me,

124
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,870
I'm from Rhode Island so I'm safe.
This is dangerous.

125
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,250
Um, so number one, you could consolidate
Connecticut and Rhode Island. Number two,

126
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:26,960
you could banish what
island from the union.

127
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,640
Number three would be to compel the
submission of Rhode Island to the wheel of

128
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:34,370
the other states. Right. He
has an issue with Rhode Island,

129
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:38,120
but Rhode Island has issues. Um,
he's speaking partly as a southerner,

130
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:40,850
but a lot of other people had
questions about Rhode Island as well.

131
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,740
And about the same time, different
French correspondent, once again,

132
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:48,770
Jefferson writing about the character
of the northern states and the character

133
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:52,160
of the southern states.
And Jefferson writes in the north,

134
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,810
they are cool, sober,
laborious, persevering,

135
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,300
independent,
jealous of their own liberties.

136
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:01,760
And just to those of others interested,

137
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,680
she caning cheating superstitious
and hypocritical and their religion.

138
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,660
Thank you. Thomas Jefferson in the south,
they are firing voluptuary, indolent,

139
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,510
unsteady, independent, zealous
for their own liberties,

140
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:17,450
but trampling on those of
others. Generous, candid,

141
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,940
without attachment or
pretensions to any religion.

142
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:24,230
But that of the heart and spoken like
a Virginia and according to Jefferson,

143
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:28,220
as he explains to this Frenchman and
observing traveler without the aid of a

144
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:29,000
quadrant,

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,810
may always know his latitude
by the character of the
people among whom he finds

146
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:34,940
himself like he really believes in,

147
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:38,270
is very different people in the
different colonies and to Jefferson,

148
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:42,050
Pennsylvania with sort of the perfect
happy medium where the two characters kind

149
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:45,290
of met and blended and form to people,
which as he put it,

150
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,140
we're free from the extremes,
both of vice and virtue.

151
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,910
Now that's Jeffersonian rhetoric.
There's a lot of Jeffersonian rhetoric.

152
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,340
George Washington,
a man have much fewer words,

153
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,590
put his views about the north a lot
more succinctly. Okay. To Washington,

154
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,810
New Englanders were as he put it in 1777
right when he joined the continental

155
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:10,590
army and the continental army is in
Massachusetts. Washington joins the army.

156
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,590
He heads up to Massachusetts and the
army is largely made of new Englanders

157
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,680
confronts the army and he
writes to a friend and says,

158
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:21,140
new Englanders are an exceeding,
dirty and nasty people. Okay,

159
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,750
that's us. Sorry, father of our country.

160
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,030
We didn't live up to his demands.

161
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,000
Now new Englanders to be fair, had
similar feelings about the south. Right?

162
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:36,630
They thought southerners were
snooty, aristocratic, proud. Um,

163
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:40,890
I once in a diary came across a passage
in which there's a Pennsylvania and he's

164
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:45,330
sitting at a dinner table with
some Virginians. And in his diary,

165
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:48,240
of course he's complaining about this
because he says all they did through the

166
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:51,930
entire dinner was talk about gambling,
horseracing,

167
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,310
Virginia Ham and drinking and
drinking and drinking and drinking.

168
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:58,040
And the parents are this Pennsylvania.

169
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:03,260
I guess that's what Virginia is
gambling and drinking Virginia.

170
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,100
Now, John Adams with a little
bit of a dose of Puritan guilt,

171
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,120
felt that new Englanders were the
best trained in the school of popular

172
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:12,954
government,

173
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,040
but that they weren't really skilled
and personal relations as he put it.

174
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,080
New Englanders are awkward, bashful,
Pert, ostentatious and vein.

175
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,010
A mixture which excites ridicule and
gives, discussed some part of me,

176
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:30,390
thinks he was speaking about himself
when he could've been. Southerners.

177
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:34,090
He claims were skilled at display
and gentlemanly manners. Um,

178
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,400
but according to Adams, they were
habituated to hire notions of themselves.

179
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,820
And the distinction between them
and the common people than we are.

180
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,040
So they're basically snootier
according to John Adams.

181
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:49,190
So comments like all of
these are reminders about how
very different the sort of

182
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,830
colony countries were from each other.

183
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,930
They did each have different distinctive
characters and maybe equally important.

184
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,760
They often distrusted one another.

185
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,350
So in a sense colonies often had more
of a connection with the mother country

186
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:05,184
than with each other.

187
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,930
Now this is partly due to
pragmatic concerns like bad roads,

188
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,950
like the fact that there actually was
not a huge bustling amount of inter

189
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:18,360
colonial trade because colonies really
did focus their trading energies on the

190
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:20,880
mother country and not
so much with each other.

191
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,170
And then also there were a lot of
border conflicts between colonies,

192
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,760
which caused distrust and complications
between colonies and also help to

193
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:30,660
discourage trade.

194
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,450
Now the colonies were hostile to each
other because they were seeing to their

195
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:37,530
own interests,

196
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,700
but also it's kind of reflected in the
comments that I opened the lecture with.

197
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,710
There also was just basic cultural
distrust. Now as I head into this,

198
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:51,210
it's worth noting that there actually
were three different types of colonies.

199
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,210
There were three different ways
in which colonies were founded,

200
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,490
and these differences could sometimes
affect the structure of the colony and its

201
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:01,870
relations with the mother country.

202
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,960
So this is going to be very quick and
dirty version of these three kinds of

203
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:07,660
colonies. Um, type of colony number one,

204
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,770
you had corporate colonies like
Connecticut and Rhode Island, um,

205
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,850
incorporated by puritans
who left Massachusetts and
basically a corporate colony

206
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:22,180
made its own constitution and it
was then ratified by the king.

207
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,540
So these are independently
founded colonies.

208
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,120
They're clearly independent in spirit,

209
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,210
which makes them potentially troublesome,

210
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,430
not potentially troublesome,
just makes them troublesome. Um,

211
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,980
so corporate colonies is
type of colony number one.

212
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,580
You also had proprietary colonies like
Pennsylvania and Maryland where the king

213
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:49,450
would give ownership of the
colony to someone. So for example,

214
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:52,420
William Penn is a
proprietor in Pennsylvania.

215
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,480
Lord Baltimore is the
proprietor in Maryland.

216
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,860
So you have corporate colonies,
you have proprietary colonies.

217
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:02,890
And the third kind of
colony is a royal colony,

218
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,990
which is owned by the king.
So royal colonies include New York,

219
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:11,290
South Carolina, North Carolina,
Georgia, and Massachusetts.

220
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,270
It's the whole range of colonies.

221
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:16,540
I basically haven't named
in those earlier colonies.

222
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,600
A lot of these colonies were royal
colonies. They were owned by the king.

223
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,520
Now of the three,
in some ways,

224
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,480
corporate colonies were the closest
to what would eventually become states

225
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,690
because corporate colonies had
drawn up their own constitution.

226
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,450
They made their own charter
and what that actually means.

227
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,760
And the charter was made by the
people who lived in the colony.

228
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,440
And what that actually means is,
um,

229
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:43,720
once independent is independence is
declared and all of these newly created

230
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:48,670
states need to create a new constitution,
which writes out royal authority.

231
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,300
Connecticut kind of had its own little
charter in Rhode Island to, to begin with.

232
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,090
They kind of already there is
little independent entities.

233
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,230
They were a little ahead of the game.

234
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:58,810
They sort of had their own constitution
that needed a little tweaking.

235
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,210
But really all these other colonies were
sort of starting from scratch. Okay. So,

236
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:09,160
so those are kind of basic structural
institutional differences between these

237
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:13,750
three kinds of colonies.
But beyond their basic structure.

238
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,950
There are also things about the social
structure and the culture of the

239
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:21,220
different regions and colonies
that differentiated them and,

240
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,140
and bread some distrust.

241
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,430
So let's just look for just a few
minutes at the different regions.

242
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:32,350
And let's start with New England. Now
logically enough, this is not a surprise.

243
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:37,351
New England had the most structured
institutional base of the colonies because

244
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:43,060
of its puritan roots. So just think about
the whole idea of the New England town.

245
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,640
And that's what I'm talking about here.
In general,

246
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,550
New England colonies were
divided into townships.

247
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,030
Each township was oriented around
the church. Traditionally speaking,

248
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:55,910
your church fathers,
where your town fathers,

249
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,110
the church felt responsible not
only for your soul and church,

250
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:03,620
but also for your soul as
displayed in your everyday life.

251
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,610
So there actually were church officials
who sometimes went from home to home to

252
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:11,450
be sure that you were living properly
biting by godly standards of living.

253
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,590
And that's, uh, that's sort of really
strong institutional base of settlement.

254
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,860
Now as commerce boomed in New England,

255
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,880
the sort of pure church orientation of
New England society got a little bit

256
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:27,710
diluted, but still it had an enormous
impact on the tone of life in the northern

257
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:28,544
colonies.

258
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,940
Also because of new England's puritan
roots and the puritan respect for the word

259
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:37,970
is presented in the Bible and you needed
to be able to read and understand the

260
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,020
Bible for yourself.

261
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,040
Literacy was particularly high in the
New England colonies and New England

262
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:46,550
colleges.

263
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,770
Harvard and Yale were generally superior
to most of the other colleges at the

264
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:53,630
time.
Although King's college in New York,

265
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:57,260
which is now Columbia and the College
of New Jersey, which is now Princeton,

266
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,730
also ranked high. William
and Mary in Virginia was kind
of in a different league.

267
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:06,050
And I'm gonna come back to that. Um, and
also to Uva, which is where I got my phd.

268
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,840
I'm in a few minutes now.

269
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:13,870
New England was mostly mostly
composed of small farms,

270
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,940
supported by family labor.

271
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:21,230
And there was some slave labor and it
was the least in all of the colonies.

272
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:26,270
And there were roughly 35 white
Europeans to every one slave

273
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,010
because of its original puritan origins.

274
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:35,750
So because of its original
focus on excluding all but
the likeminded who shared

275
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,790
their religious sense of purpose,

276
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,380
New England was not really
diverse religiously or ethnically,

277
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,380
and it was this lack of diversity.

278
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,830
You kind of insular nature of New England
society that made many people think of

279
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:52,400
doing lenders is kind of what their
word for it was unmixed, you know,

280
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:55,670
sort of stiff and awkward. They're
not used to being out in the world.

281
00:16:55,671 --> 00:16:58,610
They don't know how to have conversations
with people who aren't like them.

282
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,310
You're sort of weird because they
only know other new Englanders.

283
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:07,390
But the same sort of relative lack of
diversity also allowed new Englanders to

284
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:11,180
unite quickly and powerfully if they felt
that their rights were being impinged

285
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:11,840
upon,

286
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,680
as we'll see during the first phases of
the revolution within the next week or

287
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:17,420
so.
So that's new England,

288
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,860
the middle colonies in at least one
way where the precise opposite of New

289
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,100
England, because they were actually the
most diverse of all of the colonies.

290
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,170
The middle colonies were flooded by
immigrants from Germany, from Ireland,

291
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:36,770
from Scotland to name just a few
countries. And as a matter of fact,

292
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,790
the middle colonies were considered in
a phrase used at the time the best poor

293
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:45,791
man's country because there were ample
supplies of land and there weren't harsh

294
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,100
restrictions are great
intolerance of diversity.

295
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,380
And part of the reason why it was so
popular for immigrants is because of the

296
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:58,320
great tolerance of the
Quakers who founded the colony

297
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,020
though Pennsylvania,

298
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:05,070
like Massachusetts was founded by
basically a group of religious dissenters.

299
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,790
The Quaker faith was quite different
from puritanism and it was much more

300
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:13,791
focused on regulating society according
to your internal moral spirit rather

301
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:18,480
than through institutional sort
of church oriented structures.

302
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,220
So there were fewer external rules and
regulations controlling Pennsylvania

303
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:23,941
society and there were,

304
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:26,910
there would have been in New England
and it was a lot easier for people who

305
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:29,760
arrived in the middle colonies
to adapt to living there.

306
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,110
And tolerance was also integral
to the Quaker faith. So again,

307
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,760
it's easier for immigrants to deal
with arriving to the middle colonies.

308
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,820
Also the middle colonies,

309
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:46,380
unlike New England and the south were
kind of less of a coherent region and

310
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:48,540
particularly um,
New York and Pennsylvania,

311
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,680
although they're both lumped
into middle colony enos, um,

312
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,690
they seem to share fewer similarities
and it's why at the time you don't really

313
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:59,220
hear people dividing the
colonies into thirds.

314
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:03,540
They do tend to break it into halves and
they do tend to talk about northern or

315
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,770
eastern colonies and southern
colonies and they sort of shove, um,

316
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,380
Pennsylvania north and
shove Maryland south.

317
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:14,670
Obviously thinking generally about
slavery is a helpful dividing line.

318
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,570
Now that said to people at the time,

319
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,160
New York was particularly problematic
and in some ways some people actually

320
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:27,570
considered New York to be more southern
than northern Jefferson actually said

321
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:30,240
that at the time he found the
New York was in the wrong place,

322
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,930
like somehow geographically and ended up
far more north than it should have been.

323
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,280
It should be a southern state.

324
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:39,210
And what he meant by that was don't
like a lot of other states or colonies

325
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,740
actually not yet states colonies.

326
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,130
It was organized around great land owners
who owned vast expanses of land and

327
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:51,240
although in all of the colonies that were
sort of great families who controlled

328
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,630
or certainly had a lot of power in
New York politics was really largely

329
00:19:56,641 --> 00:20:01,440
organized around the clash between
a handful of great families and the

330
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:06,441
Livingston's are the sort of largest and
most noteworthy political clan in New

331
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,320
York.
And I can,

332
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,170
I can vouch to you as a historian of this
time period that when you're studying

333
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:15,390
and your politics, there are a million
Livingston's and they're all named Philip,

334
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,290
like trying to tell which Livingston he's,
which Livingston is really hard.

335
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,410
There are a lot of Livingston's and they
all have, a lot of them are empower.

336
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,050
Other people commented not necessarily
that New York seems southern but that it

337
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:32,820
had really high toned manners that
the people were really aristocratic,

338
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,210
that they were very interested in fine
living in display than some of the

339
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:38,160
surrounding more northern colonies.

340
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,950
And some people considered New Yorkers
shifty self interested in subtle. Um,

341
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,830
there's one account I came across
in which, um, this fellow says,

342
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,300
basically he says he thinks
New Yorkers are all liars,

343
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,100
but the way he puts it in something like

344
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,460
New Yorkers are all guilty of telling
great thumpers I guess a great thumper is

345
00:20:57,461 --> 00:21:01,300
a big lie. And actually
that same diary, okay, this,

346
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,460
this really surprised
me. I suppose. You know,

347
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:07,340
very often this is true with
slang to you consider slang or,

348
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:09,460
or other things as being really,
really modern.

349
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:13,030
And then you discover it actually isn't
really modern. It dates all the way back.

350
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,540
I found a letter once from this time
period in which someone said I wanted to

351
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,120
give so and so a good swift
kick in the can. Right. Okay.

352
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,530
I don't expect someone to say that in
1799 a good swift kick in the can like the

353
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:25,930
Cam, like they're saying
that. And so I don't know,

354
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:30,670
that's a little sort of more cash than
I thought they would be in 1799. Um,

355
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,420
but so in this diary account, um,
this person is talking about New York,

356
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:36,540
he's a Pennsylvania and,
um,

357
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,110
he says New Yorkers talk really fast,
walk really fast,

358
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:42,850
they do everything
really fast in New York.

359
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,010
They're sort of really business
like and abrupt. I mean,

360
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:47,500
I'd actually just doesn't
sound very different from
what someone today would say

361
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:51,310
visiting New York City for the first
time. Um, but he also describes,

362
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,480
and now I'm going to
embarrass myself fully. Um,

363
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,130
he also describes what he calls the
New York walk, which in his mind,

364
00:21:57,131 --> 00:21:58,750
like he thinks all New
Yorkers walk this way,

365
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,400
which I guess is kind of like
bent over and walking very fast.

366
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,560
So in his,
and he does a little limitation of it.

367
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:08,980
Apparently in his diary he talks about
it. So, so he's looking at New York,

368
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,830
basically his,
his impression,

369
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,810
you almost could read someone today making
a very similar observation about New

370
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:21,770
York. So New York, Pennsylvania,
middle colonies, but different, um,

371
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,390
considering though these differences
between New York and Pennsylvania,

372
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,240
years later after the
constitution kicks in,

373
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:32,380
they actually become an enormous issue
because they'd begin to play into the

374
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:34,900
question of where the national
capital should be located.

375
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,310
Because the general belief at the time
was wherever the capitol ended up being

376
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:44,311
located would determine the manners of
the national office holders and thus

377
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:48,100
determine the sort of manner and
character of the nation, right?

378
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:50,380
So wherever you're living is
going to shape how you act.

379
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,590
So the national office holders are
going to act if they're in New York,

380
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,550
kind of snooty.

381
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,460
And then the American public's going to
look at these snooty people and they're

382
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:58,990
going to try to act
like the snooty people.

383
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:01,570
And that's all of America will
become an aristocratic and corrupt.

384
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:04,780
And that's the end of the Republican
experiment in government Dar. Right?

385
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,030
So that was kind of the logic at the time.

386
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:10,750
So people had a lot of attitudes about
whether the capital should be in New York

387
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:14,380
or should be in Philadelphia.
Actually in Pennsylvania.

388
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,910
The idea being that Pennsylvania seemed
more ideal because it's sort of in the

389
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:20,680
middle,
it seems kind of balanced.

390
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:24,970
People said it seemed the most small r
Republican meaning sort of virtuous and

391
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,680
straightforward and uncorrupted.

392
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:30,880
So it's not as though these issues die
out when we get states in a country.

393
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,300
But now southerners might
disagree and might say no.

394
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:36,340
Pennsylvania is of course
not the most Republican.

395
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,480
We in the south are the most Republican,
um,

396
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:43,400
the most virtuous of all regions.
Um,

397
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,360
of course other colonists from other
would have disagreed and what it's claimed

398
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:52,160
as many did that the south
was aristocratic in the
extreme that they had a true

399
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:53,510
hottie aristocratic,

400
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:57,890
elite plantation owners and
then a glut of poor common folk.

401
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,640
Not surprisingly, this is not
going to be surprise to anyone.

402
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,350
Southern Society was structured
around widely scattered plantations,

403
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:11,120
which essentially functioned like
small villages owned and controlled by

404
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:12,320
southern gentlemen.

405
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,270
And it was these gentlemen who controlled
and regulated affairs who did things

406
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:22,250
like take responsibility for fixing roads
or or tending to local affairs rather

407
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:26,130
than having some kind of
formal institution tending
to those things as might've

408
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,530
happened in a place that was
more structured institutionally
structured like New

409
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:35,420
England and the southern gentleman
really did enjoy great display in their

410
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:38,600
homes, in their clothing,
in their style of living.

411
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,920
They spent their leisure time
gambling, cockfighting, horseracing,

412
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,500
and as that diary suggests drinking.

413
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,170
Now generally speaking,

414
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,170
education was not as important
in the south is in the north.

415
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,770
There's just not to say gentlemen,
we're expected to be educated.

416
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:55,850
They were in the south,

417
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:00,350
but going to school at William and Mary
with sometimes more social training than

418
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:03,620
intellectual training. I'm sorry, William
and Mary, I do not mean to insult you,

419
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,701
but for one,

420
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:08,480
Thomas Jefferson was really not impressed
with his education at William and Mary

421
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,810
and ultimately he created in his old age,

422
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,230
the University of Virginia because he
wanted to create what he considered to be

423
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:19,340
a better academic institution in the
state of Virginia where people would be

424
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:23,750
truly learning. This will be a temple of
Learning University of Virginia. Okay.

425
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,680
Things didn't work out the way he planned
initially. The University of Virginia,

426
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:33,070
um, there was a lot of
drinking, a lot of gambling. Um,

427
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,681
I think,

428
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:36,680
I can't remember whether Edgar Allan Poe
was thrown out for drinking or gambling

429
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:37,101
or both,

430
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:40,400
but he was expelled from the University
of Virginia for doing one or both of

431
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:44,090
those two things. Um,
students really liked at Uva.

432
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:45,380
I don't know if any of
you have been there,

433
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:48,480
but there's sort of this beautiful
lawn at the center of campus. Um,

434
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:51,470
students really liked to ride up and
down the lawn on their horses and shoot

435
00:25:51,471 --> 00:25:54,520
guns off in the air. This
is a popular hobby. Um,

436
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,900
things got really bad apparently
with the guns and the horses.

437
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,260
So I'm Thomas Jefferson in 1825 called
a meeting of the faculty and students so

438
00:26:02,581 --> 00:26:03,650
that he could reprimand them.
You know,

439
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:07,000
this is like the hobby and delight
of his old age. You know, his,

440
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,920
what he's going to give to his
own colony or state of Virginia.

441
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:12,620
And now there's like wacky people
riding around shooting guns.

442
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:14,090
And not really going to class per se.

443
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:19,091
So he calls this meeting of students
and faculty and he invites along.

444
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,890
James Monroe and James Madison.
Okay.

445
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,570
So we got three ex presidents who are
standing over the Virginia student body

446
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:31,370
who are going to reprimand
them or shooting off their
guns. And it supposedly,

447
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:33,050
I always find this sort of touching right?

448
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:35,990
Supposedly Thomas Jefferson
stood up to yell at the students,

449
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:40,250
but he was so upset at what was happening
at the university that he started to

450
00:26:40,251 --> 00:26:44,880
cry and he had to sit down
crying founders,

451
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:48,120
you know, so he was very upset.
And then one of the genes is,

452
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:52,140
I don't know if it was Madison and Monroe
Sorta had to take over now you would

453
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:56,880
think that a crying founder might like
help the student body in Virginia to kind

454
00:26:56,881 --> 00:27:00,640
of shape up, but it did not.
Um, and years later, uh,

455
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,710
when faculty told the still riding gun
shooting students that they needed to

456
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:07,860
actually give up their guns now because
they apparently just didn't want to stop

457
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:12,750
shooting them. There was some kind of
a gun riot, like, like a riot, like,

458
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,350
like crashing windows and I don't
know the details, but it was ugly.

459
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,610
And 70 students were expelled.
Great.

460
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,050
Four years after the amazing gun riot.

461
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,950
It's when students were celebrating
the anniversary of the gun riot,

462
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,960
which kind of tells you that the people
being expelled really didn't do a lot.

463
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,530
This gets really unfortunate. They were
celebrating the anniversary of the gun.

464
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:37,260
Right. And a professor was
accidentally shot and killed.

465
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,820
So, um, it's a problem.

466
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,950
It's Uva the early years, right?
It's like, it's, it's problem.

467
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,890
Unfortunate problem with the guns.
Okay.

468
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,910
Virginia education in the early years.
So as with the other regions,

469
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,070
southern colonists,

470
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,070
colonies were distinctive in many ways
other than crazy gun toting students. Um,

471
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:06,110
of course slavery had an enormous
impact on the Telenav life in the south.

472
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,130
Um,

473
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:12,130
there were between 1.3 and 1.7 white
Europeans to every slave in the south.

474
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:14,760
And in some colonies like South Carolina,

475
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:19,470
there actually was a black
majority to Jefferson. Slavery,

476
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:22,610
corrupted the morals of the south.
Um,

477
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,220
and once again he says this and notes
on the state of Virginia to his French

478
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,510
audience.
Um,

479
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:29,880
so he certainly writes things there
that he would not have sent to a fellow

480
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:31,020
Virginia.
And in this case,

481
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:36,021
this is what he writes and notes there
must outlets be an unhappy influence on

482
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:39,600
the manners of our people produced
by the existence of slavery among us,

483
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:44,250
the whole commerce between master and
slave as a perpetual exercise of the most

484
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:47,910
boisterous passions, the most
unremitting despotism on the one part,

485
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,010
and degrading submissions on the other.

486
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,600
Our children see this and learn to
imitate it for man is an imitative animal.

487
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,240
The parents storms,
the child looks on,

488
00:28:57,241 --> 00:29:00,330
puts on the same errors in
the circle of smaller slaves,

489
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,530
gives a loose to his worst of passions
and thus nursed educated and daily

490
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:09,330
exercise. And tyranny cannot but be
stamped by it with odious peculiarities.

491
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,600
The man must be a prodigy who can retain
his manners and morals and depraved by

492
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,260
such circumstances.

493
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:19,500
So that's Jefferson notes on the state
of Virginia and a really strong passage

494
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:23,670
about the influence of slavery on the
morals and manners of southerners.

495
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,850
So clearly the south is based on the
mastery literally and figuratively of a

496
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,770
ruling elite.
And it's this spirit of um,

497
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,100
entitlement and independence and
mastery that would inspire some of the

498
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:43,101
emotional response in the
south to Britain's actions
in the 1760s and seventies

499
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:46,300
seventies particularly in Virginia,

500
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,840
which was the colony that really
believe itself to be at the top of the

501
00:29:49,841 --> 00:29:52,960
hierarchy of southern colonies,
the leader of the south,

502
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:58,450
the response of Virginia to what they
perceive to be the impingement of Britain

503
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:02,170
upon their rights was second in intensity
as we're going to see only to what

504
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:05,110
took place in Massachusetts
and particularly in Boston.

505
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,970
So you can now begin to see how really
diverse these different regions and

506
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,080
colonies were.

507
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,400
And you can also be good to see why when
different men from different regions

508
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:21,460
came together and something like
ultimately a continental congress,

509
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,070
they were pretty quick to
pick up on those differences.

510
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:28,720
And New Englanders picked apart the
southerners as being arrogant and wearing

511
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:32,170
flashy clothes and southern or southern
new Englanders were strange and awkward

512
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:35,350
and everybody distrusted the New
Yorkers and everybody smiled at the

513
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:36,101
Pennsylvania ones.

514
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:40,840
But all of these things were pretty
prominent in any kind of a continental

515
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:41,763
organization.

516
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,010
So with all of these big differences you
can begin to see how truly amazing and

517
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,620
noteworthy would have been any
attempts at colonial unity.

518
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,390
And what I'm going to do right now is
just talk very briefly about these three

519
00:30:55,391 --> 00:30:59,230
attempts, a colonial unity that I
mentioned at the outset of the lecture,

520
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,020
two of them as we'll see,

521
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:06,520
we're inspired by the colonies
as a means of self defense.

522
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,390
One of them was basically
created by the British,

523
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,080
not surprisingly as a means
of asserting British control,

524
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,560
but what's really most important to
note in these examples that I'm going to

525
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:20,260
offer you here is generally speaking,

526
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:24,850
when American colonists considered
colonial union on their own,

527
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,010
it was for reasons of self defense.

528
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:32,011
It was for reasons of self interest and
not because of some greater ideological

529
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,440
colleague.
It was really for basic self defense.

530
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,640
So let's look at the first
attempt at colonial union,

531
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,850
which took place in 1643 okay.

532
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:47,710
So in 1643 representatives of the
colonies of Massachusetts Bay,

533
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,360
Plymouth, Connecticut, and new haven and
new haven is its own little settlement.

534
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:55,150
I let it happened several times in this
course that new haven just appears all

535
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:55,930
by itself,

536
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,570
which I always kind of love cause you
just don't expect it to sort of sit there

537
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:03,070
all by itself having historical
prominence. But here it
is. So Massachusetts Bay,

538
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:03,904
Plymouth,

539
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:08,970
Connecticut and new haven decided that
they wanted to form a confederation to

540
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:14,041
defend themselves against Dutch expansion
and hostile Indian tribes and to

541
00:32:14,111 --> 00:32:17,680
create some kind of forum for
resolving intercolonial disputes,

542
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:22,660
which happened all the time.
Rhode Island tried to join the forum,

543
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:27,520
but it was excluded because
nobody trusted Rhode Island.

544
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,960
They were not invited to join the union
known as the United Colonies of New

545
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,800
England or the New England Confederation
didn't have any sanction in the

546
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:43,340
charters of its member colonies.

547
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:48,610
Instead it was just the kind of joint
advisory council and it was made up of two

548
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,530
members from each participating colony.

549
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,860
So basically it had eight people in it
and six of the eight had to vote for

550
00:32:56,991 --> 00:32:59,330
something for it to take effect.

551
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:05,210
So between 1643 and 1664,

552
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:10,420
the United colonies of New England or
the New England confederation met between

553
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:15,770
those years, 60, 43 and 1664 until
Connecticut annex to new haven.

554
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,200
And the number of members decreased right
down to six and this became a problem.

555
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,480
So after 1664 when new haven's
or merged with Connecticut, um,

556
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:28,490
it didn't meet very often.
And then ultimately in 1684,

557
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,330
it kind of drifted to an end, the end
of the United colonies of New England.

558
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:35,750
So that's amazing.
First Attempt at union wasn't attempt.

559
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,680
The second union of a sort with
spurred by the British government,

560
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:47,290
which in the 1680s became worried
that the new England colonies were not

561
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:51,350
sympathetic and loyal to the British
monarch. And we're, we're basically,

562
00:33:51,351 --> 00:33:54,730
we're creeping up here on, I'm not going
to go into it in any detail, but um,

563
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,740
what comes to be known as the glorious
revolution when the monarchy fall.

564
00:33:57,741 --> 00:34:01,460
So there's a reason why they're wondering
how loyal the new Englanders are to

565
00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:02,294
the monarchy.

566
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,600
But British authorities wanted to be
sure that the new England colonies were

567
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:07,040
going to be loyal to the British monarch.

568
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,040
So in 1686 the British government formed
what they called the dominion of New

569
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:18,200
England, which to me sounds like sort
of Darth Vader, Star Wars, the dominion.

570
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,330
So they formed with the dominion of New
England 1686 which fused all of the New

571
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:28,330
England colonies plus New York Plus New
Jersey into one colony to be ruled by

572
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:32,630
one royal governor and
an appointed counsel. I.

573
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:33,890
That's a dramatic gesture.

574
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:39,050
The resulting mass that was made by
merging all of that into one colony was

575
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:43,460
larger in size than England.
It's a lot of land,

576
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:44,294
a lot of land.

577
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:49,250
The newly installed world governor
was named Edmund Androse, a n,

578
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,950
d R. O. S.

579
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:56,950
Androse ruled over the dominion without
a legislature passing laws after they

580
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,060
were approved by a
majority of his counselors.

581
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:02,570
You can see how happy this is going to
make the new Englanders. Not surprisingly,

582
00:35:02,571 --> 00:35:05,050
a lot of new Englanders
resented the domain Ian,

583
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,980
and the way it just sort of supplanted
colonial legislature's even more

584
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:13,850
unfortunate and was not a
very diplomatic politician.

585
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,310
And he really had no
reason to be diplomatic.

586
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:18,380
He was sent to New England
on Royal Authority.

587
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:21,020
His job was to assert royal authority,

588
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:25,130
so he really didn't need to please
anybody except the king even.

589
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:29,390
So he somehow seemed intent on really
proving his authority by flaunting it

590
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,460
before new Englanders.
So for example,

591
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:35,510
not long after he arrived and rose
took over a puritan meeting house and

592
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:39,840
converted it into an Anglican Church,
right? Nothing like a little new parents.

593
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,910
You think you control the dominion.

594
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:44,910
But I control the
dominion dramatic gesture.

595
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,650
He also put the colonial militia under
the direct control of the governor

596
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,420
himself. And there are a number of other
highly unpopular things that he did.

597
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,920
But in 1689 when the Stuart
monarchy fell in England,

598
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:02,580
because of the glorious revolution,
American colonists also revolted.

599
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:06,270
And they toppled the dominion government.
They jailed it's officers,

600
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:11,160
including Androse, who supposedly
tried to escape in women's clothing.

601
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,640
Okay. So that's somewhat
humiliating, even more humiliating.

602
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:19,670
He was caught for it and rose and he was
eventually freed and not surprisingly

603
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,690
fled right back to England.

604
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,380
And soon after Britain just let the
colonies resumed their former status.

605
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:27,570
So end of the dominion of New England.

606
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:29,700
That's a really obviously
whopping big success.

607
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:35,810
The third and last attempt at union
is in 1754 and like the first one,

608
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,910
it was largely because of a threat.

609
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:43,830
And this time colonies were afraid of
threats coming from the French and from

610
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:44,664
Indians.

611
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:49,650
And here we have the not really promising
entry of George Washington onto the

612
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:52,780
colonial military scene.
I'm going to draw a little picture too,

613
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,640
of George Washington's moment of
glory at this moment in time. Okay.

614
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:02,060
So in 1753 1754 there were some skirmishes
on the Pennsylvania frontier because

615
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:08,820
French forces were moving south from
Quebec and Virginia militia under the

616
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:13,440
command of George Washington a young. And
as we will hear, inexperienced officer,

617
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,970
he sent out by the governor of Virginia
to investigate and see what's happening

618
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:19,950
with the sort of fringe
movements on the frontier.

619
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:24,450
So Washington and this man apparently
tramp around the frontier for a while and

620
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:28,830
ultimately they find a small party of
French soldiers in an encampment and they

621
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:32,130
opened fire on them and kill a
lot of them. And then discover,

622
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:36,510
unfortunately after the fact that actually
it was a neutral ambassador holding

623
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:40,140
papers for negotiation and
his diplomatic escort. Okay.

624
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,200
So Washington just killed a bunch of
diplomats on their escort and the diplomat

625
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,770
literally died clutching like
papers to negotiate a, okay,

626
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,000
thank you George Washington.

627
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,470
So Washington and after this glorious
moment decides he's going to,

628
00:37:55,471 --> 00:37:59,160
he's going to pull back and he's going
to encamp his troops in a fort that he

629
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:01,920
will have built. Right. So he
has his troops build a fort,

630
00:38:01,921 --> 00:38:05,850
he names it fort necessity, which it
really was right. He just killed people.

631
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:08,040
He should have been killing.
Now we'd better create a forge.

632
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,750
So he creates fort necessity.

633
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:14,250
But unfortunately for Washington he
built it in basically in a valley.

634
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,550
Okay. Fort in valley, just not good.

635
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,530
He didn't really think very hard about
the places up above the fort where the

636
00:38:22,531 --> 00:38:26,430
French could perch and fire down into the
fort, which of course they did. Right.

637
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,120
He also didn't think about the fact
that if it's in a valley, if it rains,

638
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:32,760
it's really bad for people in the valley.
So sure enough,

639
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,650
the French attack there
is a big rainstorm.

640
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,040
The French are shooting down from the
heights and Washington and his little

641
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:41,980
troop are down in this sort of soggy,

642
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,480
increasingly puddled fort in which their
powder is all getting soaked in these

643
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:48,610
huge puddles as it continues to reign.

644
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:51,130
This did not end well for Washington
and basically he ultimately had to

645
00:38:51,131 --> 00:38:54,430
surrender.
Not only did he have to surrender,

646
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:57,430
but because of the document that
was really badly translated,

647
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,000
he signed his name to terms of surrender,

648
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:05,620
which announced that Washington had
quote assassinated a French diplomat,

649
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,740
like, yes, I assassinated. This
was all bad, like it was just,

650
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,480
this is George Washington's entry,
right? Let's give the command to him.

651
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,570
This is not a good moment for George.
And in addition to that,

652
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:20,200
supposedly in this moment,
Washington wrote a letter to his brother.

653
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,830
He was still kind of cheery about this
whole thing throughout this whole thing.

654
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,080
Um, he wrote a letter to
his brother and he said,

655
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:30,460
I have to quote it precisely here.
I heard bullets whistle and believe me,

656
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,980
there was something charming in the sound,
right?

657
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,470
He's so excited about
getting a chance to fight.

658
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:37,060
He's like the charming sound of bullets.

659
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:40,750
Supposedly that quote made its way
back to King George the second,

660
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,590
who thought it was a really stupidly
ridiculous thing for anybody to say.

661
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,890
And I think what the king said was
something along the lines of he wouldn't

662
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:51,110
think so if he'd heard very many
of those bullets with Lincoln,

663
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:56,030
what they would not be charming anymore.
So not a good moment for George. Um,

664
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,690
he's not helping matters.
But in addition to that,

665
00:39:58,691 --> 00:40:02,290
the British really were worried. The
Indian relations, generally speaking,

666
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:06,160
were deteriorating largely
due to complications between
colonies that weren't

667
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:07,390
cooperating with each other.

668
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:12,690
So the governors of Massachusetts and
New York persuade the British lords of

669
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:17,650
trade. They're the guys who regulate trade
in the colonies to issue a call for a

670
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:22,651
conference to meet in Albany in June of
1754 to negotiate with the six nations

671
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:26,470
with the Iroquois
Confederation Confederation,

672
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,690
and to talk about other ways of
coordinating defense for the colonies.

673
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:36,190
So in 1754 there's this meeting call
to figure out a way for the colonies to

674
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:39,010
jointly work things out
with the native Americans.

675
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,970
The six nations invitations
went to nine colonies,

676
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:47,740
Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
New York, New Jersey,

677
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,990
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,
Rhode Island, and Connecticut.

678
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,600
I'll, I'll repeat that one more time.
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York,

679
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,560
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Virginia, Rhode Island, Connecticut. Um,

680
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,611
North Carolina,

681
00:41:00,611 --> 00:41:03,610
South Carolina and Georgia
were not included because
they were probably just too

682
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:07,390
far away from where people thought
there was going to be conflict north,

683
00:41:07,391 --> 00:41:10,600
New Jersey and Virginia declined
because it was too expensive to go.

684
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,750
So even here when you, people are
afraid there's an Indian threat,

685
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,870
some colonies just say, yeah, it cost too
much. I don't think I'm going to bother.

686
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,281
But this meeting,

687
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:21,520
I'll end here and I'll pick up with
this little end passage on a Tuesday.

688
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:25,060
This meeting came to be
known as the Albany Congress,

689
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:30,330
the Albany Congress in 1754 and I'll
talk briefly on Tuesday about the Albany

690
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,810
Congress and what it was and what it did,
and then I'll segue from that,

691
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,110
which also doesn't end
well into the stamp act.
