1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,590
Uh, someone asked me, uh,

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,970
at the end of class on
Tuesday a very good question.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,100
And the question is what exactly is a
broad side? So I was here sort of happily,

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,100
oh yes, they're posting
broadsides, don't buy tea.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,300
And I'd never really precisely
define what a broad side was. Um,

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,390
a broad side is actually a single sheet
of paper that's something is printed on

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,740
one side and it would have been um,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
posted in public are handed out in public
like in town squares or taverns and

9
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:36,300
usually they were advertising things.

10
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:39,860
We're announcing things that
were of immediate pressing
importance like you know,

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,790
immediate news, pressing news, political
events, official proclamations,

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,040
great entertainment or whatever.

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,610
They were sort of immediate news and
they were not really seen as great

14
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:53,700
permanent documents. They were seen
as something that you post it up,

15
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:54,421
you handed out,

16
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,480
you read it for the day or whatever
and then it would be discarded.

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,840
So that was these broadsides
or that I was talking about.

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,740
The detested t has arrived at airport
would have been that kind of an

19
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:07,020
announcement. It would have been
an immediate, like the tease here.

20
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:11,370
Now do something kind of
an instant announcement.

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,860
So that's what a broadside is.
Okay,

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,540
so today we are going
to make our way to what,

23
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,890
on this syllabus I have called
the logic of resistance.

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,550
And what I mean by that is the mindset
that contributed to some of the broad

25
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,140
conclusions that the colonists were
drawing as events were unfolding in the

26
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:40,950
1770s as we've seen in
the last few lectures.

27
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,650
But to get to the logic of resistance,

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,680
we first have to lay out another event
that contributed to the building of that

29
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,123
logic.

30
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,180
And I mentioned it right at the end of
the last lecture and that event is a

31
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:59,181
series of acts that were passed by
parliament in 1774 and Americans ended up

32
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:04,830
calling them the intolerable acts,

33
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,640
which being easy way to remember
what they are, the intolerable acts,

34
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:11,670
they also were called the coercive acts,
but intolerable,

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,160
intolerable would have been what
Americans with a communist would have

36
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:14,994
considered them.

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,250
And I mentioned them right at the end
of the last lecture. As you remember,

38
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:24,960
they were a response to the
destruction of the t in Boston harbor,

39
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,480
which sort of dumbfounded lord north,

40
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,870
who had assumed that his tea act passed
in 1773 was going to be seen as maybe a

41
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:38,220
relief by the colonies that north have
been trying to save the east India

42
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:39,540
company from going under.

43
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,830
He had reduced duties on east India tea
so that people will be buying that t

44
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,541
path.

45
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:48,900
The act thought this would
be seen potentially as a
good thing only to find that

46
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:53,100
the colonists saw it as an attempt of
the British government to have a monopoly

47
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,200
over what the colonists had assumed was
free trade and that's where you get the

48
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:02,470
broad sides that I was just talking about
telling people not to buy or sell east

49
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,450
India tea and to do act now,

50
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:08,890
defend your liberties and then eventually
you end up with the destruction of tea

51
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:12,310
in Boston harbor.
And as I mentioned in the last lecture,

52
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:15,940
Boston Tea Party is actually later in
the 19th century that they didn't call

53
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:19,260
this at the time. They probably called
it the destruction of the tea. Um,

54
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,790
but there was not a party at the time.

55
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,620
That was later they
decided it was a deportee.

56
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,940
So now clearly having had that happen,

57
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,070
north felt that something really
needed to be done about the colonies or

58
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:38,071
obedience to British law and order in his
mind would collapse in the colonies as

59
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:40,810
he put it. And I think I quoted this
right at the end of the lecture,

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,760
that if they didn't risk something
all is over dramatic statement,

61
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,690
that's you get the intolerable acts which
are passed in the spring of 1774 and

62
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:57,070
although there were some in
parliament who protested against them,

63
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,660
still they pass with a great majority.

64
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,050
Those who did protest against them argue
that the American colonists deserved

65
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,290
the same rights as any
other British subjects.

66
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,270
And as I described the acts to you,

67
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,320
you will understand why these friends
to America were making this argument.

68
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:18,160
You'll hear the details and see that their
argument certainly made sense at that

69
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:18,491
moment.

70
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:23,491
So there were four apps that get lumped
together as the intolerable acts,

71
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,780
the first one,
the Boston port act,

72
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:35,010
which closed the port of Boston to all
shipping until the colonists paid for the

73
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:37,840
tea that they had destroyed.

74
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,340
And I suppose also hopefully showed some
degree of remorse for having destroyed

75
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:43,174
all that tea.

76
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,890
Now clearly that's a pretty
extreme measure, right?

77
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:50,020
Closing the port of Boston period.

78
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,920
And North assumed that it would pretty
much crush the opposition in Boston and

79
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:03,481
that other colonies would scramble for
Boston's lost trade and ignore what was

80
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,790
happening in Boston.
And you will see this again and again,

81
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,840
that there is sort of a
fundamental misunderstanding
about when and what ends up

82
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:14,080
seeming like a joint threat to the
colonist so that they act together versus

83
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,720
what doesn't inspire them to act together.
So here we see lord north,

84
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:18,880
assuming that if Boston loses trade,

85
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:22,600
the other colonies will just sort of
gobble it up. And the Boston radicals,

86
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,750
we'll sort of get silenced and
that'll be the end of this matter.

87
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:30,751
But he misjudges colonial sentiment in
this case really underestimating the

88
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:34,660
sense of unity that arises from something
that ends up being seen as a joint

89
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,553
threat.

90
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,090
So the British government ends up being
rather stunned when the other colonies,

91
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:42,610
not only don't ignore Boston,

92
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:45,310
but instead they actually
support it in its time of need.

93
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:49,960
So other colonies responded to the Boston
port act and some of these other acts

94
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,650
by sending goods.
So Connecticut sent sheep,

95
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,890
Charleston sent rice,
Philadelphia sent.

96
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:02,420
So the other colonies basically stepped
up and did something in Boston's time of

97
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:03,284
need.

98
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,130
And a lot of colonies made June 1st which
is the day that that act was supposed

99
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:09,920
to take effect a day
of fasting and prayer.

100
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,980
Now clearly some of this was
because people felt sympathy
for what was happening

101
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:20,150
in Boston. They they saw and
felt for Boston, and it's plight,

102
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,370
but equally if not more important,

103
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,780
people in other colonies assumed
if it could happen in Boston,

104
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,550
it could happen anywhere.

105
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,240
So in a lot of ways Boston's cause
was there because it wasn't something

106
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:37,880
happening far away. It was something that
there was no reason why they couldn't.

107
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:41,330
See it couldn't happen anywhere else where
the British government happened to be

108
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:45,320
angry at something that happened.
So in essence,

109
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,670
Lord North's actions did the precise
opposite of what they were meant to do

110
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:54,671
because they really ultimately brought
the colonies closer together in a shared

111
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,360
sense of crisis.

112
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,650
As George Washington put it in his
typical kind of meandering indirect way,

113
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:04,440
Washington is not always the best word.

114
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,070
Smith Washington had very
good people writing for him.

115
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,800
He could speech makers that Washington.
Um,

116
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,620
but he tends to write kind of a mandarin
style and this will be kind of a

117
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:17,090
typical Washingtonian statement full
of parentheses and weird clauses,

118
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,250
but he's, he's his heart's
in the right place. Okay.

119
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:23,600
So Washington says the ministry,
the British Ministry may rely on it.

120
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,710
The Americans will never be
taxed without their own consent.

121
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,850
That the cause of Boston,
the despotic measures in respect to it.

122
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:36,170
I mean now is and ever will be
considered as the cause of America.

123
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,510
Not that we approve their
conduct and destroying the tee.

124
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:39,710
This is all one sentence.

125
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,480
And that we shall not suffer ourselves
to be sacrificed by piecemeals.

126
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,790
Though God only knows
what is to become of us.

127
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,140
It's under a Washingtonian sentence,

128
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:50,420
but still he's making
his point really clearly.

129
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,250
So the Boston port act number
one of the intolerable acts,

130
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,240
the other three still pretty largely
focused on Massachusetts included a

131
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:06,251
quartering act and the quartering act
legalized the quartering of British

132
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,760
troops,
not only in empty buildings or taverns,

133
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:12,470
but also in private homes,

134
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,460
the administration of Justice Act,

135
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,450
which was an attempt to protect people
who were trying to suppress revolts in

136
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:23,684
the colonies.

137
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,750
So the administration of Justice Act
said that if a fair trial for a British

138
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:33,440
soldier or official couldn't
be had in Massachusetts,

139
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,360
the trial could be transferred
to another colony or to England.

140
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:43,850
And in Massachusetts, the land
of propaganda. This became
known as the murder act.

141
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,100
Just in case you want to wonder what
people were thinking about it. Um,

142
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,320
and if someone at the time put it,
every villain who ravish his,

143
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:55,920
our wives or the flowers are daughters
can evade punishment by being tried in

144
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:58,740
Britain where no evidence can pursue him.
Okay,

145
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:02,040
we're not really talking so much
about ravishing Indy flowering.

146
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,220
We'd really talking about taxes and such,

147
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:09,330
but still you could understand the logic,
why people feel that again,

148
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:13,230
some fundamental liberties are being
violated here. And then finally,

149
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:17,460
the last of these acts is the
Massachusetts government act.

150
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,750
And in a lot of ways that ended up
being the most controversial act of all

151
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,330
because it basically imposed a new charter
on the colony of Massachusetts from

152
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:30,954
now on.

153
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,110
The governor who was appointed by the
king could appoint his own counsel rather

154
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:40,020
than having the council be
elected by the colonial assembly.

155
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,680
The council could not no longer
veto the governor's decisions.

156
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,610
All town meetings besides the one
annual meeting for electing officers now

157
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:57,120
needed to be approved by the governor.
And if the governor wanted,

158
00:09:57,121 --> 00:10:02,121
he could simply for bid down meetings and
any additional meaning besides the one

159
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:03,540
in which officers were chosen.

160
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,670
That meeting needed to post an agenda
in advance and stick to the agenda.

161
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,840
And the governor also now could
appoint or remove sheriffs, judges,

162
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:14,820
attorney generals,
Marshall's.

163
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,510
So basically the is a royal official
and the governor is now in Massachusetts

164
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:22,770
being given a lot of power.
So I'll repeat the four intolerable acts,

165
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:25,500
the Boston port act,
the quartering act,

166
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,970
the administration of Justice Act,
and the Massachusetts Government Act.

167
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,080
So having described those acts,

168
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:38,490
you can see why there would have been
some in parliament who were sympathetic to

169
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:39,750
what was going on in the colonies,

170
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,760
who would have protested that these acts
were depriving colonists of some pretty

171
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:49,500
basic British constitutional rights.
But these protesters were in the minority.

172
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,100
Now on top of these acts,

173
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,340
the king sent a new
governor to Massachusetts,

174
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,860
Massachusetts General Thomas Gauge
Commander of the British forces in North

175
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:06,540
America. Okay, so a military commander
was sent to be the new governor. Again,

176
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,890
a pretty dramatic statement.
So now in addition to all of those acts,

177
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:14,610
you have the looming threat certainly
to the colonies or the colonists and

178
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:19,350
Massachusetts have a standing army as
a source of tyranny staring them in the

179
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:20,184
face.

180
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,390
So certainly people in Massachusetts that
this moment would have been justified

181
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:27,510
in feeling as though they were
under military occupation.

182
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:34,340
Now we may look at these pretty drastic
measures and assume that reconciliation

183
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,940
is pretty impossible at this point,

184
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:43,170
and I know a few of you came up to me
after class on Tuesday and actually we

185
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,320
already leaning in that direction like
when are we getting to independence?

186
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,270
Because how in the world can they get out
of this? Right? It's looking pretty bad.

187
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,040
Look at these really extreme measures.

188
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,710
Certainly it looks as though
rebellion is on the horizon,

189
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,920
but independence is not the natural
choice. I mean, that's a really,

190
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:07,090
really radical move that is not
at this moment on the horizon.

191
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,350
These are really,

192
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:10,780
I'm going to talk more about this
in this lecture a little further on.

193
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,820
These are British subjects trying to
demand the rights of British subjects.

194
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:20,140
That's the logic that's at play here.
They're not thinking independence.

195
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:23,980
They're thinking that they need to find
a way to get the British imperial system

196
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:27,280
to work in a way that
they see as being right.

197
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,830
They're not trying to break away.

198
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:33,520
They're hoping that there's a way to fix
things and that they will get what they

199
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:36,370
feel they deserve as British subjects.

200
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,850
So in 1774,

201
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,050
it was in the hope of maybe figuring
out some way to settle the thing,

202
00:12:45,051 --> 00:12:46,120
some way to compromise,

203
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:50,800
some way to come to some
sort of a solution that the
Massachusetts legislature

204
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,360
sent a circular letter to the other
colonies suggesting that it might be smart

205
00:12:55,361 --> 00:13:00,361
to have a joint congress from all the
colonies to discuss their problems and to

206
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:02,920
figure out a course of
action that made sense.

207
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,970
So what came to be known as the
first Continental Congress, right?

208
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,920
The congress of the continent,
um,

209
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,200
met in Philadelphia at
the end of August in 1774.

210
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Most of the delegates to that Congress
already had some political experience in

211
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:23,080
their separate colonies.

212
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,680
None of them were absolute uncompromising
radicals who wanted to rip everything

213
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:33,580
apart.
There's not a sort of dire radical body,

214
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,440
and I'll be talking a little bit more
about the first continental congress in a

215
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:42,400
lecture to come. But for
now, I'll just state, um,

216
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:47,350
I guess for significant things
about the meeting of the congress.

217
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,130
Okay. First, and it's
actually kind of practical.

218
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,140
The meeting of the first
continental congress forced
the colonists to make their

219
00:13:56,141 --> 00:14:01,141
beliefs clear to themselves as people
from a variety of different colonies and

220
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:06,361
to Great Britain and to
explain the motives behind
their actions as they debated

221
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,860
and drafted petitions and
resolves and declarations.

222
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,540
The delegates were clarifying and defining
their thoughts and they were doing it

223
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,550
in a room full of delegates from other
colonies that people didn't necessarily

224
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:24,190
know that well.
So it was actually just in and of itself.

225
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:27,370
By collecting all these people together
in a room and forcing them to sort of

226
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:28,121
think things through,

227
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:31,840
talk things through and come up
with some kind of a resolution.

228
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,430
They were actually hashing out their
problems on a broad level in a way that

229
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:39,250
they had not done before.
Second,

230
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
continental Congress forced people
from very separate colonies in a way,

231
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:49,840
really sort of separate nation states
to meet one another and stay with one

232
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:51,890
another for an extended period of time.

233
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,540
And for a lot of the
people that were there,

234
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,640
this was really their first extended
periods spent with people from far away

235
00:14:58,641 --> 00:14:59,474
colonies.

236
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,400
So not only did this contribute
to a sense of colonial unity,

237
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,770
but it actually on a
really practical level,

238
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:11,120
it gave people a chance to see how
other colonies ran their colonial

239
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,400
governments. And, and John Adams actually,

240
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:18,380
he writes a great diary at the time and
in his diary he writes about how when

241
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:19,430
he's in this congress,

242
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,340
he spent a lot of time grilling
people from other colonies,

243
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,840
asking questions about their charters,
their laws, the logic behind them.

244
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:30,320
He really wanted to understand
how other colonies worked.

245
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,970
And it's interesting because in his
letters, I think also in his diary,

246
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,260
even in his, in his letters for sure, um,

247
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Adams refers to himself and his position
in the continental congress as our

248
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,180
embassy, right. And by our embassy,

249
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:47,660
what he means is he sees himself
as a kind of diplomat representing

250
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:50,060
Massachusetts in a sort of,
you know,

251
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,550
to take today you might
say international body,

252
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,580
but he sees the continental congress as
a sort of grouping of representatives of

253
00:15:57,591 --> 00:16:00,710
other provinces or other
countries or nations.

254
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,270
And he's a delegate from our embassy
of Massachusetts. So, you know,

255
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,560
in a way we put a lot of baggage into
the word Congress as though you know, oh,

256
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:11,890
it's a bunch of Americans
joined in a congress. Um,

257
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,950
but it's not a congress and our modern
sense of the word it really is in their

258
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:18,100
mind is sort of delegation of,

259
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,010
of people representing
different nation states,

260
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,650
which is why it was so interesting for
them to collect together and get to

261
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:25,580
exchange thoughts.

262
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,890
And then third to John
Adams and some others,

263
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,940
the fact that now this
congress existed seem to be,

264
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,350
or at least to hold the potential for
being some kind of a training ground for

265
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,400
American statesman. And
Adam's put it at the time, um,

266
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,930
said that the congress was quote to
be a school of political profits,

267
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,170
I suppose a nursery of American statesman.

268
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,570
May it thrive and prosper and flourish.

269
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,440
And from this fountain may their issues
streams which shoved gladden all the

270
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:59,680
cities and towns in North
America forever died.

271
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,930
I was always has a way of saying
like the big, broad quotable thing,

272
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:04,820
which is why I keep coming back to him.
Hello.

273
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:06,800
I will provide you the
historian with the big, broad,

274
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:09,650
wonderful quote about the continental
congress. Thank you, John Adams.

275
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,570
I am from making the congress annual
and for sending an entire new set of

276
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:18,950
delegates every year that
all the principal geniuses
may go to the university in

277
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:21,740
rotation,
that we may have politicians in Plenti.

278
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,540
Our policy must be to improve
every opportunity and means
for forming our people

279
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,170
and preparing leaders for them
in the grand march of politics.

280
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,710
So he's drawing a lot of big hopes for
the future from the meeting of this

281
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:34,544
congress.

282
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,620
But certainly he's thinking the fact
that it exists and that these people were

283
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,600
meeting and talking in this way on this
level will be in and of itself a sort of

284
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:45,830
educational colonial experience.
And then finally,

285
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:50,831
a fourth significant aspect of the meeting
of this congress was that at least to

286
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,670
some back in England,

287
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,650
the continental congress symbolized
a move towards rebellion.

288
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,350
And indeed more about this to come.

289
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:06,351
But in February of 1775 lord north passed
a resolution in parliament declaring

290
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:09,210
that Massachusetts was
in a state of rebellion.

291
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,440
And part of the reason why
it's Massachusetts that
he's focusing on is because

292
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:15,030
really still in parliament,

293
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,020
they are assuming that Massachusetts
is the ring leader of all the trouble.

294
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,250
The real reason for the
Congress is Massachusetts.
Massachusetts is the problem.

295
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,250
Massachusetts is moving towards rebellion
and to some people back in England

296
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:32,070
looking on this,
continental Congress looks treasonable.

297
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,850
So you can see how things are evolving.

298
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:39,630
Here you could see how mutual
misunderstandings are growing.

299
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,120
Colonists and the British administration
are grappling with the real meaning of

300
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:46,980
British sovereignty in the colonies.

301
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,960
The British government isn't really
clear on some of the logic of colonial

302
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:53,790
thinking.
On such matters.

303
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:59,030
Colonists see an ongoing
attempt to violate their
fundamental rights as British

304
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:01,590
subjects as they have
come to understand them.

305
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,720
Which brings us to the perfect segue into
a discussion of the logic of colonial

306
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:07,554
resistance,

307
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,890
the logic driving the colonial mindset
during the passage of the 1770s and what

308
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:15,751
I'm going to do now,

309
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:18,300
I'm going to introduce this subject
by doing something that's a little bit

310
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:20,430
illogical,
but I just can't resist it basically.

311
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:24,530
So you're going to be subject to it.
Um, there actually is a logic to it. Um,

312
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,450
but to talk about the logic of
resistance in the revolution,

313
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,680
I'm going to use a story that actually
dates to a period significantly after the

314
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:32,514
revolution,

315
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,610
which kind of doesn't make sense but
it does cause the story actually really

316
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:37,020
wraps up a lot of stuff in it.

317
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,180
And this story relates to a
conversation that took place in 1791.

318
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,460
So it's after the revolution.

319
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:50,630
The United States has only been in
existence for a few years when the story

320
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:55,050
takes place and secretary of State,
Thomas Jefferson,

321
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,310
he's almost newly arrived, a secretary
of state, not, not there for that long,

322
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,960
decides he's going to have a little dinner
party to discuss a political question

323
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:08,961
that's come up and he invites
vice president John Adams
and he invites secretary

324
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:11,220
of the treasury,
Alexander Hamilton.

325
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,540
The reason why we know this story is
because Jefferson told it a lot, right?

326
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:20,010
It's because as we'll see Jefferson drug
great deep significance to this little

327
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,320
dinner conversation and he
repeated it over and over again.

328
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,180
And letters and journals,

329
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,390
it's like the story that reveals
the meaning of everything.

330
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,390
But you'll see why won't sound too
dramatic now that I've set it up that way.

331
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:35,250
But to Jefferson, it was earth shaking.
So little dinner party, Adams, Jefferson,

332
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,203
Hamilton,

333
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,650
and Jefferson who tells the story says
that after they're done with their meal,

334
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,110
quote, our question, agreed and dismissed.

335
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,750
Conversation began on other matters.

336
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,380
The room being hung around
with a collection of the
portraits that remarkable

337
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:55,030
men among them, those of Bacon, Newton
and lock Hamilton asked me who they were.

338
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:58,720
So this is how this is Jefferson's home
and in his home are these portraits.

339
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,050
Bacon, Newton and lock. And Hamilton
sitting there as a dinner guest, looks up,

340
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:06,100
sees the portrait and says, who
are they? Okay. Jefferson says,

341
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:10,720
I told him they were my trinity of the
three greatest men in the world had ever

342
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:11,141
produced.

343
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:16,141
This is professor Jefferson and full
gear naming them Lord Francis Bacon,

344
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:19,390
the philosopher of science,
Sir Isaac Newton,

345
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,600
the scientist who defined the
laws of gravity. John Locke,

346
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,720
the philosopher of I suppose you
could say the philosopher liberty.

347
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,020
And as Jefferson recalled
hearing this quote,

348
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,330
Hamilton pause for some time.

349
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,300
The greatest man said he that ever
lived was Julius Caesar. Okay.

350
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,390
Now, for reasons that will
become clear in this lecture,

351
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,930
this shocked Jefferson,
I mean like shock Jefferson,

352
00:21:44,931 --> 00:21:49,180
so that he told the story again and
again and again, remember it for decades.

353
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,840
I mean in the 1820s he's still like,
I remember that story,

354
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:58,050
that dinner where the Hamilton 30 years
ago in which he said the greatest man

355
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:02,590
who ever lived with Julius Caesar,
he repeated it to him.

356
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,210
It was a sign of the amazing, dangerous
implications of Hamilton's policies.

357
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,890
But I want to pull the story apart. I want
to look at this a little bit as a way,

358
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:14,410
not really of getting a
Jefferson and Hamilton,

359
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,940
but to get at something of
the intellectual mindset
of Americans during this

360
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:21,700
period. And some of this has to
do with enlightenment thinking,

361
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:24,580
and some of this has to do
with constitutional thinking,

362
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:27,970
but you'll see why both
men said what they said.

363
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,370
Now to start with,

364
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm not saying that every single
colonist is sitting around at this point

365
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:36,730
discussing Bacon, Newton and lock.
Okay, that's not what I mean.

366
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:40,810
This is a very much a Jeffersonian parlor
with these portraits. Ah, you know,

367
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:42,200
up on the wall.
Um,

368
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,360
but those three men make a Newton
Locke and others did contribute to an

369
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:52,951
intellectual atmosphere that the American
colonists tapped into that shaped

370
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,540
their thoughts about rights,
about resistance,

371
00:22:55,541 --> 00:23:00,170
and then eventually about revolution.
So let's start by looking at,

372
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:04,930
at Jefferson's trinity of
great men. Who were they? Okay,

373
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:05,890
Sir Francis Bacon,

374
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:11,850
man of science who believed that truth
discovered by reason through observation

375
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,870
could promote human happiness as well as
truth communicated through God's direct

376
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,631
revelation.

377
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:24,631
So basically Bacon's work suggested that
it was in humankind's power to discover

378
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:30,961
truth by reason and that by doing
that humankind could better itself.

379
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,320
Okay, so that's Bacon, Isaac Newton,

380
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,980
a second man of science
who studied gravity and the
laws of motion and Newton's

381
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:46,111
work demonstrated that it was possible
through reason and to discover the laws

382
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:49,700
of nature and of nature's God.

383
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:55,900
So Newton's work suggested that the
world is governed by laws that you could

384
00:23:56,151 --> 00:24:00,020
discover and understand that there's a
cause and effect and that through reason

385
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:03,950
and study you can figure out the
cause and effect of Nature's laws.

386
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,730
So then onto the third man,
John Locke,

387
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,900
who second treatise on government from
1683 suggested that you could apply

388
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:20,470
nature's laws to the political world
as well and determine and understand

389
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:23,960
natural and political rights.

390
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,270
And I'm going to offer here it really
woefully brief summary of locks thoughts

391
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:31,970
that'll just be enough to give us a
sense of what it is that Jefferson is

392
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,100
getting at here.
Basically,

393
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:39,370
Locke believed that people weren't born
free unhampered by government and with

394
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:42,980
certain natural rights,
life,

395
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,030
liberty and property and
that to protect these rights,

396
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,750
people decided to voluntarily leave
this state of nature to form a civil

397
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:58,451
government contracting some
of their natural rights to
this government when they

398
00:24:58,641 --> 00:24:59,474
did so.

399
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,470
So civil society was created to protect
humankind's three natural rights life,

400
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:10,520
liberty property. So you could refer
to this as social contract theory.

401
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,120
Logical enough, summing up
of it. If you think about it,

402
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,930
if a civil government is a
kind of voluntary contract,

403
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,630
this suggests that people have a right
to pull out of that contract if their

404
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:25,430
rights are being violated.

405
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,580
And obviously that will have an
important logic down the road.

406
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,550
Now if you take all of that together,

407
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,550
make a Newton lock and the
logic of their thoughts,

408
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,650
you can see the empowering aspect
of Jefferson's trinity, right?

409
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:41,960
All of those men in one way or another,

410
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:45,590
our preaching ideas that
are empowering humankind,

411
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,330
they're suggesting that there are laws
of the universe that could be determined

412
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:54,470
by people and applied to nature,
to government, to science,

413
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:57,680
to society in the hope
of bettering things.

414
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:03,500
They suggested that civil government is
a contract created by and maintained by

415
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:06,770
people,
not some kind of a divine creation.

416
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,640
And if you step back and consider the
implications of these really broad ideas,

417
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:18,850
you can see that they share an underlying
conviction that humankind could solve

418
00:26:19,821 --> 00:26:24,140
God's riddles by dissolving,
dissolving, dissolving his laws,

419
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:28,940
gas discovering and
applying his natural laws.

420
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,460
And in a sense, this is the, the idea
that's the spirit of the enlightenment,

421
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,150
that the world is governed by
natural laws that can be detected,

422
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,290
they can be studied, they can
be applied. And in a sense,

423
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:45,630
the practice of day Islam
stems from this idea. Um,

424
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:49,410
there were some founder types
who were basically deus at heart,

425
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:53,730
believing that God was a sort of divine
clock maker who made a world of logic

426
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,470
and natural laws and then stepped
back and allowed it to operate without

427
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,400
intervening. And this kind of God
is omniscient and all powerful,

428
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,540
but it was natural forces
that governed daily existence

429
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,430
and things that we're governed by
understandable and predictable.

430
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,990
Natural laws could be
detected, analyzed, critiqued,

431
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,090
and applied by man.
So in this sense,

432
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:22,410
you really can see how some of the spirit
of the enlightenment would have been a

433
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:24,420
kind of empowering philosophy.

434
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,000
So Jefferson's trinity of portraits
reveals a lot about this kind of general

435
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:34,020
enlightenment spirit and some of
its intellectual implications.

436
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,690
But what about the
other half of the story?

437
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,530
What about Hamilton's comment about
Julius Caesar and Jefferson's?

438
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:44,340
I'm going to be shocked for
three decades response. Well,

439
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,400
this aspect of the story reveals another
related aspect of the enlightenment

440
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,753
mentality.

441
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,880
It shows how immediate and relevant
the ancient world and actually history

442
00:27:56,011 --> 00:28:01,011
generally was to enlightenment thinkers
and I suppose just in the 18th century

443
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:06,381
generally an idea that's again related
to this idea that humankind can detect

444
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:10,530
patterns and then apply them for all
time because basically if you think about

445
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:14,010
it, if you believe in
ongoing natural patterns,

446
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,220
you're also going to believe
that the study of history,

447
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:22,250
all of history is one way to determine
laws and patterns of human nature that

448
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:28,440
apply across all time.
So basically two people at this period,

449
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,551
all of history,

450
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:34,551
it was like a big grab bag of lessons
about humankind and civil society,

451
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:39,750
ancient Greece, ancient Rome, modern
nations, modern peoples and more.

452
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,020
If you study them,
if you look at rules and patterns,

453
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,520
you could find things to apply to modern
times that ideally would allow you to

454
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:51,510
better things for the present by
learning from the past. And in a way,

455
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:55,170
the ultimate example of this, I think
I've mentioned it once before in here,

456
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:59,940
I'm not sure, is James Madison preparing
for the constitutional convention?

457
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:03,450
Um, and he's very much, he's right
in line with this kind of thinking.

458
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:08,010
He basically says, I'm going to study
republic's across all time, right?

459
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:09,300
All of human time.

460
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:13,140
I will study Republican government and
thinking if he could figure out the rules,

461
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:16,410
if he could figure out what works and
what doesn't work and see the patterns and

462
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:17,310
get the rules,

463
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,780
he can then apply that knowledge to
the creation of a new republic that

464
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:24,690
hopefully then would benefit
from that kind of knowledge.

465
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,750
If I love the fact that
medicine sets out to do that,

466
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:32,430
write that all down on paper so
you can see how in in this sense,

467
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:33,600
if you're thinking along these lines,

468
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:38,601
you can see how ancient history could be
really immediate to this sort of whole

469
00:29:38,821 --> 00:29:42,580
founding generation because it
had real lessons for the present.

470
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,770
And actually one of the most influential
books in educating young gentlemen at

471
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:51,690
the time was Plutarch's lives.
Has anyone here read Plutarch's?

472
00:29:51,691 --> 00:29:55,180
You must be some flu. It was a couple
plutoch readers in here that's admirable.

473
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:55,990
Um,

474
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:00,460
Plutarch's lives is basically a
collection of brief biographies of Great

475
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,410
Statesman and leaders,
ancient Greece, ancient Rome,

476
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,830
and it was aimed at teaching
rules of leadership,

477
00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:08,770
teaching young men how to model themselves
into great leaders are certainly,

478
00:30:08,771 --> 00:30:11,170
that's how it was used
in the 18th century.

479
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,630
Any young man would have read Plutarch's
lives and would have learned, you know,

480
00:30:14,631 --> 00:30:18,260
all the greatest thing I can do is to
be a great statesman and found a nation.

481
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,590
Then here are great
examples for me to follow.

482
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,440
So given this kind of a logic,

483
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,570
there's a good reason why
Hamilton's comment about
Caesar might've been shocking

484
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:29,404
to Jefferson.

485
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:33,700
It's not just a little
interesting intellectual sort
of other part of Hamilton.

486
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,330
Oh,
are there,

487
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,270
the greatest man that ever lived is
rules Julius Caesar Pass the Cherries.

488
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:37,840
I mean,
it's not,

489
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,290
he didn't see this as a sort of random
idle throwaway intellectual comment.

490
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,460
It was a declaration about
present day policies to Jefferson.

491
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,780
And it wasn't a declaration that made
Jefferson happy because think about the

492
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:53,630
historical lesson that Jefferson
logically pulled from health.

493
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,090
His comment about Julius Caesar,
who was Julius Caesar in short,

494
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,510
he was the man who destroyed
the Roman Republic, okay?

495
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,830
He's the guy who marched his army
against the republic who seized power,

496
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:07,150
who made himself emperor.

497
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:12,750
So there we are in 1791 and Alexander
Hamilton in the middle of this experiment

498
00:31:13,691 --> 00:31:16,630
to create a new republic.
No one knows if it's going to work.

499
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,480
It might collapse at any second.
And Alice in her house and says,

500
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:21,450
the greatest man who ever
lived is Julius Caesar,

501
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,810
the man who destroyed the Roman republic.
Okay? This is why Jefferson was like,

502
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:32,110
oh my God, what does this mean? What does
this mean? This is the truth to Hamilton,

503
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:32,501
right?
This is,

504
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:36,280
this is a bad moment as far as relations
between Jefferson and Hamilton are

505
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:41,020
concern. The Jefferson Dinner Party I'm
with never lived it down. So to Jefferson,

506
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,010
this is a side to him, this was like he,
the scales were lifted from his eyes,

507
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:48,580
right? Hamilton wants to be a kind of
Caesar. He's dangerously ambitious.

508
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,380
He wants to destroy the republic.

509
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,040
Maybe he wants to make it go back into a
monarchy and then put himself into some

510
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:55,240
kind of a position of power.

511
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:59,500
Like he could just see the pathway laid
all with that one little comment that

512
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,090
Hamilton tossed out at a dinner.

513
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,380
He had to be careful at how you talked
in an age where history meant that much.

514
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,620
Now let's stop for a moment
also to think why did Hamilton,

515
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:13,130
why did Hamilton say that? Why
did he say that? Um, I mean it's,

516
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,450
it's unlikely that what
he meant to say was, hi,

517
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:20,350
I'm going to be the next Julius Caesar.
I'm out to destroy the republic.

518
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,610
Nice to meet you.
Okay.

519
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:26,500
He probably wasn't intending to signal
some big threat to the American republic.

520
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,430
I think that there are probably
two explanations for it.

521
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,130
No one actually ever absolutely
knows why he said this and that's,

522
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,230
it says more about Hamilton
than anything else.

523
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,800
He's wonderfully self destructive
individual Alexander Hamilton.

524
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:41,360
But in this case, I think there are
two possible reasons why he said this.

525
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:45,530
One is he actually just liked to
savings to upset down this Jefferson,

526
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:50,390
you're really good. And this was a
good one. Better than he thought.

527
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,480
But he liked to push Jefferson's buttons,

528
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,480
get Jefferson all sorts of
sputtering and mad and it worked.

529
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,820
Aaron Berg did the same
thing to Alexander Hamilton,

530
00:32:58,850 --> 00:32:59,870
like he would say sort of shocking,

531
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:04,670
outrageous things and then watched
Hamilton splutter and then Hamilton would

532
00:33:04,671 --> 00:33:06,200
repeat them for years and years and years.

533
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:08,180
Do you know what he said
at the dinner party?

534
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,700
Dinner parties where tricky places can
maneuver in the early republic. Um,

535
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,170
so part of it might've been just Hamilton
being deliberately irritating, um,

536
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,040
or equally possible.

537
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,860
It's possible that that Hamilton
was referring to Caesar as you know,

538
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,820
a statesman, a leader, a
founder of a nation. Um,

539
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,350
Hamilton would have
admired military ability.

540
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:30,740
So he would have actually seriously
admired that. And Cesar too.

541
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:34,250
But he really could have been more
thinking of Caesar as great statesmen,

542
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,320
great leader depicted in Plutarch's
as you know, a model on it.

543
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:43,190
Certainly in the mind of an educated
gentleman like Hamilton being the founder

544
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:43,791
of a nation,

545
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:46,610
being someone who shaping a nation would
have been seen as an admirable thing.

546
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:48,380
So he could have been
thinking along those lines.

547
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:51,590
It's interesting when you look
through all of Hamilton's writings,

548
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:54,530
he doesn't really speak in
praise of Caesar anywhere else,

549
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,270
which might lead you to theory
number one. Okay, teach,

550
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:03,890
see how you deal with this one.
I'm all for Julius Caesar.

551
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,670
What are you going to do?
No, it's hard to know. Um,

552
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:11,240
but at any rate it's unclear what,
what Hamilton's logic is.

553
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:15,500
But you can certainly
understand Jefferson's shocked
response. And either way,

554
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:20,501
both the comment and the response reveal
the power of the classical heritage on

555
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,190
this early American world.

556
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,120
Both men are applying the past
to the present in some way.

557
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,790
And one of the lessons that Caesar
certainly suggested to Thomas Jefferson as

558
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:35,720
suggested by his response is a powerful
lesson that a lot of people were focused

559
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:40,430
on in the early years of the American
republic and in this colonial period is as

560
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:44,270
well. And that is the fragility
of liberties. And in the republic.

561
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:46,760
Also obviously how,
how fragile republics are.

562
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,840
So the ancient world held
really valuable lessons,

563
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,450
but so did the semi recent past as well,
particularly for the American colonists.

564
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,650
There was another period of time that
seemed to hold special lessons for them.

565
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,870
The period of the glorious
revolution in Britain,

566
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:07,490
which would have been a
period when opposition to the
king's Court and ministers

567
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:08,870
was on the rise in Britain,

568
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,230
along with a growing tradition of praise
for English liberties and the glories

569
00:35:12,231 --> 00:35:14,450
of representation in parliament.

570
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,940
So political rhetoric from the era of the
glorious revolution would have focused

571
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:24,710
on attacking corruption and corrupt
influence as when a monarch would try to

572
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:25,700
bribe legislators,

573
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:29,360
are ministers with high office or
pensions granted from the crown,

574
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,780
thereby subverting the
balanced British constitution,

575
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:36,110
which is supposed to be balanced
between Crown, Lourdes and Commons.

576
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:40,590
That would have had some real bearing
on this revolutionary period as well.

577
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,400
But whether talking about history,
ancient or history,

578
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:49,490
relatively modern history did teach
some overriding lessons that British

579
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:53,460
subjects would have taken as
their own throughout this period.

580
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,630
And that at this moment in time would
seem really relevant in the American

581
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:58,464
colonies.

582
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,420
So they're going to be amazingly brief
summary of some of these lessons,

583
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:07,350
but you'll see really clear lessons
that history would appear to be teaching

584
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:10,740
generally and the colonists would
be listening to really attentively.

585
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:16,790
So history taught basically that arbitrary
power is the ultimate threat to good

586
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:18,570
government.
Okay.

587
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:21,750
So the 1770s is a moment
when that's certainly going
to be something that people

588
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:25,680
here history taught that
political liberties were fragile.

589
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,480
History taught that constitutional
principles defended customary contract

590
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:38,340
Terrian rights against government
assertions of arbitrary power.

591
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,490
So arbitrary power is the ultimate
threat to good government.

592
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,710
Political liberties are fragile and it's
constitutional principles that defend

593
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,970
against governments asserting
arbitrary power. So yes,

594
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:55,290
Rome had been great, but arbitrary power
had sent it spiraling into tyranny.

595
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,440
The glorious revolution had been a
moment where ancient liberties had been

596
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:02,310
restored by restraining
the power of the monarch.

597
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,760
So clearly history taught liberty's
fragile and powers the natural enemy.

598
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:13,190
Arbitrary Power and power
naturally grows by nature.

599
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:17,970
Power grows. And as it does it encroaches
on liberty's in a free society.

600
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:21,000
So power has to be restrained.

601
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:26,540
British liberties must be defended
and British liberties as defined by

602
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:30,870
generations of constitutional precedents.

603
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,970
Now it's important to remember that the
British constitution is not a written

604
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:40,080
document like American state
and federal constitutions.

605
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:44,100
It's a way of thinking about
authority largely based on precedent,

606
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,150
based on existing institutions,
based on laws and customs.

607
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,720
And it was a means of limiting
power and defending rights.

608
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:57,950
So when British colonial policy began
to change in the mid 18th century,

609
00:37:58,021 --> 00:38:02,070
and precedents seemed to be
abandoned and new precedents,

610
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:06,450
perhaps we're being set when parliament
seemed to be asserting what certainly to

611
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:11,451
some colonists felt like arbitrary
power is logically began to worry about

612
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:17,340
protecting their fundamental British
liberties against seemingly increasingly

613
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:20,520
arbitrary parliamentary power.
They felt defensive.

614
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:25,970
They worried about the
seeming inevitability of
a rise of arbitrary power.

615
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,053
Now,
of course,

616
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,920
people in parliament did
not see themselves as x
exercising arbitrary power.

617
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:36,280
They saw themselves as
behaving constitutionally
asserting their constitutional

618
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:40,180
power to govern over the colonies.
But as we've seen in this course so far,

619
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:45,420
there were some fundamental disagreements
on both sides about the precise

620
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,690
meaning of parliaments,

621
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,500
constitutional power to govern over the
colonies about the precise way in which

622
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:52,810
this imperial system was supposed to work.

623
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,040
So acts like the stamp act,

624
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:01,800
which parliament basically intended as
a way to raise revenue or the tea act.

625
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:06,801
Same idea could logically seem to the
colonists like a way of establishing a new

626
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:09,020
precedent,
right?

627
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:13,900
And a new precedent that ultimately would
be making some kind of inroad against

628
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:16,120
liberty and property rights.

629
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:21,690
And particularly given that the stamp
act was not ultimately raising enormous

630
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:23,350
sums of money to the colonists,

631
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:26,110
that was a real sign that it
must be about a precedent, right?

632
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:30,850
It can't really be about raising enormous
sums of money. It must be a trap,

633
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:35,710
a precedent setting trap that if they
can get us to accept this precedent,

634
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,580
then the government will be able to set
future taxes along similar lines because

635
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:42,610
the precedent well have been set.
If your constitution,

636
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:45,550
if you understand your constitutional
rights as based on precedent,

637
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,430
when you see new precedents
potentially being set,

638
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,410
that's a potentially scary thing,

639
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,970
so you can kind of get a sense of why the
colonists and reacting as they do to a

640
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:58,810
lot of events in this period.
As John Dickinson wrote,

641
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,490
and I've mentioned before his,

642
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:04,090
he's really well known pamphlet from
1768 called letters from a farmer in

643
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:06,520
Pennsylvania,
Dickinson wrote,

644
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:10,960
nothing is wanted at home
and by home he means Britain,

645
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,400
but a precedent,

646
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,380
the force of which shall be established
by the tacit submission of the colonies.

647
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,530
If the parliament
succeeds in this attempt,

648
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:25,270
other statutes will impose other duties
and thus the parliament will levy upon

649
00:40:25,271 --> 00:40:29,920
us such sums of money as they choose
to take without any other limitation,

650
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,460
then their pleasure, right? He
says it's just about the precedent.

651
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:36,880
It's all about precedent.
That's what we're looking at here.

652
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:40,390
This the fact that small amounts of
money are being raised in a sense,

653
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:43,990
it's the ultimate proof that what really
matters to parliament is the precedent

654
00:40:43,991 --> 00:40:44,824
that they're setting.

655
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:49,600
The same holds true for the vice admiralty
courts I've mentioned before that

656
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:53,800
were being used as venues for trying
certain crimes committed in the colonies.

657
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,650
Vice Admiralty courts were
composed of a single judge.

658
00:40:56,651 --> 00:41:01,600
They had no jury and they were becoming
responsible for enforcing parliamentary

659
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:04,630
legislation and the new legislation.
Logically,

660
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,980
many colonists would have seen this.
Again, really dangerous precedent,

661
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:13,120
violating fundamental British
constitutional rights,

662
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,400
violating past precedents,

663
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:21,430
the presence of a standing army in the
colonies. Also same kind of threat,

664
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,720
same kind of fear.

665
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,590
Something new is happening
here and certainly history,

666
00:41:26,591 --> 00:41:31,591
ancient and modern taught
about the dangers of a
standing army and Samuel Adams

667
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:35,930
summed up prevailing ideas about standing
armies in a newspaper essay that he

668
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:39,290
wrote in 1768 and he wrote,

669
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:44,830
it is a very improbable supposition that
any people can long remain free with a

670
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:48,290
strong military power in the
very heart of their country.

671
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:53,120
Unless that military power is under the
direction of the people and even then it

672
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:54,920
is dangerous history.

673
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:59,420
Both ancient and modern affords many
instances of the overthrow of states and

674
00:41:59,421 --> 00:42:04,421
kingdoms by the power of soldiers who
were raised and maintained at first under

675
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:08,840
the plausible pretense of
defending those very liberties,

676
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:12,950
which they afterwards destroyed.
So in the colonies,

677
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:15,950
the fear of a standing army with bad
enough at the end of the French and Indian

678
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:19,820
war, when the crown sent troops to
protect the colonists against the French,

679
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,610
the Spanish and native
American populations.

680
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,690
But a few years later when troops began
to arrive in Boston and Response to

681
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:28,100
stamp act demonstrations,

682
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:33,230
it's certainly seem to many colonists
as though it might be the first step in

683
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:36,740
what could be the destruction of their
liberties there. Colonial charters,

684
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:40,970
their constitutional rights, uh,
seem to be, again, a scary precedent.

685
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,550
Now, in a way, it's really tempting
to look at this way of thinking like,

686
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,810
these people are like worried
about precedents. What's happening?

687
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:50,150
What does it mean? It must be a
sign that they're going to do worse.

688
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,950
And think of these people as being really
paranoid in a logical, like, oh, come on.

689
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:59,870
You know what? If it's just like a little
gesture to raise some money. Colonists.

690
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:02,720
Why? Why do you seem so paranoid?
And they're in the past.

691
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:07,130
They're actually have been some historians
who suggested that the colonists were

692
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,930
to some degree being paranoid.

693
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:13,220
We're seeing threats of tyranny where
there actually wasn't any Tierney at all.

694
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:14,960
But as I've just described,

695
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:20,180
precedents are a fundamental part of
British constitutional thought and

696
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:24,860
enlightenment theory backed up that idea
because enlightenment science promised

697
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:28,130
the capacity to understand and
control nature and society.

698
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:32,600
You're supposed to be looking for patterns
of behavior to understand what things

699
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:33,434
mean.

700
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:38,270
So the British government seem to be
setting new precedents and the colonists

701
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:39,560
were looking for the pattern,

702
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,940
trying to figure out the logic of what
was happening, what was parliament up to,

703
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,410
what were they thinking?

704
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,670
Why were they seemingly violating
fundamental constitutional rights?

705
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:54,230
And you can see this logic
again in Dickinson's pamphlet
and his letters from a

706
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:58,280
farmer in Pennsylvania, which he argued,
was premised on his desire quote,

707
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:02,150
to discover the intentions
of those who rule over us.

708
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,180
Why are they doing what they're doing?
There's a pattern. What is the pattern?

709
00:44:05,181 --> 00:44:06,014
What does it mean?

710
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:11,300
Colonist ultimately resisted what they
saw as the approach of tyranny and their

711
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:14,780
resistance stiffen.
The British government's resolve,

712
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,260
which in turn provoke more of
a reaction in the colonies.

713
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,450
And eventually down the road,

714
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,720
the colonists would come to see their
social contract with the British

715
00:44:23,721 --> 00:44:26,900
government broken a conclusion,
which would seem to them,

716
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:30,890
give them the right of community
resistance. But as I've said,

717
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,610
it's important to recognize that the
colonists at this point see their actions

718
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,460
not as revolutionary,
but just the opposite.

719
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:40,470
They're fighting for their British rights.

720
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,170
They're not trying to figure
out how to stage a revolution.

721
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,600
I think we hear the phrase
continental congress were like, Ooh,

722
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,500
one more continental congress, and
we're there. You know, they, wow.

723
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:50,221
Almost an independence.

724
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:52,950
But that's obviously not the way
that they're thinking at the time.

725
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,210
They see themselves as fighting against
arbitrary power in defense of British

726
00:44:57,211 --> 00:45:01,790
liberties, not as rabid revolutionaries.
And thus far in the course,

727
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,790
it's parliament.

728
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,870
That seems to be the main source of
arbitrary power to the colonists.

729
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:09,360
So as we're going to
see in future lectures,

730
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:13,920
a logical response to this conclusion
would be for the colonists to next turn to

731
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:15,990
the king to solve their problems.
Okay.

732
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:18,300
If parliament is
exercising arbitrary power,

733
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,470
we will now turn it to the king and
appealed to him to solve our problems.

734
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:26,460
We will see that logic go into
effect very soon in future lectures.

735
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,770
So more has to happen before the colonists
begin to consider the ultimate act of

736
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:32,604
resistance.

737
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,780
Actual rebellion would seem
to them as the last resort,

738
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,350
the last resort of people
unable to protect their lives,

739
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,340
liberties and properties by
normal constitutional methods.

740
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,240
And there were some members of parliament
that could foresee this looming threat.

741
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,430
And early 1775 Edmund Burke gave one of
his best known speeches in parliament.

742
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,930
It was a three hour speech,

743
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,740
and he argued in his speech that
parliament should try to be conciliatory

744
00:45:58,741 --> 00:46:02,250
towards the colonies or risk
pushing them to extremes.

745
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,420
And he laid out in this speech some of
the points that actually come up just in

746
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:10,800
the course of this lecture. He said,
Americans love their liberties. Why?

747
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:13,200
Because they're descendants of liberty,

748
00:46:13,201 --> 00:46:17,820
loving English citizens to those who
argue that giving concessions to the

749
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:20,880
colonists would encourage them
to demand even more concessions.

750
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:25,530
Burke said he doubted whether quote
giving to millions of my fellow citizens

751
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:26,910
some share of those rights,

752
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:31,530
which I have always been taught to value
would bring down the empire and he had

753
00:46:31,531 --> 00:46:33,090
a dramatic conclusion.
He said,

754
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:37,290
let the colonies always keep the idea of
their civil rights associated with your

755
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:38,124
government.

756
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,870
They will cling and grapple to you and
no forest under heaven will be of power

757
00:46:42,871 --> 00:46:44,940
to tear them from their allegiance.

758
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,870
But let it once be understood that your
government may be one thing and their

759
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:53,280
privilege another, that these two things
may exist without any mutual relation.

760
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,020
The cement is gone,

761
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:00,320
the cohesion is loosened and everything
hastens to decay and dissolution.

762
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:04,440
So to the colonists, and in a sense
you can hear to Burke as well,

763
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:09,650
rebellion would be a drastic action
only to be exercised by an overwhelming

764
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:14,790
majority of the community against rulers
who so completely ignored the terms of

765
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:19,791
the original social contract as to make
further allegiance a crime against God.

766
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:20,754
And reason,

767
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:25,020
and it's really only by grasping this
mindset and really taking it seriously

768
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,650
that we can begin to
understand events to come.

769
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,860
That will lead to what is seen at the
time is that last dire step towards

770
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:38,710
revolution. I will stop there.
I will see you on Tuesday.

771
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:43,390
Happy paper completing
and have a good weekend.
