1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,800
Today we're going to be talking
about being a British colonist,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,990
which means we're going to be discussing
how you would feel if you were part of

3
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:13,380
the British empire in
the mid 18th century,

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,450
living in the North American
colonies shortly before the
onset of the revolution.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,340
And for those of you who were not here
on Tuesday, I talked for a little while,

6
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,770
I'll just mention it here.
Um,

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,920
about how this course was really going
to be exploring the mindset of the people

8
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:33,810
who are experiencing the revolution to
really try to get it the logic behind

9
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:37,830
both what the British colonists in the
British authorities were doing and how

10
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:39,390
that ultimately resulted in a war.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,190
So we really were going to try to really
kind of create two opposing forms of

12
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:47,790
logic and understand how they came to
oppose each other and how that ended up

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,900
leading into conflict. So it makes
sense that as a starting point,

14
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,490
we're going to start by
essentially talking about
some of the basics about being

15
00:00:56,491 --> 00:01:00,120
a British colonist in North America.
What their world would have been like.

16
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:02,670
What your world would have been
like if you had been a colonist,

17
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,660
what your feelings would have been about
yourself as part of the British empire

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,750
if you were a colonist in the
middle of the 18th century.

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,170
Now I'll note here just
in passing, um, that the,

20
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:17,640
the first part of Gordon Woods radicalism,
which I already mentioned once,

21
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,470
that actually deals a lot with the topic
that I'll be talking about today. And,

22
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:24,060
and I think one or two more lectures,

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,870
the sort of idea about what the colonies
were like prior to the revolution.

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,180
That book overall presents
an argument about how, uh,

25
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,420
the colonies went from monarchy.
The first third of the book is monarchy.

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,820
And then the second,
third of the book is republicanism.

27
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:43,800
And then the third is democracy. Um,
and I think I said Tuesday, I said,

28
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,800
think about what words mean. I'm sure
that will come into play in Gordon Wood.

29
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,933
But,
um,

30
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,110
the monarchy section not surprisingly
goes into some depth about some of the

31
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:54,330
things I'm going to be talking
about today and on Tuesday,

32
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:57,900
which is kind of life in
the colonies before the war.

33
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:00,480
Sort of just basically what did it mean?
How did it work?

34
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,610
How did society function? Okay, so let's
actually start with some of the basics.

35
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,370
First and most basic,

36
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,760
if you were a British colonist
here in North America,

37
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,240
you would be living somewhere
along the Atlantic seaboard.

38
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,850
The colonial population was largely
clustered right along the shoreline.

39
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,650
It's for really practical reasons.

40
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:25,140
I'm sure you don't have to be
very imaginative to think why.

41
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm obviously for reasons of trade,
for reasons of shipping,

42
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:32,790
and even just for reasons of
communication. It made sense.

43
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:37,260
Not to mention the fact that people had
a pretty healthy fear of potentially

44
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:41,640
unfriendly Indians who were
not particularly pleased
with the idea of losing

45
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:46,050
land to potentially advancing settlers.
Now,

46
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:47,130
if you were male,

47
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,670
you might very well be a small landholder
because about 60% of the white male

48
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,190
colonists owned land.

49
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,100
And as I'll talk about
down the road a little bit,

50
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,230
that's actually when you compare that
with the rates of land ownership and

51
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,970
Europe, that's actually pretty high.
It's pretty high rate of ownership.

52
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,170
And even in today's lecture you'll see
how that actually has an impact on how

53
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:15,640
things are functioning in
the American colonies. Um,

54
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,510
you probably would be a small landholder
you met might be if you were living in

55
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:21,820
one of the small cities along the coast,

56
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:26,650
maybe a merchant or an artisan
as a non enslaved person,

57
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,180
you would probably have decent clothes.
You probably have a decent home.

58
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:36,181
You probably would have some degree of
economic and personal independence and

59
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:40,390
right around the term like let's say 1770,

60
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,340
you would be one of about 2 million North
American colonists, which is actually,

61
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:46,600
if you think about it,
certainly if you,

62
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,570
if I asked you to guess how many
colonists there, we're in 1770.

63
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:52,810
You probably would not say
2 million. It's a lot. Um,

64
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,690
and that includes both
free people and slaves.

65
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,430
And you would have been
living in a society that was
so booming with prosperity

66
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,820
that between the year 1,717 70 so we're
just talking about a 70 year period.

67
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,450
The population increased from 200,000
to over 2 million in just a 70 year

68
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:15,190
period,
which is amazing.

69
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,880
So basically things were
increasing every decade.

70
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,910
The population was increasing at a rate
of roughly 30 to 40% it's a huge rate of

71
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:29,050
growth. You would be living in the
midst of a host of British colony.

72
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,500
So it's not just you along the seaboard,
but obviously to the north.

73
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:34,840
There's Canada to the south,

74
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,930
there were British islands
in the West indies,

75
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,030
which were known as the sugar islands.

76
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,920
And to the West was the vast scary
wilderness populated by potentially

77
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:49,300
unfriendly Indians with what felt to
you as though it was an entirely foreign

78
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,500
culture. And then of course
to the east, to the east,

79
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,700
there is civilization to your east. There
is the metropolis, there is England,

80
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,650
there is culture in the minds of the
colonists and probably to many people in

81
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:03,670
England as well,

82
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,860
the height of cultural and
political sophistication
when you looked to the east.

83
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,170
And it really was,
if you were a colonist,

84
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:13,150
it was looking to the
east towards England,

85
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,190
that you really got a sense of yourself
as a British colonist and really felt

86
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:23,170
that you belong to something that was
powerful and admirable and world shaping

87
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:24,550
and victorious basically,

88
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,780
you understood yourself as being part
of an empire by identifying with that

89
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:33,070
center of Empire to the east.
As an example of this,

90
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:36,430
just listen to someone who ends up
being a rather prominent American

91
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:38,560
revolutionary.
And I mentioned him as a matter of fact.

92
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,260
On Tuesday I called him to the doctor,
to the stars,

93
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:44,410
and that's kind of unfair to
him. Um, but Benjamin Rush,

94
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,220
he actually was a really prominent
man of science at the time.

95
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:50,920
He moved in very high political circles.
Um,

96
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,590
when I was thinking about this
lecture today, I remembered,

97
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,170
or at least I hope I remembered, I
think I'm not leading you astray. Um,

98
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,320
I think that that actually
rush help Thomas Paine edit
common sense and I think,

99
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,590
uh, he edited out a sentence
that I wished pain had left in.

100
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,130
So I don't like Russia as an
editor very much. I think,

101
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,570
well wait till we get to common sense,
but,

102
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,220
and supposedly allegedly it's rush who
came up with the title common sense that

103
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:20,660
pain was going to call it plain truth and
a rushed. I think rush wounds on that.

104
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:24,590
I think plain truth is not as snazzy
as is common sense, but either way. Um,

105
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:25,960
so rush the,
the,

106
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,300
my main point here in blathering happily
about rush is he's not some little

107
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:33,050
modest humbug of a guy,
right? He's someone of status.

108
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,200
So this is Russia's response when he
saw the throne of the King of England.

109
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,730
So rush said,
I felt as though I were on sacred ground.

110
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,860
I gaze for some time at the throne with
emotions that I cannot describe. Okay.

111
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:53,480
He's, he's just dumbstruck at the
throne of the King of England.

112
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:58,250
Just looking at it now we sit here,
we think back were like,

113
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,040
oh boy,
aren't those monarchists really cute.

114
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,940
It was cute water cause was silly.
People who are amazed at a throne,

115
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,190
which is pretty much I think
what I thought was wow,

116
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:10,820
what an interesting phase in
American history when they
were dazzled by a throne.

117
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,980
Then a couple of years ago I ended up
being lucky enough to have a member of

118
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:19,660
parliament show me around the houses
of parliament and I was excited.

119
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:23,510
It's pretty neat being all American
historian ish, you know. Oh, how similar.

120
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:27,580
How interesting. When you compare it. So
I'm doing the geeky storing thing and uh,

121
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,131
then this,

122
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:31,370
this member of parliament who's
showing me around takes me into what he

123
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,300
described to me as the roping
chamber for the Queen, uh,

124
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,350
where she puts on her crown and ceremonial
robes before she goes into the House

125
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,351
of Lords,

126
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:42,680
which I gather she does at the beginning
of every session of parliament. Okay.

127
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:45,560
So I'm walking to like the robbing
chamber and at the head of that room,

128
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:48,260
there's a throne,
sort of an elevated throne.

129
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,880
So like instantly without even
thinking in my head, I'm thinking, wow,

130
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,340
like that's the throne.

131
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,020
And then I thought I just
became Benjamin Rush. Like,

132
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,130
like just like that.
I went right into the monarchy vortex.

133
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,680
Like it didn't really take me very long,
so I can't chortle at rush anymore.

134
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:10,220
So there is something
impressive and particularly
at this moment if you had been

135
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:11,270
a colonist,
um,

136
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,380
and not that many people I should say
necessarily even got to travel to Europe.

137
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:17,660
I'll talk a little bit
about that later on too.

138
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:21,920
But you certainly would have been Austrac
and impressed by something like the

139
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:24,560
throne of the King of England.
Okay.

140
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:29,561
So as suggested by rush quavering in
front of the throne as a colonist,

141
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,690
you would be proud to be British.

142
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,710
You would have a really deep affection
for the mother country and it would be an

143
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:41,711
affection that was really rooted in bonds
of culture and tradition and language.

144
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,091
Basically,

145
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:49,091
you would really consider yourself lucky
to belong to a powerful nation that

146
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:50,570
granted its citizens.

147
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,690
You believed more liberty than any
nation on unlike other modern empires.

148
00:08:58,351 --> 00:08:59,184
At the time,

149
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,350
England seemed particularly to the
English to be an empire that was bound

150
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:06,360
together,
not by force,

151
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,980
but by bonds of interconnectedness
and affection as well as a joint

152
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,400
appreciation,
real love of liberty and order.

153
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,450
And we're going to come back to this
idea of liberty a little bit later in the

154
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:21,810
course where we start to really
talk about the logic of revolution.

155
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,670
But for now I'll just highlight the fact
that if you asked an English speaking

156
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:30,270
person of the 18th century about liberty,

157
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,770
he or she would have told you that
liberty was worth more than life, right?

158
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:36,960
Liberty was it.
Liberty was what mattered.

159
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,070
It was the most important
possession of a civilized people.

160
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,870
And of course the British people,

161
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:46,920
colonists and all felt that they were
at the peak of the civilized world.

162
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,480
As somebody at the time
wrote what signify riches?

163
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,560
What signifies health or
life itself without liberty?

164
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,800
Wife without liberty is
the most errant trifle,

165
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:03,060
the most insignificant
enjoyment in the world. Okay.

166
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,760
Extreme.
But you know something to think about.

167
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,970
I suppose it's related to what I said.
I'm on Tuesday.

168
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,780
I think it's also easy to hear some of
this talk that sounds really inflated and

169
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,840
to dismiss it as mere rhetoric.
Um,

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,430
and I'm sure there is some mere
rhetoric floating around here,

171
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:19,320
but it's important,
I think,

172
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:23,640
not to dismiss things that sound extreme
and emotional as simply emotional and

173
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:27,630
extreme. I mean, some of this
actually represents sincere thought.

174
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,950
So I think before you think these guys
are sort of over excited about things,

175
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,860
think here's off that they actually
honestly may be over excited.

176
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:36,810
It might just be that they're dramatic,

177
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:38,370
but that they sincerely feel these things.

178
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,260
There was a time when
historians did assume that a
lot of revolutionary rhetoric

179
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:46,170
from the colonists was
actually kind of inflated,

180
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,700
kind of for propaganda purposes. Um,
and it took a while actually, um,

181
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,510
the faces of revolution book by Bailyn
at part of the book that I mentioned

182
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:57,690
before, it comes from his larger book
on the ideology of the revolution.

183
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,850
He's the guy who said,
you know,

184
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:03,990
I've read several hundred revolutionary
war pamphlets and I actually think

185
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:06,480
they're serious.
I think we have to take them seriously.

186
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,490
I don't think it's propaganda or rhetoric.

187
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:12,190
I think they actually feel these things.
So again,

188
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,990
to us it might sound a little inflated,
but their feelings are really strong. And,

189
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:17,701
and again,

190
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:21,330
liberty is one of the things that we'll
find they're feeling very strongly about.

191
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,100
So as a colonist,
you would be proud to be British.

192
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,120
You would be really obviously proud of
British liberties and you would have been

193
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:34,410
particularly proud about being British
after the French and Indian war in the

194
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:39,411
1760s when North American colonists fought
right alongside the British army and

195
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:43,500
helped them defeat England's great enemy,
the French,

196
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:45,330
and more on that to come for sure.

197
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,550
But that was a really proud
moment for the colonists,

198
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:50,580
that they felt that they were right there
with the British army fighting against

199
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,980
the French above all else.

200
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,740
As British colonists,
you would of course,

201
00:11:56,741 --> 00:12:01,741
consider yourselves to be British
subjects through and through equal to all

202
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:06,400
other British subjects. Even those living
off in the east, in the metropolis,

203
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,810
you were a British subject and you
deserve the rights of a British subject.

204
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,930
But as a colonist living
on the peripheries of the
British empire on the edge of

205
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:19,450
what was perceived at the time
to be a howling wilderness,

206
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:24,210
which is one of those great 18th century
ways of referring to North America. Um,

207
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:29,310
you also would be a little nervous
about your status as a British subject,

208
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:34,060
worried about how you rated in comparison
with people living in the mother

209
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:36,610
country at the center of the empire.

210
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,540
Everything seemed more sophisticated
in England and I suppose everything was

211
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,400
more sophisticated in England,

212
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:48,190
but it definitely seemed
that way to the colonists.

213
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,720
The clothes were more fashionable,
the homes were grander and more stately.

214
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,280
The intellectual life was rich and
challenging in comparison with the

215
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:58,960
sophisticated people in England.

216
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,430
You as a North American colonists
pretty much felt like a country bumpkin.

217
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:06,910
You felt kind of dull, kind
of primitive, somewhat rude,

218
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,820
and certainly you felt
potentially irrelevant.

219
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,580
You really did feel that you are on
the edge of a howling wilderness.

220
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,080
So in essence, like most British
colonists in North America,

221
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:21,940
if you were there at the time, you would
have had an ongoing inferiority complex.

222
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,763
Now,

223
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,450
there were a number of ways in which
you might deal with your insecurities.

224
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,381
Um,

225
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:34,300
one way to deal with that would have
been to become really apologetic for what

226
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:38,680
would have been labeled as American
speech patterns or American manners.

227
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,110
And I've already given you one
arrogant British quote, um,

228
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,370
by that fellow on Tuesday who said
that he was mortified that these crude

229
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:47,260
colonists spoke English.

230
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,980
I can trace themselves to us
because they speak our language.

231
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:54,040
So it's sort of the ultimate
nasty stab at the colonists.

232
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,570
So you actually for good reason might
feel kind of embarrassed about your

233
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,040
manners and your speech.

234
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,090
You probably would feel
equally embarrassed at the
meanness of your architecture.

235
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:07,540
Your buildings are smaller and less
impressive at the pallor of your

236
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:12,280
intellectual life at the relative
unimportance of your public affairs.

237
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,510
Like a lot of colonial writers who
wrote pamphlets or books addressed to an

238
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:17,380
English audience,

239
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,660
you probably would apologize for the
poor quality of your work by reminding

240
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,280
readers as one writer did.

241
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,390
I live in the uncultivated
woods of America,

242
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,550
far from the fountains of science and
with but very rare opportunities of

243
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:34,930
conversing with learned men.

244
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,500
That's almost sounds like someone feels
sorry for himself and I'm so far from

245
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:43,501
civilization or you might boast about
colonial society not claiming to be better

246
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,170
than the mother country,

247
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,380
but instead bragging that the colonies
represented in miniature that colonial

248
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:54,860
legislatures.
In this sense,

249
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:59,861
we're kind of like mini parliaments or
you might admit that the colonies were

250
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:02,630
different from England,

251
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,170
but boast that in the same way that
England once had been pure and virtuous,

252
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:14,420
you in the colonies were maintaining the
sort of pure virtuous England and that

253
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,410
England itself was becoming corrupt and
it's cities were becoming cesspools,

254
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:19,640
but they are in the colonies.

255
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:24,641
You are preserving the true
British heritage still.

256
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,940
Whichever way you chose to rationalize
or understand your status as a colonist,

257
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,960
you could not escape the fact that you
were a colonist and that you were far

258
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:40,961
away from the center of the civilized
world as the young John Dickinson of

259
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:44,240
Pennsylvania put it. And we're going
to meet John Dickinson again for sure.

260
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:45,920
Later on to the course.
Uh,

261
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,710
he wrote to his father while
he was studying law in London,

262
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,920
and he said that when colonists went to
England and saw the difference between

263
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:59,120
themselves and the polite part of the
world, they must be miserable. I mean,

264
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:00,290
he actually thinks of people,

265
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:04,850
any colonists goes to London and sees
what the polite part of the world lives.

266
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:09,050
Like. They'll never be able to hold
their head up in the colonies ever again.

267
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,620
And Jefferson felt the same way.
Thomas Jefferson actually, um,

268
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,590
as much as he adored being,
uh, particularly in France. Um,

269
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,900
he actually said more than once that he
thought that young American men should

270
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:25,100
not be allowed to go to Europe because
if they impressionable young men went to

271
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:25,880
Europe,

272
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,880
they would be so impressed by Paris and
London that they would never be able to

273
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:31,010
hold their heads up in
Massachusetts or Virginia.

274
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,790
It would look so puny and insignificant
in comparison that they would never be

275
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:38,330
good Americans ever again and that
they'd have to go back to Europe.

276
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,030
Now,
of course,

277
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,650
the British agreed generally with
this assessment of colonial society,

278
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,280
colonists obviously were inferior
and rough and rustic and crude.

279
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,640
So as promised,

280
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:55,940
here is yet another arrogant British
quote in my series of arrogant British

281
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:57,770
quotes. Um, in this case,

282
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:02,771
one British observer noted
American colonists may try
to ape British habits and

283
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:08,900
customs, but they're no more than
ruffled dunces. I just think there's,

284
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:13,610
these guys have like a real vim and
vigor for finding like the little zippy

285
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:16,610
stinging ft statement. I think
ruffled dunces is a pretty good one.

286
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:22,420
What else could be expected
from aggrandized upstarts
in those infant countries

287
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:27,761
of America who never have an opportunity
to see or if they had the opportunity

288
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:33,290
to observe the different ranks
of men in polite nations.

289
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:37,400
Notice how the colonies are never polite.
They're the polite missions.

290
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:42,090
And then there's the scary
howling wilderness colonists.
Along these same lines,

291
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:45,700
there's actually another professor
here at gale Kerrianne Yakota. Um,

292
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:48,920
and some of her work shows I found
this really fascinating. Um, the,

293
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:50,910
the British regularly sent,
um,

294
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,670
damaged or second rate goods
to the colonists because
they figured the colonist

295
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,740
wouldn't know the difference.

296
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,600
They just kept the first rights stuff for
themselves, like broken Massachusetts.

297
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,030
They'll never know last week, last
year, his style, Massachusetts.

298
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:11,130
So basically all of the shows that if
Americans had an inferiority complex,

299
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,190
they had some reason to have one.
Now,

300
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,990
let me add at this point that this
anxiety about how the colonists rated in

301
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:22,050
comparison with England,
specifically in Europe,

302
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,710
the polite world generally
doesn't end with the revolution.

303
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:26,590
It's not as though suddenly we,

304
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:29,790
when the revolution then we don't really
care what the rest of the world thinks

305
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,440
even after the colonies.

306
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,250
And then the states had fought and
defeated the great power of the British

307
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:38,970
empire and successfully created
a new national constitution.

308
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,710
Americans were still worried about looking
sophisticated enough in the eyes of

309
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:45,930
the world.
And my favorite example of this,

310
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,890
it's a little bit down the road from
the moment that we're at in this course,

311
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:53,280
but I just can't resist adding it in
cause it's just, it makes me happy.

312
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:57,360
And it's John Adams. Um,
and it's actually from 1789.

313
00:18:57,361 --> 00:19:00,690
It's right when this new national
constitution has gone into effect.

314
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,940
And the Senate is debating what the
title should be for the new national

315
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:08,220
executive, right? We know there's
going to be a national executive,

316
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,750
we don't know what
we're going to call him.

317
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,650
And so the Senate is debating this
and someone in the Senate says, well,

318
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:17,640
why don't we call him president
of the United States? Okay,

319
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,840
this horrifies John Adams. I
mean, absolutely horrifies him.

320
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,740
And as he says at the
time, says, for God's sake,

321
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:30,060
they're presidents of cricket clubs,
president of the United States,

322
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,450
and I'll quote him exactly here.
He does say the presence of cricket clubs,

323
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,840
but he says in the Senate,
um, where is it here?

324
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,100
What will the common people
of foreign countries,

325
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,480
what will the sailors and soldiers say,
George Washington,

326
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,940
president of the United States,

327
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,060
they will despise him to all eternity.

328
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,270
I was just thinking in a world where
you have his royal highness protector of

329
00:19:57,271 --> 00:20:00,270
the realm, you know, president of the
United States, he's just thinking,

330
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,180
there's just no comparison.
It doesn't rank.

331
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,310
So as we're going to be seeing in
future weeks of this course, there's a,

332
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,120
there's a constant thinking about what,
how we're being looked upon.

333
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:14,220
And that doesn't go away.
It shifts. It's different,

334
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:17,730
but it remains for quite some time.
America in one way or another,

335
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:22,731
always assumes they're being
watched and judged in the 1760s.

336
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,510
We'll see soon.

337
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:29,130
How could these sort of colonial feelings
of inferiority would help fuel the

338
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:33,780
hypersensitivity of the
colonists to infringements
on their rights by the mother

339
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:37,590
country. Now, despite all of this anxiety,

340
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:42,390
all of this inferiority complex that
I'm talking about here as a colonist,

341
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:47,170
you did share a base of assumptions
and values with your counterparts in

342
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:51,070
England. So first of
all, as an individual,

343
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:55,330
you assumed that you lived in a great
hierarchy as sort of natural order.

344
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,130
Everyone in his or her place different to
those that were beneath you, respected,

345
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,180
but I'm sorry, different to those
above you. That's a nifty order.

346
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,130
If you're different to those
beneath you and respected,

347
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,390
you would be respectful to those
above and people below you would be

348
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:11,170
differential to you.

349
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,470
So basically everyone is in their place
and everybody's acting respectful and

350
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:17,440
deferential as they properly should.
And this,

351
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:19,750
you'll see a lot of this and Gordon Wood.
Now of course,

352
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:22,000
the American version of
this great social order,

353
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:26,680
this great hierarchy is different in
some ways from its British equivalent

354
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,100
because the colonies lacked both the top,

355
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:34,900
most and the bottom most rungs of
society in England. So in the colonies,

356
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:39,901
there wasn't a titled Entrenched
Aristocracy and there wasn't an entrenched

357
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,660
peasant class. Instead,
the colonies had what?

358
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:48,661
Some called a middling society which
was populated mostly by either middling

359
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:51,574
folk,

360
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,670
logically enough who had migrated from
England to better their lot in life by

361
00:21:57,311 --> 00:22:02,311
the English poor who hoped to better
themselves and by some of the lower ranks

362
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:08,530
of the English gentry like third or
fourth sons of the English gentry who

363
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:11,950
basically knew they weren't going to
inherit anything in England and so their

364
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:12,431
thought was,

365
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,880
well maybe if I head off to the colonies
I it'll be easier for me to get some

366
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,530
land there.
I'll be able to better myself.

367
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:22,300
I'll be able to basically make something
of myself there easier than I can here.

368
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,310
Now,

369
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,760
if you were thinking about going to the
colonies and if and you really want it

370
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:28,870
to get rich quick,

371
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,150
the West indies was the place to go though
it also offered some of the absolute

372
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:37,630
worst living conditions in
the British colonial world.

373
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:42,190
Life there was extremely hard.
There was unbearable heat.

374
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,240
All energies were focused on
gaining money and little else.

375
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,220
West Indian planters, we're so
focused on money, money, crops,

376
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,800
they actually didn't even
bother to grow their own food.

377
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,250
They imported food because
they didn't want to waste land,

378
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,130
energy and resources on
growing their own food.

379
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,350
They were really focused
on their money crop.

380
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,560
If you went to the nds to get rich quick,

381
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:10,390
typically you either made it big
or failed miserably and either way,

382
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:12,520
typically what happened is
he would go to the indies,

383
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,420
you would establish a plantation,
you would find an overseer,

384
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,650
you would put him in charge,

385
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:21,640
and then you would flee back to England
and be an absentee landlord and let the

386
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:25,120
people live in misery and the West indies
while you collected the profit off of

387
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:30,070
your sugar crop back home in England.
Now the indies, not surprisingly,

388
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:32,470
it might seem a little intimidating
if you wanted to get rich quick,

389
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:35,140
you might choose not to go down
to the scary sugar islands.

390
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:40,150
You might decide instead to go to the
southern colonies to get rich quick.

391
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,410
And for example,

392
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,560
it was largely sons of the lesser gentry
in who went to Jamestown at the start

393
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:51,590
of the 17th century in Virginia.
And logically enough,

394
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:55,100
since these are sons of the lesser
gentry and they consider themselves to be

395
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,330
above hard labor,

396
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,230
they show up to this rather
primitive new colony and Jamestown,

397
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,470
they refuse to work to,

398
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,440
to grow their own food
and they starve to death.

399
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,360
Like that's a serious commitment to your
status. I'm sorry, I'm above plowing.

400
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,870
I'm going to die now.
I mean,

401
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,060
you think sooner or later they kind of
figure a little plowing life. You know,

402
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:19,220
it's kind of, I don't
know. Um, at any rate,

403
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:21,170
there's a reason why
Jamestown didn't do so well.

404
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,620
And there's a great example
of this weird mentality, um,

405
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,660
is Nathaniel Bacon who's
a genteel colonist.

406
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:34,640
He's a younger son of a member of the
British gentry and in the 17th century,

407
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:38,450
sure enough, he migrates, he ends up
in Virginia and he arrives in Virginia.

408
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:41,300
Like a lot of people assuming
that he deserved power,

409
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,470
he deserved land and he deserves status.
I mean he's among the lesser gentry,

410
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,810
but he still is among the upper crust
and England and now he's arriving among

411
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:50,600
the rood,
ruffled bounces of the colonies.

412
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,500
He assumes he's someone who deserves
what he wants. Lo and behold,

413
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:58,460
he gets there and he finds that actually
in Virginia there's a kind of inner

414
00:24:58,461 --> 00:25:03,320
core of men self made men who had been
there for awhile or their families had

415
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:06,890
been there for a while and basically
they controlled most of the land.

416
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,200
They controlled most of
the government offices.

417
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:13,580
They had most of the power and that
they could exclude bacon and others from

418
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:16,700
getting what they wanted.
Bacon,

419
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,450
obviously it's a person who's much more
interested in making money than in the

420
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:22,100
good of the colony.

421
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,600
So he responded to his frustration and
not being able to get land or power by

422
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:29,450
surrounding himself with a
pack of equally frustrated,

423
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:33,590
angry young men who also wanted
land and also wanted power.

424
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:36,930
And eventually they came up with the
brilliant idea that they would stage and

425
00:25:36,931 --> 00:25:40,940
enormous attack on Indians massacred
them all and steal their land.

426
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,990
Brilliant plot.
So Bacon and his,

427
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:48,770
his pack of guys sort of go off
and actually start this inaction.

428
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:54,010
The governor of the colony sees that this
is rapidly spinning out of control and

429
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:56,570
becoming wild,
crazy Indian warfare.

430
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,840
So he tries to stifle it and Nathaniel
Bacon and his friends did what I suppose

431
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:07,370
appeared logical to them at the time
they burn Jamestown to the ground because

432
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:11,570
they were angry. But that's, I
mean, that's serious anger. Oh,

433
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:16,070
you're going to stop us. We'll just
destroy the capital. You're gone.

434
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,120
Now the story is kind of anti climactic
because Bacon ultimately dies miserably

435
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:24,470
of dysentery while running
away from authority.

436
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:28,720
So there's not a lot of glory
and Bacon's ultimate end. Um,

437
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,840
but he's definitely a really good example
of greedy self interest and have the

438
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,630
sense of deservedness
because of his social rank.

439
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,010
And this discussed at the power of
these self made men in Virginia.

440
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,580
There was some gentry who would've
migrated to the colonies who would've had

441
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:47,610
some kind of a similar feeling about
what they saw and what they expected.

442
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,120
But the gentry was only a minority of
the people who migrated to the colonies.

443
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,470
Most were lower in status.

444
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:00,730
Some are have the lowest rank of all
landless people and sometimes criminals.

445
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,420
So if you committed a crime in England,

446
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,770
you might be offered the option between
prison in England and being sent to the

447
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:12,270
colonies. And to some, this was actually
a really hard choice, right? Prison,

448
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,480
the colonies, prison, the
colonies, I don't know,

449
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,120
the howling wilderness was very scary.

450
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,330
Now some people opted for the howling
wind wilderness, obviously. Um,

451
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,370
and some people,

452
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,110
poorer people decided to take
their chances on the colonies,

453
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,700
sold themselves into servitude
as indentured servants
for five to seven years at

454
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:36,120
a time. And in exchange,
their passage was paid,

455
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,690
they owed a certain amount of work,
and at the end of their time of indenture,

456
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,940
they would get some plot of land.

457
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,420
So there were a good number of indentured
servants. And as a matter of fact,

458
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,980
some of those Virginia power mongers who
were blocking bacon out had started out

459
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:51,420
actually as indentured servants.

460
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:54,330
I mean that's when you talk self made and
you're really talking self made people

461
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:57,780
who came did their indenture, got some
land and then really built their way up.

462
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:04,430
So self improvement obviously is
one reason to head to the colonies.

463
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,780
Another reason,

464
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:09,780
another thing that might drive you to
head off to the colonies would have been

465
00:28:09,781 --> 00:28:14,781
if you belong to a religious minority
that was seemingly increasingly unpopular

466
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:20,160
in England. So if you were a puritan, if
you were a Quaker, if you were Catholic,

467
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,010
again probably middling in status,

468
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,870
you might decide to try your luck in the
colonies where either you thought there

469
00:28:27,871 --> 00:28:32,370
might be more religious tolerance or just
as likely there'd be lance so empty of

470
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:35,190
people that it wouldn't
really be a worry of yours.

471
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:37,500
There wouldn't be people around there
to be intolerant of views that would

472
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:40,080
probably would be better than what
you were experiencing in England.

473
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,130
Obviously a lot of New England was
settled by puritans with that mindset.

474
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,330
Pennsylvania had the Quaker
faith at its cure, at its core,

475
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,890
it was founded by William Penn, who is
actually a member of the aristocracy.

476
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,360
He became a Quaker and then he used his
high connections to get a royal charter

477
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:02,361
from the king to found a colony for
Quakers and Maryland began as a place that

478
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:07,440
was distinctly friendly to people
of the Catholic faith. Now,

479
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:10,380
out of all of these kinds of
colonists that I'm talking about here,

480
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,800
what was missing was a titled sort of to
the Manor born established aristocracy

481
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:21,000
of dukes and duchesses unshakably
of the highest rank in society.

482
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:26,390
This doesn't mean that colonial society
didn't have an established elite because

483
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:31,170
certainly every colony had certain great
families that controlled large amounts

484
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:36,000
of power and land, and as a
colonist, as an average colonist,

485
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,500
you would have had no
problem differentiating these
gentle folk from the common

486
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:44,950
masses, right? These sort of gentlemen
and gentle women, they dress differently.

487
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,770
They held themselves differently.
They spoke differently.

488
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,210
You address these people by
Mister or madam or Esquire.

489
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,840
I mean you actually visibly could tell
who the sort of upper crust people in

490
00:29:55,841 --> 00:30:00,040
society were.
Some families held obvious power,

491
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,121
but again,

492
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:05,140
not in the unquestionable way that
the aristocracy remained in control in

493
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:05,920
England.

494
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,610
A lot of these people that
I just mentioned had worked
their way into positions

495
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:10,271
of prominence.

496
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:15,271
So ultimately the line dividing sort
of upper crusty people from less upper

497
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:19,450
crusty people was less sort of absolute.

498
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:23,230
It was less distinct than it would have
been in a country or in a place where

499
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:27,160
there was a really established
aristocracy. So basically,

500
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,190
even though you could tell who the elite
are and you can tell who the masses are

501
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,200
there slippage up and
down between the two.

502
00:30:32,201 --> 00:30:35,680
It's not as though there's a dividing
line and you could never hope to become an

503
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:39,040
aristocrat. It's a little blurrier.
It's again, middling society.

504
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:42,250
It's part of what that means.
And because of that,

505
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,640
things like formal titles and find
clothing were of extreme importance in the

506
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:52,180
colonies and in a lot of
ways more important in the
colonies than they were in

507
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:56,110
England because they really were ways
of proving your status in a place where

508
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:59,680
you felt the need to prove your status.
If you think about it,

509
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,070
your status would have been just
a matter of common agreement.

510
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:06,580
You are only as lofty in status
as people believed you were.

511
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,520
And if someone felt compelled to call you
by a title or if you were wearing find

512
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:14,020
clothing that people knew they
themselves couldn't afford,

513
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:18,580
that could go a long way
towards convincing people of
your status and importance.

514
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:23,200
So for example,
if you had any military service at all,

515
00:31:23,201 --> 00:31:25,990
even for the briefest moment you'd
served in the military and you were an

516
00:31:25,991 --> 00:31:26,824
officer,

517
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,390
you would insist forever after to the end
of your days that you be called always

518
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:34,300
by your title like colonel
so and so, or captain. So.

519
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:37,780
And so that military
title counted for a lot.

520
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:42,670
That was really a sort of unquestioned
symbol of rank and authority. And in fact,

521
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:46,900
some people join the military just because
they knew by doing so they would get

522
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:50,770
a title and then they would be able to
hang on to that title to really claim a

523
00:31:50,771 --> 00:31:54,170
place for themselves in
society. And when I was, um,

524
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:59,480
when I was researching my first
book, um, I came across, um,

525
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:03,610
a case where there are these two guys.
Sounds like a bad joke.

526
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,540
Two guys in a tavern. There were
these two guys in a tavern and um,

527
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,640
one of them is a military
officer and one of them isn't.

528
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:12,400
And I guess the guy who wasn't a military
officer wasn't so clear on the whole

529
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:17,230
rank thing and he called the fellow
by a lower rank than he was, you know,

530
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:19,840
well, captain something
instead of colonel something.

531
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,520
And the guy was so insulted that his
title had been lowered by who the hell was

532
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:28,960
his person that he actually challenged
him to a duel like right there, I'm sorry,

533
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:32,800
but I'm willing to kill you now.
You called the captain, you die.

534
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,860
The serious insult dreaden sold.
Well,

535
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:39,980
and also he might've just been crazy
person, but that's too, but still,

536
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:44,981
it actually was a serious insult because
military titles and status went hand in

537
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:50,210
hand. Sometimes strangers
who seem to be high ranking,

538
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:54,170
we're just called colonel or general
cause they seemed important and thus they

539
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:58,400
must have a military rank. Um, and
I actually found a diary of someone,

540
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:02,660
this sort of member of the South Carolina
elite and he was wandering around in

541
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:06,860
the back country. Um, and he says in
his diary, no matter where he went,

542
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,450
he was called curl,

543
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,500
which amazed him because he said not only
had he never had any military service,

544
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:15,050
but, and I don't know what this means.
I don't know enough about him to know.

545
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,640
But he kept saying over and over again,

546
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,720
I really don't look like a military
person, like nothing about me.

547
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:22,220
So I'm imagining this sort of sloppy,

548
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:25,220
scary guy who's wandering around in
the back country of South Carolina and

549
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:29,120
people were saying, Colonel Wow.
And people usually love that.

550
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:30,020
I mean this make him happy.

551
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:32,780
He wrote about it in his diary
because he liked it so much.

552
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,380
This made him a happy guy.
So obviously titles, status,

553
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,570
they are important and
they go hand in hand.

554
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,580
Now if you were in college in the
colonies, so if you were at Yale,

555
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:47,240
if you were at Harvard, if you were at
King's college, which is now Colombia,

556
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,710
these kinds of distinctions of rank and
status would have been a part of your

557
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,890
everyday life because
when you entered college,

558
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:59,900
you were listed as a member of your class
in the order of your social rank. Okay.

559
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:03,500
So the person at the highest social rank
is listed at the top of the class and

560
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:06,680
the person of the lowest social rank
is listed at the bottom of the class.

561
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,590
And at commencement ceremonies
or graduation ceremonies,

562
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,580
the highest in rank was the one who
got to speak the longest and give the

563
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:17,660
longest public address. And obviously
because as I've been saying things,

564
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:20,810
they're less entrenched.
What this meant was lots of really petty,

565
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:24,680
nasty squabbling at a lot of universities
because everybody had a complaint.

566
00:34:24,681 --> 00:34:27,260
Well, I'm not on the bottom. Well, I
certainly have a better rank than him.

567
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,970
He should be at the bottom.
I should be at the,

568
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,840
so certainly it's a contentious issue
at colleges. And what this meant,

569
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,080
oddly enough,
is that when the grading system,

570
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:39,800
when people actually figured out that
you could have a grading system and base

571
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,490
judge people based on grades,
unbelievably,

572
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,990
this was seen as a great relief.

573
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,270
This made people really
grades and made people really,

574
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:51,950
really happy because it meant that you
could be judged based on merit and not

575
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:54,020
based on rank or it's social class.

576
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,560
So you can give thanks to
the democracy of grades.

577
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,640
Remember that during the semester
I'll, I'll, I'll remind you,

578
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,260
give thanks for your grades.
Okay.

579
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:08,650
So we've talked about some
of the similarities and
differences and social rank

580
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:11,450
between colonists and
people living in England.

581
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,280
I want to just take a few minutes
to talk about some assumptions about

582
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,860
government and about rights,
about individual rights.

583
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:23,570
Because one of the periods of
great migration to the colonies,

584
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,240
which was the mid to late 17th century,

585
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,280
was also a period in which parliament
asserted its dominance in England.

586
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,540
So while all Englishman believed in
the importance of political liberty and

587
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:38,550
legislative representation and the rule
of law and all of these things I've

588
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:43,170
started to talk about, the colonies were
full of people who either themselves,

589
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:46,680
I'd left England or were descended from
people who had left England when that

590
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:49,140
kind of belief was at an all time high.

591
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:54,860
So colonial governments embodied that
spirit to a really extreme degree.

592
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,780
And it's important to
realize that colonial talk of
liberty wasn't some kind of

593
00:36:00,781 --> 00:36:02,160
colonial innovation.

594
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,120
It was the most heartfelt of British
traditions as I've suggested just in this

595
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,940
lecture.
And as we're going to see in future weeks,

596
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,980
it's the precise meaning of liberty as
translated into the colonies from England.

597
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:16,140
And as the slowly shifts over time,

598
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,790
it's going to help raise conflict between
the colonies and the mother country.

599
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,530
But questions about the precise meaning
of liberty wouldn't really become an

600
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:30,531
issue until the 1760s after the French
and Indian war when as we'll soon see the

601
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:35,190
British would end what had been a long
period of what's often called it period

602
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:36,540
of salutary neglect,

603
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,770
a period when the British largely he
just left the colonies alone to regulate

604
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:43,830
themselves and throughout
that period of of neglect,

605
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:48,510
colonists had lived immersed in their
sense of English rights and privileges,

606
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,660
unaware of the ways in which
the colonial experience,

607
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:55,380
just the experience of living in the
colonies had suddenly altered their

608
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:57,480
understanding of these rights.

609
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,920
They've been able to live in the back
kind of a freedom largely because of the

610
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:04,500
nature of the British
imperial administration.

611
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,690
Typically rather than exerting great
control over the colonization process,

612
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:13,800
the British crown tended to
leave colonization largely
to private enterprise,

613
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:18,540
so like a joint stock company would get
a grant to establish a colony and off

614
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:22,380
they go and it wasn't really necessarily
the crown that had its hand on

615
00:37:22,381 --> 00:37:24,180
everything.
It was these private companies.

616
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,890
There were often taking care of the
colonization efforts and on the few

617
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:32,190
occasions when the crown
did pass trade regulations,

618
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,380
they didn't enforce them very rigorously,

619
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,000
which basically allowed widespread
smuggling and bribery. So in a sense,

620
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:44,450
the success of the British imperial system
up until the 1760s was largely due to

621
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:50,370
what was not really a policy,
but the absence of a policy,

622
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,880
right. This neglect of the
colonies by the mother country,

623
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,980
not until the British began to actively
regulate the colonies in the mid 18th

624
00:37:58,981 --> 00:38:03,750
century did it really become apparent
that colonial and British ideas about the

625
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:08,040
role of the colonies and the rights of
colonists had really begun to drift apart.

626
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:12,960
Had the colonist forfeited some of their
English liberties by migrating to the

627
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:17,961
new world or not where they dependent
on the mother country or were they just

628
00:38:18,241 --> 00:38:20,250
contributors to the greater empire?

629
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,480
And some colonists would come to have a
clear answer to those kinds of questions.

630
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,240
They would argue, and we're going
to see this in weeks to come,

631
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,110
and specifically people writing this
argument and offering it to the public,

632
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,620
that the original settlers of the
colonies had been free born subjects of

633
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:40,570
England who had left England with the
authorization of the monarchy and taking a

634
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:40,841
good,

635
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:45,841
many personal risks had created thriving
English settlements at little cost to

636
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:49,390
the English government bringing
England great riches in the process.

637
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,350
So essentially some colonists would
argue not only were they English,

638
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,140
but they made personal
sacrifices for England.

639
00:38:56,141 --> 00:39:00,250
They attained a wilderness for
England for the sake of the empire.

640
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,730
And ironically,
it would be that mentality,

641
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:07,720
that kind of outcry for the rights of
Englishman that would help lead the

642
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:11,890
colonists to revolt against
England as we'll see. In a sense,

643
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:16,150
the colonies were never as English as
when they rebelled against the mother

644
00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:20,920
country for the rights of Englishmen.
And I will stop there. Um,

645
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:25,690
Tuesday we will be looking at some things
that were distinctly American about

646
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:28,210
the colonial experience.
Have a good weekend.
