1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,480
Today we are going to be discussing,

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,670
I'm certainly one of the biggest
bestsellers in early American history and

3
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:15,150
that's Thomas Payne's
pamphlet common sense.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,940
Before I plunge in to common sense,

5
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:22,470
I am going to answer the question that
was asked from this section of the room

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,000
on Tuesday about how do you vote on
voting the little brain teaser of the

7
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:30,090
continental congress. And I found
the answer to this question. Okay.

8
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:34,230
So the answer to the question is they
actually had a pretty animated debate in

9
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:36,840
the continental Congress on
the whole voting question.

10
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:41,100
And some people said it should be
according to population and some said,

11
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:45,360
well you should put property
in with population. And
some people said one colony,

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,930
one vote and with after apparently
arguing for quite some time,

13
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:53,610
what they realized was they
actually really didn't have
an orderly way to figure

14
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:55,980
out population and property worse.

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,300
And so they also really just
decided one colony, one vote.

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,370
Like that's all we can do.

17
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,310
And they were really concerned because
they didn't want that to be a precedent.

18
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:07,800
Like they were all worried that they'd
be setting a precedent for all time.

19
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,090
So when they wrote it down in the minutes,
they said, we're deciding one colony,

20
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:14,670
one vote, but not with the idea that
it will be a precedent for all time.

21
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:15,091
Of course,

22
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:18,900
it then becomes a precedent for Congress
under the articles of confederation.

23
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,070
But the answer to the question,

24
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:24,120
how did they vote is apparently
someone made a motion. You know,

25
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,150
I make a motion that we just do the one
colony one vote thing and people just

26
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:32,550
voted on the motion as a group.
So that is the answer to the question.

27
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,540
How do you vote on voting?

28
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,810
I had not thought about it before
and yet historians have addressed it.

29
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,770
So there you go. So, okay. That
is the answer to the question. Um,

30
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:43,530
onto common sense,
which really,

31
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:46,490
truly unquestionably was a bestseller.
Um,

32
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,530
it actually sold over 120,000 copies
in its first few months in print.

33
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:55,740
And a little bit later in the lecture,
I'm going to give you a sense of,

34
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,790
of how that compares with how some
other things might've sold in this time

35
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,750
period. You'll really get a sense of
what kind of a bestseller this was.

36
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,520
And certainly many scholars consider
it to be the most brilliant political

37
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:12,270
pamphlet of the revolution.
Not necessarily for the
subtlety of its argument,

38
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:14,550
but certainly for the
way in which it's argued.

39
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,890
And I'll talk more about that
in the course of the lecture.

40
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,480
So what we're going to be looking
at is the pamphlet itself and what

41
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:23,700
specifically made it so remarkable.

42
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:27,090
And then we're also going to look
some at its author Thomas Paine,

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,220
who he was and how he came to
produce this influential pamphlet.

44
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,230
But I actually want to begin with
something that I just in my head,

45
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:38,970
when I think of that Thomas Paine,
I think about this.

46
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:41,400
So I feel like I can't start this
lecture without discussing it.

47
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,660
And that has to do with the death of
Thomas Paine or actually to be more

48
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:49,860
accurate, the body of
Thomas Paine. Okay. Um,

49
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:53,370
it's one of the sad ironies of history
that this person who all through this

50
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:54,480
lecture,
I'm going to be talking about,

51
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:57,390
the great influence of this pamphlet
had this great influence throughout the

52
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:57,901
revolution.

53
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:02,800
And he actually died pretty much poor
and not very much liked by Americans of

54
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:04,180
all political stripes,

55
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,170
more having to do with his politics
later in his life then what he was doing

56
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:12,610
during the revolution. But he was not a
happy camper in the years of his death.

57
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,501
But the,

58
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:17,140
the most horrifying thing about pain
Steph has to do with the question of his

59
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:17,921
body.
Okay.

60
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:22,921
So pain first asked about being buried
in a Quaker cemetery and the Quakers

61
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:27,610
weren't very excited about that because
they were not really hoping to have that

62
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:30,820
cemetery become a tourist attraction.
So that didn't work.

63
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,150
So he basically ended up at first being
buried on his small farm in upstate New

64
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,160
York.
A few years later,

65
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,080
a newspaper editor named William Cobbett
decided that what he was going to do

66
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:47,560
was disinter the body and
take it back to England.

67
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,580
And then in England they would
set up a memorial to Thomas Payne.

68
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:56,110
This was his plan. So he did, he
disinterred the buddy, he went on a boat,

69
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,500
he and did buddy pain,
went sailing back to England,

70
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,840
got back to England,
raise the issue.

71
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:06,100
And apparently did not get very much
support for the idea of a memorial of some

72
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:10,540
kind. At this point it
gets a little sad. Okay.

73
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,770
So not knowing what else to do and I
and why at this point he didn't think to

74
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:16,420
bury him someplace else.
I don't know.

75
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:21,421
But apparently he had the bones put in
a trunk and kept them on his farm for

76
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:26,320
awhile. Okay. So buddy of pain
sitting on his farm in England,

77
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,820
then he died it,

78
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,840
Mr Kovic died and the trunk and
pain was passed on to his son.

79
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,360
And then his son I guess went into debt
in some way and his belongings began to

80
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:42,130
get auctioned off and the person doing
the auctioning didn't want to have

81
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:43,810
anything to do with
auctioning off a buddy.

82
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,850
It's like I'm never
auctioned off a body before.

83
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,350
I don't want anything to do with this.

84
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,310
And basically pains corpse disappeared.

85
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,460
We really do not know
where Thomas Paine is.

86
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:59,461
I mean truly like there was a trunk and
it had pain in it and then it vanished.

87
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,690
And I went searching today before I gave
this lecture, trying to figure out like,

88
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:05,410
okay,

89
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,820
maybe there's been a recent development
in the search for Thomas Payne,

90
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,740
the corpse. And No, actually,
although I did discover that in 2001,

91
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,120
um,

92
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,630
there was a society that wanted to create
some kind of memorial here in America

93
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:22,270
and they decided they were
going to try to trace the body.

94
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,670
So they set out trying to trace the body.

95
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:28,210
What they found was all over the world
are people who claim to have a piece of

96
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:29,530
Thomas Paine,
right?

97
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,090
Well his skull might be in Australia
that his leg that might be an England.

98
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:37,810
So this sort of horrifying enter Thomas
Paine is his body disappeared and

99
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:41,650
perhaps a little pieces of Thomas Paine
or are flooding around his little relics

100
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,090
all over the world. So, so that's
pain, sort of weird ending,

101
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,440
certainly not the kind of ending that
you would wish for the person who has

102
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:53,390
written the pamphlet we're going
to be talking about today. Um,

103
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,190
and we are given that, you know, what
he ended up writing was so influential.

104
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,510
It's so different from much of what
was being written at this time now.

105
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:04,070
As I said at the outset,
um,

106
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,460
it's not this great subtleties of its
argument that made it stand out and in

107
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:15,491
fact its popularity was due to the very
things that were its greatest strengths.

108
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,300
The fact that it was passionate,

109
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,750
the fact that it had a really simple
style that it spoke to the common man that

110
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:27,791
it captured and completely overturned
prevailing colonial ideas about the

111
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:32,690
relationship between the mother
country and the American colonies.

112
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,880
As someone wrote at the time,

113
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,980
pain spoke a language which the
colonists had felt but not fought.

114
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,380
One of the remarkable things about the
pamphlet is that it was written by a

115
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:50,590
somewhat bankrupt English course maker
a mere 14 months after he had arrived in

116
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:54,170
America from England.
Basically speaking,

117
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:58,250
pay knew relatively little about colonial
affairs when he decided to write it.

118
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,570
He wasn't really an established writer.
He had done writing before.

119
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:03,980
I'll talk a little bit about this today,

120
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:07,370
but he wasn't this sort of well
known and established writer.

121
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,260
He wrote some for newspapers.

122
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,790
And actually the idea for the
pamphlet initially wasn't really his,

123
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:17,390
he wrote it at the encouragement
of Dr. Benjamin Rush.

124
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,970
I mentioned that in the first lecture
and I'm going to come back to that too.

125
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,150
So pain is relatively new to the colonies,
not really an established writer.

126
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,690
So how is it that he ends
up writing this pamphlet?

127
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,530
Well more than anything else,
it actually was pains,

128
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:38,531
experience of events in the
colonies between 1775 and
1776 that inspired what he

129
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:43,064
wrote.

130
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,550
Now let's look for a moment at bout to
see here what pain is experiencing in

131
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:53,600
that year before he wrote the pamphlet,
what is happening around him.

132
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,480
I'm going to talk about this
really briefly here because
I'll be talking in more

133
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:59,030
detail about this on Tuesday.
Um,

134
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,360
but one thing I will mention here very
briefly is part of what happens between

135
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:07,340
1775 and 1776 is the meaning of
the second continental Congress.

136
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,470
And that actually begins meeting
in the spring of 1775. Um,

137
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,080
I'll talk about the details of
the congress Tuesday. For now,

138
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:18,590
I'll just talk about the general
mindset. Um, for one thing,

139
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:24,070
no colony instructed it's delegates to
this second continental Congress to work

140
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,280
for independence.
That was not the agenda delegates.

141
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:32,120
We're pretty much still acting under
the assumption that they were trying to

142
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:37,121
force parliament or the king or someone
to acknowledge their liberties and

143
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:39,200
readdress their grievances.

144
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,680
And the overall assumptions still was
that balance had been thrown off within

145
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:48,770
the British constitution and
it needed to be rebalanced.

146
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,040
So they're talking about trying to
figure out a way of balancing things,

147
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,120
maybe a new balance,

148
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,760
but they're not talking about
throwing the entire system aside.

149
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,170
Actually in the minds of many of the time,
they probably were thinking,

150
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:06,120
why destroy what had for a very long
time been one of the most successful

151
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:08,130
political empires in the world.

152
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,100
John Adams noted in his diary at the
opening of the second continental congress

153
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:18,240
that at what he called an
elegant to supper, um, at
the opening of the congress,

154
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,330
many representatives and
their friends toasted quote,

155
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,130
the Union of Britain and the colonies
on a constitutional foundation. Okay.

156
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,040
So that's what they're hoping for.
As this congress opens

157
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,350
as an example of this initial
mindset of a congress, again,

158
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:39,351
more about this Tuesday
moderates attempted one last
stab at some kind of basic

159
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:44,250
reconciliation with the crown and they
issued what came to be known as the olive

160
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,790
branch petition.
It failed for a number of reasons.

161
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,530
I'll again more next week.

162
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:53,100
One of the most basic reasons being the
king refused to read the olive branch

163
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:56,730
condition, which pretty much is the way
to guarantee the failure of a petition.

164
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,130
By doing that,

165
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,870
the king basically gave some credence
to the views of the more radical members

166
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:08,871
of the continental congress and radicals
got even more credence on August 23rd,

167
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,010
1775 when the king issued a proclamation
that declared the colonies to be in

168
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:21,081
rebellion and then made plans to send
20,000 British troops to the colonies,

169
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,520
including Prussian mercenaries.
Okay.

170
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,460
Big Change and things much
more detailed Tuesday.

171
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,400
But this is important to
the setting of common sense.

172
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,510
So the king ignores the olive
branch petition. He sending troops,

173
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,630
not just any truth, but
literally hired guns, right?

174
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:42,750
Foreign hired guns to go to the colonies.

175
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,730
So the colonies have now been declared
in rebellion and army is coming.

176
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,360
At this point,

177
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,360
the con is realize that they need to
maybe take some form of action and make

178
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:57,150
some kind of military preparation,
not in an aggressive way,

179
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,980
but certainly in a defensive way.

180
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,820
Even as they began to do this and try
to stock up on military supplies and

181
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,780
engage in militia training,

182
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,970
still a lot of colonists considered
it pretty unlikely that a string of

183
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,050
relatively weak,

184
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,060
prosperous as they were colonies
could hope to defeat England,

185
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,160
the most powerful nation on earth.

186
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,510
And even if they did miraculously
somehow manage to do that,

187
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,440
certainly also most people in the
colonies would have assumed that instantly

188
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:32,630
foreign powers would have come zipping
over to North America and would've

189
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,040
swallowed up these
helpless little colonies.

190
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,110
And so now instead of
belonging to England,

191
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:38,910
they would have belonged
to France or maybe Spain.

192
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,740
So certainly things weren't really feeling
really optimistic at this moment in

193
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:45,660
which things seemed to
be dramatically shifting.

194
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,900
And this is the setting in which
pain wrote common sense in his mind.

195
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,750
The time was right for some kind of a
drastic change for the better in the

196
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:59,110
American colonies.
And as we'll see,

197
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,740
instead of just tinkering
with the English constitution,

198
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,290
paying basically turns his back on,

199
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:10,291
it rejects King George the third rejects
parliament and ultimately rejects even

200
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:12,760
the idea of monarchy.

201
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,900
So instead of centering on
the British constitution,

202
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,530
pain based his ideas about colonial
society and government on natural rights

203
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:23,464
logic,

204
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,510
arguing that the colonies should join in
a new government grounded on equality.

205
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,170
No,
obviously ideas about natural rights,

206
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:35,710
natural rights talk isn't new pains.

207
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,340
Achievement was to take those
kinds of ideas and in a sense,

208
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,890
give them to ordinary people.

209
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,860
Part of what he argues in his pamphlet is,

210
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,640
this isn't some great hi
constitutional argument.

211
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,360
This is about you and me
and life in the colonies.

212
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,380
And as we'll see in
method and in audience,

213
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,680
and an argument for all of these reasons,
pains,

214
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:01,480
pamphlet had a big impact.

215
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,920
So let's look for a moment
at who this man was.

216
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,610
Who wrote this early American bestseller.
Well,

217
00:13:09,611 --> 00:13:13,360
he was relatively poor.
He was never really well off.

218
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,300
Obviously he was an intelligent,
strikingly intelligent person.

219
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,570
He was someone who loved to
assert his own importance.

220
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:21,790
He loved to brag about
his great accomplishments.

221
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,550
He loved to dominate a conversation.
Um,

222
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:27,400
it's possible towards the end of his life,
he may have had a drinking problem.

223
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:32,020
I tried to get authoritative word on this.
It probably don't even realize that.

224
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,860
Like when I'm, I all, I've
taught this course before,
before I give every lecture,

225
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:38,860
I actually go over it and kind of
Redo it and then I researched things.

226
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:41,650
So before I come to class,
I'm actually having these random,

227
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,240
it's like a big game of trivial pursuit.
Was Thomas Paine really drunk research.

228
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:50,020
Research. Research. Okay. Maybe not
so much what happened to the body. Oh,

229
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,610
we still don't know. Okay. Okay.

230
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,090
So I have these weird
trivial pursuit moments in
preparation for the course here.

231
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:00,490
So maybe drunk, maybe not slight drinking
problem. Historians disagree either way.

232
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,410
He was born in England in 1737.
I'm supposedly,

233
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,700
the cottage that he was born in was
literally in the shadow of a place of

234
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:10,391
execution.

235
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:15,391
So the dark hand of the state was
looming over the cottage of Thomas Paine.

236
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,800
Um, he was born poor. His
father was a Stainmaker pain,

237
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,370
did go to grammar school and he
liked learning. But at the age of 12,

238
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:29,260
he was pulled out to be apprenticed
to his father as a young man,

239
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:33,310
he had a number of different trades. Um,
none of them were enormously successful.

240
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,100
Um, I think for a little while
he might've been a sailor.

241
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:37,780
I think he was a minor office holder.

242
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,750
I think he was an excise man
in England for a little while.

243
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,000
In his spare time he liked to go to
public lectures in London and that's where

244
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:48,280
he met men like Benjamin Franklin.

245
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,850
And Franklin ultimately proved important
to pain because pain ended up doing

246
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,840
what a lot of sort of vaguely rootless
people in England might've decided to do.

247
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,500
He decided to try his luck in the
American colonies where there seemed to be

248
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:07,400
some opportunity for self promotion for
sort of making something of yourself.

249
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,900
But before setting off pain did an
intelligent thing and that is he made an

250
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:15,530
appointment with Franklin and
Franklin did an important thing.

251
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:20,531
He wrote a letter of recommendation for
pain and a letter of recommendation in

252
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:24,410
this period was, was kind of a magical
thing because if you think about it,

253
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,890
I mean unlike now where there are 5
million ways in which we all can check on

254
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:28,550
each other,

255
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,200
there really weren't ways in which one
person knew anything about a stranger or

256
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,260
could verify or check on who
some complete stranger was.

257
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,950
There's a reason why the early 19th
century is the age of the con man, right?

258
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,800
It's really easy for someone to drift
into town, claim to be somebody.

259
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:46,820
No one has a way of checking and then
the person can drift out taking various

260
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,320
amounts of money and belongings with him.

261
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,880
So letters of recommendation were
kind of magical because basically they

262
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:56,270
represented one person vouching
their reputation for another.

263
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,070
The person who wrote it said, I
writing this letter for Mr Pain, I,

264
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,240
Mr. Franklin writing from Mr Pain and
I'm introducing him to your attention and

265
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:09,290
wish that you will introduce yourself
to him and show him around Philadelphia.

266
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,800
Seemingly a basic statement. But
Franklin was basically saying, I'm,

267
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,980
here's my reputation. I'm vouching
for this guy. So you could,

268
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,950
you can get to know him, you can trust
him because I'm recommending him.

269
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:23,540
So it was a smart move on pains part.
It was a nice thing for Franklin to do.

270
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,490
And in the letter that Franklin wrote,

271
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:30,470
he referred pain to his son and son
in law, Richard Bache in Philadelphia.

272
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,280
So pain arrived in America in late
1774 but apparently the whole overseas

273
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,930
passage was pretty horrible.

274
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:43,250
So he was pretty much out
of commission until January,

275
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,080
1775 and at that point
when he was up and about,

276
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:49,190
bache offered to introduce him into
the local literary and political scene.

277
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,481
Now,

278
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:53,870
what happened next is a really good case
for the importance of serendipity and

279
00:16:53,871 --> 00:16:55,520
the importance of bookstores.
Okay.

280
00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:00,110
So pain liked to hang out
in this one local bookstore.

281
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,100
Apparently he went there every day
and that's the local literary scene,

282
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,770
the bookstore.
Um,

283
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,040
and he befriended the owner of the
bookstore and the owner eventually invited

284
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,340
paying to be the editor of a new
journal that he wanted to start,

285
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:15,410
that he was calling the
Pennsylvania magazine.

286
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,510
So Payne wrote for the
Pennsylvania magazine for a
while and he wrote a bunch of

287
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:23,420
different kinds of things. He
wrote fiction, he wrote essays,

288
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:28,390
he wrote social commentary as an
example. He wrote a piece on, um,

289
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,960
British cruelty in the East indies in
Africa and against native Americans

290
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,550
writing quote. When I reflect
on these examples of cruelty,

291
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,140
I hesitate not for a moment to believe
that the Almighty will finally separate

292
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:43,160
America from Britain,

293
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,480
call it independence or what you will
if it is the cause of God and humanity.

294
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:48,350
It will go on.

295
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,420
Now considering I'm going to talk a
little bit more about the fact that people

296
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:53,400
aren't really talking about
independence at this point.

297
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:56,730
So that's a pretty bold
statement before common sense.

298
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,470
Now,
one thing was noticeable about pains,

299
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,240
writings and that is that when they
seem to strike at issues of American

300
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:07,800
liberty,
even indirectly,

301
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:11,760
even seemingly through metaphor as in
one essay that talked about British

302
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:12,870
domination of India,

303
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:17,790
but everybody assumed India must
really be the North American colonies.

304
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,020
Whenever he was referencing any of
that sort of thing, sales jumped,

305
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,450
everyone wouldn't want
it to read those essays.

306
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:29,870
And ultimately it was some of those essays
that brought pain to the attention of

307
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:33,780
Benjamin Rush. Rush went to that same
bookstore, the magical bookstore,

308
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,310
the center of paints life.
Um,

309
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,110
he happened to meet pain
at that same bookstore.

310
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:41,400
So the moral is it's a good
thing to hang out in bookstores.

311
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,650
And through their conversations,

312
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,370
rush later wrote that at the
time he observed that quote,

313
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,040
pain had realized the independence of
the American colonies upon Great Britain

314
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,090
even at that time.

315
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:59,040
And that he considered the measure as
necessary to bring the war to a speedy and

316
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,220
successful issue. So he meets pain and
one of the things he notices is, well,

317
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:04,290
this guy is already kind of
thinking about independence.

318
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,250
Pain himself later wrote about his opinion
of the colonies upon his arrival and

319
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:15,591
he said that the thing that most struck
him was how loyal the colonists were to

320
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:18,510
Great Britain,
and this is Paine's words here.

321
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,100
I found the disposition of the people
such that they might've been led by a

322
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:27,210
thread and governed by a read.
Their suspicion was quick and penetrating,

323
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:31,080
but their attachment to
Britain was obstinate and it
was at that time a kind of

324
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:35,700
treason to speak against it.
They disliked the ministry,

325
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,750
but they esteemed the nation.
I think that's a really important point.

326
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,210
They disliked the ministry,
but they esteemed the nation.

327
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,190
Their idea of grievance operated without
resentment and they're single object

328
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,690
was reconciliation.
I viewed the dispute as a kind of lawsuit.

329
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,320
I suppose the parties would find a
way either to decide or settle it.

330
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,440
I had not thoughts of
independence or of arms.

331
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,370
The world could not then have persuaded
me that I should be either a soldier or

332
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:07,140
an author. Ultimately it was the
battle of Lexington that changed pains,

333
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:10,740
view and his life has changed
that of many others as pain.

334
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,090
Put it when the country into which I had
just set my foot was set on fire about

335
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:17,400
my ears.
It was time to stir.

336
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,830
And so it's at this point that pain begins
to tinker with the idea of writing a

337
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:23,664
pamphlet.

338
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,800
And apparently he spoke with Benjamin
Rush about it and rush later recalled in a

339
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:31,380
letter to a friend that he offered pain,

340
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:35,730
one overall piece of advice at the
outset of the project, he said to pain,

341
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:41,040
there were two words with she should
avoid by every means as necessary to his

342
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,990
own safety and that of the public.

343
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,500
And the two words were independence
and republicanism. Okay.

344
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:51,610
What you think about common sense?
He didn't listen to that advice at all.

345
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,810
And it's a matter of fact,

346
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,070
it's impossible to know what went
through pains mind at that moment. Um,

347
00:20:57,071 --> 00:21:00,160
he certainly, he knew the colonies
were, as he put it on fire,

348
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,610
he knew that popular sentiment was
building even against the king.

349
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,690
But knowing his personality, it's entirely
possible that if rush said to him,

350
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:11,830
whatever you do, don't mention
independence, that pain's
reaction might have been,

351
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:15,280
well that's at the center of it,
isn't it? So that's it. Like that.

352
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,110
That's going to be what I write about,
isn't it?

353
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,930
It's going to be independence and he
might have deliberately done the precise

354
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:22,740
thing she was asked not to do.
Um,

355
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,680
and focus on the most controversial issue
that seemed to be at the very heart of

356
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:31,681
the controversy that seem to be certainly
to pain lurking right underneath the

357
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:35,200
surface of this prevailing
constitutional argument.

358
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,750
So Paine wrote the pamphlet,

359
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,960
he read parts of it to rush as he did
and common sense is published in January,

360
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,580
1776 and I did state correctly earlier
that he wanted to call it plain truth.

361
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:50,920
And Benjamin Rush thought
common sense was a better title.

362
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,480
And I agree with Benjamin Rush. I like
common sense better. Um, the pamphlet,

363
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:59,380
the main argument of the
pamphlet did three things.

364
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,270
So number one,

365
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:05,860
it basically refuted the prevailing
ideas against independence.

366
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:12,220
It went one step further and demonstrated
the necessity of independence.

367
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:17,221
And how possible it was and
it demonstrated the stupidity
and utter uselessness,

368
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:23,200
not only of the English monarchy,
but just have monarchies generally.

369
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:29,130
This is a radical message and it was
written in a radically simple style aimed

370
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:32,650
at being accessible to a broad audience.

371
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:37,450
This was all the more radical given that
American independence had not really

372
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:41,020
been seriously discussed by the
great majority of colonists,

373
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:44,080
with the exception of some extreme
radicals who I've been mentioning now and

374
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:45,550
again in lectures.

375
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,450
So let's look for just a minute it how
pain went through the three parts of his

376
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:53,860
argument.
And in a sense there's,

377
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:57,970
there's three parts of his argument and
the pamphlet itself has three sections

378
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:02,770
and the first section of the pamphlet
centers on getting people past this

379
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:07,600
ongoing constitutional argument about
the proper relationship between the

380
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:09,070
colonies and the mother country.

381
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,880
And to accomplish this painted
something amazingly bold.

382
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:18,090
He just tossed aside the entire idea of
focusing on the English constitution as

383
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:22,630
the context for determining
the fate of America.

384
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,890
And rather than going on and on and on
with the same constitutional debate,

385
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,500
he began his pamphlet with an attack.

386
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,830
Not only against King George but also
against the entire idea of monarchy and he

387
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:39,640
had a couple strategic reasons
for choosing to do this. First,

388
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:45,270
the crown was the last remaining emotional
and political link that was really

389
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:49,910
tying the colonies to the mother country.
By this point,

390
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,760
the colonists had lost
faith in parliament,

391
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
so pain certainly knew that if he could
strike at this last linchpin of colonial

392
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:01,850
sentiment, he could advance
the cause of independence.

393
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:07,160
Second,
if pain could destroy the legitimacy,

394
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:11,810
not only of King George but also
of the idea of monarchy overall,

395
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,830
then they English constitution
legitimacy would suffer as well.

396
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,580
Once again hopefully opening
the way for independence.

397
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,411
And then third,

398
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:25,550
I think equally important rhetorically
pain had a really good writer sense of

399
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:29,990
pacing and he knew that if he opened
this pamphlet with this really dramatic

400
00:24:29,991 --> 00:24:34,590
challenge to all of the prevailing
assumptions about government and if you

401
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:37,280
turned all of these
assumptions on their head,

402
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,140
he would pull readers in to his pamphlet
and into his argument immediately and

403
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:45,260
hold them there for the
center of his argument,

404
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:48,590
which was the second section of the
pamphlet and that is really the part that

405
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:50,000
focuses on independence.

406
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:55,730
Independence at this point was a topic
that people didn't discuss openly.

407
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,940
They didn't talk about it in
public if discussed at all.

408
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:03,260
It was discussed privately among
friends because basically it amounted to

409
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:05,540
treason pains,

410
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:09,650
dramatic introduction opened the
way for him to introduce this really

411
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:11,210
controversial topic.

412
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,890
If the English constitution
lacked legitimacy, well what next?

413
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,190
And his answer obviously
is well independence,

414
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:24,050
the obvious solution which then brings
us to the third section of the pamphlet

415
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:29,051
and that is the future pain concludes
the pamphlet by discussing just what

416
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,940
Americans could institute to
replace the English Constitution.

417
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:38,180
Like what kind of government they might
be able to construct to replace what

418
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:39,350
they were stripping away.

419
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,370
Now throughout his work,

420
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:48,110
pain hammered away at old
ideas and propounded new ones.

421
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,820
He argued that America was distinct
from England, that it was multicultural,

422
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,320
that it actually was more the child
of Europe. Then the child of England,

423
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,640
he promoted American commerce.
He promoted social mobility.

424
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,930
He praised the innocence of the new
world is compared with the corruption and

425
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:10,610
decadence of the old world.
He struck at the trappings of monarchy,

426
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:14,600
things like hereditary
privilege and court intrigue.

427
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:20,350
He was an individualist arguing that
society was made of individuals who should

428
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:23,060
all be able to strive for their own good.

429
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,580
He wasn't arguing that families are
patron client relationship should define

430
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,900
society any longer.

431
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,970
He depicted government as a kind of
necessary evil that was prone to create

432
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:37,220
bureaucracies and privilege as he put it.

433
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Government like dress is
the badge of loss innocence.

434
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:46,030
So it's the price we pay for being flawed
beings and he seemed to speak of an

435
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:51,450
American millennium. Speaking of
America as God's chosen people.

436
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:56,930
Pain argued that America's success was
linked to the success of all humankind.

437
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:02,810
That the American colonists could launch
a worldwide democratic revolution.

438
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,830
And as he put it up,
voted again.

439
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,840
But I think maybe it was the
first lecture that I quoted.

440
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:11,490
This is my sort of random inspirational
sentences from random guy from the 18th

441
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:14,770
century. Um, this is where
this comes from. It's, it's uh,

442
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,690
the statement about beginning
of the world, a new, um,

443
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,700
we have every opportunity
and every encouragement
before us to form the noblest

444
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,260
purists constitution on
the face of the earth.

445
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,280
We haven't in our power to
begin the world over again.

446
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,570
The birthday of a new world is at hand.
It's like millennial talk there.

447
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,920
The power of the pamphlet wasn't just
in its argument or in specific points of

448
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:45,060
argument, but rather it was in the way
that it reversed prevailing assumptions,

449
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:45,931
pain,

450
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:50,931
forced readers to consider a whole new
way of looking at the impending crisis.

451
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,900
And it actually at the
entire imperial system,

452
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:01,190
he laid bare assumptions that had
led colonists to resist independence.

453
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,670
And then by exposing these biases
and holding them up to scorn,

454
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:10,230
he forced people to think beyond
what they had thought before.

455
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,220
So basically the old paradigm had been
liberty can survive among brutal and self

456
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:21,990
interested men only through a
balance of institutionalized forces.

457
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,370
So no one can monopolize,

458
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:28,170
monopolize the power of the state and
rule without opposition. So monarchy,

459
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:32,430
nobility, and the people have an equal
right to share in the struggle for power.

460
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,100
Complexity in government in
the sense is a good thing.

461
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:39,170
Simplicity allows for monopolization,
we'll paint,

462
00:28:39,171 --> 00:28:42,120
argues complexity is not
a virtue in government.

463
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,100
It simply makes it impossible to
tell who is at fault. Pain charge,

464
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:52,130
that the complexity of
the British government was
designed to serve the monarchy

465
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,550
and the nobility,

466
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:58,740
that the king did nothing but wage war
and hand out gifts to his followers and

467
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:03,660
that this entire idea of British
constitutional institutional balance was a

468
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:04,494
fraud.

469
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,750
Now the boldness of this message becomes
clearer when you compare it with some

470
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:11,340
other pamphlets of the time,

471
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,470
many of which were aimed at
exploring difficult questions, right?

472
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,290
Constitutional issues,
and then coming up with recommendations.

473
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,820
Common sense isn't about exploring
difficult constitutional questions.

474
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,970
It aimed to quote,
tear the world apart.

475
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:31,980
This pamphlet did not have the
kind of rational tone and lawyerly,

476
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:36,180
precise logic and high scholarship that
you see floating through a lot of the

477
00:29:36,181 --> 00:29:37,860
other pamphlets of this period.

478
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,910
And the tone was part of why the
pamphlet ended up being so effective.

479
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,160
Pain didn't use legal arguments,
he didn't invoke legal authorities.

480
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,240
He assumed that his readers would have
some kind of limited knowledge of the

481
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:55,360
Bible. He didn't use a lot of
lab. And then if he did use Latin,

482
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:57,730
he tended to follow it up
with an English translation.

483
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,700
He used really
straightforward sinked syntax,

484
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:05,701
a really simple vocabulary as he himself
explained it as is my design to make

485
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:10,280
those that can scarcely read,
understand I show,

486
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:14,830
therefore avoid every literary ornament
and put it in language as plain as the

487
00:30:14,831 --> 00:30:19,480
alphabet. So what he wanted to write,
he said was quote, simple facts,

488
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,150
plain arguments,
and common sense.

489
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,720
Sometimes it was pains.

490
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,780
Irreverence in comparison
with other pamphlet writers
that made his writing seem

491
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:32,380
so effective. So, for example,

492
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,280
writing about the origins of the English
monarchy and William the conqueror.

493
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,293
Payne wrote,

494
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,600
no man in his senses can say that their
claim under William the conqueror is a

495
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,630
very honorable one,

496
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:47,590
a French bastard landing with an armed
band diddy and establishing himself,

497
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:51,910
King of England against the consent
of the natives is in plain terms,

498
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,780
a very paltry rascally original.
Okay. It's not your typical pamphlet.

499
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:01,330
Sometimes he used really straightforward
language just for shock value,

500
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:06,820
trying to make his point by trying to
upset prevailing ideas by saying something

501
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,700
in a shockingly straightforward,
in a reverent manner.

502
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,390
And that's obviously going to be really
effective if he's talking about the king

503
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,990
to use sort of shockingly
irreverent language. So for example,

504
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:21,880
he really tried hard to dehumanize King
George the third writing, for example,

505
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,290
he has sunk himself beneath the
rank of animals and contemptible.

506
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:30,760
He crawls through the world like a worm.
Okay? That's pretty irreverent language.

507
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,970
Even brutes do not devour their young.
Okay.

508
00:31:33,971 --> 00:31:38,080
That would have been really shocking to
someone to read at the time that that's

509
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:43,081
a description of the king or he
used sarcasm as in this sentence.

510
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,980
Now I mentioned this sentence,

511
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,230
I in the first one of the early lectures
I talked about a sentence that um,

512
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,800
I really liked and I accused Benjamin
Rush of cutting it out of the pamphlet and

513
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:55,120
I'm here to redeem Benjamin Rush.

514
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,280
Cause when I looked this up
today to double check on myself,

515
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:59,660
what I discovered was this
is actually Benjamin Rush,

516
00:31:59,661 --> 00:32:02,770
his favorite sentence and
Benjamin Franklin struck it out.

517
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:08,230
So it was in the draft and it didn't make
the final printed copy of common sense.

518
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:13,750
And this is the sentence. Okay. A
greater absurdity cannot be conceived of.

519
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,320
Then three millions of people running
to their sea coast every time a ship

520
00:32:17,321 --> 00:32:20,470
arrives from London to know what
portion of liberty they should enjoy.

521
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,070
I think that's a good sentence. I agree
with rush. I think Franklin had it wrong,

522
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,850
I think. I think that's good.
Sort of point pointed sarcasm.

523
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,740
So I'm sorry I didn't make the final
printed version rushes right. So sarcasm,

524
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:37,480
effective or reverence, shock value,
all effective, even just emotion,

525
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:38,111
even pains.

526
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:42,890
Emotion was effective because it was so
strong because he was so passionate and

527
00:32:42,891 --> 00:32:46,610
because he was so straight forward
as in a sentence like this,

528
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,890
everything that is right or
reasonable pleads for separation,

529
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,510
the blood of the slain,
the weeping voice of nature cries,

530
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,460
tis time to part. Okay. Dramatic,
passionate, emotional language.

531
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,630
So all of this stuff that I'm
describing here, all of this rhetoric,

532
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:09,200
all of this logic, all of the sort
of rationale behind this pamphlet,

533
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,950
this is popular culture,
but it's not low culture.

534
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,190
It may not have had
really refined language,

535
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:20,090
but it hadn't correct language
as Thomas Jefferson put it.

536
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,230
No writer has exceeded pain in ease and
familiarity of style in perspicuity of

537
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:31,730
expression, happiness of elucidation.
And it's simple and unassuming language.

538
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:34,430
Okay. By riding that Jefferson
achieved none of those things.

539
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:40,510
That's like a really good example of how
different pains sounded perspicuity of

540
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:43,940
expression and happiness of
elucidation. Okay. Not In common sense.

541
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,890
Jefferson does not sound like
Thomas Paine. Um, given all of this,

542
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:53,420
the widespread popularity of the
pamphlet isn't surprising and the first

543
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:55,190
printing sold out in a few weeks.

544
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,130
There were many reprinting
first in Pennsylvania,

545
00:33:58,131 --> 00:34:03,131
then in other colonies and even
ultimately in Europe and all in all,

546
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,560
a majority of the population of the
colonies either read common sense or

547
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:13,580
received some kind of distilled version
of it at their local tavern or in

548
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:17,030
conversation as presented by
other people who had read it.

549
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,840
By march [inaudible] 1776 there had
been 125,000 copies sold and by colonial

550
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:27,380
standards,
that's a mind blowing number of copies.

551
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,970
And here's a way to sort of put that
in context at this period, even later,

552
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:36,200
even in the 1790s in a city
like New York or Pennsylvania,

553
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:41,390
a newspaper that would have been
considered to have like a big circulation

554
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:42,380
number like wow,

555
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:47,000
that's a really big newspaper would have
had a circulation of a thousand. Okay,

556
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:50,590
so 125,000 copies is a lot of copies.
That's,

557
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,430
that's a pretty remarkable number.

558
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,440
And sales were helped by the fact that
the pamphlet was priced really low so

559
00:34:57,441 --> 00:35:02,210
that it could be bought by anyone, even
the relatively poor. Now, of course,

560
00:35:02,211 --> 00:35:05,180
pain wasn't shy about
his own accomplishments,

561
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:09,110
and he later told anybody who would listen
that his pamphlet had enjoyed, quote,

562
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:14,380
the greatest sale than any performance
has ever had since the use of letters.

563
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:20,780
It's not a modest man. It is the greatest
selling thing of all time. It's like,

564
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:25,760
okay, okay, Tom, it's
important, but come on now.

565
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,600
Of course, not everybody cheered
with the publication of common sense.

566
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,280
There were many people who were enraged
at what it dare to say about the English

567
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:38,760
monarch, about the British constitution,
about independence. I mean,

568
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,620
who was this guy anyway?
Right?

569
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:45,621
Who was he to promote independence as
Samuel Adams put it with actually unusual

570
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,990
understatement for Samuel Adams.
He said,

571
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:52,710
the pamphlet quote has friended
some folks here more than a little.

572
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,140
It upset a lot of people.

573
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:00,420
More direct criticism was issued by an
English gentleman traveling in Virginia.

574
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:01,201
In his diary,

575
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:05,700
he wrote a pamphlet called
common sense makes a great noise.

576
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,620
One of the vilest things that ever was
published to the world full of false

577
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:14,100
representations,
lies calumny and treason.

578
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,440
Now, you may be surprised
to hear that John Adams,

579
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,710
ultimately a leading
proponent of independence,

580
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,760
did not like common sense.
John Adams did not like the pamphlet.

581
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,160
It wasn't because of the first two parts,
right?

582
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:33,840
He's all for questioning the British
constitution. He's all for independence.

583
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,100
That's fine.

584
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:39,450
But what really got Adams was the
third section of the pamphlet,

585
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,960
the section about like what
kind of government might
we be able to create in the

586
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:45,030
absence of the British constitution?

587
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,920
This made Adams crazy because two
atoms into many others at the time,

588
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,970
good lawmakers were supposed to always
be practical thinkers and they were

589
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:57,960
supposed to be realistic about
what a society could achieve.

590
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,260
They were supposed to think about the
realities of a society and then what would

591
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:04,950
be politically possible. And this is
not what he thought pain was doing.

592
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:07,050
He thought pain was sort of blue sky,

593
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:11,700
unrealistic tossings off
about possibilities without
thinking really hard about

594
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,840
probabilities.
So this is John Adams,

595
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:20,670
summary of common sense. Is it true
John Adams? Okay. Common sense quote,

596
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,890
a poor, ignorant, malicious,
shortsighted, crappy analysts mass.

597
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:30,610
Okay.
That's John Adams opinion of common sense.

598
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,950
I have to add here for no reason
except that when I was writing this,

599
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:38,370
I thought of it and then this is my
excuse to mention it in a lecture.

600
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:42,960
And so I will, um, how many of you
here have read Plato's republic?

601
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,550
Some of you have read Plato's
republic. Okay. Um, John,

602
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:50,850
I was really did not like Plato's republic
either and it for the same reasons,

603
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,940
right? He thought Plato was
irresponsible. He hated Plato's republic.

604
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,630
Jefferson was not a big fan either.
He thought that,

605
00:37:56,631 --> 00:37:59,430
that actually both of them thought
that Plato was Sorta vaporizing about

606
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:04,320
political ideals and not really thinking
about realistic application to real

607
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:07,320
people.
So to these guys at this time,

608
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:12,240
the real challenge of what they're
doing is to match ideals and realities.

609
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,860
And they didn't think Plato
was doing that at all.

610
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:18,861
So this is what Adam's first had to say
about Plato's republic while waiting

611
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:20,430
through the whims,
ease,

612
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:24,150
the pure realities and
unintelligible jargon of this work.

613
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,820
I laid it down often to ask myself,

614
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,600
it could have been that the world
should have so long consented to give

615
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:35,070
reputation to such nonsense. Is this
okay? He really doesn't like Plato's,

616
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,100
but he also just didn't like Plato.
So overall he said,

617
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:43,680
he talks about how he read all of Plato's
works and he talks about, oh yeah, no,

618
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,990
three Latin dictionaries in a German
one and a French one just in case.

619
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,210
And he like worked his way through.
Uh,

620
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:52,510
and he said he learned only two
things from all of Plato's work.

621
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,920
He learned number one,

622
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:58,330
that Benjamin Franklin stolen idea
from Plato to give him credit.

623
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,830
I never too, he learned that
sneezing is a cure for the hiccups.

624
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,290
And he said quote accordingly,

625
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,860
I have cured myself and all my friends
are that provoking disorder for 30 years

626
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:13,480
with a pinch of snuff. Okay. That's
Plato to John Adams. That's it.

627
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,110
So I just loved it. I love that
John Adams and his best. Okay.

628
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:22,180
So away from Plato back to common
sense. Um, for many people,

629
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:26,560
common sense was kind of a conversion
experience. And there are people,

630
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:28,990
they're are fence sitters who may be,

631
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,650
might've had the makings of a radical
and in reading the pamphlet or hearing of

632
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:36,790
the pamphlet, they actually
were radicalized by it. It
was talked of everywhere.

633
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,500
As rush put it, its effects were sudden
and extensive upon the American mind.

634
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,830
It was read by public men.
It was repeated in clubs,

635
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:49,270
spouted in schools and in one instance
delivered from the pulpit instead of a

636
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:53,140
sermon by a clergyman in Connecticut.
It's a Connecticut woman.

637
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,540
Always happy when we have like
little Connecticut or Yale moments.

638
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,510
It was talked about everywhere.

639
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,620
It's rhetoric was so powerful that for
many it inspired them to stand back,

640
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,840
examine their situation and really low
the Britain for the first time like, oh,

641
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,640
I've never thought of loathing Britain
before and yet now I am at George

642
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,880
Washington wrote common sense was working
a wonderful change in the minds of

643
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:18,130
many men.
In the end,

644
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:21,430
regardless of whether one agreed
or not with his argument pains,

645
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:24,220
pamphlet did one
fundamentally important thing.

646
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,290
He focused the prevailing colonial
political conversation on independence.

647
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,340
He lifted the argument above
constitutional reckoning.

648
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,960
He inspired others to write about the
topic as well. Sometimes for independent,

649
00:40:38,961 --> 00:40:39,910
sometimes against,

650
00:40:39,911 --> 00:40:44,860
but independence became now the topic
to discuss as a reader in Boston,

651
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:48,970
put it independence a year ago could
not have been publicly mentioned with

652
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:49,804
impunity.

653
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,250
Nothing else is now talked of and I know
not what can be done by Great Britain

654
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,140
to prevent it now.

655
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:00,670
Pain was all too happy to remind anyone
who would listen about the significance

656
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,240
of his pamphlet.
He considered it his lifetime achievement.

657
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,910
He wanted his tombstone
to read Thomas Paine,

658
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:09,790
author of common sense of course that
was assuming he was going to have a

659
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:10,640
tombstone,
which

660
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:17,350
for guy and think of that
until the second bad irony. Um,

661
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,860
he said that regardless of whatever
form he took in the afterlife,

662
00:41:20,861 --> 00:41:24,760
you would always know he had
written commonsense. Okay.

663
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:28,340
But did common sense cause independence?
Okay.

664
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,700
Pain clearly would have loved
to tell you that it did.

665
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,010
That's the kind of conclusion
you really can't make.

666
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,450
But clearly you can say it was
so powerful, so widely read,

667
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:43,220
so controversial that it shattered much
of the psychological resistance to the

668
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:45,890
idea of independence.

669
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,880
And also on a more social level,

670
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:55,190
common sense invited an entire range of
people into the political conversation

671
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,570
that in some ways hadn't
really been included before.

672
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,860
Just by deliberately making this pamphlet
available to as broad an audience as

673
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:08,861
possible and his message in a sense was
fundamentally democratizing as well.

674
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,640
Pain preach that any people can
deliberate and decide how they are to be

675
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,860
governed and then they
can act on that choice.

676
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:23,630
Any people are capable of creating
and implementing their own government.

677
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,560
It's a powerful message and regardless
of whether people agreed or disagreed

678
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:29,930
about what government
they should be creating,

679
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,320
the ideas underlying that pamphlet in
a sense we're really revolutionary in a

680
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:40,250
sense and certainly radicalizing just
at this moment when things are taking a

681
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:44,240
turn just at this moment when the king
was declared the colonies and rebellion

682
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:48,290
and very soon we're going to have
Lexington and conquered so you can see how

683
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:51,620
we're right at this moment where things
are going to take a shift. Common sense,

684
00:42:51,621 --> 00:42:56,030
partly timing wise came out at just the
moment where it was going to strike and

685
00:42:56,031 --> 00:43:00,920
have the broadest impact. That is all
I have for today. Have a good weekend.

686
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:05,420
I will see you on Tuesday and
we will move on to independence.

687
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:07,700
We get independence next week.
Very exciting.
