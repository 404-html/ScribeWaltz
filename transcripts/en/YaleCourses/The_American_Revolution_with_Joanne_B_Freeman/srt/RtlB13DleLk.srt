1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,540
Wow. So, um,

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,210
this my last true confession to you,
my class.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,720
Um, and is it true I always
give you true confessions.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,490
I never lied to you in my class. Um, but
this is a truly true confession because,

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,353
um,

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,780
the fact of the matter is I actually
really couldn't figure out how to end the

7
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:22,614
course.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,310
Like I can figure out what this last
lecture was supposed to be and I really

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,420
wondered about it. Agonized
over it. It's the last lecture.

10
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:33,030
There's all this pressure,
you know, sell up.

11
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:36,400
Several of you have emailed me and said,
looking forward to the last lecture.

12
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:40,690
And it's like, how can I live
up to the expectation? Um,

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,090
so I decided that,
um,

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,470
I would do two things in the lecture.
Um,

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,240
and the first thing that I'm going to
do is talk about the end of the American

16
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:53,220
revolution,
which is not an easy thing to do.

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,120
And I'm not going to be so good as to
actually put my finger on the moment when

18
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:58,080
the revolution ends,

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,480
but I'm at least going to suggest
a couple things about that.

20
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:01,111
And then at the end,

21
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:04,770
you'll see I'm going to come back around
and hopefully magically just tie the

22
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:07,200
whole course together.
By the end of the lecture,

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,260
you will for sure notice that some of
the things I'm talking about now have

24
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:13,110
references to things I talked about
way at the beginning of the course.

25
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:15,840
So I'm trying for
symmetry course symmetry.

26
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,580
And if you think back in the
distant ages of time, um,

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,480
when this course started,
um, I talked on that first,

28
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:26,950
I think the very first lecture I did,
um,

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,260
I used to quote from John Adams and
I used a quote from Benjamin Rush.

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,730
Those are the quotes that are
on the top of this syllabus. Um,

31
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,480
and both of them talk about when
the revolution supposedly began.

32
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:45,230
So Adam's writing an 1815 said that he
thought the revolution began in the minds

33
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:46,224
of the people.

34
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,860
And this was affected from 1760 to 1775
in the course of 15 years before a drop

35
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:54,750
of blood was drawn at Lexington.

36
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:57,480
So he says the war quote was
no part of the revolution.

37
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,730
And then the other quote I read was rush,

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,170
who in 1776 basically agreed that the
war and the revolution were two different

39
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:08,160
things, but then says, um,
the American war is over.

40
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,920
But this is far from being the
case with the American revolution.

41
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,050
We have changed our forms of government,

42
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,090
but it remains to affect a revolution
of our principals opinions and manners.

43
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,230
So as to accommodate that them to the
forms of government we have adopted. Okay.

44
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:27,210
So when I quoted those at the
very beginning of the course,

45
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,370
I basically was quoting them to kind of
shake up your assumptions about what the

46
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:35,700
American revolution actually was. You
know, if the founders can't even agree,

47
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,580
that kind of opens things broadly
for us to really talk about what the

48
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:40,620
revolution was today.

49
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:44,700
I'm mentioning them because I actually
do want us to think a little bit about if

50
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:46,800
that is, it is all that
confusion about when it starts,

51
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:49,260
what can we say about
when a revolution ends?

52
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,390
And there's definitely a hint about
how to discuss that question in both of

53
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:57,060
those quotes,
even though they don't necessarily agree.

54
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,630
Because both men and one way or
another saw the revolution as being

55
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:04,510
fundamentally about what
rush called principles,

56
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:08,410
opinions and manners and Adams called
a change in the minds of the people.

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,730
So in a way, they're both
saying that a real revolution,

58
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:17,790
a full revolution involves some kind
of a fundamental change in principals.

59
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,410
And as both men suggest, obviously this
isn't something that happens instantly,

60
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,380
like a declaration of war or
a surrender on a battlefield.

61
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,330
But it's a process and it takes place
over years, maybe even over decades.

62
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,950
Now obviously if you think about what
a revolution is formerly speaking,

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,390
it's a change of forms, forms of
government more than anything else.

64
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:48,010
So it involves some kind of a large scale
transfer of power after some kind of a

65
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:51,940
struggle between competing groups,
right?

66
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:54,490
So it's like a major shift
in sovereignty of some kind.

67
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,020
But for the struggle and the instability
of the revolution to come to a close,

68
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,630
obviously there had to be some kind of
a shared agreement about the nature of

69
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:08,590
whatever this new regime was going to
be about. What it's ideals were about,

70
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:10,180
what it's shape was going to be.

71
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,710
And without that kind of shared
agreement on those kinds of things,

72
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,750
this new regime would really stay in a
state of flux and would be vulnerable to

73
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:24,280
all kinds of continued dramatic and
potentially revolutionary change.

74
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,560
So in a sense,

75
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,780
what I'm saying here is that revolutions
involve both deconstruction and

76
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,840
reconstruction and that basically it's
one thing to rebel against something and

77
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:43,651
it's quite another thing to construct
something in its place that manages to get

78
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,180
some kind of general acceptance.

79
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,460
And a revolution cannot be said to have
ended until both parts of that equation

80
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,593
have been met.

81
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,800
And I think if you think back
over the course of the semester,

82
00:04:56,801 --> 00:05:01,801
you can see that during the semester
we've looked at both parts of that

83
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:03,400
equation.
In a sense.

84
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,510
We've looked at the very beginning of
the course when we were getting towards

85
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,321
the beginning of the war.

86
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:12,820
We've seen how Americans generally
agreed about what they were protesting

87
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,683
against.

88
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,890
But the 1770 1780 1790s revealed,

89
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,120
they've weren't necessarily in agreement
about what they were fighting for.

90
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:27,121
They didn't necessarily agree about what
the most desirable outcome would be.

91
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,010
And we've watched this over
the course of the semester.

92
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:34,450
We've seen people basically just figuring
out what this new regime is going to

93
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:34,751
be.

94
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:39,751
So we looked at the 1770s we saw how
people tried to create constitutions that

95
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:43,870
would reflect whatever this
new regime was going to be.

96
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,500
And we saw how those constitutions
pretty much distrusted centralized power.

97
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,240
Unfortunately at the 70s,

98
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,440
eighties revealed that that first
wave of reform wasn't quite right,

99
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,340
but there were some pretty important
problems that weren't solved,

100
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,210
that there was some new problems that
seem to be erupting that maybe hadn't been

101
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:07,970
anticipated before.
And then we've seen the result,

102
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,010
we watched continental army officers
sort of vaguely threatening some kind of

103
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:17,990
coup. And so the, the, the mighty power
of George Washington's glasses. Um,

104
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,710
we saw soldiers digging their bandits
through the windows of the Pennsylvania

105
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,400
State House to demand their pay
from the Confederation Congress.

106
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:30,850
We saw indebted farmers and Massachusetts
joining and protest to close down the

107
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:31,694
courts.

108
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,610
And then of course we saw the independent
republic of Vermont and my favorite,

109
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,630
the state of Franklin.

110
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,710
So clearly there was some
pretty widespread discontent
and some of the elite

111
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:45,320
also as we heard,
were not particularly happy.

112
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,310
Many of them wanted some
kind of economic stability.

113
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,910
Some of them were none too pleased
about what they saw as this sort of

114
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,780
widespread social instability.
So in one way or another,

115
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,160
all of these groups felt that the promise
of the revolution wasn't really being

116
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:01,994
fulfilled.

117
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,360
And the political system that had been
put into place during the revolution not

118
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:09,710
only was incapable of
dealing with the problem,

119
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:14,060
but in many ways it was fueling
the problem. Now, of course,

120
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:18,830
everything in one way or another
added up to lead to the constitutional

121
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,850
convention, which we discussed. Um,
and as we discussed in the course,

122
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,780
a new constitution was by no
means a done deal. And in fact,

123
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:30,680
there was some pretty fervent debate over
whether or not some individual states

124
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,100
even wanted to participate in
the whole convention at all.

125
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:39,170
And we've seen some of what people were
scared of in those debates about whether

126
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:40,400
or not to go to the convention,

127
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,900
a stronger government or even just the
new government might open the door to

128
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:49,010
things like an established aristocracy,
monarchy,

129
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,870
tyrannical centralized power,
the rise of a privileged few,

130
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,900
over an impoverished many.
So in essence,

131
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:59,900
these people are seeing that there
might be a big change happening.

132
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,430
They don't know what the change is
going to be and anything seems possible.

133
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,180
And all of those things obviously
would represent going back on what the

134
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:12,500
revolution had just gone forth for.
So in essence,

135
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:17,501
you see people who had absolutely no sense
of political stability or permanence,

136
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,530
no sense of what was going to come,

137
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,450
no real consensus about
the best way to fix it.

138
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:30,170
Now following the 1780s came a period
that obviously we don't cover in this

139
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:30,770
course.

140
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,770
My other electric cars covers
it and that's the 1790s
which saw yet another wave

141
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:36,411
of reform.

142
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:40,130
And this time it has to do with the
rise of the federalist Party and the

143
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:43,370
federalists and one way or another
were largely about centralizing power.

144
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:48,371
Even more and strengthening the national
government even more and controlling

145
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:52,340
and channeling the protest and
politicking of the populace.

146
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:55,860
They're not all that comfortable
with ongoing popular politicking.

147
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,770
And here again, in the 1790s
with this sort of counter wave,

148
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,710
you also see more instability,

149
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,280
more of a sense that there's some kind
of potentially drastic change that might

150
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:12,480
be happening just around the
corner. So throughout the 17, nine,

151
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:14,100
these people have things in their letters,

152
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:17,940
throw away lines like if this
government last another five years,

153
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,490
here's what I think we should do.
Um,

154
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,550
you can almost feel in some of these
letters how frightened in a sense some of

155
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:30,270
these people were who were stepping onto
the stage of a new government in this

156
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:33,930
sense of amazing instability. I'm going
to offer three quotes because it's,

157
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,020
it's amazing to me how similar they are.
They all use the same image.

158
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:38,430
It's almost like they
went into a room and said,

159
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,270
how should we describe being
scared in 1789? Oh, I know. Um,

160
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,640
so James Madison says in 1789,

161
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,520
we are in a wilderness without
a single footstep to guide us.

162
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:53,090
George Washington in 1790 I walk on
untrodden ground and good old Pennsylvania

163
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:56,640
Senator William McClay who offered us
that quote way at the beginning of the

164
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:59,370
course sitting next to Virginians at
dinner and saying that all they talked

165
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:01,880
about was alcohol and horses.
Um,

166
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,480
Mclean says the whole world is a shell
and we tread on hollow ground every step.

167
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,620
Now that's kind of interesting to me that
all of those quotes are all saying the

168
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:14,160
same thing, which is basically
all of these guys literally
are saying, wow, I'm on,

169
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:18,540
is really unstable ground and I have no
idea where I'm supposed to be going or

170
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,430
what a safe pack is going to be.

171
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,840
So throughout the 1790s the federalists
countered their sense of social disorder

172
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:31,560
by trying to legislate and administrate
their way into order and control.

173
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,240
And the alien and sedition acts of 1798
which I'm sure you probably studied in

174
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:39,990
high school, are two of the most
extreme examples along those lines.

175
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,220
This brings us to Thomas Jefferson and
the presidential election of 1800 now

176
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:50,730
significantly for the purposes of
this class. Jefferson years later,

177
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,360
very modestly called his own
election to the presidency,

178
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:58,680
quote the revolution of 1800
right? Not Modest at all. Oh yes.

179
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,100
When I came to power, it was the
revolution of 1800 and not only that,

180
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:06,300
he said it was as real a revolution in
the principles of our government as that

181
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:10,380
of 1776 was in its form. Okay.
He's talking serious revolution.

182
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:15,710
My rise to power was just as significant
as 1776 thank you Thomas Jefferson,

183
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,670
but you can kind of see that given what
was happening in the 1790s in my like

184
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:24,390
amazingly quick and dirty frighteningly
condensed version of the 70 nineties

185
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,900
that I just gave you, given what
the federalists seemed to represent,

186
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,280
you could see why Jefferson would have
thought that his rise to the presidency

187
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:36,420
was some kind of a return to core
principles or revolutionary principles.

188
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,370
Now this change of principles wasn't easy.

189
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,420
And actually I think it was the whole
intensity of the experience of that 1800

190
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:50,421
election that led Jefferson to
experience and describe his election as a

191
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:53,040
revolution that was fought and won.

192
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,570
His rise to the presidency came after
a seemingly deadlocked tie vote in the

193
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:02,230
electoral college that was thrown into
the House of Representatives to decide.

194
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,900
So deadlocked was the election.

195
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,410
And so extreme where the
fears and expectations on
all sides that if the wrong

196
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:12,010
person got the office,

197
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,750
the entire nation would come crashing
to ruin that two states in two different

198
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:19,840
states. And in one state, I
believe the governor was in on it.

199
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,520
People were stockpiling arms because they
were going to march on Washington and

200
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:28,270
take the government for Jefferson.
Yeah, that's, that's amazing.

201
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,320
That's America in a sense on the
brink of some sort of civil war.

202
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:35,650
If the people are marching
on the government to take
it for the person who they

203
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:39,520
think should be Jared, it
should be president. Um,

204
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,570
Massachusetts federalist Fisher Ames at
that time fought about this and believe

205
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:50,370
that he understood why this was happening.
And I'll,

206
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:53,560
I'll mention here only because it's
been a continuing theme in our course.

207
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,440
We've seen lots of crying
guys over the semester.

208
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,400
Washington's really good at reducing
people to tears apparently. Um,

209
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,070
and I have to mention here partly because
I just really liked Fisher ames cause

210
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:07,150
he's sort of an intriguing character
who always says quotable things. Um,

211
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,721
but he also,

212
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:12,721
he was in congress in the 1790s and the
thing that he's most known for is he

213
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:16,870
made a speech about the Jay Treaty
and everybody started to cry.

214
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,210
So he reduced congress to tears,
which to me is kind of a terrifying image.

215
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,450
Congress crying.
So Fisher Ames,

216
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,580
mighty orator reduce her to tears.
Um,

217
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,510
here's what he says in 1800 when he's
looking around and he's trying to figure

218
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,620
out what this all means,

219
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,560
the fat really is that there is a want
of accordance between our system of

220
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:40,780
government and the state
of our public opinion.

221
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,560
The government is Republican
opinion is essentially democratic.

222
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,191
Either events,

223
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:52,450
we'll raise public opinion high enough
to support our government or public

224
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:55,420
opinion will pull down the
government to its own level.

225
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,380
They must equalize.
That's really interesting.

226
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:04,381
So here watching what's happening in 1800
aims is kind of confirming what Adams

227
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:09,550
and rush were suggesting and the quotes
that I started out by discussing for a

228
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:14,551
revolution to end forms and public
opinion have to equalize in some way and

229
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:19,900
before they do things remain unstable.
So in a way,

230
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:24,901
what all of these guys are saying is
that revolutions end when public opinion

231
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,410
conforms with new post
revolutionary forms of governance.

232
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:34,390
And until that happens, revolutionary
change is still entirely possible.

233
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,190
Once that happens,

234
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,470
once the sort of new car smell is
dissipated from a new government and the

235
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:43,330
government could be taken for granted,

236
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:46,900
is kind of the normal state of affairs
and it's endorsed by a majority,

237
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,680
then it becomes much harder to stage
some kind of full scale revolution from

238
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:54,140
outside of the government.
So in essence,

239
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,370
revolutions and when the public
mind declares that they do,

240
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,870
it's up to the public.
Now that's a nice big,

241
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:06,830
broad general discussion about defining
the bounds of the American revolution.

242
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,440
But what does that really mean?
Like,

243
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,590
what are we really saying
here and how can we show it?

244
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,040
How do you actually show public opinion
changing and eventually conforming with

245
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:22,610
the new government? Well, what
am I that you can begin to do?

246
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:27,050
This is to find a wonderful primary source
that includes all kinds of eyewitness

247
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,830
testimony about one person's ideas
and how they changed over time.

248
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:34,900
So I bring to you today the recorded
recollections of George rubber,

249
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,900
twelves Hughes,
a New England shoemaker.

250
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,510
I know he's popped up once or twice in
one or two of the books we've read and

251
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:44,960
he's popped up once or twice for
good reason because it's hard.

252
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:49,280
It's harder to find comments from
people who are not lofty founders.

253
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,430
It's hard to find recollections and
memories and thoughts about the revolution

254
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:57,470
in a broad sense from average
Americans because number one,

255
00:15:57,471 --> 00:16:00,260
they don't spend a lot of time off
and sitting down and losing on paper.

256
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,423
And number two,

257
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:06,260
their papers don't get saved as often as
an elite politicians papers get saved.

258
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:11,261
So people always quote George Robert
twelves Hughes because he's there and he's

259
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:11,961
thoughtful.

260
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:16,370
And he actually went back and talked
about his entire life and his life spans

261
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:17,300
this entire period.

262
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:22,301
He was born in 1742 he dies in 1840
so he lives a really long time.

263
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:28,060
And he ended up being one of the last
surviving veterans of the revolution,

264
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,870
or at least that people knew about.

265
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:35,530
So because of that in the 1830s he was
interviewed so that he could talk about

266
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:39,650
his recollections, things of his life
that he saw as being significant.

267
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,270
So let's look for a minute
at what Hughes can show us.

268
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:50,120
For one thing you can see in some of the
stories that he told and the way that

269
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:55,121
he tells them some kind of subtle but
actually pretty significant changes in the

270
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:58,460
public mind that were unleashed
by the revolution. So for example,

271
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,140
one of his earliest memories was of
having to bring a pair of shoes to John

272
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,160
Hancock. And as he recalled the occasion,
all these years later, he was terrified.

273
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,390
And he says he's first ushered into the
kitchen where his type of person belongs.

274
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:15,800
And then Hancock says, no, no, actually
I'd like to thank this guy personally.

275
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:19,930
So then he's ushered into the sitting
room and he mumbles a little speech.

276
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:22,010
He didn't quite know what he was
supposed to say or how to say it and he's

277
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:25,490
really embarrassed. And then Handcock
actually ask him to sit down,

278
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:29,030
which terrifies him even more. And
then worst of all, Handcock says,

279
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,360
let me drink to your health and wants
to do the whole glass clinking thing.

280
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:35,090
And he says,
I'd never done the glass clinking thing.

281
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,380
I didn't know what I was doing.

282
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:40,610
We did the glass clinking thing and
then he basically ran away as soon as he

283
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:41,540
could without being rude.

284
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,890
Now he was Mary of this whole episode.

285
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Even all of these years later shows
really sort of colonial era difference at

286
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:55,710
work or this is not someone who's
just respectful of John Hancock.

287
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,390
This is someone who is
scared of interacting with
someone who that above him in

288
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:02,970
society
now.

289
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:06,780
He's lived in Boston and the 1760s and
seventies seventies this is very handy

290
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:10,560
for us obviously because then he offers
us eye witness testimony about other

291
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:14,430
kinds of sort of floating
in the air opinions that
we're developing at the time.

292
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,740
So he certainly, you can see when
he's talking about his experiences,

293
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:24,741
shared the feelings of many
of his neighbors in Boston
in the 1770s in his later

294
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,180
years,

295
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,140
he remembered how much he really hated
the British soldiers that were occupying

296
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:31,891
Boston.

297
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:34,620
He actually remembered that one of them
had a pair of shoes made and then never

298
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:37,890
paid for them. So it's a really
specific, I hate the British memory.

299
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,450
He also remembers watching an 18th
century mugging in which I'm a soldier,

300
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:45,720
knocked a lady down and stole
her bonnet and stole her MF.

301
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,870
So he remembers ugly British
soldier moments from Boston.

302
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,100
And then on March 5th he says that
when he heard noise in the street,

303
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,540
he ran to see what was happening and he
saw British soldiers firing on American

304
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:02,400
civilians and his response really say
something because he immediately ran home

305
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:07,410
to arm himself. He grabbed a cane
and he ran back to the uproar.

306
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:10,380
And when a soldier tried to
grab the cane out of his hands,

307
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,890
he was insistent that he had a
right to carry whatever he pleased.

308
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,010
Now that's really interesting
because here you see Hughes,

309
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:21,600
he's defending his fellow
Bostonians literally and
physically, and he's clearly,

310
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:24,900
I suppose an insisting that he has a right
to hold on to that cane defending his

311
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:29,280
rights to. But what you see is that
he's taken action almost instinctively.

312
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,970
It's not like he saw what was happening
and said, this is a revolutionary moment.

313
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,330
I must go home and grab my club so that
I can say I was there at the beginning

314
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:38,360
phases of the American
revolution. I mean, he, he,

315
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,090
he just sees what's happening in the
street. He's upset. It's his neighbors.

316
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:46,380
It's people from Boston who are getting
shot at and he instinctively is just

317
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,510
drawn in to what's happening.

318
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,980
So clearly his sense of involvement
and unfolding events is growing,

319
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,030
particularly given that he next
took part in the Boston tea party.

320
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,900
Obviously that's a very deliberate
choice to take part in a protest.

321
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,420
And then he fights as a
soldier during the revolution,

322
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:07,200
which I guess is the ultimate way in which
you show that you're part of a cause.

323
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,580
And then he went back to being a shoemaker
and then he became an aged veteran of

324
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:13,350
the revolution.
Oh,

325
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:17,070
and one thing I can't help mentioning
only because whenever I talk about George,

326
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:17,940
Robert twelves Hughes,

327
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,680
I always mention this because I just
love the fact that it exists. Um, he had,

328
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,220
I think, well actually I
know he had 15 children. Um,

329
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,660
but what's wonderful about
that fact is that, um,

330
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,250
his 11th son was named 11 and his,

331
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,990
his 15th son was named 15.
And I just love the guy,

332
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,410
George Robert twelves
Hughes has the humor.

333
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:44,320
I don't know if his sons were really
thrilled about being named 11 and 15. Um,

334
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,350
but I just love the fact that he did
this and that we know that that makes me

335
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:49,900
even happier. Okay. So,

336
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,310
so what does his show us besides
very bizarre naming habits? Um,

337
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,510
for one thing,

338
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:59,020
his recollections offer a great example
of the ways in which the revolution

339
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:02,080
inspired average Americans
to become politically active.

340
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,910
He was literally drawn into the action
first defending his neighbors and his

341
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:08,170
town,
but over time,

342
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,220
obviously feeling like he was taking
part in some kind of a larger cause.

343
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,660
So in essence, he helps us see how the
revolution could politicize someone.

344
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,550
And you kind of see this in action.
Obviously with the Hancock story,

345
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,680
you could see what a real
sense of pre-revolutionary
difference felt like. Now,

346
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:29,500
of course, the revolution didn't
just stamp out difference,

347
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,890
but a politicized public was a public
that understood that it had rights and

348
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:36,070
that it could demand them.

349
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,680
And eventually the American people
would not show that kind of fear and

350
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:44,560
trembling before a member
of the supposed elite.

351
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,710
So basically eventually the
American public would find
their voice and this idea

352
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:56,340
that the public had a voice and had a
right to express it is the sort of general

353
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:00,850
changing of public opinion that would
ultimately connect to the nation's new

354
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:01,600
form of government.

355
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,260
So basically you see the sort of
beginning of a chain reaction that might

356
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:06,760
actually lead to the
end of the revolution.

357
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:11,650
You can see patterns unfolding that
represent pretty major changes over a long

358
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:12,580
stretch of time.

359
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,650
Now obviously it's not just average
American citizens who are being shaped by

360
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:21,460
the revolution. The elite were
profoundly effected by it as well.

361
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,470
And for one obvious thing,

362
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,120
suddenly they were presented with this
opportunity to create and shape a new

363
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:29,350
government for a new nation.

364
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,370
And they knew that this was
a pretty rare opportunity.

365
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:34,840
So even as they're doing it,

366
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,750
they know that this is not
something that happens very often.

367
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,580
Just listen to how John Adams discussed
what he felt like was the change that he

368
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:44,170
experienced over the course of his life.

369
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:47,140
And this is in one of the letters I
mentioned this at the beginning of the

370
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:49,600
course. These great letters they
write to each other in their old age.

371
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,800
So here writing to Jefferson,
Adam says, when I was young,

372
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,110
the summa Bonem or the sort of ultimate
height in Massachusetts was to be worth

373
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,590
10,000 pounds.
Sterling ride in a chariot or carriage,

374
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,700
be a kernel of a regiment of militia and
hold a seat in His Majesty's Council.

375
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:11,500
No Man's imagination aspire to
anything higher beneath the skies.

376
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,390
So Adams is thinking back and he's here
basically suggesting that the revolution

377
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,670
and its aftermath expand the
horizons of an entire generation.

378
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,040
Now he's talking about the elite,

379
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:28,540
but you could expand this to include
the American citizenry as well.

380
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,870
Cause then a variety of ways.
The revolution shook things up.

381
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,410
And in doing so it
expanded People's horizons.

382
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,580
Now I use the word citizenry and I
did that really deliberately. Um,

383
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:45,750
because all Americans did not have
their horizons expanded during the

384
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:46,940
Revolutionary War.

385
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,730
And this is something clearly we talked
about in class and you've talked about

386
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:53,390
in sections that's linked to some of
the discussions that we've been having

387
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:56,240
about how radical the
revolution was or wasn't.

388
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,160
So the elite, like everyone else, we're
profoundly effected by the revolution.

389
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,640
But of course they're not the people
who get to decide the fate of the

390
00:24:04,641 --> 00:24:08,690
revolution. If the American public
who gets to make that decision,

391
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:12,680
it's their opinions of the new government
that are going to either make or break

392
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,930
the government and the revolution.

393
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,680
And during the period
covered by this course,

394
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:22,700
we've seen the beginnings of a long
period during which public opinion would

395
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:27,230
continue to change sometimes really
dramatically concerning just what this new

396
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,330
government and this new
nation was supposed to be.

397
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:34,610
Now I'm not going to end by continuing
here to talk about the end of the

398
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:39,170
revolution because it isn't
just the events of the
revolution that mattered even

399
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:41,750
when they're ending.
It's actually how we remember them.

400
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,310
That matters because the way that
we remember history obviously really

401
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:48,740
determines its meaning and its impact.

402
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,890
So basically history and how we
understand our history can have a profound

403
00:24:54,891 --> 00:24:59,660
effect on the here and now. In a way,
this is what Jefferson referred to,

404
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:02,870
I think a couple of lectures back.
I talked about the dead hand of the past.

405
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,160
Jefferson wanting to like every 19
years, let's make a new constitution. Um,

406
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,390
that's kind of linked to that Jeffersonian
idea of the dead hand of the past.

407
00:25:11,391 --> 00:25:14,300
And since history could have
that impact on the present,

408
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:17,930
depending on how you understand
it and that dead hand of the past,

409
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,120
it can be a pretty heavy hand
at this point. Basically,

410
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:26,750
I need, I need, I need
to tell you an anecdote.

411
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,940
I actually do need to
tell you an anecdote. Um,

412
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,470
as I was reading the lecture this morning,
um,

413
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,680
I was writing about the
dead hand of the past.

414
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,970
And I guess whenever I use that phrase,

415
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:38,750
I think at this one particular letter
I found, which actually is relevant,

416
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:41,880
so I'm not being completely random.
Um,

417
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,780
it does have something to do with the
dead hand of the past and history.

418
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,690
It actually also has nothing to
do with the American revolution,

419
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,530
but it really shows you how the past can
have an enormous weight on the present.

420
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,210
And it's also just an amazing little
piece of paper that I found and it has to

421
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:59,250
do with this letter that I found when
I was rummaging through, um, the,

422
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,840
the Addams family correspondence,
which is indeed what it's called,

423
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,710
the Addams family. So the, the
John Adams family correspondence,

424
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,070
and I found this letter from John
Quincy Adams. I wasn't looking for it,

425
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:13,440
but I found this letter
and he was overseas, uh,

426
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,150
when his father was running for president.
And he clearly,

427
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:18,710
he really wants to know if his father one,

428
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,190
and it takes a long time for
news to make it across the ocean.

429
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,970
So what I found was first one
letter in which he's writing,

430
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:27,020
do you know what happened in the election?

431
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,260
And then I found a lot of them and he
keeps me writing to people and writing to

432
00:26:30,261 --> 00:26:33,140
people saying, do you know, do you
know, has my father won the election?

433
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:36,020
Who's won the election? What's happened
in the election? So I can't help.

434
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:39,500
But now I'm like following the trail
because I have to find the letter where he

435
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:44,220
finds out. Right. And you would assume,
I assumed that I found that letter.

436
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,480
He would say something, you know like,
ah, this is a great day for America,

437
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:52,320
or I don't know, something, something
lofty and you know, w vision,

438
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:55,410
this sort of looking out,
aw, junk with the Adams ask.

439
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,680
So finally I find the letter and I'm
going to paraphrase it and with my own bad

440
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:05,730
paraphrasing here, but the point
will be true. He basically says,

441
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,820
Oh God,
I'll never live up to this.

442
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:14,590
The first thing he thinks is now I'm
going to have to be president too.

443
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:20,640
That was amazing to me.
Like I really felt for John Quincy Adams,

444
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:25,641
like you suddenly got a quick flash
of what it felt like to be an Adams or

445
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:30,741
particularly the Addams family had a
habit of picking one Adams progeneration

446
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:33,660
and then dumping all of their
expectations on that one.

447
00:27:33,661 --> 00:27:37,440
Adams clearly John Quincy Adams is
this generation's guy. So there's,

448
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:41,030
this certainly gives you a
sense of, I want to say dead
hand of the past, I guess.

449
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,630
I guess it's the live hand of the past
because it's his father, this poor guy.

450
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:48,510
Like anything his father does,
he's clearly like, oh damn,

451
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:54,570
I have to be president too.
She's amazing. Um, but concrete,

452
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:57,650
a concrete example of what
I'm talking about here. Um,

453
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,440
and it certainly shows how the next
generation beyond the founding generation

454
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,340
really felt like they had to live up to
the achievements of what had gone before

455
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:09,120
them. Now, as far as the people
who had gone before them,

456
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,860
as far as the fathers are concerned,

457
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,640
they knew that they were becoming history.

458
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,770
And so they thought about the making of
history and the writing of history a lot.

459
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,320
To me the most, the most
concrete example, um,

460
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,240
of people becoming history is something
that happened to poor Thomas Jefferson

461
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,800
in his old age. You know, I wonder if any
of you ever seen a life mask. You know,

462
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:35,310
there's death masks in life masks,
death masks are obvious,

463
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:39,120
but there do exist life masks as
well. So again, Jefferson's old age,

464
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:42,180
someone went to Monte Cello and they
wanted to make a life mask of him.

465
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,320
I don't know who this guy
was, but he wasn't good at
his job. So whatever he did,

466
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:49,800
he did it wrong. And his,
his daughter later said,

467
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,270
she came into the room to see
the guy with a hammer and chisel,

468
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,820
like trying to chip the plaster. You're
like, oh my God, I killed him, you know,

469
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,010
like the plaster hardened
and they couldn't get it off.

470
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,800
So Jefferson's like basically thinking
this is so bad, this is really bad.

471
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:10,190
He really like was terrified
that that was the end for him.

472
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,410
He literally almost became history.
He was his dream. He was gone.

473
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,060
Luckily they can pick out the
plaster off and, and he survived.

474
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,950
But aside from the fact that he
almost melted into plaster, um,

475
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,930
obviously that whole cohort of people had
really strong feelings about the story

476
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:31,170
of the revolution,
about how that story should be told.

477
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,090
And they were not in love with the whole
idea that the founding period is some

478
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:38,730
kind of golden age of
patriotic perfection.

479
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,760
They did not see the revolution is some
kind of divine strike of Providence.

480
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,310
They did not see themselves as demi gods.

481
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,780
And here I'm going to turn to John
Adams, which always makes me happy. Um,

482
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:54,870
who did a really good job in his old age
of answering letters from strangers who

483
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:58,960
wanted to know,
tell us about the revolution,

484
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:00,730
what really happened and an answering.

485
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:06,060
He did a great job of basically
popping bubbles of myths, you know, he,

486
00:30:06,061 --> 00:30:09,760
he basically said over and over again
in one way or another, you know,

487
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,620
revolution wasn't some kind of
golden, wonderful moment. Now,

488
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:16,690
like the other founders,
he actually lived to be 90,

489
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:19,840
so unfortunately he had a lot of
these letters. Um, I think Jefferson,

490
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,450
I think I was back to say
Jefferson I think got more,

491
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,910
which obviously would
make Adam's really mad.

492
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,770
Like even now I was thinking
about him more than me. Um,

493
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,600
but I think all of these guys were getting
these letters from people basically

494
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:37,060
in one way or another saying, you know,
tell us what was it really like? Like,

495
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:39,910
what was it like, what happened when you
signed the declaration? What happened?

496
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:43,930
What was it really like? Jefferson in
particular was driven crazy. I mean,

497
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:48,931
Jefferson Jefferson doesn't normally
emote on paper in a deep kind of sincere,

498
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,170
like he's not thinking hard way.
They always get a sense,

499
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:56,050
he's thinking really carefully
about how he expresses himself. Um,

500
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,230
but when he's riding to Adam's
in their old age, he gets,

501
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:03,070
he's really just sort of Vince about
this whole like strangers writing letters

502
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:04,270
and asking about history thing.

503
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,630
So he says he complains from sunrise to
one or two o'clock and often from dinner

504
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:10,690
to dark,

505
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:15,690
I am dredging at the writing table and
all this to answer letters into which

506
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,100
neither interest nor
inclination on my part enters.

507
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,840
And often for persons whose names I have
never before heard. And in this letter,

508
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:27,841
Jefferson estimates that an 1822 he
got 1,267 of these letters from people,

509
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,770
just strangers.
Tell us about the declaration.

510
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,700
He called it the burden of his life.
And then at one point in this letter,

511
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:40,250
and this is where I felt like he really
hit like Jeffersonian bottom, he's,

512
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,510
he's like whining and whining and he's
going on, I hate this, I hate this. Well,

513
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:46,390
they stop, you know, probably out
of the thinking sends them to me.

514
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,130
I have something to say.
Um,

515
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,870
but finally at this point in the
letter Jefferson just writes,

516
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,820
is this life it's so
weirdly modern. You know,

517
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,900
that's like something we have probably
all said at one point is this life,

518
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:07,090
please stop writing me the letters.
His life actually got worse on this front.

519
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,360
You got it. You're feeling
bad for the founders here. Um,

520
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,200
people didn't just like daily
gym with random letters.

521
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,780
Strangers made pilgrimages to Monte Cello.

522
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,680
It became like a tourist attraction
and he was still living in it.

523
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,010
And so strangers would come
and just swarm around macho,

524
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,960
like peering in the window, you know,
like, oops, I broke the glass, you know,

525
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:29,860
like trampoline the car.

526
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:34,910
And he got so overwhelmed by this that
he basically after a while left my cello

527
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:38,620
and lived in one of his other homes
for a while. Like I just can't take it.

528
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,900
I'm abandoning my house to the strangers.

529
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,030
I'm going to go live in my
other house for a little while.

530
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,610
And that's why actually those of you
who've been to mount a cello and you've

531
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:49,250
seen his little sanctuary,
there's a look,

532
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:53,870
a little area that's really his and has
sort of all his books and his bed and

533
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,080
it's really their doors that
can lock it off to everything,

534
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,840
which is really rare for a
real reason because that was,

535
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:04,200
that literally was his sanctuary. That was
like the swarms are outside lock, lock,

536
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:07,910
lock, lock, like you're
not coming in. So I think,

537
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:11,150
I think it wasn't fun being a founder
and basically that's what Jefferson is

538
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:15,590
showing us here. Um, but whether or
not they were happy old founders,

539
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,190
the founding types who are
answering these letters,

540
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:23,660
we're really trying to shape the telling
of the history of the revolution and

541
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:26,990
different founders I'm sure had different
messages and some are probably happier

542
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:29,060
than others or more
optimistic than others.

543
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:33,440
I think James Madison was like
optimistic to the end. Um, Adams,

544
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:34,430
as I said before,

545
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,420
spent a lot of time sort of punching
holes and myths about the revolution that

546
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:41,840
already were circulating in
the 18 teens in the 1820s.

547
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,550
So over and over and over again,

548
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,720
he told people that there had not been
some kind of unanimous, patriotic,

549
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:52,580
glorious moment as it seemed to have
been looking from the distance of time.

550
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,130
So in response to one letter,

551
00:33:55,131 --> 00:34:00,131
he insisted that the revolution was not
a big wave of unanimous patriotism as he

552
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:00,530
put it.

553
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:05,530
Every measure of Congress from 1774
to 1787 inclusively was disputed with

554
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:11,351
acrimony and decided by a small majorities
as any question is decided these

555
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:15,580
days. Right. I saying, you know, it's
not like we were like, yes, independence.

556
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,310
You say,
you know,

557
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:19,730
sometimes it was like one or two votes
that we decided this and then it goes out

558
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:23,510
into history and all the people know is
we voted yes and it seems unanimous and

559
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:26,060
it really wasn't even iconic.

560
00:34:26,061 --> 00:34:30,730
Revolutionary moments he thought should
not be viewed as the sort of blurry is

561
00:34:30,731 --> 00:34:31,760
moments of triumph.

562
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:36,020
He in one letter he recalled what he
was thinking as he watched people,

563
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:39,620
his fellow congressmen signed the
Declaration of Independence and he said,

564
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:41,150
I could not see their hearts,

565
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,750
but as far as I could penetrate the
intricate foldings of their souls.

566
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,630
I then believed and have not
since altered my opinion,

567
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,050
that there were several who signed with
regret and several others with many

568
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:54,230
doubts and much lukewarmness.
He said, he's saying, okay,

569
00:34:54,231 --> 00:34:57,060
even while they're like signing
the declaration, it's like,

570
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,560
I don't think some of these
people actually really
want it to be signing it at

571
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:00,920
all.

572
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,370
And some of them I think kind of wish
they were somewhere else not signing it,

573
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:07,370
which is not the image that's floating
around at this point about what the

574
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:10,700
revolution was.
So people were disagreeing.

575
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,360
He's saying back in the revolutionary era,
they came to the majority.

576
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,070
They weren't sure about
what they were doing.

577
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:19,760
They didn't even like what they were doing
sometimes and their decisions weren't

578
00:35:19,761 --> 00:35:23,660
always good. He out. Of course. That's
something to say about that as well.

579
00:35:23,661 --> 00:35:26,030
So he said in a different letter,
I say,

580
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:31,150
we did not make more mistakes
now than we did in 1770456789.

581
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,200
He's clearly making a point here.
When I was copying this, I was like,

582
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:41,010
how many more?
(808) 018-0280 three it's like,

583
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:45,240
I get your point. We made a lot of
mistakes through the whole revolution.

584
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:50,070
He's saying it was patched and Piebald
then as it is now and ever will be world

585
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:54,110
without end,
nor were battlefields any more sank.

586
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,490
Sacrosanct is Adam put it.
Adam's put it.

587
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,910
We blundered at Lexington at bunker's
hill where indeed did we not blunder

588
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:06,090
except Saratoga and Yorktown
where our triumphs redeemed.

589
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:07,620
All former disgraces.

590
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,880
So Adams is insisting much of the time,
you know,

591
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:15,840
we weren't all that great like
we made mistakes back then.

592
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,900
We didn't always entirely
believe what we were doing.

593
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,200
It wasn't that different
from how it is now.

594
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:27,360
The Revolution was not some golden age
of perfection and Adam summed all of this

595
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:30,000
up in a letter that I like
because in some way, I don't know.

596
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:33,050
It seems a little more direct than
some of these other letters and it,

597
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,250
if it was a while,
you'll hear the way he phrases it.

598
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,900
He wrote this letter in 1811 and he
said to this one correspondent who said,

599
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:44,580
you know, I revere the fathers,
I, you know, I want to be
like them. Oh, you know,

600
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:46,710
all the things he's getting in
all of these letters. And he says,

601
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,410
I ought not to object to your
reverence for your fathers,

602
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:54,411
but to tell you to tell you a great
secret as far as I am capable of comparing

603
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:56,400
the merit of different periods.

604
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,950
I have no reason to believe
we were better than you are.

605
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,800
He has like being really
straight forward about this.

606
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,730
Now all of those quotes of course are
from the sort of lofty Adams, you know,

607
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:09,390
the far seeing items, the sage
Adams, they're not from the Adams.

608
00:37:09,391 --> 00:37:12,360
I was just referring to a few minutes ago,
which is the, I don't get any respect.

609
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,700
John Adams and he's there too and mean.

610
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,340
Both of those things were there at the
same time, which also tells you something.

611
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,680
When you read the
correspondence of his old age,

612
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:22,740
he sort of veering back and forth between,
I am a lofty founder.

613
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:26,580
Why won't anyone recognize me as a lofty
founder? I'm a lefty founder, please.

614
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:28,890
Someone recognized me. He has all these
letters where he's like, you know,

615
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:32,190
no one will ever make a monument to me.
John Adams,

616
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,480
so sorry,
but my,

617
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,650
my point here is that to
Adams and to many others,

618
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,370
you're not supposed to look at
history as this sort of golden,

619
00:37:44,371 --> 00:37:48,540
perfect moment that's drastically
different in that sense,

620
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,750
from everything since innocence to these
people worshiping the founding era or

621
00:37:54,061 --> 00:37:58,320
worshiping the American revolution as a
golden age actually did more harm than

622
00:37:58,321 --> 00:38:01,770
good. The revolution had
been all about beginnings,

623
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,970
about beginning traditions
and patterns of governance,

624
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,000
about beginning new constitutions.

625
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:14,400
But these beginnings were
actually supposed to go
someplace they were supposed

626
00:38:14,401 --> 00:38:19,401
to lead to something that actually
would survive and be shaped by future

627
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:22,500
generations.
So I think to this whole generation,

628
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:27,501
this idea of sort of worshiping
the founding era as a
golden age made it seem as

629
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:33,300
though the time for that kind of work
had ended as though there was a glorious,

630
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:37,210
wonderful creative moment when things
could be done. Uh, now that time is gone.

631
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:41,530
And you could see that in Adam's letters
to that he says often about the future.

632
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,220
Well, you know, maybe it
will be a brighter page or
maybe it'll be a darker page.

633
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:46,480
I don't know.
It's up to you.

634
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:51,460
But he assumes obviously that what they've
been doing isn't some like dead end

635
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:53,380
moment at which who knows
what will happen next.

636
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:56,920
He actually assumes they've started
something that in one way or another,

637
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,360
they assume it's going to continue.

638
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:04,380
So clearly the time for that kind of
creative political work hadn't ended

639
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,290
whenever the random date is that we
decide the American revolution ended.

640
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:12,730
And in a sense it hasn't ended
as the founding generation. Well,

641
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:16,300
new American citizens are always
responsible for their government.

642
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:20,140
They control its destiny, right?
They decide when revolutions start,

643
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:22,360
they decide when revolution stop,

644
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:26,710
they control the destiny of
the aftereffect of revolutions.

645
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,780
So I guess in a sense, and this is where
I was really struggling this morning,

646
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:34,930
I was like, what would be the
ultimate message I give to you?

647
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:38,980
It's so hard when you teach courses on
the founding period because everything

648
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:41,980
you say has weird
resonance in the present.

649
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:44,960
As I'm kind of saying here and I
don't want to have weird resonance,

650
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,530
I just want to sort of give
something to you guys. Um,

651
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,590
so related to what I'm saying here,

652
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,400
maybe the ultimate message of the sort
of ground level message or this course is

653
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:59,700
your opinions matter and your actions
out there in the world politically and

654
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:02,680
otherwise are going to matter too.

655
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,430
That's in essence what these founders are
saying when they're saying don't treat

656
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:07,630
us like demi gods,

657
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:11,470
like where some lofty population
that will never come again.

658
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,920
Then when we set something in motion
and the whole point of the thing that we

659
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:18,580
set in motion is that you're
supposed to make it run, right.

660
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:21,400
It's actually about you.
We may be memorable guys.

661
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:26,020
I might want to be a more memorable
guy than I am, but it's all about you.

662
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:31,060
It's all about you. That's what's supposed
to keep it running in the end. Okay. Um,

663
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,470
I want to, first of all, thank you
for laughing at my jokes all semester.

664
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,151
Obviously,

665
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:40,600
one of my favorite things to do is to
tell stories and lecture courses are

666
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:44,170
moments where you're completely my
hostage and I get to it sometimes as I'm

667
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:47,410
writing a lecture, as as today,
I'm like, oh, this isn't related,

668
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:50,140
but I'll find a way to rope it in to the
lecture so then I can give it to you.

669
00:40:50,141 --> 00:40:53,400
So I have greatly enjoyed myself
this semester. You've been,

670
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:57,100
you've been wonderfully receptive.
You asked, when I went to sections,

671
00:40:57,101 --> 00:41:01,780
you asked wonderful questions, you're
engaged with the material. After lectures,

672
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:03,850
you guys kept coming up to
me and asking good questions,

673
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:07,090
which was impressive and doesn't
always happen in electric cords.

674
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:10,420
So I want to thank you because it makes
me really happy if you guys are really

675
00:41:10,421 --> 00:41:14,290
engaged with what I'm talking about here.
So thank you very much.

676
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,930
[inaudible].
