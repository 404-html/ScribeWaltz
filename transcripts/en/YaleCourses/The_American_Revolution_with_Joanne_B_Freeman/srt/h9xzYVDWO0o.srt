1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,880
Okay. So, um, Thursday,
less long ago, last week,

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:06,630
um,

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,630
we began to set the scene for this
course by talking about the experience of

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,840
being a British colonist.
And as you remember,

5
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:19,320
we talked about the connection
the colonists had with England,

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,700
both positive and negative.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,770
We talked about their sense of England
and particularly London is being the sort

8
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:29,010
of center of the empire and
almost the center of the universe.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,170
And we talked about the colonists,

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,630
simultaneous concerns about maybe not
quite being as good as the people who were

11
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:40,650
at that wonderful sophisticated
center of the universe. Um,

12
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:45,651
and I closed the lecture by noting that
in many ways the colonists were never as

13
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:50,931
British as when they began to object
and then ultimately rebel against their

14
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:56,160
mother country for not being given
their full rights as British subjects.

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:57,601
Okay.

16
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:02,310
So if Thursday's lecture was about how
the colonists identified with the mother

17
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:06,060
country,
today's lecture sort of does the opposite.

18
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,380
And what I'm going to be talking about
today is the ways in which the colonists

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,630
and the colonies were different from
people back in the mother country.

20
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,410
Basically is the title of this lecture
suggest I'm going to be talking about

21
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:23,160
being a British American as opposed
to being a British colonist,

22
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:28,161
which is last week now connected
with what I suggested on Thursday.

23
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,740
It's important to note that the American
colonists weren't necessarily aware of

24
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:38,220
the ways in which some of their ideas
and attitudes were different or certainly

25
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:41,340
we're evolving differently
from those in England,

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,010
and I'll come back to this
again in this lecture,

27
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:46,830
but I'll mention it here
by the mid 18th century,

28
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:48,780
the period that we're
really talking about now,

29
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,580
there had already been several
generations of colonists in the colonies,

30
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,480
so certainly there were people in the
colonies who themselves had never been to

31
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:01,260
England, perhaps didn't know very
many people who had been to England,

32
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:06,650
and so they didn't necessarily have an
amazingly accurate sense of really what

33
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:11,130
it meant to be a British
subject in England living
in England proper as opposed

34
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,230
to their experience of
being in the colonies.

35
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,010
And that's going to be an important
thing to think about as we continue on in

36
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:21,420
this course. This idea that ideas are
evolving differently in the colonies,

37
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,700
then they're involving in England and
the colonists didn't necessarily realize

38
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,270
that these differences existed.
Okay,

39
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,440
so I want to begin this lecture on being
a British American with just a handful

40
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:42,321
of examples and really kinds of snapshots
of life in the colonies in the 1740s

41
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,410
and as you'll see with
these little examples,

42
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,680
they're going to each be demonstrating
something that I'm going to come back to

43
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:50,970
later in the lecture,

44
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,850
but I at least wanted to give you sort
of a sense of what it looked like before

45
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:56,820
I actually talked about it and
I've pulled all of these examples.

46
00:02:56,821 --> 00:03:00,250
There's three or four of them
all from the same source,

47
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,300
which is from a really well known
diary by a Dr. Alexander Hamilton,

48
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:05,860
and this is not the Alexander Hamilton.

49
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,180
I always feel bad for this guy because
he's gone down to posterity is like not

50
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:15,150
the real Alexander Hamilton.
He's, he's the not real, he's
the unknown, unimportant.

51
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,510
Alexander Hamilton for guy who lived in
Maryland is a doctor and actually mean

52
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,370
does have a really interesting diary.

53
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:25,510
I'll be reading a couple of sections from
it. Um, but he's, he's not the founder.

54
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,030
Tough break for Alexander
Hamilton. Okay. So in 1744,

55
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,470
he decided to take a trip north from
Maryland for his health and that's when he

56
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:37,360
keeps this sort of a travel diary.

57
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,720
And in it he recorded his observations
with a lot of detail as you'll hear that

58
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:46,570
show a lot about habits of behavior and
thought in the colonies are certainly,

59
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:51,130
and they also will show you a lot as
you'll see about Mr. Hamilton. Um,

60
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,921
but also they,

61
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:56,600
they sort of show you what he
saw through the lens of him. Um,

62
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,570
but still they'll give you a sense
of some trends. Okay. Um, and I'll,

63
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:03,820
I'll actually, I'll add here one
little brief point and that is,

64
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,930
I'm in a sense this is
touching on something that
I'm going to be focusing on in

65
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:12,250
Thursday's lecture. And that's the
idea that, um, too many people,

66
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:17,020
and you'll hear it sort of underlying
what he's saying here. Too many people,

67
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,500
their individual colony really was
what felt to them like their country.

68
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,000
And people often refer to Jefferson
called Virginia my country well into the

69
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:26,920
1790s if not beyond.

70
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,020
So you'll be hearing how people really
feel about their colony versus those

71
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,720
other foreign colonies.

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,440
People often felt as though they were
different countries with strange habits

73
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:40,600
and weird speech patterns.
So you'll,

74
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:44,590
you'll kind of hear that beneath what
I'm going to read here by Hamilton. Okay.

75
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:49,591
So one thing that Hamilton wrote about
in his diary shows the impact of the

76
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:54,130
great awakening during the
time that he was traveling,

77
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:58,210
which is the 1740s the colonies were
actually right in the middle of the great

78
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:58,990
awakening,

79
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,010
which was this really vast religious
revival that really swept through the

80
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,680
colonies.
And in the course of Hamilton's travels,

81
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:09,700
he said he could always tell when he
came across the revivalist because they

82
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:12,730
always had a really dour expression on
their faces that they were just about to

83
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:14,350
ask you to repent for your sins.

84
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,580
So he says at one point he came
across one of these revivalists.

85
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:22,420
He said the fellow was named Mr.
Thomas Quiet and is Hamilton,

86
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,410
put it in his diary.

87
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,670
This fellow I observed had a
particular down hanging look,

88
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,260
which made me suspect that he's one
of the revivalists, I guess right for,

89
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:34,870
he introduced a discourse
concerning George Whitefield,

90
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:37,570
who is the renowned preacher
of the great awakening.

91
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:41,200
He traveled throughout the colonies
preaching and in a lot of ways he was sort

92
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:45,040
of the guiding force behind
the great awakening in America.

93
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,050
So Mr. Thomas Quiet,

94
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,160
enlarged pretty much and with some
warmth upon the doctrines of that apostil

95
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,320
speaking much in his praise.

96
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,730
I took upon me in a ludicrous manner to
impugn some of his charming. He's like,

97
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:01,400
oh, since this means a lot to
him, I'll just make fun of it.

98
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,500
Which by degrees put mister quiet in a
passion and he successfully upsets mister

99
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:10,260
quiet. He told me flatly that I
was damned without redemption. Ah,

100
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,230
really fun conversation.

101
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,730
I replied that I thought his name and
behavior were very incongruent and desired

102
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:20,810
him to change it with all speed
where it was very improper.

103
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:23,690
That's such an angry turbulent mortal
as he should be called by the name of

104
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:26,780
Thomas Quiet. Okay. This tells you
a lot about Alexander Hamilton.

105
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:29,810
He just as you'll hear, he doesn't
sound like it, really charming fellow,

106
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,430
but certainly that passage gives you a
sense of the sort of religiosity that

107
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:37,190
mark this particular period.
Okay.

108
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,220
So sometime later Hamilton met three men
from Pennsylvania and he decided he was

109
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:46,010
going to treat them to punch
in an off roads tavern.

110
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,930
Now to Hamilton is you'll hear clearly
these three men were not gentle men are

111
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:55,690
certainly, he assumed that they were
beneath him. Um, as he noted in his diary,

112
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,260
one of them seem to have to think really,

113
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:59,570
really hard about every word
that came out of his mouth.

114
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,610
One of them was fused in compliments
which were generally blunt and came out in

115
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:05,600
an awkward manner.

116
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,770
And the third one was a very
rough spun forward clownish blade,

117
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,260
much addicted to swearing
at the same time,

118
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:15,710
desire is to pass for a gentleman
not withstanding which ambition the

119
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,240
consciousness of his natural Boris and
Boris snus obliged him frequently to

120
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:22,910
frame.
Ill timed apologies for his misbehavior,

121
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,040
which he termed frankness and freeness.

122
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,260
It was often quote damn me
gentlemen and excuse me Y'all,

123
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:32,720
I am a plain honest fellow.
All is right down plain dealing by God.

124
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,870
So he manages to apologize and
swear in the same sentence,

125
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:38,330
which is pretty tricky.
Now that fellow,

126
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:42,950
what Hamilton refers to as the sort of
odd cursing fellow went onto curse Sir

127
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:46,790
Robert Walpole who was a recent British
prime minister as a rascal and is

128
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:50,540
Hamilton put it. We asked him his
reasons for cursing Sir Robert,

129
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,680
but he would give us no other than this
that he was certainly informed by some

130
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:57,050
very good gentlemen who
understood the thing. Right.

131
00:07:57,051 --> 00:08:01,070
Well that the said Sir Robert
was a damn rogue. So you must be,

132
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,430
well important gentleman
have told me he was.

133
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,070
He must be and I will
now quote it to anyone.

134
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:09,290
I meet at random taverns
by the side of the road.

135
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,690
So here you see three average people
try and clearly or at least to Hamilton,

136
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:17,540
try and clearly to impress
or please him in some way.

137
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,890
Clearly he is sort of snarky it feeling
as though he's above them in social

138
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:26,120
status is tavern companions feel a little
bit awkward there apologizing all the

139
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:28,100
time and saying,
well I'm just a plain speaker.

140
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,680
All of which Hamilton
clearly fines amusing.

141
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,990
And this anecdote suggest two things.

142
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,170
First it shows people of
different social ranks,

143
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:39,260
obviously socializing and show several,

144
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,670
well what Hamilton would've considered
common folk trying to in his mind pass

145
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:44,504
for gentlemen.

146
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,460
But second you see a group of people who
all perceive differences in status on

147
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,320
all sides.
So they're hanging out together,

148
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,080
but they also understand that
there's a little bit of a difference.

149
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:58,570
It's making them feel somewhat
awkward. Okay, so at another tavern,

150
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,570
Hamilton is going to ever get tavern,

151
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:03,210
I guess this portion of
the trip at another tavern,

152
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,380
he said he died with a very mixed company
of different nations and religions.

153
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,090
There were Scots, English, Dutch, Germans,
Irish, Roman Catholics, church man,

154
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:15,990
Presbyterians, Quakers, New Light man,
Methodist, seventh day men, Moravians,

155
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:20,580
Anabaptist and one Jew
counted that one guy.

156
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,170
So obviously here you see diversity,

157
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,770
great diversity of all kinds of
religious diversity, ethnic diversity.

158
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,420
Which also represents something that
was typical of the colonies in a general

159
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:37,080
way though more in some places than
in others. And actually Pennsylvania,

160
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:38,460
which is where I think
he is at this point,

161
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:43,200
was known at the time for being
particularly diverse. One last anecdote,

162
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,730
so at one point he even says he
ended up in a conversation with some

163
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:52,680
Pennsylvanians about how low Maryland
was in comparison with Pennsylvania,

164
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:55,890
which clearly was a much better
colony as Hamilton put it,

165
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,720
the Pennsylvania's enlarge upon the
immorality, drunkenness, rudeness,

166
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,950
and immoderate swearing. So much
practiced in Maryland and added that,

167
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:07,710
no such vices where to
be found in Pennsylvania.

168
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,260
I heard this and contradicted it.

169
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:13,740
Not because I knew that the first part
of the proposition was pretty true.

170
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,420
He's like, yeah, we are drunk and we do
swear a lot and were rude in Maryland, so,

171
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,010
okay.
I think that's true,

172
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,070
but what appeared most comical in their
criticism with they're making a merit of

173
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:28,710
the stoniness of the roads as one put it,

174
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,420
one may ride 50 miles in Maryland and
not see as many stones upon the roads.

175
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:36,510
That's 50 paces of roads in Pennsylvania.

176
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,760
This I knew to be false, but as I thought
there was no advantage in Stoney roads.

177
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,900
I let them take the honor of it to
themselves and did not contradict them.

178
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,690
Now to me, one of the interesting
things about this anecdote it,

179
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:52,740
it makes me think about almost a century
later when we're talking about de

180
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,320
Tocqueville and he's wandering around
America talking with random Americans.

181
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,160
And one of the things that drives him a
little bit nuts is that no matter what

182
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:01,190
American he talks to,
no matter where he is,

183
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,650
the American always tells him how
everything is best in America better than

184
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:05,790
anywhere else in the world.

185
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,600
So what Tocqueville is
witnessing in the middle of the,

186
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,270
towards the middle of the 19th
century is national pride.

187
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,390
And what you're seeing here is
a close equivalent equivalent,

188
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,100
but obviously it's colonial pride is
pride in your own individual colony.

189
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,680
And in a sense, again, it's a reminder
that people are seeing their colony,

190
00:11:23,681 --> 00:11:28,500
colonies, their country. So in all
of these little, these snapshots,

191
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:32,730
these anecdotes, we've seen a few
things about life in the colonies.

192
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,480
We've seen religiosity and the
impact of the great awakening.

193
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,180
We've seen diversity of all types.

194
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,480
Sometimes at one dinner table we've seen
a middling society and we've seen how

195
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,790
people saw their own colony
as their own country.

196
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,850
And in a sense other colonies is other
countries to varying degrees and all of

197
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:56,080
the colonies,
all of these things were characteristic.

198
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,860
So with that introduction,

199
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,550
I want to turn out to really look at
what was different about the American

200
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:06,460
colonies.
Why were people here different?

201
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:10,360
Why was life here different from what
it would've been like to be a British

202
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,830
subject back in England?

203
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,550
So that's going to be what I mainly
address for the rest of the lecture.

204
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,870
And I'm going to talk about it by
focusing on three different points.

205
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,580
Point number one,

206
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:25,630
I'm going to talk a little bit about the
distinctive character of the people who

207
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:27,040
migrated to the colonies.

208
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,930
It gives you such a sense of power when
you're lecturing and you say there are

209
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:36,550
three reasons and the entire room
goes, oh, free. There are three.

210
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,490
Uh, so there are three. Um,

211
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,070
so number one is the distinctive character
of the people who migrated to the

212
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:42,904
colonies.

213
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,860
Number two is the distinctive
conditions of life in British America.

214
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:50,020
And that, that point I'll
talk about for the longest.

215
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,670
And then number three is the nature
of British colonial administration.

216
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,563
And I'll repeat that.

217
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,840
The distinctive character of the
people who migrated to the colonies,

218
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,620
the distinctive conditions of life in
British North America and the nature of

219
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:04,510
British colonial administration.

220
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,280
So let's start off first by looking
at that first category of difference,

221
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:12,280
the character of the people
who migrated to the colonies.

222
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,960
And as you'll see in some ways a
distinctive kind of person migrated to the

223
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:20,170
colonies, or at least tended to in, in,
in ways that will make perfect sense.

224
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:24,790
So for one thing, and in a way this
sounds obvious, once you think about it,

225
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,840
people who migrated to the
colonies tended to be risk takers.

226
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,720
These were people who are
willing to take a risk.

227
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,050
They were willing to make the
hazardous passage across the sea,

228
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,510
put themselves at a
distance of several months,

229
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:41,320
travel from everything that
they knew and start life anew.

230
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,110
And what they assume to be
some kind of a wilderness.

231
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,880
There were people who wanted something
maybe to better their condition and they

232
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:52,210
weren't afraid to act on
that desire to reach for it.

233
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,650
Obviously these are people who are going
to be pretty independent and they were

234
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:59,620
often people who didn't
simply accept the status quo.

235
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,020
Now all of these are really big,
broad generalizations,

236
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,150
but as big as broad as they are,

237
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:07,570
you can see in a general sense that
people who are deciding to migrate in this

238
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:07,980
way,

239
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,930
it's certainly many of them would have
shared some of these characteristics to

240
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:15,160
some degree and as we're going
to see in the next few weeks,

241
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,970
in a general way, this spirit
ran through all of the colonies.

242
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,650
This sort of sense of really being
willing to push for what you wanted in the

243
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:24,430
old world.

244
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:29,430
Naturally enough things were more
tradition bound in the new world just by

245
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:31,090
deciding to go to the colonies.

246
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:34,900
You were already breaking with tradition
and behaving differently from the

247
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:36,520
average British subject.

248
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,100
So if you put this different sort of
person in a different kind of environment,

249
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,540
as in the colonies,

250
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,410
you begin to understand the slow creation
of something that ends up being a kind

251
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:50,650
of colonial American mindset or mentality.

252
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:56,030
And this brings us to my second
category of differences in the colonies,

253
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,020
which is the conditions of
life in British North America.

254
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,350
You have a different kind of person now
you're putting them in a different kind

255
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:04,400
of living situation.

256
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,850
And there were a number of things that
were different about living conditions in

257
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:11,810
the colonies. First, as
I mentioned last time,

258
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,580
more people on land in the
colonies there was a lot of land,

259
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,290
I mean empty land,
some of it actually empty land,

260
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:22,850
some of it land owned by Indians
that people considered to be empty,

261
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,170
but there was more land that was
certainly accessible to settlers in the

262
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:28,004
colonies.

263
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,430
So these risk take taking types who came
to the colonies could get land and set

264
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:37,040
up their own farms a lot more
easily than they could in England,

265
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,490
which gave more people a more independent
lifestyle in the colonies and a sense

266
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:46,970
that they could be and maybe we're raising
themselves up in the world in a way

267
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:50,360
that might not have been as
easy to do back in England.

268
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,930
A second difference in living
conditions involve voting and political

269
00:15:56,931 --> 00:16:01,250
participation because logically enough,
and generally speaking,

270
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,190
land holding in the
vote went hand in hand.

271
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:09,350
The idea being in the colonies that you
should only let people vote who were

272
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:11,450
really invested in a community.

273
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,740
And land holders holders are pretty
literally invested in their communities.

274
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,280
So in the colonies where you have a lot
of a much larger number of landholders,

275
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,120
you have a much wider franchise than
in England. So an example of that,

276
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,640
in the 1760s in England,

277
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,950
roughly 20% of white men had
the vote in the colonies.

278
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,610
Roughly 60 to 80% of white men had
the vote depending on the colony,

279
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,510
which is a pretty big difference.

280
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:47,110
And that one fact alone represents a
big shift in mindset and the colonies.

281
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,070
You had lots of landholders who knew
that they had the right to be directly

282
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:56,210
involved in the political process.
Equally important,

283
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,990
not only were more people able to
be active in the political process,

284
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,560
but the process in which they were
taking part was really localized.

285
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,800
So people felt able to
understand an effect.

286
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,860
That process a lot of times you knew,

287
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:14,570
or at least perhaps had met many of the
people that held government offices and

288
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:18,830
elections could be won or lost
by just a handful of votes. Now,

289
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,690
when I first taught this course,

290
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:23,180
that that always used to be
like an amazing fact. Wow.

291
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:26,150
And election could be lost by a handful
of votes and somehow in the last 10

292
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:30,560
years, that doesn't seem amazing
anymore. We do that all the time now.

293
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,720
I don't know why that happens.
Okay,

294
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:36,320
so I want to look for just a couple of
minutes at how voting actually worked in

295
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,440
the colonies. And it varies
from colony to colony. So again,

296
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:43,190
I'm talking in a general kind of
way here. Elections. First of all,

297
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:46,490
and this is generally true in all of
the colonies they had to take place over

298
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,950
the course of a few days because people
were often traveling from very far away

299
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:53,220
to get to a polling place.
And once they got there,

300
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:56,460
because it was such a big deal for
people to get to a polling place,

301
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,730
they generally discovered what in
essence was a kind of affair. I mean,

302
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,550
election day was big
sort of celebration day.

303
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,850
There are a lot of people milling about.
There was a lot happening,

304
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,530
there was a lot of alcohol.

305
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,060
The alcohol was provided by the
candidates here, you must vote for me.

306
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,653
I have another.

307
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,120
And the candidates can
would've been prison to helping
to poor and mingling with

308
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,130
prospective voters. Now a couple of years
ago, I mean I knew this fact for myself,

309
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:25,110
I hadn't ever sort of thought
about how it played out.

310
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,100
And then a couple of years ago I was
researching in the Virginia historical

311
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:30,870
society. I was of course
looking for something else.

312
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:34,710
But when I came across was a bunch of
documents that clearly involves some kind

313
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:39,270
of legal dispute that broke out because
of a problem on one of the election days

314
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,250
in Virginia. And apparently
what happened was, um,

315
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,580
the brother of one of the candidates
showed up with a pack of his friends,

316
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,870
drank a lot,

317
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,430
got really drunk and then stood at the
door of the polling place with guns and

318
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:57,390
threatened to shoot anyone who didn't
vote for the brother of a guy standing,

319
00:18:57,391 --> 00:19:00,630
you don't vote for my brother,
you die.

320
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,110
Strong persuasive component.
Um,

321
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,340
so obviously at least in that election
you had drinking, celebrating and guns,

322
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:10,410
which is a bad combination,
but,

323
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:15,411
but elections were really kind of rowdy
occasions now what that kind of hints of

324
00:19:15,631 --> 00:19:19,200
that sort of door persuasion is that
actually once you went into the polling

325
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,660
place, assuming that you
weren't shot first, um,

326
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,660
there were no secret ballots.

327
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,530
You actually step to the front of the
room and usually it was a table at the

328
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:30,930
table was sitting the candidates
and maybe some official,

329
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:32,340
perhaps like a local sheriff.

330
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,120
And you declared who you voted for in
front of everybody and in front of the

331
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:36,954
candidates.

332
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:42,110
So one example actually from a document
from the time period we're in Virginia

333
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,970
and one voter, uh, Mr. Blair came forward
to this table and the front of the room,

334
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,620
candidate on each side of the table,

335
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:53,220
the sheriff in the middle and the
sheriff says, Sir, who do you vote for?

336
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,200
And Mr. Blair says,
Mr. Marshall and Mr. Marshall responds,

337
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,150
your vote is appreciated, Mr. Player, it's
very personal exchange. The next voter,

338
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:06,900
I'm Mr. Buchanan is asked
the same question and he
says that he votes for Mister

339
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:09,780
Clapton and Mister Clapton responds,
Mr. Buchanan,

340
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,270
I shall treasure that vote in my memory.

341
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:17,100
It will be regarded as a feather in my
cap forever. That's such a politician.

342
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,950
He's like already you can hear.

343
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,080
So obviously this is a very personal
process and which certainly you could feel

344
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:26,700
some pressure to vote a certain way.

345
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:30,180
It's actually a surprisingly long period
of time before people figured out that

346
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:34,470
maybe ballots are great idea.
Maybe voting in person is not so good.

347
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,271
Okay,

348
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:41,271
so you've got more land holding in the
colonies leads to a broader franchise in

349
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:46,050
the colonies. You have voters
taking part in a very localized,

350
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:47,530
immediate political process.

351
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,080
Another significant difference in
colonial conditions of life connects with

352
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:56,890
something that I've mentioned briefly
on Thursday and that's the nature of the

353
00:20:56,891 --> 00:21:00,460
colonial social structure.
As I mentioned last week,

354
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,560
you did have an elite in the colonies,

355
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,060
but the proportions of elite and
laboring people's with was different.

356
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,740
In England, half of the population
roughly was of the laboring class.

357
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:14,830
People who did not own land
and labored for others,

358
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,030
and the other half of the population which
included small farmers and the gentry

359
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:23,590
and nobility owned most of
the land in the colonies.

360
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:28,240
Two thirds of the white men
owned land or businesses. Again,

361
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:30,850
which gives you a sense of why the
colonies are often known as a sort of

362
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:34,600
middling society.
Also in the colonies,

363
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:39,040
there wasn't such a stark contrast between
the top and the bottom of the social

364
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:39,874
spectrum.

365
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,620
So in England you had the royal court
who have courtiers and opulence and court

366
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:48,160
ritual and sort of cow to the king.

367
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,590
At the very top of the social spectrum.

368
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:53,170
Obviously the colonies did
not have something like that.

369
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,180
They did have royal
governors and certainly royal
governors lived in fine style

370
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,680
in comparison with others,

371
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,870
and there was certainly a distinction
between average people and gentlemen,

372
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:10,230
but the contrast between governors and
farmers was nowhere near the extreme

373
00:22:10,331 --> 00:22:15,331
contrast between a member of the
entrenched British nobility and a landless

374
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:18,280
commoner. So in America, the spectrum,

375
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:21,400
it's like the top of the bottom of that
spectrum have been sort of locked off

376
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,550
and what's in between is
a little bit more pliable,

377
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,770
so more landholding, broader franchise
and everything that that entails,

378
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,870
more of a middling society and now yet
another colonial difference that I hinted

379
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:36,790
about at the start of today's lecture.

380
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:41,920
The fact that several generations of
colonists had lived and died in the

381
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:46,330
colonies having never been to
England by the mid 18th century,

382
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:51,630
you had a colonial society full of people
who often had no actual personal tie

383
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,190
to England except an emotional tie.

384
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:56,470
And I talked about those
emotional ties last week.

385
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,320
So just think about this comparison,

386
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:05,190
the length of time between
the first settlement at
Jamestown and the declaration

387
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:09,310
of independence is roughly the same
as the length of time between the

388
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:13,400
declaration of independence
and World War II. Okay. We,

389
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:16,990
we tend to collapse all of early America
into one big blob of early America.

390
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,790
And we assume it's a
kind of a small blurb.

391
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,730
But if you think about that declaration
of independence to World War II,

392
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,040
Jamestown to the
declaration of independence,

393
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,370
we are talking about a
broad expanse of time.

394
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,313
So these people,

395
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,590
or at least many of them are truly
British Americans at this point

396
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,900
because we're also not
Britain's and yet another way,

397
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:41,590
another distinctive feature of
colonial society. And that's again,

398
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:43,780
something I referred to at the beginning.

399
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:49,170
And that's the great ethnic and religious
diversity as our friend Mr. Hamilton,

400
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:55,010
or Dr. Hamilton was noting
there were immigrants from
Germany, Scotland, Ireland,

401
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:57,050
there were Quakers,
they were Roman Catholics,

402
00:23:57,051 --> 00:23:59,810
congregationalists and then
later on Methodist and baptist.

403
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,550
So generally speaking,

404
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,110
it's a reasonably pluralistic society
with a relatively high tolerance for

405
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,810
diversity.
Though new Englanders in some ways,

406
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,870
particularly in early colonial times,
are a little bit less tolerant

407
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:18,380
related to this diversity is yet another
colonial distinction and that's the

408
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:22,370
religiosity in the colonies, which is
really heightened by the great awakening,

409
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:27,770
which was roughly from the 17 thirty's
to the 1760s now I've said that,

410
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:29,390
but what I really want to also point out,

411
00:24:29,391 --> 00:24:34,010
I'm not saying that the great awakening
is a purely colonial phenomenon because

412
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:35,660
it isn't and as a matter of fact,

413
00:24:35,661 --> 00:24:38,840
it's spread to the colonies
from England and from Ireland,

414
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,880
but it's impact on the colonies would
be different when you combined it with

415
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:46,910
some of the other things that
were distinctive about colonials.

416
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,900
Society in life is, I'm talking
about here now. We can have it.

417
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:53,750
We can have a little Yale moment here.
I'm always looking for Gayle moments.

418
00:24:53,751 --> 00:24:58,751
It's a little Yale moment because Jonathan
Edwards is someone of importance in

419
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:00,860
the spread of the great awakening.

420
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,330
His preaching really sparked the New
England branch of the great awakening.

421
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,780
Edwards preached that God was Raffle,

422
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,330
that endless torture awaited the sinner,

423
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,400
but God was also loving and wanted
sinners to convert and turn towards God's

424
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:17,090
love.

425
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:21,710
And most important you could choose
heaven or hell depending on whether you

426
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:26,690
chose to repent. And I can't resist.
Whenever I get to this part of the course,

427
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,010
I can't resist offering a little snippet
of one of Edwards' most famous sermons,

428
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,320
which is sinners in the
hands of an angry God.

429
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:38,321
How many of you have read a good number
of you have read as a great sermon?

430
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,270
1741 I,

431
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:44,360
I can't resist giving you your own great
awakening moment because that means I

432
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:48,260
get to actually be Edwards for a little
bit in order for you, the wrath of God.

433
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,500
So, um, I will offer you a tiny
snippet from Edwards sermon.

434
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,110
I think it's different when you
hear it from when you read it.

435
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,760
The God that holds you over the pit of
hell much is one holds a spider or some

436
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:01,821
loads,

437
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:06,821
some insect over the fire of whores you
and just dreadfully provoked his wrath

438
00:26:08,061 --> 00:26:10,040
towards you.
Burns like fire.

439
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,360
He looks upon you as worthy of nothing
else but to be cast into the fire.

440
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:18,920
He is a pure eyes than to
bear to have you in his sight.

441
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,370
You are 10,000 times more
abominable in his eyes.

442
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,060
Then the most hateful
venomous serpent is in ours.

443
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,260
You have offended him
infinitely more than ever.

444
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,260
A stubborn rebel did his prints and yet
it is nothing but his hand that holds

445
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:38,540
you from falling into
the fire every moment.

446
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:44,100
It is to be a scribe to nothing else that
you did not go to hill the last night,

447
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,060
that you were suffered too awake again
in this world after you closed your eyes

448
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:50,820
to sleep and there was no
other reason to be given.

449
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:55,620
Why you have not dropped into hill since
you were rose this morning and that

450
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:58,260
God's but that God's hand has held you up.

451
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:02,790
There is no other reason to be given
while you have not gone to hell since you

452
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:06,000
have set here,
oh center,

453
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,520
consider the fearful danger you are in.

454
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:13,790
You hang by a slender thread with the
flames of divine wrath flashing about it.

455
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,610
Ready every moment to singe
it and burn it asunder.

456
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,720
And you'll have no interest in any
mediator and nothing to lay hold up,

457
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:26,610
save yourself, nothing to keep off the
flames of wrath, nothing of your own,

458
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,410
nothing that you have ever done,

459
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:33,030
nothing that you can do to induce
God to spare you one moment,

460
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:37,560
I think, wow, that's sermonizing.
That's like pow in your face urbanizing.

461
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,790
So that kind of is the core
of the great awakening, right?

462
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:46,791
This belief in the sinfulness
and helplessness of
humankind and the possibility

463
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:48,210
of redemption.

464
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:53,510
If you individually make the choice
and repent and as suggested by Edward

465
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:54,330
sermon,

466
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:59,040
they were often some tearful emotional
conversions at the big camp meetings that

467
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:00,480
took place at this time.

468
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,270
And I actually have an eyewitness
account of a camp meeting,

469
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,160
which I offer you partly
because as you'll see,

470
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:08,300
there's an aspect of it which I
consider truly ridiculous, but it's,

471
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,980
it's offered by Benjamin Franklin,
which I also think is interesting.

472
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:14,730
And you'll see the enlightenment and the
great awakening come up right against

473
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:16,530
each other in this little passage.

474
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:21,990
Franklin actually is in Pennsylvania and
he says he sees Whitefield preaching to

475
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,150
a crowd as he describes it.

476
00:28:24,151 --> 00:28:27,720
In 1739 arrived among us from Ireland,

477
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,410
the Reverend Mr Whitefield,
who had made himself remarkable.

478
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,910
There is an itinerate preacher.

479
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,420
He was at first per minute to
preach and some of our churches,

480
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,040
but the clergy taking a dislike to him
soon refused him their pulpits and he was

481
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,750
obliged to preach in the fields.

482
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,250
The multitudes of all sex
and denominations that
attended his sermons were

483
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:51,690
enormous and it was a matter
of speculation to me who
was a vet. Number two,

484
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:56,610
observe the extraordinary influence of
his oratory on his hearers and how much

485
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:59,760
they admired and respected him.
Not withstanding his comment,

486
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:02,970
abuse of them by assuring them that
they were naturally half beast and half

487
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:06,360
devils being among the crowd,

488
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:09,630
being among the hind most of the crowd.
So he's towards the back of the crowd.

489
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,990
I had the curiosity to learn how far he
could be heard by retiring backwards.

490
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:16,470
Okay,
so now Franklin says,

491
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:20,550
I wonder how far I could back away
and still hear him preaching clearly.

492
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,100
Clearly at this moment, he's not
really thinking about the message.

493
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:28,630
So I backed away towards the river and I
found his voice distinct till I came to

494
00:29:28,631 --> 00:29:31,350
your front street when some
noise on the street obscured it,

495
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,830
and at this point you can really hear
that the sort of enlightenment come

496
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:36,540
banging up against the great awakening,

497
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:42,410
imagining then a semicircle of which my
distance should be the radius that it

498
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,540
was filled with auditors to each
of whom I allowed two square feet.

499
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:52,650
I computed that he might well be heard
by more than 30,000 this reconciled me to

500
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:57,250
the newspaper accounts of
his having preached to 25,000
people in the fields and

501
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,810
to the histories of generals,

502
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:01,720
haranguing whole armies of
which I had sometimes doubted.

503
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,080
So he computes out radios and area.
Wow.

504
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,680
We could actually be preaching
to 30,000 people now that said,

505
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:13,180
Franklin says by the end of the sermon
when clearly there was a collection plate

506
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,110
that was going to be passed around,
Franklin said, I first silently resolved.

507
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:21,700
He should get nothing from me. I had
in my pocket a handful of copper money,

508
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,140
three or four silver dollars and
five gold pieces. As he proceeded,

509
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:29,020
I began to soften and
concluded to give the copper.

510
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,670
Another stroke of his oratory made me
ashamed of that and determined me to give

511
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:34,504
the silver.

512
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,320
And he finished so admirably that I
emptied my whole pocket into the dish,

513
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,850
the gold and all.

514
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:44,470
So even Franklin sort of has to admire
and ultimately contributed to what's

515
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:45,304
going on there.

516
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:50,050
So even this sort of true man of the
enlightenment found himself affected by

517
00:30:50,051 --> 00:30:52,330
this oratory.
Okay.

518
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:57,331
So what was the impact of such great
awakening sentiment in the colonies?

519
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,810
Well, in part, given the distinctive
state of affairs and the colonies,

520
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:09,970
it's suggested to people that they had
the personal ability to change their

521
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:12,310
lives through their own freewill.

522
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,880
It was personally empowering and in that
sense it was sort of a democratizing

523
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:18,550
force.

524
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:22,630
I almost hesitated when I was writing
this to use the word democratizing cause I

525
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,430
didn't want to be.
And as I mentioned on that first day,

526
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:28,120
you put the democracy word out there
and all kinds of lights go off.

527
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:29,650
But I just couldn't
think of a better word.

528
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:34,651
So democratizing all stick with also
the great awakening preached spiritual

529
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:37,630
equality and included women,

530
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:40,420
African Americans and the poor
and the power of making choices.

531
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:44,140
Though the impact of that as we'll
see might not have been so great.

532
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,880
Plus,

533
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:51,090
it was an anti authoritarian force led
by Unorthodox preachers and people not

534
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:54,520
attached to an established church.

535
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,660
So we have here a mix of individualism
and personal empowerment and throw in

536
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,640
emotional sort of righteousness.

537
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:08,290
That's a really kind of a heady mixture
of feelings and ideas that would

538
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:12,610
eventually help to encourage a real
spirit of political resistance.

539
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,400
Okay. I'm going to mention a few more
basic things about colonial life that were

540
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:20,950
different from England very quickly.
First,

541
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:26,790
the realities of living on a frontier
which not only fostered a sense of

542
00:32:27,101 --> 00:32:29,530
independence but also
a sense of community,

543
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,180
partly in a defensive way because of
fears about Indians and because of the

544
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:39,181
difficulties of forging a homestead or
creating a community of more positive

545
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:44,741
side colonist generally had healthier
living conditions than in England.

546
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,850
Food was plentiful.

547
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,930
There were plenty of open spaces and you
can actually see this concretely when

548
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:55,220
you look at the average size of an
English man and an English woman and a

549
00:32:55,221 --> 00:33:00,050
colonial man, a colonial woman towards
the term, the middle of the 18th century.

550
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,860
Basically the average size
of an Englishman in the
middle of the 18th century

551
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:07,040
was five foot six and the,
this made me happy.

552
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:10,310
The average size of an English woman
was five feet, which is basically me.

553
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,760
It makes me so happy to think there's
a time when I was average height,

554
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,830
I feel so tall.
Um,

555
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,920
however colonial men and women on average
tended to be a couple of inches taller

556
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,460
so you could see plentiful
food wide open spaces.

557
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,790
Actually people are healthier and bigger,
which was true also among soldiers.

558
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:31,250
As a matter of fact, which was
interesting. You could see it.

559
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,610
This brings us to the third major
category of things that contributed to the

560
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:41,360
difference differences in being
a British American colonists.

561
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,280
So we've had the type
of person who migrated.

562
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:46,580
We just had a whole bunch of
living conditions in the colonies.

563
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,260
This is the third category,

564
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:52,190
which is the nature of the British
administration of the colonies,

565
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,400
which as I mentioned last
week was kind of light handed.

566
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:00,140
So colonial government and society could
develop in ways that Britain might not

567
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:02,840
necessarily have desired
or even recognized.

568
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:09,190
One of the most striking effect of this
lack of imperial control was the power

569
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:14,030
of the typical colonial
legislature left alone.

570
00:34:14,031 --> 00:34:18,920
The colonists developed strong
legislatures which often were full of very

571
00:34:18,921 --> 00:34:23,570
contentious individuals who felt
entitled and compelled to fight for their

572
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:27,320
rights. For what I discussed last
week, their English liberties.

573
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:32,750
Some of these colonial legislatures were
so strong that they often one battles

574
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:37,751
against royal governors battles that were
not taken much note of by the crown at

575
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:42,830
the time because the crown
wasn't administering to the
colonies very closely and

576
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:47,831
in fact by the 1760s most of the colonies
had in place all of the conditions

577
00:34:50,211 --> 00:34:53,540
necessary to be self governing states.

578
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,320
They had elective assemblies and other
institutions of local government with and

579
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:03,800
these institutions had broad powers over
the internal affairs of the colonies.

580
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:08,420
They had a reservoir of political
leaders drawn from the elite.

581
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,970
And colonist recognized and we're jealous
of their power of self government and

582
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:17,300
we're not shy about fighting
royal officials for this power.

583
00:35:17,301 --> 00:35:21,410
So by the 1760s there's a lot of things
in place for these colonies in a sense

584
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,960
to be self governing,
although obviously they are not already.

585
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,630
So in summary,
what does all of this add up to?

586
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,060
What do I mean when I refer to
being a British American? Well,

587
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,380
we've talked about a tradition of
voicing opinions and grievances.

588
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,910
We've talked about a sense of
entitlement to owning property and land.

589
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,860
We've talked about assumptions about
active participation in the political

590
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:50,694
process.

591
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,170
We've talked about a willingness to take
risks and fight for what you wanted.

592
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,810
We've talked about an independent spirit
and jealousy about your independence

593
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:06,120
and we've talked about relative tolerance
of ethnic and religious diversity.

594
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,560
You can hear this sort of
mixture of things in a comment
by a British officer in

595
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:18,450
the colonies during the French and
Indian war and he observed and wrote back

596
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:23,130
home just the nature of this people to
do all in their power to pull down every

597
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:27,000
legal authority. There is no
law prevailing at present here.

598
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,950
That's a little bit of an
exaggeration I would say,

599
00:36:28,951 --> 00:36:32,820
but it's another arrogant British quote.
I promise you.

600
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:33,990
Lots of Eric and British quotes.

601
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,410
There is no law prevailing at
present here that I have met with,

602
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,650
but the rule every man pleases
to lay down to himself.

603
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:45,900
Every man insists upon following the
dictates of his own will without control.

604
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,280
A little bit of an exaggeration,

605
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:51,540
but you can see certainly what he feels
like he's seeing as compared with what

606
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:53,010
he knows from back in England

607
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:59,690
or as a member of the Massachusetts
legislature put it are people who are not

608
00:36:59,971 --> 00:37:03,420
calculated to be kept in
any particular service.

609
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,470
They seem go troublesome,
an uneasy by reflecting upon their folly,

610
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,791
by bringing in,

611
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:12,540
bringing themselves into
a state of subjection when
they might've continued free

612
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:17,110
and independent. Now that sounds
like a sort of wonderful, you know,

613
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,950
thing impressive, admirable
like, oh our people are,

614
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,240
they like to be independent and if they
commit to something, they're not happy,

615
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,010
but that committee because they think,
wow, I could've been free and independent.

616
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:26,843
What have I done?

617
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:30,510
The problem with that is try putting a
bunch of those people into an army and

618
00:37:30,511 --> 00:37:33,360
then expecting them to stay in
it for a long period of time.

619
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,680
George Washington was not a happy camper
for part a good part of the revolution

620
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:42,681
because he was stuck with a lot of
soldiers who had that point of view like,

621
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:44,820
well, I'll do this for a little
while and then I'll leave.

622
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,170
So it's kind of hard to command
that kind of an army is, we'll see.

623
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,910
And I guess I can't say I'm proud to
say. Um, Connecticut was a problem.

624
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:57,660
Connecticut as we'll see, Connecticut
head issues. Rhode Island too,

625
00:37:57,661 --> 00:37:59,490
I think I mentioned that in the
first lecture, but Connecticut,

626
00:37:59,491 --> 00:38:02,970
two soldiers particularly had
problems wanting to stick around,

627
00:38:02,971 --> 00:38:04,530
but that was a general problem as well.

628
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:08,190
This sort of spirit of independence
and I've done what I wanted to do.

629
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,420
I'm going to now do something different.

630
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,640
So we've looked at being
a British colonist,

631
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,110
we've looked at being a British American.

632
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,150
The next step that we're going to be
taking on Thursday is going to be looking

633
00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:25,470
at intercolonial relations, looking at
how the colonies felt about each other,

634
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:29,340
looking at how the colonies
interacted with each other,

635
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,440
how they felt about each other,

636
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:36,560
what their sense was of any kind of
cooperation or union between these sort of

637
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:40,690
colony states.
And by the end of Thursday's lecture,

638
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,550
we're going to see the first glimmers
of tension with the passage of the stamp

639
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:49,090
act. So by the end of the next lecture,
you can see why when I mentioned in that,

640
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,060
in that first lecture that
there was someone in when
I first taught this course,

641
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:54,280
who raised his hand probably at
the end of this lecture and said,

642
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:57,860
where are all the dates? Right? We've had
two lectures without a lot of dates. Um,

643
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:58,960
but the stamp app,

644
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:03,040
we have an actual concrete thing coming
on Thursday and then actual events of

645
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,310
the revolution.
Um,

646
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:09,080
but hopefully with these three lectures
you have some kind of a sense of,

647
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:14,081
of the sort of foundation of where we're
working from as we're now going to show

648
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:17,890
people basically getting upset,
working themselves,

649
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,660
a logic of resistance and
then acting on that logic. Um,

650
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,900
I think it's important obviously to
understand where the colonists were coming

651
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:30,340
from before you plunge right into seeing
them rebelling against what they've had

652
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:34,060
and for something else. But I think
certainly in these two first lectures,

653
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:39,360
you do get a sense of some of the ways
in which the colonies were prepared to

654
00:39:40,871 --> 00:39:45,871
resist or maybe be predisposed to resist
and some of the reasons why it took

655
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:50,230
actually as you'll see a pretty long
time for the colonists to decide to

656
00:39:50,231 --> 00:39:53,500
actually rebel.
Then it took a while.

657
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:57,790
People sort of let go finger by
finger of the British empire.

658
00:39:57,791 --> 00:40:01,270
They let go piece by piece until finally
they felt that there was no alternative

659
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:05,950
except a revolution. I will end
there. I will see you on Thursday.

660
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,570
Um,
if you have questions,

661
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:12,700
come up and see me now at the end of
class or email them to me and I will see

662
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,390
you on Thursday.
