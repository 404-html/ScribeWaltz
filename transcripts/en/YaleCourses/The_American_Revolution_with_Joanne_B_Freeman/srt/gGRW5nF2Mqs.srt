1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,063
Tuesday,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:08,150
we ended with the angry response in the
colonies to the passage of the stamp

3
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:12,270
act.
1765 I talked about,

4
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:14,250
I described Patrick Henry.
We had a first,

5
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:15,960
our famous revolution moment number one,

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,350
Patrick Henry speaking out in
the Virginia House of Burgesses,

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,240
talking about what he dramatically
called his colonies, dying liberty.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,220
And at the very end of the lecture,

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,940
I mentioned that in May of 1765,

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,280
the Virginia House of burgesses
past some protesting resolutions,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,750
ultimately known as the Virginia resolves,
I think I said resolutions on Tuesday,

12
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:40,950
and let's stick with resolves.

13
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:45,930
The Virginia resolves and the Virginia
resolves said there were a number of

14
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:48,330
different obviously resolves
and the Virginia Resolve.

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,660
They said that the colonists had come
to Virginia with equal rights to all

16
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:58,650
British subjects.
That the colonial charter confirmed that,

17
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,790
that Virginia is had the right to be
governed by their own legislature and that

18
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:08,460
the Virginia legislature
had never forfeited.

19
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,260
It's right to impose taxes
on the colony of Virginia.

20
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:17,790
I'll repeat that again. Um, the
Virginia resolves May, 1765,

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,660
Collin has had come to Virginia with
equal rights to all British subjects.

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,490
Colonial charters confirm that Virginians
had the right to be governed by their

23
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:31,491
own colonial legislature and the
Virginia colonial legislature had not

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,720
forfeited. It's right to impose
taxes on the colony of Virginia.

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,780
Now, how's it burgesses passes
these resolutions. But in Virginia,

26
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,410
they weren't even published in
the local newspaper. However,

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,910
they were published in Rhode Island.
Okay. I really don't make this up.

28
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,730
Like I feel like you're going gonna you're
going to accuse me of planting Rhode

29
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,700
Island randomly throughout this
course and I'm not. It's really,

30
00:01:56,701 --> 00:02:00,780
it's there all by itself. Um,
Rhode Island. And why Rhode Island,

31
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:04,530
I can't tell you, but indeed by
happenstance, someone in Rhode Island,

32
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:06,300
it circulates the,
resolves a circulating.

33
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:08,040
People are reading them and
they're talking about them,

34
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,720
but it's somebody in Rhode Island who
publishes the Virginia resolves in a Rhode

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,980
Island newspaper.
However,

36
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:18,981
what this person does when he publishes
these results is not only publish the

37
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:21,480
ones that were actually passed,

38
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,490
but there are two additional results that
get published right alongside the ones

39
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:27,990
that were passed.
Um,

40
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,680
these were not passed and possibly
weren't really even discussed,

41
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,530
and they're more radical
than the other resolutions,

42
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,470
but they're put right alongside
with no differentiation.

43
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:41,640
And these two unpassed
more radical resolutions,

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,020
say quote,
His Majesty's Leach people,

45
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,620
inhabitants of this colony are not
bound to yield obedience to any law or

46
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:57,180
ordinance whatsoever designed to
impose any taxation upon them. Okay?

47
00:02:57,181 --> 00:03:01,390
That's a much bolder statement than
what I just said was happening in those

48
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,320
Virginia resolves.

49
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,060
And then this sort of more radical
unpassed resolution number two that got

50
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:12,061
published said that anyone who asserted
that anyone except the Virginia Assembly

51
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:17,680
could directly tax Virginia was quote,
an enemy of this,

52
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:21,280
His Majesty's colony. Okay? Those
are two really strong statements.

53
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,910
The Virginia House of Burgesses did
not pass. Those did not resolve those,

54
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:28,300
but they get published in Rhode Island
right alongside the ones that were passed

55
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:31,990
and resolved. And so they go
circulating throughout the colonies.

56
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,980
Making Virginia look a lot more radical
than it was at that particular moment.

57
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,020
So news of this sort of
new radical version of the
Virginia resolves get spread

58
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:45,880
throughout the colonies and colonies are
then inspired to pass resolves of their

59
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:49,060
own. So it's an, it's an out of
Rhode Island moment. However,

60
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,390
it is Massachusetts that first
suggests United colonial action.

61
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,140
So in June, uh, 1765,

62
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,450
the Massachusetts Assembly sins,

63
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,340
a circular letter to all of the colonial
assemblies and a circular letter is

64
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,820
kind of what it sounds like.

65
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:10,330
A letter intended to circulate to
all of the colonial assemblies,

66
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,600
inviting them to meet in a congress in
New York in October of 1765 quote to

67
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:21,360
consider,
have a general and United dutiful,

68
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,460
loyal and humble representation of
their condition to his majesty and the

69
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:30,760
parliament, and to implore relief.
Okay, so it's a United response,

70
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:34,030
but it's also beautiful, loyal
and humble. So on the one hand,

71
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:36,820
the fact that there's going to be some
kind of a United colonial statement is

72
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:41,500
interesting and forceful, but on
the other hand, due to full, loyal,

73
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:44,950
humble, we're not, we're not this, we're
not near declaring independence here.

74
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,270
We're just kind of imploring relief,
making a statement that, excuse us,

75
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,870
we are your humble and obedient
subjects and we don't really like this.

76
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:55,180
Thank you very much. So it's,
it's that kind of a statement.

77
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,160
Nine colonies responded,
New Hampshire declined to participate.

78
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,481
Virginia,

79
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:05,410
North Carolina and Georgia couldn't
participate because their governors didn't

80
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:09,220
convene their assemblies to
elect delegates. So there
were no delegates elected.

81
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,661
But all in all,

82
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:15,661
there were 27 men who took part in
what came to be known as the Stamp Act.

83
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:19,000
Congress. Right? Easy enough to
remember the Stamp Act Congress,

84
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,220
which meant for much of October
in 1765 okay. The Stamp Act,

85
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:26,440
Congress,
the Stamp Act.

86
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:31,441
Congress was actually the first of what
we're going to see is a series of extra

87
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:36,481
legal organizations created outside of
the regular colonial political system to

88
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:42,580
resist and reform British policies.
Okay.

89
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,610
So it's it's a significant action on the
part of the colonies and ultimately the

90
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:49,151
stamp act.

91
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:53,710
Congress passed a series of declarations
and they kind of echo some of the

92
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:56,680
resolutions and declarations that had
been circulating and they're going to

93
00:05:56,681 --> 00:06:01,010
sound not drastically different from
some of the logic that I've been talking

94
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:05,600
about in the last lecture or two and
I'll just mention four of the resolutions

95
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,040
passed by the Stamp Act Congress.

96
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,630
They declared that they owe their
allegiance to the crown like any British

97
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:12,464
subject.

98
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,700
They declared that they were entitled to
the Rights and liberties of any British

99
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:19,814
subject.

100
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,580
They said that British subjects in the
colonies could not be taxed without their

101
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:30,581
consent and they declared that trial
by jury was the right of every British

102
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,190
subject in the colony. So
you can see they're really
their statement saying, well,

103
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:36,860
you know where British subjects like
any other British subjects and were

104
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:40,160
demanding the rights and liberties
of other British subjects.

105
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,540
Now it's important to note the resolutions
are not saying that parliament had no

106
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:49,970
right to regulate trade in the colonies.

107
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,780
They're just saying that parliament
cannot directly tax the colonies without

108
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:57,710
their consent. So again, it's, it's a
direct statement. It's a strong statement,

109
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:02,450
but it's a respectful statement and
it's not boldly sort of altering,

110
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,750
at least in the minds of the colonists
and enormous change of policy.

111
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:08,390
They're kind of stating what they
think the state of things is.

112
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,540
So clearly the stamp that Congress
is a step towards colonial unity,

113
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:19,300
it's a significant step. Now actually
I want to add at this point, um,

114
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,430
the answer to a question that someone
asked at the end of class on Tuesday that

115
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,650
he's working over there. I think that was
yes, uni, it was a really good question.

116
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,150
I answer questions and then I
actually answered them in class. Um,

117
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:32,360
it was a really good question.
And the question was, um,

118
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,980
did anyone in parliament actually
oppose the stamp act? And if they did,

119
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,740
what was the logic?
It's actually a really good question.

120
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,750
And although I knew the answer was yes,

121
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,850
I couldn't tell you very
much detail about that. Yes.

122
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,570
So I went and did a little research.
Um, and it's interesting. Um,

123
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,380
most members of parliament
assumed that the stamp act was,

124
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,570
I suppose you could say constitutional
or that it was, you know,

125
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:57,530
above board proper that there was nothing
wrong with it as far as procedurally

126
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,350
and most members of parliament assume
that the colonists would agree it's

127
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,740
constitutional above board.

128
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:07,250
There's nothing wrong with it as
far as the fact that it exists.

129
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,170
The stamp act is perfectly proper. Some
members of parliament, and not a lot,

130
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,200
but some did admit that maybe parliament
was treading on dangerous ground,

131
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,550
but even these people didn't worry about
the stamp act on constitutional grounds.

132
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:25,190
They didn't say, wow, I wonder
if we have the right to do this.

133
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:30,140
Rather they worry that maybe the colonists
were going to be unhappy because the

134
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:34,190
stamp act may be would seem too
burdensome or they worried that maybe the

135
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:37,040
colonists would think this was some
kind of an aggressive display of

136
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,210
parliamentary power.

137
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,250
But members of parliament were
actually not worried about this.

138
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:46,730
Seeming as though it's something
that wasn't proper, wasn't allowable,

139
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:50,900
wasn't supposed to be done within the
confines of the British imperial system.

140
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:53,990
So basically what you're seeing here
is sort of a version of what I've been

141
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,520
saying in a variety of different
ways so far in this course,

142
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,440
I've been talking about
different mindsets,

143
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:02,100
developing and both sides sort of not
necessarily understanding that there are

144
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:03,840
different mindsets evolving here.

145
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,470
What you're seeing here is basically
members of parliament just fundamentally

146
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:11,520
not seeing that the colonists had
developed a different understanding of the

147
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:16,170
workings of the British imperial system
and those members who were worried about

148
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:20,730
the act, they were worried about it being
unpopular or maybe seeming too strong,

149
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:25,731
but they were not worried about any larger
sort of legal rationale as one member

150
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,870
put it.
I thought this was kind of a neat quote.

151
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,320
We are working in the dark and
the less we do, the better.

152
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,960
I know that's a great quote because it's
basically a member of parliament saying,

153
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:35,460
I'm not entirely sure,

154
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,610
like we don't really know what we're
doing and we don't really know how they're

155
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,450
gonna respond.

156
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,540
So we actually need to be careful with
what we're doing because we just don't

157
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,970
know what the response is going to be.
They're not gonna, they may not like it.

158
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,291
They actually,

159
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:51,150
it was only one member of parliament
who was a planter in the West indies.

160
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,950
One Guy who predicted,

161
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,180
I think the stamp act is going to produce
discord and confusion in the colonies.

162
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,680
Right. One guy. So probably afterwards
he was the guy saying, yeah,

163
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,190
told you you should have listened to me.
I told you I knew.

164
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,560
Okay.
So that's the answer to that question.

165
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:10,350
It's a really good question because I
had just never looked that up in any

166
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:11,400
detail before.
Okay.

167
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:16,430
So so far we've largely been talking
about speechifying paper pushing resolves

168
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:21,390
declarations,
newspaper announcements.

169
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,750
But in Boston we're now about to see some
physical resistance because there some

170
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:30,480
radicals decided no more words action.

171
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,290
And these Boston radicals is,
you're about to see,

172
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,340
they deployed a long held
colonial tradition of resistance.

173
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,920
They basically planned a mob action.

174
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,970
Now it's important to note that mobs
in early America weren't sort of wild,

175
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:48,670
violent, out of control. You know,

176
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,140
all kind of actions in a way that we're
sort of part of the political system.

177
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,750
Something that people were supposed
to do when they felt outraged. I mean,

178
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:00,240
it was sort of a way of
venting popular protest,

179
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,170
and usually early American
mobs were pretty conservative.

180
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,370
They were usually focused on protecting
the good of the community from things

181
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:11,910
like unfairly high food prices
are illegal business practices.

182
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,630
Normally they weren't really
excited about tearing things down.

183
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,180
Normally they involve some
marching and some yelling.

184
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:20,850
There was a lot of effigy burning
and then people went home.

185
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,500
So early American mobs again,
are almost kind of procedural.

186
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:29,010
This sort of what happens when you're
upset and you're a member of the public

187
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,210
and it's not only sort of average members
of the public is not only the masses

188
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,640
taking part in these kinds of protests.

189
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,150
All levels of society might take
part at one time or another.

190
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:45,410
So in the summer of 1765 some
Bostonian's decided they're going to take

191
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:47,040
advantage of this tradition,

192
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,710
a group of Boston radicals who eventually
call themselves the sons of liberty.

193
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,680
So here's yet another.

194
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,530
Now we're starting to get to the part of
the course where these things come out

195
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:58,210
of my mouth. And you're like,
Ding, Ding, Ding, Ding, ding,

196
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:01,990
revolutionary war moment sounds of
liberty. We had the master camera,

197
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:03,430
we're gonna have another one by
the end of the lecture today,

198
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,680
but here's one sons of liberty,
Boston.

199
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,870
So these radicals decide they're going
to take action and the sons of liberty,

200
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:15,640
basically our artisans and shopkeepers
who want to act in resistance to the

201
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:20,050
stamp act. Samuel Adams, who's
really more a member of the elite,

202
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,070
but he nevertheless was kind of a champion
of the artist class and he's among

203
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:24,904
their number two.

204
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,230
So let's look for a moment what the
sons of liberty decide to do and how it

205
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:30,041
works out.
Okay,

206
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:35,041
so basically in Boston at the time
there were two really large fraternal

207
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:38,440
organizations of artisans.
There was one in the north end of Boston,

208
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:42,430
there was one in the south end of Boston.
And the sons of liberty think, well,

209
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:46,450
you know, you have these sort of
organized groups like clubs of artisans.

210
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,110
Why don't we enlist the aid of one of
them? They're sort of already organized.

211
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,470
They already have a leader.
Maybe we could get them to help us.

212
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:55,900
It's some sort of organized
protest against the Stamp Act.

213
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,650
So they appealed to the south end group
who agrees to take part in some kind of

214
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:05,770
a protest.
So now we have this radical group,

215
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:08,590
the sons of liberty who have named
themselves and they're organized enough to

216
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:09,424
have names.

217
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,700
We have an organized force of men and we
have a focus desire to protest against

218
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:16,780
an act of parliament.

219
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,780
So this is on its way to being a different
kind of early American mob action

220
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,520
than these other ones might
have been. Okay. So in Boston,

221
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,850
the poor guy who is the stamp agent,

222
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,820
the stamp distributor
is named Andrew Oliver.

223
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,020
This is the person that you do not want
to be at this particular moment. Okay.

224
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:42,370
So Andrew Oliver is the one who's going
to be giving out or selling the stamps.

225
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:46,150
So obviously this group of men, they want
to do a mob action. They decide, okay,

226
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,310
Oliver is the target. So first they
go to his dock, side warehouse.

227
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:54,100
They assume actually that that's where
the stamped paper is going to be.

228
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,340
So they just destroy the warehouse.
I mean like destroy it.

229
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,910
Then they go to Oliver's house and throw
rocks and basically break all of the

230
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:04,534
windows.

231
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,040
Then they take an effigy of
Oliver and they stamp on it. Okay.

232
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,950
That's not my point. And that's actually
their foot, right? The stab back.

233
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,650
We're still paying all of her hug lackey,

234
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:19,180
early Americans with their wild sense
of humor. Um, bad puns of early America.

235
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:22,780
That's the first of these courts.
So they stamp on Andrew Oliver.

236
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,360
Oliver responds logically enough
by resigning as stamp distributor,

237
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,470
which I think was a wise move. Okay.
You think that, thank you very much.

238
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:37,030
I'm going home to my broken window
house now. No more stands for me. Okay.

239
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,580
Not long after that.
Maybe within two weeks,

240
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,080
that same group of men turn on
Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson,

241
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,330
who seemed like a friend to the stamp act.

242
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,950
This time the mob goes to his
house and they destroy it,

243
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,890
and I don't just mean rocks at windows,
they go to Hutchinson's house,

244
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,690
they smashed the windows, they break in
the doors, they smashed the furniture,

245
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,920
they cut the paintings,
they trashed the clothing.

246
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:09,110
They cut down the trees in his garden
and they were in the process of removing

247
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:13,280
the roof when daylight stopped them. Okay,

248
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:15,860
so this is on the one hand, it's sort
of a weird mob. They're like, you know,

249
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:18,290
excuse me, can you pass me that hammer?
I've got to remove the shingle. You know,

250
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,050
they're really like they're
industrious mob action,

251
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:23,390
but they're literally
completely tearing apart.

252
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,490
Hutchinson's pretty sort of
spiffy mansion in protest.

253
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,360
Um, attacks on stamp distributors
and other colonies followed.

254
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:36,950
And there were a lots of resignations
of staff agents. I'm not doing the job.

255
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,030
Thanks. I love my house. I
don't want to do this anymore.

256
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:47,020
So the result of all of this
kind of action is that by
November of 1765 when the

257
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:51,980
stamp act is actually going to
go into effect. So first of all,

258
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,710
the act actually hasn't
gone into effect yet.

259
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,700
Everything I've talked about is leading
up to it actually going into effect.

260
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,000
So November, 1765, it's
due to go into effect,

261
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:05,480
but people aren't quite sure what to do.
Do we ignore it?

262
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,570
Are there actually any stamp agents left?

263
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,620
Maybe you don't have to ignore it
because nobody will sell stamped paper.

264
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:16,340
I don't know. And some people did
just choose to ignore the act.

265
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,590
Others went further and decided to
boycott British goods, which has,

266
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:25,220
we're going to see further into this
course with sometimes a really effective

267
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:26,720
way to protest against the mother.

268
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:30,860
Country basically hit economically
and that's bound debt make an impact.

269
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,590
But in the middle of all this,

270
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,150
Grandville ministry fell not
because of the stamp act,

271
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:40,490
but because of insider politics.

272
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,200
The colonists saw this as
providential Greenville's gone.

273
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,850
Clearly it's assigned from providence
that we are meant to succeed here to come

274
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:53,240
out of this looking better than things
were when we were in the middle of it.

275
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,200
The new prime minister is
the Earl of Rockingham.

276
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,140
Now the Earl of Rockingham had strong
connections with London merchants.

277
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,530
London merchants clearly are people
who are going to be deeply effected by

278
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:11,450
colonial boycotting,
so they want the stamp act repealed.

279
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,780
So we've got this new prime minister,
the Earl of Rockingham.

280
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:17,330
He's in with the merchants who
are being hurt by the boy cut.

281
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,890
The idea now is it would be a fine thing
if we could figure out a way to repeal

282
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:22,461
the stamp act,

283
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:26,210
but the problem of course is figuring
out how to repeal it without seeming weak

284
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,450
while holding your
ground and rocking them.

285
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:34,451
Eventually did repeal the stamp act
in March of 1766 but to save face,

286
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,980
he assigned blame to the
wounded British economy.

287
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:42,860
He did not say anything about
colonial rights. He said, well,

288
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,070
the economy's suffering and so
we will repeal the stamp act.

289
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,180
He also passed at the same
time the declaratory act,

290
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,890
the declaratory act,

291
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,370
which declared in short that parliament
could pass laws for the colonies quote

292
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,290
in all cases whatsoever,

293
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,880
gave the declaratory act of 1766 really
strong statement. It's like, yeah,

294
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:08,250
we're going to repeal the stamp act,

295
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,650
but we're going to pass this
other act that says, you know, no,

296
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:15,651
we could basically pass laws for you
however we want to pass them so we're not

297
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:16,591
caving.

298
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:21,591
We're just sort of giving it on this
one little point now to Britain.

299
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,590
The Declaratory Act asserted
their control over the colonies.

300
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:30,591
They're legal control over the colonies
in all cases to the colonists because it

301
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,540
mentioned legislation but not taxes.

302
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,960
It seemed to suggest that maybe they had
made their point that parliament is not

303
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:41,910
going to assert taxation.
So in a way,

304
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:44,610
the declaratory act makes things worse.

305
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:48,270
It worsens ongoing misunderstandings
between parliament and the colonies.

306
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,340
The British not fully understanding the
colonial mindset about the workings of

307
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,174
the empire,

308
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,500
the colonists not viewing their own
logic as exceptional in any way.

309
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:00,300
They assume that their
logic has been understood.

310
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,840
The declaratory act also didn't really
encourage compromise because if you think

311
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:10,860
about it, moderates on all sides
were discredited. In England,

312
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,980
the Declaratory Act asserted
parliamentary power.

313
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,040
So it's a strong statement
of power in the colonies.

314
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,000
Radicals rule the day because it seemed
as though they'd made their point.

315
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,900
So as far as the colonies were concerned,

316
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,060
the stamp act crisis move many
to accept radical leadership,

317
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:31,140
it appears to be working.

318
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,810
It also revealed to the colonies the
power of uniting the colonies to bring

319
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:41,070
pressure against England, which
also seemed to have worked. Now,

320
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:44,970
once again in the middle of all this,
the prime minister yet again is replaced.

321
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:47,280
Clearly this is not the time to
be a prime minister in England.

322
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,310
It's kind of a rocky
time going on. So, um,

323
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,460
rocky time was not meant to be upon the
early of Rockingham goes down in this

324
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:57,150
rocky time. Um, and Charles. Yeah. And I
heard a Groan. I didn't do it on purpose.

325
00:19:57,151 --> 00:19:58,860
It just sort of happened.
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:01,970
It's a bad plan that I take
full responsibility for it. Um,

327
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,350
but they are only rocking him.
His ministry falls.

328
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,740
Charles Townsend takes his place.

329
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,470
Charles Townson the new prime minister
and he's given the task of balancing the

330
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:17,790
budget in 1767 and like
Granville before him.

331
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Townson first looks to England itself
and issues new taxes in England.

332
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,211
But again,

333
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:29,211
he still needs more income and he does
next turn to the colonies and he devises

334
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:33,660
a scheme that he thinks isn't going to
be too upsetting to these sort of touchy

335
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:38,280
colonials. He says he's going to proceed
quote with great delicacy, right?

336
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:41,880
Cause it's clear now they get
upset over there. I get upset.

337
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:44,520
We need to be careful.
I'm going to proceed with great delicacy.

338
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,370
He understands their sensitivity
by this whole issue of taxation.

339
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,800
So he decides he's going to ask for
customs duties on items that the colonies

340
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,210
import from Britain like glass,
silk,

341
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,460
paper, paint, and t. You can see,
you can see where we're going.

342
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,420
Um, but this is not an internal
tax. This is an external tax.

343
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:09,220
It's not a tax on things
within the colonies.

344
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:14,050
It's not a tax on legal documents is
not a tax on PA playing cards like the

345
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,820
Stamp Act.
It's an external tax.

346
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:20,821
It's customs duties and light before
Townson wants the money raised by this to

347
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:26,290
go to pay for royal administration in
the colony. So also the money raised,

348
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,770
isn't it? Going back to England, it's
going to be spent on the colonies.

349
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,010
Townson also reorganized the
custom service in the colonies,

350
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,960
basically tossing out old customs
agents who had been bought by colonial

351
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:44,560
merchants and putting
handpicked men in their place.

352
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:50,040
So all in all towns and thought surely
these are tame enough measures that the

353
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:54,220
colonists aren't going to object to
them at the scenes as though they're

354
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:57,520
accommodating. They're mild, nothing
very dramatic being done here.

355
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:03,180
These come to be known as the towns
and acts of 1767 and sure enough,

356
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:09,631
the initial response to the
Townson x is relatively weak,

357
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:16,410
but colonial anger is raised yet again
by a publication by a colonist named John

358
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,480
Dickinson.

359
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,040
He's a Pennsylvania and
he's in Pennsylvania and he
writes a series of letters.

360
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:28,720
First they appear in a Pennsylvania
newspaper there eventually published in

361
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:30,100
other colonial newspapers.

362
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,100
And then finally they're put
together and published in a pamphlet.

363
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:38,020
This is all in 1767 and the pamphlet
is named letters from a farmer in

364
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:40,960
Pennsylvania to the inhabitants
of the British colonies.

365
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:45,010
They have very literal titles and these
days is one of them, John Dickinson,

366
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,970
Pennsylvanian letters from a farmer in
Pennsylvania to the inhabitants of the

367
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:53,470
British colonies. Now Degas, and
actually when you read these,

368
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:58,471
he's pretty moderate in tone and most of
what he does is he uses past precedent

369
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:04,861
to argue against the right of
parliament to directly tax the colonies.

370
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,130
He asserts directly,
we're not talking about independence,

371
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:12,730
we're just talking about past
precedent. However, he also says,

372
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:17,440
and this is a quote from him,
we cannot be happy without being free.

373
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,610
We cannot be free without
being secure in our property.

374
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,990
We cannot be secure in our
property if without our consent,

375
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,360
others may as by right,
take it away.

376
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,210
The tax is imposed on us by parliament. Do
this, take it away. That's really clear.

377
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:37,390
Direct logic, right? We can't
be happy without being free.

378
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:39,460
We can't be free without
being secure in our property.

379
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,980
We can't be secure in our
property without our consent.

380
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:44,770
Others may take it away and
parliament seems to be taking it away.

381
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,350
So Dickinson isn't arguing
anything amazingly new here,

382
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,980
but he's certainly stating it
with real clarity and real power.

383
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,440
And he also appears to be
saying, well, you know,

384
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:56,870
some of that stuff we learned
from that whole stamp act thing.

385
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,100
I think they apply as well to
this new towns and to act thing.

386
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,140
He appears to be drawing a pattern.

387
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,550
So letters from a farmer in
Pennsylvania ultimately has an impact.

388
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:11,510
It's a strong statement up in Boston.

389
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,790
There was also some writing
going on and there Samuel Adams,

390
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:22,090
who was in the Massachusetts Assembly
wrote a circular letter that he sent to

391
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,890
other colonies,
yet again another circular letter.

392
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,380
And this time it's a circular letter
protesting against the Townson Act.

393
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,430
And it's moderate,
but it's criticizing the ax.

394
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,550
It does deny.
It's where this isn't about independence.

395
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:38,990
We're not trying to rebel here,

396
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,200
but it does urge joint colonial
resistance to the towns and acts.

397
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,560
Now, back in England, many people urged
a lenient response to this. I mean it's,

398
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,870
it's, if you think about it potentially,
it's a scary thing. You have this guy,

399
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:58,010
this radical guy in Boston whose urging
joint colonial resistance to an act of

400
00:24:58,011 --> 00:25:01,430
parliament. So, um, as you will see,
some people get rather upset by this,

401
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:06,290
but not everybody. Some people say,
well, okay, let's not overreach, respond.

402
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:10,010
Let's not overreact. However,
the British Secretary of state,

403
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:15,011
Lord Hillsborough really saw this as
organized resistance and refuse to stand

404
00:25:16,311 --> 00:25:17,144
for it.

405
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:22,220
So in 1768 privately
consulting with the Kings,

406
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:23,930
so kind of doing this off on the side,

407
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,570
he instructed the governor
of Massachusetts to
dissolve the Massachusetts

408
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:32,000
Assembly unless they took back the letter.

409
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:37,730
He also sent a letter to all royal
governors telling them to ignore the

410
00:25:37,731 --> 00:25:42,680
Massachusetts letter or else he would
dissolve their legislatures to. Okay,

411
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:45,800
that's it. There's a strong statement
for you that's clearly bound to make.

412
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:47,540
Collin is get very,
very upset.

413
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:52,340
Hillsborough also knowing that
people are going to get upset,

414
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:57,710
urged General Thomas Gauge who's commander
in chief of the army and at the time

415
00:25:57,831 --> 00:25:58,940
was posted in New York,

416
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,820
he urges gauge in New York to prepare
his troops in case they're needed in

417
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:08,480
Boston. Okay, so he's anticipating
there might be a response.

418
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,870
It would be nice to have troops
potentially ready to go to Boston.

419
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,590
So now troops are being organized.

420
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,330
There's threats about dissolving
assemblies and communication between the

421
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:24,080
colonies in the form of a circular
letter is being discouraged.

422
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,830
So clearly if you're a colonist at this
point there appears to be a plan of

423
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:32,600
repression, right? It plan, there
seems to be a system of tyranny.

424
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,220
There seems to be some kind of
organized attack on colonial liberties.

425
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,930
And I'm emphasizing plan and system and
organized because next week that's the

426
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:43,350
direction we're going to
be going with the lectures.

427
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:47,250
We're going to be looking at what I call
the logic of resistance or how does all

428
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:50,580
of this add up in the minds
of the colonists? What's
what, what are they drawing,

429
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:53,550
what conclusions are they drawing
based on actions that are happening.

430
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:57,510
And as we'll see in the lectures and
in the readings for next week, um,

431
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,200
there's a lot of conclusions being
drawn about an actual system of tyranny,

432
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:03,270
which is a very 18th century
way of kind of looking at it.

433
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,940
So colonists are wondering if there is
a sort of system of repression being put

434
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:11,160
in place.
Meanwhile,

435
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,700
parliament eventually in 1770 repeals
most of the towns of debts but does

436
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:21,960
preserve the tax on tea,
partly for revenue.

437
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,960
And partly to prove that they still have
the right to tax the colonies. So we're,

438
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:29,010
we're half seeing revenue raising
and half seeing an argument here,

439
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,650
and probably there was an assumption on
the part of parliament that by repealing

440
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:38,880
most of the acts, things would
quiet down. But as events in Boston,

441
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:41,490
we're about to prove this
would not be the case.

442
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,420
As we're about to see between 1768 and
1774 Boston really ends up taking center

443
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:55,641
stage and thanks in part to the
actions of Samuel Adams who really is,

444
00:27:55,921 --> 00:28:00,921
you'll see today a brilliant propagandist
and a man with a really fierce sense

445
00:28:01,411 --> 00:28:05,490
of his rights, his British rights and
his grievances as an English subject.

446
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,510
And I will add that Samuel Adams
did brew beer. He actually is.

447
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,360
Samuel Adams is associated with beer.
So truth in advertising who?

448
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,560
I have no idea.
That's an accurate portrait of Sam Adams.

449
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,770
Sam Adams is too ugly. Oh, poor Sam Adams.

450
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,120
I feel very bad now.
Oh well he's not attractive,

451
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:28,020
but I don't know what he's ugly.

452
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:31,650
I feel I feel bad and I'm going to
have to find a way to redeem Sam Adams.

453
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,020
Thank you very much.

454
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,190
No wonder I didn't think it was entirely
an accurate portrait of Samuel. Okay.

455
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,570
And yet he is associated with
beer. Okay. Um, so Sam Adams,

456
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:47,571
he's going to have a moment October of
1768 troops actually arrive in Boston at

457
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:54,780
the instigation of Massachusetts
Royal Governor Francis Bernard,

458
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,100
who's alarmed at this sort of
radical rumblings that he's hearing

459
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,320
parliament makes things
worse by in December of 1768
by proposing that the ring

460
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:10,530
leaders behind that circular letter
that seems like organized resistance,

461
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,280
that they should be brought to trial
for treason and using an obscure law.

462
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:19,650
They say that they should be brought
to trial for treason in England.

463
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,040
They should go to trial
in England. Okay. Again,

464
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:26,220
not something that's going to make call
and it's really happy. Not surprisingly,

465
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:31,221
when you have the next election for
the assembly in Massachusetts in 1769,

466
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:37,190
a large number of radicals get voted in
and this new assembly passes logically

467
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:43,990
enough radical resolutions. Again,
largely the work of Samuel Adams.

468
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,450
The, sadly not good
looking. Samuel Adams, um,

469
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:52,990
who declared in these resolutions that
no man can be justly taxed by or bound

470
00:29:55,871 --> 00:30:00,871
and conscience to obey any law which he
has not given his consent in person or

471
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:04,120
by his representative. Okay. That's a,

472
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,880
that's a stronger statement
than the ones we've had before.

473
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,020
What he's saying here,
formerly like other colonial assemblies,

474
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,260
the Massachusetts Assembly with saying,
well, parliament can legislate for us,

475
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:17,440
but they can't directly
attacks us without our consent.

476
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:22,441
But this statement says parliament can't
legislate for us if we have no say in

477
00:30:23,261 --> 00:30:26,200
the process. Bang. That's
a very strong statement.

478
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,050
So clearly there's a lot of,
um,

479
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,630
emotions that has been raised about what
the British administration is doing.

480
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:37,300
It's being vented in
radical resolves like that.

481
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:43,110
The arrival of troops in Boston in 1768
ended up really focusing these feelings

482
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:48,550
of grievance, these, this
anger, they sort of passions.

483
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:53,410
You have troops being sent to Boston at
a moment where people are angry at the

484
00:30:53,411 --> 00:30:54,940
British,
surely enough,

485
00:30:54,941 --> 00:30:58,630
you can see that the columns are going
to vent their feelings towards the

486
00:30:58,631 --> 00:31:01,480
soldiers troops being sent to Boston.

487
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:06,580
Increase colonial assumptions that
they are being treated as second class

488
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:07,031
citizens,

489
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:11,500
as lower class subjects as people who
are not equal to other British subjects

490
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:12,400
within the empire.

491
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:17,200
And Samuel Adams said this really clearly
in a newspaper article written at the

492
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:18,850
time he wrote,

493
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,880
it is well known from the first landing
of the troops that the truth behavior

494
00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:25,630
was to a great degree,

495
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,660
insolent and such as looked as if they
really believed that we were a country of

496
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:35,960
rebels and that they were sent
here to subdue us. Right? Again.

497
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:39,460
Now Adam's is propagandizing so he's
always saying things with a sort of extra

498
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:42,310
twist. But what he's saying is it was
very clear that when the troops arrived,

499
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,390
they were treating us like lowly rebels
and that they were sent here to subdue

500
00:31:46,391 --> 00:31:49,780
us. Okay. So given all of these feelings,

501
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:54,070
fears about a tyrannical standing army
vets and saw that sort of system of

502
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:54,904
tyranny,

503
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,930
it makes sense that when these troops
arrive in Boston relations are not going

504
00:31:58,931 --> 00:32:01,960
to be good between people in
Boston and soldiers in Boston,

505
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:06,820
which brings us to get another sort of
bell ringing revolutionary war moment.

506
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,050
Um,

507
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,550
a particularly note worthy active
resistance in Boston later memorialized by

508
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:16,600
clever colonial propagandists
as the Boston massacre, right?

509
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,050
That's how we know it today. They gave
it, Collins gave it that name. It's, it's,

510
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,600
it's a snappy name, right? We kept
that name. We liked that name.

511
00:32:22,601 --> 00:32:25,060
It really has some zing.
Makes a political point.

512
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,500
So let's look for a minute here at
the details of the Boston massacre,

513
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,670
partly because they're really interesting.
As you'll see,

514
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:35,320
it's just a really interesting incident.

515
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:39,710
But also because I think if you look at
how the colonists and the soldiers are

516
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:40,544
interacting,

517
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,810
it really will reveal something about
the dynamic of colonial British relations

518
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,840
at the time.
Now first off,

519
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,080
it's important to understand that the
Boston massacre wasn't this little

520
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:56,110
isolated moment of conflict
between soldiers and citizens
between 1768 and early

521
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:03,890
17, 70 tensions were building
between the colonists and the troops.

522
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,280
And in early 1770,
there actually were a number,

523
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:12,310
several different outbursts of hostility
between townspeople and soldiers in

524
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:17,540
Boston.
So an example on March 2nd Samuel Gray,

525
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:21,560
a rope maker asked to passing
soldier if he wanted a job.

526
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,770
And when the soldier who was
probably underpaid said, yeah,

527
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:28,070
actually I could use as a second
job. Gray laughed and said, good,

528
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,820
go clean my outhouse.
This did not make the soldier happy.

529
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,260
So the soldiers slugged grey and
grey hit back and other people,

530
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:38,780
soldiers ran out and other Collin,
it's ran over and there was a fight.

531
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,840
There was a street fight.
A few days later,

532
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:47,350
March 5th another fight broke out when
another civilian said something insulting

533
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:51,740
to another soldier and they began
punching each other and there was another

534
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:56,770
street fight and that would be the first
in a series of increasingly agitated

535
00:33:57,411 --> 00:34:02,360
clashes on that day. March 5th,
1770 that's going to end in gunfire.

536
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,980
But obviously the, the Boston massacre
is not the first moment of conflict.

537
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,360
Now later that evening, there's a
series of little outbursts. That day,

538
00:34:11,361 --> 00:34:13,280
March 5th later that evening,

539
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,230
a small boy walking out on the street
began taunting a soldier and the soldier

540
00:34:18,231 --> 00:34:22,220
responded by knocking him
down. Well, the boy got up,

541
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,533
went off,

542
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:27,650
found some other colonists in the street
and complained that a soldier over

543
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:29,840
their head knocked him down.
Okay,

544
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:32,630
so in this environment that's going to
really get a lot of colon, it's upset.

545
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:37,100
So a little ring of people surrounds
the kid like he's knocking down a kid,

546
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,840
we need to go get the soldiers,
right.

547
00:34:38,841 --> 00:34:43,160
So a small group of colonists heads off
to the barracks to actually a cost the

548
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:45,620
soldiers,
but they're held off by guards.

549
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Soon thereafter someone begins ringing
the bell of the Boston Meeting House.

550
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:54,740
And normally when you ring the
bell of the Boston Meeting House,

551
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,850
that's a signal for fire and is a
serious thing in a place full of wooden

552
00:34:58,851 --> 00:35:01,760
buildings, right? So if the bell
is ringing, that means, oh my God,

553
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:05,690
there's a fire and everyone does what
they should do. When there's an alarm,

554
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:08,570
a fire, right? The, the bell goes off
and doesn't, it doesn't. It doesn't.

555
00:35:08,571 --> 00:35:11,330
Some people run into the street
thinking that there's a fire.

556
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,770
Now from this point we have several
accounts are a number of cans about what

557
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:18,260
happened.
Some of them conflict.

558
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,810
And we're going to be looking
at two accounts today.

559
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,080
We're going to be looking at one
by British General Thomas Gauge.

560
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,500
I mentioned before, the commander in
chief of the British army in America,

561
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,150
he's posted in New York,

562
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,860
but he had gotten a very detailed report
about what happened in Boston from his

563
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:38,400
soldiers, his officers and men on
exactly what they think they experienced,

564
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:42,630
and then the other account is by
Samuel Adams. Radical propagandists.

565
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,750
Clearly it's going to be a very
different point of view. Okay,

566
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:50,751
so gage sends a very detailed report to
a member of the king's cabinet in London

567
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,890
based on what the British
soldiers in Boston told him,

568
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,860
assuming that the colonists in general
were insolent and we're pushing to get

569
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:05,100
more than they deserved.
Gage says in his statement,

570
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:07,470
he suspects that the entire
thing was deliberate.

571
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,250
He thinks that there is some colonists
who probably prearranged what happened.

572
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,690
Arm themselves with sticks, rocks, bricks
and snowballs. I'm sorry if it snowballs.

573
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:18,840
Just never sounds like a scary weapon to
me. Even though bad things happen here,

574
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:22,410
and I know I would not like to be hit with
a snowball, but it's not like a brick.

575
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,770
But that snowballs or
everyone's complaining about
snowballs and these accounts,

576
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:29,130
you'll see somehow it just makes it
seem less serious. I don't know why,

577
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:32,540
but anyway, he thinks it's deliberate.
He thinks the colon is prearranged.

578
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,410
Did that they arm themselves with sticks,
rocks,

579
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:39,000
bricks and snowballs planned the ringing
of the bell so that Bostonian's would

580
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:42,030
rise up at the signal and
attack the soldiers. Okay,

581
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:44,490
so this is what gauge assumes,
and here's gauges account.

582
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,340
Many people came out of their houses
supposing a fire in the town and several

583
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,820
officers on the same supposition
we're repairing to their posts,

584
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:57,180
but meeting with mobs were reviled,
attacked,

585
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,380
and those who could not escape knocked
down and treated with great in humanity.

586
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,560
Right? Those crude, nasty colonists
are treating the soldiers very badly.

587
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,680
Different mobs paraded
through the streets,

588
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,250
passing the several barracks and
provoking the soldiers to come out.

589
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:16,050
One body went to the main guard where
every provocation was given without effect

590
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:20,730
for the guard remained quiet from thence.
The mob proceeded to a sentinel,

591
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,930
a single sentinel posted upon the custom
house at a small distance from the

592
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:26,700
guard and attacked him.

593
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,240
He defended himself as well as he
could calling out for help. Okay.

594
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:33,120
There's like one guy according to
this account and like the mob attacks,

595
00:37:33,121 --> 00:37:37,470
the one guy standing in front of the
Customs House and people ran to the guard

596
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,170
to give information of his danger.
So according to gauge,

597
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:42,480
people see this one guy getting
attacked by a bunch of people in.

598
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:45,900
They actually colonists run to get
other soldiers to help the one guy.

599
00:37:45,901 --> 00:37:49,200
So according to gauge his account,
they're not all crazy radicals in Boston.

600
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,730
Some of them are out there helping us.

601
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,860
Captain Preston hearing the sentinel
was in danger of being murdered already.

602
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,110
We got to murder really fast.

603
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:03,150
He detached a sergeant and
12 men to relieve him and
soon after followed himself

604
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:07,740
to prevent any rash act on the
part of the troops. This party,

605
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:12,210
as well as the sentinel was immediately
attacked. Some colonists throwing bricks,

606
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:16,410
stones, pieces of ice and snowballs.
Once again, the snowballs at them,

607
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,580
whilst others advanced up to their band
nets and endeavored to close with them

608
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:25,110
to use their bludgeons and clubs calling
out to them to fire if they dared and

609
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:28,620
provoking them in the most
appropriate language. Right? Again,

610
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,630
rude colonists behaving badly,
so we have a group of soldiers,

611
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:37,000
they're lined up in front of the customs
house running to protect a fellow

612
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:41,830
soldier supposedly being murdered at
the hands of a crude and angry mob armed

613
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:44,950
with sticks and rocks and snowballs.
Okay,

614
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,840
let's segue over to Adams.

615
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,330
Adams writes a series of newspaper essays
for the Boston Gazette describing the

616
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,230
same incident,

617
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,700
often quoting testimony from the trial
of the soldiers that obviously it takes

618
00:38:57,701 --> 00:38:58,930
place after this incident,

619
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:04,360
but also obviously quoting
them and telling the story
with his own radical flare.

620
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:08,740
Now remember here the different
reasons for these accounts,

621
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,830
and this is actually a great example
of the importance of thinking about the

622
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:13,600
nature of historical evidence,

623
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,640
who things are written to and why they're
written has a lot to do with how you

624
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:19,510
interpret them,
right?

625
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:23,200
You have these two documents being written
for really specific reasons to a very

626
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:24,040
specific audience.

627
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:29,041
So gauge is trying to explain to royal
authorities a shooting that never should

628
00:39:29,751 --> 00:39:32,470
have happened.
He has to somehow justify this.

629
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:36,610
So he's appealing to the people he
sent the letter to whoever this world

630
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:39,640
authority was and he has to assume that
other world authorities are going to see

631
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:44,050
it. He's appealing to them
as fellow sophisticated
Englishman who understand the

632
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:48,160
nature of things out in this
sort of frontier, colony area,

633
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,220
crude colonists,
upset colonists.

634
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,970
So in a sense gauge is offering sort
of an extreme version of some typical

635
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:58,210
English sentiment among
about the colonies.

636
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:04,320
Adams is riding to the colonial public
and he's trying to raise a public outcry

637
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,750
against the soldiers and obviously
by association against the British

638
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,710
administration.

639
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,370
And clearly Adams is going to want it
to pick these soldiers as cruel and

640
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:16,450
tyrannical as all standing armies are.
So when it sentence Adams,

641
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:20,020
it's certainly going to be offering
an extreme version of some colonial

642
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,630
sentiment at the time
about the soldiers and,

643
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:25,420
and maybe about the British
administration generally. Okay,

644
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:28,630
so here is Adam's version. From the
moment when the bell starts to ring,

645
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,630
the ringing of the bells alarm,

646
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:34,660
the town it being supposed by the
people in general, there was a fire.

647
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,880
As the people came into the street,

648
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:41,230
the boy who had been knocked down told
them that the century had knocked him

649
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:44,470
down. Okay. And I'm actually quoting,
so this you can't blame me for this.

650
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,580
The boy says century knocked me down,
points at the soldier and says,

651
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:53,050
there is the son of a bitch that
knocked me down. I love that.

652
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,730
That detail is in the newspaper.

653
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,130
And that's another one of those things
that like they said that in 1770 they did.

654
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:04,840
Um, other people heard
this and cried, kill him.

655
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,630
The century ran to the custom house,

656
00:41:10,631 --> 00:41:13,660
steps knocked at the door but
could not get in. Excuse me,

657
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,753
they're going to kill me.

658
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,870
He primed and loaded his gun and leveled
it and told the people to stand off and

659
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:21,070
call to the main guard.

660
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,240
Various where the dispositions and
inclinations of the people at this point,

661
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,330
the cooler sort advise to go home.
The curious,

662
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:31,870
we're willing to stay and see the event
and those whose feelings were warmer,

663
00:41:31,871 --> 00:41:35,330
perhaps partook of the boys resentment.
And here he's trying to justify like,

664
00:41:35,331 --> 00:41:36,800
okay,
there was some crazy radical guys,

665
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:40,160
but they were probably upset with the
boy, right? They weren't really angry.

666
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:42,650
They were just, of course they'd
be upset. The boy was attacked.

667
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:48,680
The soldiers moved to help the
century standing alone before the mob,

668
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:51,860
Adam said the soldiers moved
quote with a hottie air.

669
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,280
They push their band nets and dammed
the people as they went along.

670
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,690
And when they arrived at their post,

671
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:00,590
one witness who is a young gentlemen
of a liberal education and an unspotted

672
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:01,424
character

673
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,910
declared that one of the soldiers whom
he particularly named loaded his gun,

674
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,380
pushed him with his band and
damned him. Ooh, okay. So here,

675
00:42:12,381 --> 00:42:13,220
according to Adams,

676
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,540
there's this route imperious British
soldier treating the young gentleman of a

677
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:22,310
liberal education and unspotted
character, like a lesser being. Okay,

678
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:25,310
so now both narrators have
gotten us to the same point.

679
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:26,390
We have soldiers lined up,

680
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:30,050
they've just very visibly loaded their
guns in front of them stands British.

681
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:33,950
Captain Preston with WHO's in command
of the men and in front of Preston is an

682
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:37,490
angry crowd.
So according to gauge at this point,

683
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:40,910
Preston soldiers behind him,
crowd in front of him, he's,

684
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,850
he's trying to calm the situation
down and supposedly he's asked,

685
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:49,070
are you going to ask those soldiers to
fire on us and presences? Yeah. See,

686
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:54,350
the guns are behind me and
you're in front of me. No, really

687
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,610
wouldn't be a good idea for them to fire
now because I'll die, right? He's like,

688
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:02,900
no, it's a good point, I think.
But all he could say had no effect.

689
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:07,880
And one of the soldiers
receiving a violent blow
instantly fired captain Preston

690
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:10,700
turned round to see who fired
and received a blow upon his arm,

691
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:11,840
which was aimed at his head.

692
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:15,680
And the mob at first seeing no execution
done and imagining the soldiers had

693
00:43:15,681 --> 00:43:17,450
only fired powder to frighten them,

694
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,820
grew more bold and attacked
with greater violence,

695
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:21,800
continually striking at the soldiers.

696
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:25,070
He didn't get their guns and pelting
them and calling out to them to fire.

697
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,730
And we have captain Preston,
his description of what
he heard from the crowd.

698
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,120
He says the crowd was yelling, come
on you rascals. Bloody backs, lobster,

699
00:43:33,121 --> 00:43:37,520
scoundrels, great little string
of insults. Fire. If you dare,

700
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,060
you dare not fire. Okay, so gauge goes on.

701
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:44,360
The soldiers at length perceiving their
lives in danger and hearing the word

702
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:48,590
fire all around them. Three or four of
them fired one after another. And again,

703
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:50,480
three more in the hurry and confusion.

704
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:55,160
Four or five persons were unfortunately
killed, unfortunately and more wounded.

705
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:59,870
Okay, so that's basically the end of
gauges account. Clearly in his account,

706
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:03,590
the soldiers are under serious attack.
Adam's tells a different story. Adam says,

707
00:44:03,591 --> 00:44:05,690
yes,
the crowd was yelling at the troops,

708
00:44:05,691 --> 00:44:10,460
but they had insulted the crowd and
loaded their guns. Yes, they had sticks,

709
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,730
but everybody was carrying sticks these
days because everyone was scared of the

710
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:17,330
soldiers. So everyone naturally walked
around in the streets with sticks. Now.

711
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,270
Maybe that's true. Which tells you
a lot about the streets of Boston,

712
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:24,650
or maybe it's not, in which
case it's really creative.
Yes, the crowd, he hit it,

713
00:44:24,651 --> 00:44:26,870
the soldiers guns,
but they were trying to push them away.

714
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,300
So Adam said it's not an uncontrolled mob.

715
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,490
It's actually a group of people
carrying their normal everyday sticks

716
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,270
pushing in to here.

717
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,000
Captain Preston answered the question
about whether or not he was going to order

718
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:41,310
the troops to fire at this moment.
Adam says,

719
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,080
one of the soldiers was hit by a stick,

720
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,430
staggered fired his gun at the crowd upon
which several soldiers fired and says

721
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:51,030
Adams, they reloaded their guns.
They were gonna fire again.

722
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:52,950
Some of the crowd moved away.

723
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:56,490
One man went up to a soldier and asked
him to his face if he was going to fire.

724
00:44:56,491 --> 00:44:59,640
And supposedly the soldier
said yes by the eternal God,

725
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:01,680
at which point the
colonist knocked him down.

726
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,860
I love all the detail at this point,

727
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,760
press and called out to his men not to
fire and they stopped. And here Adam says,

728
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:12,480
I am no soldier and never desired to
be one. But I appeal to those who are,

729
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:17,040
whether the words don't fire our
words of command and the British army,

730
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:18,060
one of,

731
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:21,960
there's not some other word which soldiers
are taught to understand more proper

732
00:45:21,961 --> 00:45:24,960
to be given on such an occasion,
which would have prevented such Rashma.

733
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:28,500
So here he's saying the guy didn't
even call out like cease fire. He said,

734
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:32,370
don't stop. Great. Thank
you Captain Preston.

735
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,860
And then Adam's describes
the people who died.

736
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,050
He makes special note
of the fact that gray,

737
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:41,760
the rope maker who insulted the century
by asking him to clean the outhouse is

738
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:45,810
killed in the clash.
Coincidence or murder

739
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,470
Adams is good,
right?

740
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,340
And so here Adams is tossing out the
suggestion that maybe the troops were just

741
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:56,700
looking for an excuse to fire on the
townspeople and I'm really get that nasty

742
00:45:56,701 --> 00:46:00,510
gray plotting maybe. And the
British too, as you've heard,

743
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,720
are wondering if maybe this is a
plot on the part of the colonists.

744
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,540
Maybe they're actually just
trying to rob the customs house.

745
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:10,530
And this whole thing was an elaborate
ploy by the colonist just to rob the

746
00:46:10,531 --> 00:46:12,420
customs house behind the guard.

747
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,740
So you can really see from these two
accounts and from the details contained

748
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:17,574
within them,

749
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:21,360
the animosity and the sense of alienation
between the colonists and the soldiers

750
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:26,340
on both sides. And you can also see really
dramatically the fears on both sides,

751
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,140
that there's some kind of a plot.

752
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,440
There's some kind of a plot of resistance
or tyranny depending on which side

753
00:46:31,441 --> 00:46:35,670
you're on. Somehow this is organized and
it's not good, and it has to be stopped.

754
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:37,680
And both sides have
come to that same point.

755
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:41,490
And I will stop there and we will
continue next week onto the logic of

756
00:46:41,491 --> 00:46:42,180
resistance.
