1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,720
Before we begin,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,890
I have to make a true confession to you
in my class or my class and I have been

3
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:13,300
confessing things all semester,
but this is the,

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,490
I basically set myself up for this failure
and then realized at the end of the

5
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:21,510
class someone came to me and asked me
a question and then I realized, okay,

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,890
so remember how I told you how at
Uva for like five straight years,

7
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:29,250
I forgot Thomas Jefferson's birthday
even though everything closed. Yeah.

8
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:31,470
Guess what I didn't say on Tuesday,

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,470
I forgot it was Thomas
Jefferson's Brooklyn.

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,580
I like completely forgot something
came up at the end and said, well,

11
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,950
in honor of Jefferson's birthday we
did the following and I was like,

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,590
so it's good to know that
I'm really consistently a
horrible Uva Grad who always

13
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:51,780
forgets Thomas Jefferson's birthday. It
must be like a Hamiltonian mental block.

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,370
Good. I like, it is not possible for
me to keep that date in my head anyway.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,100
I at least wanted to say happy
birthday John, with you ever since.

16
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:03,250
So now officially I'm a little late,
but he'll get over it. So anyway, I've,

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,040
I've confessed to you. I feel
much better now. Okay. Um,

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,350
so today we turned to the constitution,
um,

19
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:17,650
in the last few lectures
and in today's lecture, um,

20
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,680
basically we've been looking at the new
nation figure out its shape and form,

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,361
right?
What,

22
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:28,361
what kind of a nation is going to be as
people were discovering throughout the

23
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:29,400
seventies and eighties,

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,400
it was one thing to protest against things
that you didn't like in a government

25
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,750
as the Americans had
during the revolution.

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,160
It was quite another thing to come up
with an alternative to come up with

27
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:44,670
something better and then
to get others to agree.

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,100
Today's lecture,
I'm sorry,

29
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:51,990
Tuesday's lecture discuss part of this
process of figuring out the shape and

30
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:55,560
form of the new nation. So we looked
at the Mount Vernon conference,

31
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:59,010
we looked at the Annapolis
convention and we, in doing that,

32
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:04,011
we're looking at a gradual process that
was unfolding one step at a time with no

33
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:08,220
inevitable outcome.

34
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:13,790
So basically what we saw on Tuesday was
how the Americans are basically backing

35
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:19,371
their way into what would become
the constitutional convention.

36
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,540
So it's not as though everyone said,
hey,

37
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,720
we need a new constitution and it's
gotta be stronger. Let's go right there.

38
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,410
It's a process. It which people are
really figuring things out as they go,

39
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,070
and today I want to stress that same
message that the constitution was not

40
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,760
inevitable and I know that's obvious
on the one hand, but on the other hand,

41
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:42,690
it's so ingrained in us, I think to think
that it's a great idea that of course,

42
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:46,080
what happens sooner or later that I feel
the need at the outset of the lecture

43
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,680
to say this,
that obviously it was not inevitable.

44
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,710
We think to ourselves,
well of course the articles,

45
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:55,170
what a goofy government the
articles of confederation was.

46
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:57,060
Of course they've got to come
up with something better.

47
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,860
Of course it's going to be stronger.

48
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,770
Of course it's going to end up
looking like our constitution.

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,400
And obviously the problem with that
whole river of of courses is that if he

50
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:10,180
traveled down that stream,

51
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:15,181
you miss one of the most important
aspects of the process of creating the

52
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:16,810
constitution.

53
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,890
And that is that it was a
process that it was a debate.

54
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,490
It was a national debate during which
people really seriously considered what

55
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:29,920
they were doing, what the implications
were of what they were doing.

56
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:33,610
And they did not all agree on
what was a good or a bad idea.

57
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,830
So the process,

58
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:40,831
the fact that there actually was a debate
is significant and it's not a process

59
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,460
that was entirely disconnected
from the revolution,

60
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,720
the things that Americans had been yelling
about during the revolution. Right?

61
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:52,090
They talked in a variety of
different ways about liberties.

62
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:55,900
They talked in a variety of different
ways about rights that wasn't just

63
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,530
rhetoric.

64
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,530
People were truly arguing about and
defending specific fundamental rights and

65
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:06,100
privileges that they felt they
deserved as British subjects.

66
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,610
And of course the end result about
that fight was the revolution.

67
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,190
So now we're years later and we're
looking at arguments over a new form of

68
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:18,880
government and some of these things,
same things are being yelled about.

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,580
So as you're going to see in
the course of today's lecture,

70
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,900
I'm in one way or another,

71
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:27,220
people are still fretting about sort
of what they consider to be fundamental

72
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,680
liberties,
basic rights.

73
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,280
People consider these things to be the
legacy of the revolution and they didn't

74
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:39,220
want to give them away before they
even really begun to enjoy them.

75
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,350
So think back for a minute, many moons
ago, it's so long ago in this semester,

76
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,250
but think back to when we were talking
about the vote for independence and I

77
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:50,460
mentioned Pauline Mayer's book.
Um,

78
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,310
and I talked about how in her book she
has a chapter in which he talks about the

79
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:57,970
other declarations of independence and
she really shows how on a local level

80
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:02,800
people were getting together and
debating as groups in towns and counties.

81
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,580
What do you think about independence
and should we actually support this?

82
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,630
That that was actually a real debate.
And what I'm talking about here,

83
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:13,660
what I will be talking about
over the course of this lecture,

84
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,160
it's a similar process of debate in
which people throughout the country,

85
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:22,240
we're really trying to figure something
out. They knew it was a major decision.

86
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,970
They were hoping whatever it was going
to happen was going to be a smart

87
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:27,280
decision.
But it's an actual debate.

88
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,400
And along these lines, as you'll
see by the end of today's lecture,

89
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,880
this is not the kind of lecture in which
I'm going to give you this deep textual

90
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:40,070
analysis of the constitution.
Um,

91
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,210
basically I've got this lecture and a
little bit in the next lecture to talk

92
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:44,080
about the constitution.

93
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:46,330
I'm sure the founders are spinning
in their graves like what,

94
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,080
45 minutes to get to the constitution.
Um,

95
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,780
but that's where we are in the semester.
Um,

96
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,730
given that I only have
that amount of time,

97
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:59,360
what I really want to focus on is the
process of creating the constitution.

98
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,040
And in doing that,

99
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:06,041
I'm also going to talk about a handful
of ongoing controversies that we have

100
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:09,260
seen before during the revolution
at an earlier part of this course.

101
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:12,770
And we're going to see them again towards
the end of this lecture when we focus

102
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:17,771
on some of the main areas that became
controversies for the constitutional

103
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,610
convention. Now, I think in the same
way that we have all these of courses,

104
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:25,280
you know, of course we know what's
going to happen. It's the constitution.

105
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,880
I think it's also easy for us to
walk down the, of course trail,

106
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,380
when we think about nationalists like
James Madison or Alexander Hamilton on

107
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:37,280
some sort of basic level, we assume, well
they're right or they're the smart guys,

108
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,940
they are right and anyone who is against
them. It's sort of a short sided,

109
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,560
limited minded person who like clearly
isn't thinking on a broad, smart level.

110
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:49,130
Right? I think almost instinctively
because we think what we think about our

111
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:53,540
constitution, we think that way about
whoever supported it or did not.

112
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,410
Now certainly these nationalists felt
like they were vindicating the revolution,

113
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,450
right?
So if you'd asked them,

114
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,110
they would have told you that they felt
they were preserving the achievements of

115
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:06,980
the revolution.

116
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,370
They were fending off chaos and a variety
of other things that would defeat what

117
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,730
had been one in the revolution. And from
our vantage point, we can look back.

118
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,320
We see that and that makes sense.

119
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,540
But this wasn't the only argument
that was circulating at the time.

120
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,560
So even before the
constitutional convention met,

121
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,880
people have valid fears about
what might result from it.

122
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,020
And they were fears that were strong
enough that some people didn't even think

123
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:38,570
they're states should participate
in the convention. Nevermind.

124
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:41,390
Like arguing about ratification.
I'm backing is way up.

125
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,910
There were many people who just thought,
I don't want to,

126
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:47,990
I don't think our state should participate
in this whole idea of revising the

127
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,000
government in some way or another.

128
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,020
Some people feared that strengthening
the national government with a kind of

129
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:59,021
counter attack against everything
that the revolution had meant.

130
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,410
And I want to give you a sense
of the flavor of this debate.

131
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:06,710
This is actually sort of pre convention
debate in which the states are figuring

132
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:10,250
out what to do. Um, and, and
I'm going local again, right?

133
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:13,880
I sort of tea to give you a sense of on
the ground reality during the revolution.

134
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:16,210
I went local and I talked about
the invasion of new haven's.

135
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:19,820
So for just a couple minutes here,
I want to go local again. Um,

136
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,680
and just give you a flavor of the debate
that was going on here in Connecticut.

137
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,550
After the Confederation Congress had
passed the resolution saying, okay,

138
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:34,210
we think that the states should select
delegates to send them to this convention

139
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:38,060
that's going to happen to
revise the articles, right?

140
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:41,390
They're not saying go destroy the
articles, but they are saying, okay,

141
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,550
revising the articles might be okay.

142
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,000
And once the Confederation
Congress makes that resolution,

143
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,950
the states now debate what
to do. So on May 12th, 17,

144
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:52,784
87,

145
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:58,330
the Connecticut legislature began
debating whether Connecticut should send

146
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,730
delegates to this proposed
convention to meet in Philadelphia.

147
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:06,090
That was coming up in a couple of what
coming up very soon in a matter of fact.

148
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,050
Um,

149
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:12,050
now most newspapers that reported on
what happened explicitly mentioned four

150
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,100
members of the Connecticut House who
came forward and declared that they were

151
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:20,730
opposed to sending
delegates to the convention.

152
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,510
All of these men were from small towns
and the Massachusetts border and all of

153
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:27,900
them in one way or another,

154
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:32,340
warned that sending a delegate to this
convention would endanger the liberties

155
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:36,540
and privileges of Americans.
So Alicia Fitch,

156
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,130
I love the fact that
their names are preserved.

157
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,900
Eliza Fitch say the convention might end
up a bridging the people's privileges

158
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:46,800
by creating some kind of a big unjust
centralized government that just wouldn't

159
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,500
consider in the individual person at all.

160
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,110
Daniel Perkins said that the men who
probably would be named as delegates to

161
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:59,400
this supposed convention would
probably be a bunch of rich,

162
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,430
aristocratic type men who
wouldn't understand or care
about the problems of the

163
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:08,010
average person in Connecticut.
Nevermind the poor of Connecticut.

164
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:11,010
So Perkins thought whatever
comes out of this convention,

165
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,350
it's bound to just ruin the poor.

166
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,990
It's going to be some weird
aristocratic decision.

167
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,930
Hosea Humphrey said that the convention
would probably somehow or other take

168
00:10:20,931 --> 00:10:25,130
away the rights of Connecticut to
protest against things, to veto things.

169
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:26,820
Somehow or other,
it's going to be more centralized.

170
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:30,120
So Connecticut is going to
lose power in this equation.

171
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,620
And the fourth representative named
Abraham Granger was particularly straight

172
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:36,454
forward.

173
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:41,610
He said he knew that his constituents
didn't want delegates to be sent to this

174
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:44,790
convention and he represented them.
So first of all, there it was.

175
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:49,530
He had no choice. He had to just do
what they wanted him to do and say, no,

176
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:53,640
we should not send delegates
to the convention, but he
added, he agreed with them.

177
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:57,420
He actually thought that this
convention was a bad idea and he said,

178
00:10:57,421 --> 00:11:01,620
stated specifically the reason why he
didn't like the whole idea of a convention

179
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:05,820
was probably it would end up creating a
monarchy and then we'd be right back to

180
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:09,690
where we were before.
So all of these men,

181
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:11,940
either directly or by implication,

182
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,080
clearly they're rejecting the idea that
the union or Connecticut is in such

183
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:19,350
horrible shape that something must
be done. We need a new government.

184
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,810
They're not traveling down that trail.

185
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,110
Granger actually in the
course of his remarks,

186
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:29,040
explicitly said that the Confederation
Congress had plenty of power.

187
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,910
The articles of confederation joined
with Connecticut's own constitution would

188
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:35,430
be just fine for the
people of Connecticut.

189
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,640
Implied in some of the comments of what
these men said is the idea that anything

190
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:43,680
could happen at this convention.

191
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:46,230
And obviously that's something I've talked
about before in this course as well,

192
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:48,900
but you can hear it underlying
a lot of their comments.

193
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,810
Who knows what's gonna come
out of this convention?

194
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,820
Anything could happen in
odds are whatever happens,

195
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,890
some fundamental American privileges
and rights are going to be taken away,

196
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,910
potentially buy a bunch of wealthy
aristocratic guys who are going to be the

197
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:06,790
ones standing in that room
in Philadelphia debating.

198
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,870
So they're basically imagining the
convention is going to be a bunch of

199
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:15,850
aristocrats who were going to subvert a
popular revolution and maybe even just

200
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:19,900
toss the new country right back into
a monarchical form of government.

201
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,580
So those are the four people who
at least the newspapers noted,

202
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,440
is really standing forth
against the convention.

203
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:31,441
Now of course the newspapers also
reported on nine men who spoke in favor of

204
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:36,610
attending the convention.
All of them were from commercial areas.

205
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,960
They all argued as you would expect
them to argue that the wellbeing of the

206
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,600
union and the wellbeing of the
state of Connecticut really,

207
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:46,510
really required a stronger
central government.

208
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,520
One of these nine even brought up an
embarrassing example of how powerless the

209
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,000
congress was that involves
Connecticut. He said, you know,

210
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,410
recently the Confederation Congress
asked the states, including Connecticut,

211
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,090
they requisitioned money from us and we
just decided we didn't feel like giving

212
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:06,580
them any and they couldn't do anything.

213
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,320
Remember like they asked us
for something and we said no,

214
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,600
and that was the end of that. Remember
guys are that, that's like a sign.

215
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:19,150
They don't have power because
we've watched them not have power.

216
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:24,100
When we just said no and he, this one
delegate went on to say, well, what about,

217
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,490
you know, think about it. That's not even
a problem. What about problems to come?

218
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,710
What if the Union begins to disintegrate?
What if, what if the union is invaded?

219
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,840
What would the confederation Congress
be able to do about problems like that?

220
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,190
So obvious.

221
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,970
Obviously in the end it's that kind of
an argument that wins out and Connecticut

222
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:45,370
voted to send delegates to the convention,

223
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:48,100
but obviously also not
without a real debate.

224
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,060
So even participating in the convention
was a big deal that required serious

225
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,170
debate and we haven't even
gotten to ratification yet.

226
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,130
As a matter of fact,
it was such a big deal that one state,

227
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,080
the state of Rhode Island, Rhode Island
is consistent throughout my entire glass.

228
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,800
But Eileen decided not to attend.
They actually just decided, no,

229
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,140
we're not participating.
We're not going.

230
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,130
So there were actually only 12 states
represented at the constitutional

231
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:22,360
convention. Rhode Island was a
holdout. So clearly so serious.

232
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,070
This one state is just not there.

233
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,450
So ultimately 12 states sent
delegates to the federal convention.

234
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,030
And I should add here,
just to not confuse you.

235
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,820
Sometimes I know I'm saying Federal
Convention and sometimes I'm saying

236
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:37,450
constitutional convention and there are
two ways of referring to the same thing.

237
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:40,300
Some historians say federal convention
because if you think about it,

238
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,760
every state could have a
constitutional convention,

239
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,570
but there can actually be maybe,
hopefully one federal convention.

240
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,160
But you can use either one.

241
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:51,350
You have my full permission to call it
either the constitutional convention or

242
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:55,910
the Federal Convention. So 12 states
sent delegates to the federal convention.

243
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:01,100
It met between May and
September of 1787 Rhode Island,

244
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:05,060
obviously, as I said, was not
there from those 12 states.

245
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,380
55 delegates attended
the convention in all.

246
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,840
And I suppose as you might expect,
overall, they were well educated men.

247
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,240
A lot of them were trained as lawyers.

248
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,050
A lot of them had experience
working in their state governments.

249
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,740
A good number of them had experienced
serving in either the continental

250
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:29,420
congresses or the Confederation Congress.
Now that said,

251
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:34,010
this doesn't mean that these were sort
of professional politicians sitting down

252
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:35,030
to write a constitution.

253
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:38,930
It's not as though they've prepared
their lobes for this this moment.

254
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,900
There are people who've been
involved in public life,

255
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:45,350
but they certainly have not been
training to sit down and create an entire

256
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:48,830
constitution for a whole country.
So despite that experience,

257
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,090
which I'm sure it served them well,

258
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:54,020
it does not suggest that they
actually are just ready to go.

259
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,180
They're not entirely sure
what's going to happen.

260
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,720
Now in some ways,

261
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,200
these delegates were kind of a self
selecting group because people who were

262
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:10,211
really dead set against the idea of
strengthening the national government

263
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,800
basically just didn't
go to the convention.

264
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,990
The problem with that strategy is on the
part of certainly the people who didn't

265
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:20,600
like this whole idea.
By not being there,

266
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,490
they made it easy to achieve a consensus
among the people who were there who

267
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:29,270
were a little more comfortable with
strengthening the national government.

268
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,410
Most of the people who were there
in one way or another ended up being

269
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:37,650
nationalists in some form.
And by nationalists I
actually don't just mean them,

270
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,990
James Madison's of the world.

271
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:43,070
It's a pretty wide spectrum of people
thinking about the fact that the national

272
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:46,640
government needs to be stronger.
And some of them, Hamilton, Madison,

273
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,840
Extremo of nationalists,
others not so much.

274
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,360
There's a pretty wide range and there
were some people at the convention, um,

275
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,790
who weren't even necessarily comfortable
with a great amount of increased

276
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,610
strength and did not end up
signing the constitution. So,

277
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:03,680
I'm not saying everyone
there is a firm nationalist,

278
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,760
but the really from I suppose you call
them at this moment to anti nationalists

279
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,830
didn't go for the most part.

280
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,550
So since they were not there,

281
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,710
it meant that there was a certain sort
of fundamental level of agreement at the

282
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:19,544
convention.

283
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,730
Now two of the delegates there were
particularly well known and to people who

284
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,060
were wondering what the heck
was going on in Philadelphia,

285
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,070
the presence of these two men made
a big difference. George Washington,

286
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,270
George Washington was there.

287
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,970
George Washington ended up
presiding over the convention,

288
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,890
which ended up being a
pretty important move. Um,

289
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,260
I've already talked in past lectures
about how he gained the trust of everybody

290
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:50,010
by continually surrendering power. Um,
so he's already a legend in his time.

291
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,560
Um,
but also he's a trusted leader.

292
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,420
So certainly having him there gave a
certain status to whatever was going on

293
00:17:57,421 --> 00:18:00,510
meant that it was important and meant
that it was something that was being

294
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:04,380
treated responsibly because
George Washington had
invested it with his presence.

295
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,180
Benjamin Franklin also attended.
Again,

296
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:14,181
he's another man in this
period in American who had
an international reputation.

297
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:17,430
I've talked a little bit about
him as well and like Washington,

298
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:20,970
his presence there suggested that whatever
the heck was going on in Philadelphia,

299
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,550
it was important and it
had some major support.

300
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:26,100
The fact that these two men
were there was significant.

301
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,320
This is not the reason why he was there,

302
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:32,040
but I also am always happy when anyone
is anywhere who has a sense of humor.

303
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,640
So Franklin had one and it's always good
to have the guy with a sense of humor

304
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:39,900
at any large meeting of men
who have important things
to say. So for that reason,

305
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:43,770
I personally I'm happy to.
Benjamin Franklin was there. Now,

306
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:45,300
as I suggested on Tuesday,

307
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,770
Madison also played a major role and I
talked at the end of Tuesday's lecture

308
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:54,750
about his amazing notes that he recorded
partly thinking ahead to posterity.

309
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,100
His notes ended up being even more
significant because it was agreed at the

310
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:06,201
start of the convention that its
proceedings would be kept entirely secret.

311
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,790
The logic of that being that if it was
really, really kept entirely secret,

312
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,770
the people who were there would feel
free to really speak their minds.

313
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:21,300
They really wanted an open, full,
honest debate. So if people,

314
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:25,020
they're really believed that the public
would not know what they were saying,

315
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,660
someone for example,
it might feel free to stand up and say,

316
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:29,430
I personally would like a monarchy,
right?

317
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:30,840
If people thought that
public was watching,

318
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,170
no one's going to utter the m word
at the constitutional convention.

319
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,640
But if it's really secret,

320
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,560
the idea was it would allow for much
more open and free and potentially useful

321
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,810
debate. And there's
actually, um, I can't resist.

322
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,790
There's actually a story about the
secrecy of the Federal Convention,

323
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,280
which I will offer you,
cause it's also a George Washington.

324
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,390
He had another George Washington
story. I can't, I can't resist it. Um,

325
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,721
and it's actually,

326
00:19:57,721 --> 00:20:01,380
it really is a way of showing
how important people at
the time considered the

327
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:03,150
idea of keeping the convention secret.

328
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,730
And it's from the notes of a delegate
who was there at the convention. And, um,

329
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:12,690
his name is William Pierce. And supposedly
at some point in the convention,

330
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:17,691
somebody found a page of notes about the
proceedings on the floor of the State

331
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:23,430
House and brought this up
to George Washington said
he know somebody lost these.

332
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,540
Okay.

333
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,540
So Washington takes the last notes and
at the end of that day's session he

334
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,460
stands up and he says, before we adjourn,
I'll read his precise words. Gentlemen,

335
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:41,470
I am sorry to find that some one member
of this body has been so neglectful of

336
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:46,440
the secrets of the convention
as to drop in the State House,

337
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,950
a copy of their proceedings,

338
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,940
which by accident was picked up
and delivered to me this morning.

339
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,450
I must entreat gentleman to be more
careful lest our premature speculations

340
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,360
disturb the public repos by
getting into the newspapers.

341
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,830
I know not whose paper it is.
And then he said,

342
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,600
but there it is.

343
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:12,400
And you sort of threw it down on the
table and added. Let Him who owns it,

344
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,970
take it. And according
to Pierce, he bowed,

345
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,120
picked up his hat and left the room
quote with a dignity so severe that every

346
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:25,030
person seemed alarmed. Okay.
The power of George Right?

347
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,390
He just sort of threw his weight
around and everyone's like, oh,

348
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,640
so pierce writes it immediately.

349
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,200
Everyone started like checking their
pockets and their notes like, oh,

350
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:36,310
I really hope those are not my notes.
Please don't be my notes.

351
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:40,210
Pearce says to his horror,
he discovered that his were lost.

352
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,560
So he kind of goes up to the front of the
room and he kind of peaks at the notes

353
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,950
and he's really relieved to
discover they're not mine. Okay.

354
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,870
That means his notes are lost

355
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,200
to people's notes are laws and pierce
then later says that he remembered,

356
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:56,890
Oh yeah,

357
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:01,210
I left them in my coat pocket in the
boarding house where I'm staying.

358
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,410
Uh, and he found them and got them
and hopefully everything was okay.

359
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:08,980
But I love the fact that, you know,
he's really relieved like, oh good.

360
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:12,550
At least those aren't my notes. There's
someone else who's really lost notes.

361
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,770
And according to Pierce,

362
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,210
Washington's reprimand was so off putting
that nobody ever claimed a piece of

363
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:24,100
paper. It will just stay there.
The scary piece of paper.

364
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,760
So obviously Madison's
notes are important also,

365
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,280
partly because this was very secret,

366
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,080
but of course as I hinted at the
very end of Tuesday's lecture,

367
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:38,290
what's particularly significant about
Madison's role in the convention,

368
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,600
it's his creation of a plan of government,

369
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:43,480
which ultimately is known
as the Virginia Plan.

370
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,380
Madison arrived at the convention
with a plan of government in hand,

371
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,340
so in a sense he immediately
set the terms of debate.

372
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,130
That was a really strategic move and I'll,

373
00:22:57,131 --> 00:23:01,060
I'll add at this point that when you go
off into the future and have wonderful

374
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:05,410
jobs that in one way or another will
require you to have committee meetings and

375
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:07,960
various sorts.
The little lesson,

376
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,370
the life lesson that James Madison teaches
us here is if you set the agenda of

377
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:13,180
the meeting,

378
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,980
you set the terms of debate and you make
it much more likely that you win, right?

379
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:21,280
So remember James Madison down the
road and your professional lives,

380
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,420
he really does something very brilliant
strategically by walking in and

381
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:28,150
regardless of what is going to happen,
he doesn't know what's going to happen.

382
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,290
But he literally at least started
out by setting the terms of debate.

383
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,740
Now he may have devised
this plan of government,

384
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:40,741
but given that people already knew he
was sort of an extreme nationalist,

385
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:46,010
he wisely decided he would not stand up
and present this plan himself thinking

386
00:23:46,011 --> 00:23:49,550
and probably rightly so, that if he
stood up and made a recommendation,

387
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,330
some people would immediately distrust
it as coming from some kind of an extreme

388
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:57,410
nationalist. So instead he
asked fellow Virginia delegate,

389
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,110
Edmund Randolph to present the plan.

390
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,820
And Randolph was popular and Randolph
was influential and unlike Madison,

391
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:08,030
Randolph was also a good public speaker.
So it was a wise choice.

392
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,190
So on May 29th just a few days
after the convention opened,

393
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,580
Randolph stood up and very diplomatically
and very gently open the subject of

394
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,510
altering the articles of confederation
though as you're about to see,

395
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:26,960
what he ends up suggesting
is not altering the articles.

396
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,040
So first he reviewed the weaknesses
of the articles and then he proposed a

397
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:35,720
series of resolutions.

398
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,490
The first one intended to just calm the
nervous down and sort of put people off

399
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:42,980
guard.
Nothing scary is happening here.

400
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:48,160
So he first says resolved that the
articles of confederation ought to be so

401
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:52,550
corrected and enlarged as to accomplish
the objects proposed by their

402
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:57,320
institution, namely common defense,
security of liberty and general welfare.

403
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,580
So Randolph there says he's proposing
to correct and enlarge the articles.

404
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:10,220
What followed that statement was a rather
radical plan of government that was

405
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:14,510
not a correction of the articles.
Instead,

406
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,780
it's pretty much proposed to demolish
the articles and create in their place a

407
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:25,220
strong national government that would be
grounded not on the individual states,

408
00:25:25,221 --> 00:25:27,740
but instead on the people themselves.

409
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,290
This plan of government, the Virginia
plan is ultimately what it's called,

410
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,830
propose that the new government
would have three branches.

411
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,030
The first would be a
bicameral legislature.

412
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,940
The lower house would be
elected by the people.

413
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:49,640
The upper house would be selected by
the lower house from candidates named by

414
00:25:49,641 --> 00:25:50,780
state legislatures.

415
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,330
The legislature would have the power to
nullify any state law contrary to the

416
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:59,960
constitution and representation.

417
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,960
As I mentioned in the lower house,
it's based on population.

418
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,420
The second branch was
the national executive

419
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,980
in the Virginia Plan.

420
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:15,140
The executive would have a qualified
veto over acts of Congress.

421
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:20,660
The plan didn't specify
whether the executive would
be a single individual or a

422
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:22,730
committee.
People talked about both.

423
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,790
The term of office
wasn't specified either.

424
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,800
And then obviously the third
branch was a national judiciary,

425
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:36,190
which would consist of one or more supreme
judges and some inferior courts to be

426
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:40,400
chosen by the national legislature
to hold off as during good behavior.

427
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,010
So I'll repeat that. Uh,
by camera legislature,

428
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,570
lower house elected by the people upper
house selected by the lower house from

429
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:50,640
candidates name by state legislatures.

430
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,140
The legislature can nullify any state
law that violates the constitution.

431
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,720
Representation is based on population.

432
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,670
Ranch too is the executive who has a
qualified veto over acts of Congress and

433
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,420
it's not specified one person, many
people, how long you should be an office.

434
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:09,230
And then the third
branch, the judiciary, um,

435
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,900
with one or more supreme judges chosen
by the national legislature holding

436
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:14,700
office during good behavior.

437
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,500
The Virginia Plan also included a flexible
amendment process and a procedure for

438
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:26,580
the admission of new states.
Now, as you can hear,

439
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:31,581
they're the basic outline of the final
constitution is kind of sitting there in

440
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:36,750
that plan and sort of fundamental frame
of what's coming in the next few months

441
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:42,150
is contained within the Virginia Plan.
So from the start of the convention,

442
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,680
things look a little auspicious for
the nationalists. And sure enough,

443
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:49,140
relatively early on in the convention,

444
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:54,060
there's a vote that a new national
government ought to be established and it

445
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:59,061
should have a supreme legislative
executive and judiciary branch.

446
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,660
Now that's a pretty major thing to decide.

447
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,680
It's a pretty major victory for people
who are really firm nationalists that,

448
00:28:07,681 --> 00:28:08,514
okay,

449
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:13,440
the convention now has
committed to setting up a
supreme central government with

450
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:18,300
three branches and some more
nationalist victories followed.

451
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,280
So for example,

452
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,930
the confederation decided that the
executive would be one man after debating

453
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:25,590
this for a while,

454
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,170
and I'll talk a little bit more about
this towards the end of the lecture,

455
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:33,060
but they ultimately decided that one man
should be the executive and clearly in

456
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:36,120
a world where you're scared of centralized
power and thinking about kings,

457
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:37,110
that's a big decision.

458
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,180
And then they began to discuss
representation in the lower house of the

459
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:45,150
legislature. And I'm also going to come
back to representation in a few minutes,

460
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,520
but for now I'll simply state the obvious,

461
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:52,521
which is of course this debate broke down
as this debate always breaks down into

462
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,290
small states versus large states,

463
00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:00,270
small states not liking the idea of having
representation be based on population.

464
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,090
Large states being perfectly
happy with that idea.

465
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,800
And small states had a good reason to
fear that their influence would just be

466
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:10,980
eliminated in some degree if
everything is based on population.

467
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,710
So on June 15th,

468
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,420
William Patterson of New
Jersey proposed his own plan,

469
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,720
which becomes the New Jersey
plants and other New Jersey moment,

470
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,590
the New Jersey plan.
Um,

471
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,420
and of course this is the plan that's
much more popular among small state

472
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:28,950
representatives.

473
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:34,790
The New Jersey plan suggested a one
house legislature in which obviously each

474
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:41,040
state would have one vote.
There would be a plural executive.

475
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,020
Um,

476
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,960
so an executive consisting of more than
one person who would be elected by the

477
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:50,980
Congress and the Supreme
Court chosen by the executive.

478
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,910
Now you can see how in some ways they're
a little vestiges of the articles

479
00:29:55,911 --> 00:29:59,530
sitting there. In that plan,
there's a unicameral legislature.

480
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,500
Each state has one vote.
Even so,

481
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,020
even though this is
supposedly a less centralized,

482
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,020
less scary alternative to the
Virginia plan, it's still,

483
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,860
it is giving more power to the national
government. Then the articles had done

484
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,590
three days later,

485
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,780
someone successfully moved to postpone
consideration of the New Jersey plan and

486
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:24,550
instead consider simply revising the
articles. You can imagine the sort of,

487
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,240
uh, I went around the room. Oh No.

488
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,710
Now at this point,

489
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,980
Alexander Hamilton stood up and made
a dramatic move on June 18th he made,

490
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,660
but some describe as a six hour speech.

491
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,080
I can't imagine giving or listening to
a six hour speech in which he proposed

492
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:51,790
his plan of government, which as
you'll hear, is really, really,

493
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:56,320
really, really centralized
and national. Basically,

494
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,300
Hamilton's plant reduced the states
to administrative subdivisions.

495
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,100
Each would have a supreme executive
appointed by the national government,

496
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:12,030
a chief executive elected for life during
good behavior elected by electors who

497
00:31:14,381 --> 00:31:19,030
are elected by electors who
were popularly chosen. Okay.

498
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,120
How removed can we get the people from
the process of choosing the executive

499
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Hamilton also proposed a Senate chosen
for life during good behavior and an

500
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:33,520
executive with absolute veto power.
Okay.

501
00:31:33,521 --> 00:31:36,010
That's like way out there and scary land.

502
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:39,280
You can imagine he gives a six hour
speech and that's what he comes up with.

503
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,020
He also,
during the speech praise,

504
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:43,390
the British government is the best
government on the face of the earth.

505
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:48,280
That's Hamilton,
so basically held it,

506
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,400
never lives down the speech
as a delicate later put it,

507
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:55,510
Hamilton's dramatic speech was praised
by everybody but supported by none.

508
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,080
It was like, thank you,
you can sit down now.

509
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,130
And it really did haunt him to the end
of his days because it seemed to be

510
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:05,800
eternal proof to anybody who
even vaguely didn't like him,

511
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,960
that he was really a monarchist at heart,

512
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,100
that he's just waiting for a chance to
convert the government into a monarchy

513
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,560
with a king at its head.
It's,

514
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:18,850
you can see why it was important to keep
the proceeding secret and you can see

515
00:32:18,851 --> 00:32:22,660
how they did not get remain a secret for
very long. Right. Clearly they leaked.

516
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,200
If this,

517
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,890
if this is like the tin cans tied to
Hamilton's reputation for the rest of his

518
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:31,720
life, clearly it's leaking. Um, but
yeah, he never lived down that speech.

519
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:36,310
Now the question is why did he
stand up and give that speech?

520
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:39,470
Why did he stand up and praise the British
government is being the government on

521
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:40,101
the face of the earth?

522
00:32:40,101 --> 00:32:43,820
Why did he propose this
extreme plan knowing how
people felt about some of these

523
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:47,450
ideas and there's disagreement.
There is not agreement on this. Um,

524
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:52,451
some historians assume that this was
a strategic move and then Hamilton was

525
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:55,400
trying to push the
convention past the week,

526
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:59,240
New Jersey plan or horror of horrors,
just revising the articles.

527
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,790
So according to the strategy,

528
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,560
Hamilton's plan would have looked so
extreme that the Virginia plan would look

529
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:09,530
really good in comparison.
And sure enough,

530
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:12,530
not that long after Hamilton speech
to the New Jersey plan is defeated.

531
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:16,760
So if this is why Hamilton did this,
you know, maybe you could say it worked.

532
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,013
However,

533
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:23,240
it's equally possible that Hamilton
wanted at least a moment to stand up and

534
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:27,830
offer his ideas and basically stayed,
okay, here's my plan of government.

535
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,580
Here's my little moment to shine.
Here's what I think we should be doing.

536
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,150
And I always feel, you know, I don't
know which of these is true or not true.

537
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:39,590
I think either one could be, or actually
both could be, but certainly the ladder,

538
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:43,940
um, theory has a little credence to it
only because you have to feel sorry for

539
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:45,020
Hamilton at the convention.

540
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,680
Here's this guy who for roughly
a decade has been saying,

541
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:50,990
we need a stronger national government.
He's one of the first,

542
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,530
he's one of the strongest. He's
consistent. He's out there.

543
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:56,000
This is like his message.

544
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:01,150
He finally gets a constitutional
convention and the other
two delegates from New

545
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,940
York do not like the idea of really
strengthening the national government very

546
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:09,260
much. And it's one state, one vote. So
basically his vote doesn't matter at all.

547
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:14,240
So this poor guy, he's like my
mission and my mission. Finally,

548
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:18,740
I'm here and I can't do
anything. I took aw, poor guy.

549
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:22,040
So it's possible that he did actually
stand up and say, okay, whatever,

550
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:26,090
here's what I would do,
what I would do,

551
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,040
and I'm going to announce
this and never live it down.

552
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,550
But here's what I would do during this,
what should be my prime moment.

553
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,410
So one reason or another,

554
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,580
who knows whether it was strategic or
cause he wanted his moment to lay out his

555
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:40,850
plan. The fact is that that night
after he gave the amazing speech,

556
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:45,020
he did meet with Madison and revise
Madison's notes so that they would be an

557
00:34:45,021 --> 00:34:49,100
accurate reflection of what he said
just in case anyone didn't hear him.

558
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,240
Praise the British government is the
finest on the face of the earth. Okay,

559
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:58,340
so a little truth in both.
I think now I'm about to do a really,

560
00:34:58,341 --> 00:35:01,640
really grave injustice
to the constitution. Um,

561
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,970
and so now is the moment when the
founders will be spinning in their graves

562
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:09,620
because I'm going to basically condense
my discussion of the constitution down

563
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:10,940
to three main issues.

564
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,790
Not because they're the only
issues that should be discussed,

565
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,820
but because certainly they
are all important issues.

566
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,570
And because they show
something about how concerns,

567
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,640
issues of the revolution continued to
play a role in American politics and in

568
00:35:25,641 --> 00:35:26,660
American public life.

569
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:31,040
I apologize to all founders for
condensing the constitution down into near

570
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:35,210
minutes. Okay. The first issue that
I want to discuss is representation.

571
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,650
And the question here,
the obvious one population or one state,

572
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,220
one vote, small state, big state battle,

573
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,470
small stays are afraid
of having no influence,

574
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,880
which they continue to be afraid of.

575
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:50,220
This is not a battle that stops
once this decision is made,

576
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,570
it continues on and in one way or another
state through always sort of objecting.

577
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:54,721
You know,

578
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:59,721
there's a succession potential succession
plot by New England in the early 19th

579
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:03,060
century because they feel that they have
no influence. So this doesn't go away,

580
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,660
but certainly at this point
it's a real sticking point.

581
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,150
And ultimately a committee came up with
a solution which is known either as the

582
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:15,210
great compromise or the
Connecticut compromise.

583
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:18,840
And the reason why it's the Connecticut
compromise is cause it was proposed by

584
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:23,530
Connecticut delegate Roger Sherman, Roger
Sherman, he's a local boy yet again,

585
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,630
new haven appears on the map.

586
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:28,800
Roger Sherman lived in new haven and
actually you may have not have noticed it

587
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:31,890
because I'm probably the geek who
notices every historical plaque and the

588
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:34,530
universe. Um, but on the front
of the Union League cafe,

589
00:36:34,531 --> 00:36:36,540
there actually is a
plaque to Roger Sherman.

590
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,920
It was his house like here was
his hose and here's what he did.

591
00:36:39,921 --> 00:36:42,900
And we like Roger Sherman.
Um, so he's a new haven guy.

592
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:47,820
He's the guy who proposes the Connecticut
compromise and basically as you could

593
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:51,540
predict, the compromise
says representation in the
lower house will be based on

594
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:54,510
population and in the upper house,
one state,

595
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:59,511
one vote and that gets
passed on July 16th,

596
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,450
1787.
So representation first major issue,

597
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,670
second major issue.

598
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,660
Although in a way the problem with this
one is that it was not a major issue is

599
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:10,770
the question of slavery,

600
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,060
which clearly is linked to the
question of representation.

601
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:20,790
On August 8th northern states
attacked slavery on moral grounds.

602
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,890
And propose taking no account of
slaves as part of the population.

603
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,400
When allocating representation
in the national legislature.

604
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:34,800
Now obviously many southerners did not
like this idea and they defended slavery

605
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:39,600
on moral and economic grounds and they
were joined by some northerners who were

606
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:42,600
afraid that this issue was just
going to dissolve the union.

607
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,480
Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania
offers a nice sort of example of the

608
00:37:48,481 --> 00:37:49,710
antislavery point of view.

609
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:54,390
I'll quote Maura's here upon what
principle is it that the slave shall be

610
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:56,310
computed in the representation?

611
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,830
Are they men then make them citizens
and let them vote or they property?

612
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,150
Why then is no other property included?
The houses in the city,

613
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,240
Philadelphia are worth more than all
the wretched slaves which cover the rice

614
00:38:09,241 --> 00:38:10,950
swamps of South Carolina.

615
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,910
The admission of slaves
into the representation when
fairly explained comes to

616
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:19,020
this that the inhabitant of Georgia and
South Carolina who goes to the coast of

617
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:22,260
Africa and in defiance of the
most sacred laws of humanity,

618
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,070
terrorist has fellow creatures from their
dearest connections and damned them to

619
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:30,300
the most cruel bondage shall have more
votes in a government instituted for

620
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:34,680
protection of the rights of mankind
than the citizen of Pennsylvania or New

621
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,340
Jersey who views with a lot of
horror, so nefarious a practice. Wow.

622
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,160
That's a statement.
Strong statement.

623
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,500
Other side of the argument,

624
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:49,840
Charles Pinkney of South Carolina was
among those who stood up and tried to

625
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:54,250
justify slavery. An example
of his argument, he said,

626
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,630
if slavery be wrong,

627
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,910
it is justified by the example
of all the world in all ages,

628
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,650
one half of mankind had been slaves
and he cited Greece and Rome and other

629
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,750
ancient city states as well as sanctions
given to slavery in modern times.

630
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:15,280
So slavery is mentioned.
Slavery has its moment of debate,

631
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,260
but it is important to note. It was in
a sense a little more than a moment.

632
00:39:20,261 --> 00:39:22,060
It only occupied a few days.

633
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:27,340
The issue was recognized to be a deal
breaker and when the delegates held up

634
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:31,120
their concern over slavery against
the idea of forming a union.

635
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,330
So basically when they saw that if they
really confront the issue of slavery,

636
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,790
they may never get a chance to
confront the issue of union.

637
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,030
They just decided not to
confront the issue at all.

638
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,070
And they memorialized their inability
to confront the issue in the document,

639
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:49,690
the Constitution itself and Article
One section nine of the constitution in

640
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:53,380
article one deals with Congress.
It states that quote,

641
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:58,480
the migration or importation of such
persons as any of the states now existing

642
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:03,220
shall think proper to admit shall not be
prohibited by the Congress prior to the

643
00:40:03,221 --> 00:40:08,221
year 1,808 which basically says Congress
can't stop the slave trade before 1808

644
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,990
but look at how indirect that languages,
right? It doesn't say what I just said.

645
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:15,130
In very simple terms,

646
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:20,350
the importation of such persons as any
one of the states shall think proper to

647
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:24,370
admit, can there be a more indirect
way of referring to slavery?

648
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,850
They're tap dancing around this issue.

649
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:32,740
They're finding one way or another does
not to confront it. So the word slave,

650
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,080
the word slavery does not
appear in the constitution.

651
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,120
So basically faced with a pretty
fundamental moral problem,

652
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,650
the delegates to the constitutional
convention looked the other way and their

653
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,484
minds,

654
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:49,780
the union was too tenuous for anything
that's controversial to be addressed.

655
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,550
And this kind of sort of skipping out
or not confronting the issue cause it

656
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:58,510
seems like the deal breaker would be
seen again and again and again and

657
00:40:58,511 --> 00:41:03,130
obviously eventually it becomes the deal
breaker and it does contribute to the

658
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:06,820
breaking of the Union.
Okay. So representation,

659
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:11,740
slavery to large issues under debate or
not under debate depending on which one

660
00:41:11,741 --> 00:41:12,574
you're talking about.

661
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,640
The third issue I want to bring up concern
the national executive and obviously

662
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:23,311
that really had links to the revolution
revolution with a revolt against strong

663
00:41:24,431 --> 00:41:27,190
centralized power in the form
of a monarchy and a monarch.

664
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:32,610
We've seen in previous lectures how
state constitutions that were created.

665
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:38,290
The 1770s really showed this ongoing
fear of tyrannical centralized executive

666
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:42,980
power. So we've seen when we were
looking at those state constitutions,

667
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,780
how more often than not,

668
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,950
legislatures were given more power
and governors were denied some power.

669
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,320
It's the same fear,
the same spirit,

670
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,740
it's charging the debate
during the convention.

671
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,400
So questions about the national
executive came up again and again.

672
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,700
How should he be elected by electors,

673
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,260
by electors chosen by state
legislatures, by state, governors,

674
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,410
by the national legislature,
by popular election.

675
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,630
How long should he serve?

676
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:16,280
Proposals range from two years
to life during good behavior.

677
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,380
The ultimate compromise suggested that
the president would serve for a four year

678
00:42:21,381 --> 00:42:25,760
term and it didn't set a limit on how
often he could be reelected and he would

679
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:28,130
be elected by electors
in the separate states,

680
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,730
which reassured delegates who
were worried about state rights.

681
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,860
And each state could decide for
itself how to select its electors.

682
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,000
So if a state wanted to select electrics
by popular election, they could,

683
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:45,050
if a state wanted to have
their legislature pick
electrodes, they could, again,

684
00:42:45,051 --> 00:42:48,620
they're sort of allowing the states to
come up with their own way of doing this.

685
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:53,870
States still have rights, um, but
still big scary issue of the executive.

686
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,030
So in a way that this,

687
00:42:56,031 --> 00:43:00,290
all of these sort of compromises and
decisions end up creating an executive who

688
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:05,120
at least it felt like he was being
controlled in some way every four years by

689
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:06,530
having to face election.

690
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:11,480
Now in some ways considering everything
that I just said about being scared of

691
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:15,710
monarchy, King's America sort of
slipping right back into a monarchy,

692
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,830
this executive is granted a
surprising amount of power.

693
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,810
He's commander in chief of the armed
forces. He could carry on diplomacy,

694
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,830
he could recommend measures to Congress,
he could exercise a veto,

695
00:43:27,831 --> 00:43:32,270
although obviously it could be overturned
by a two thirds vote in each house of

696
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:33,104
Congress.

697
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:38,000
Part of the reason for this amount of
trust in the executive was the idea of

698
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:38,960
checks and balances.

699
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:42,680
So people really actually did believe in
checks and balances and think that this

700
00:43:42,681 --> 00:43:47,180
isn't a single executive sort of scary
and alone with no way to check his power,

701
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,650
that the constitution actually seems to
be kind of nicely balanced so that maybe

702
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:55,160
this person actually has some
restraints or some rains pulling him in.

703
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:01,340
Now obviously this is the, that I'm so,
I feel so bad and Hamilton, Madison,

704
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,690
I'm so sorry.
Um,

705
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,100
this is the most vast overgeneralization
of the constitution that I can almost

706
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:08,420
possibly imagine.
Um,

707
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,970
and I will come back to it because
we have to get it ratified,

708
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,740
which is part of what we're part of
what we're going to do on Tuesday. Um,

709
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:19,930
but in the interest of
time on September 16th,

710
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,890
1787, the constitution was
agreed upon on September 17th,

711
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:29,980
it was signed and sent to
the Confederation Congress
to pass along to the

712
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:33,540
individual so that they could ratify it.

713
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,440
And there needed to be nine states to
ratify the constitution for it to go into

714
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:40,464
effect.

715
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:44,940
And each state would have its own
ratifying convention to decide the issue.

716
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:45,930
So what we're going to be looking at,

717
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:50,931
at least at the beginning
of next Tuesday's lecture
is this second to debate,

718
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,060
which is what do we really
think about the constitution?

719
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:59,060
And part of what we'll be pulling from
that is what kind of a sort of status

720
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:02,930
check does it show us about what Americans
were thinking at the time, you know,

721
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,600
in what way do the different arguments
for and against tell us something about

722
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:11,400
America at that moment. So we'll see
this sort of highly contested debate.

723
00:45:11,401 --> 00:45:15,180
We'll see states, um, that say
no and then say, yes, you know,

724
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,540
Rhode Island is still over here somewhere
waiting to see what happens. Um, and,

725
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,690
and it's really something that
people are watching closely.

726
00:45:21,691 --> 00:45:24,240
I'll talk a little bit
more about this on Tuesday,

727
00:45:24,241 --> 00:45:27,320
but I once again also
turned to Ezra styles. Um,

728
00:45:27,321 --> 00:45:30,180
I'm basically always looking for
like something that makes this real.

729
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:34,350
So there's not just the document,
the debate, the constitutions.

730
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,980
So as freestyles diary,
I love as her style's diary,

731
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,110
so I'll mention it a
little bit more on Tuesday,

732
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:44,290
but he talks about what he thinks about
what's going on. And he talks about, um,

733
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,180
you know,
watching states ratify the constitution.

734
00:45:48,181 --> 00:45:49,830
I'll mention some of that
as well cause it's again,

735
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:53,550
shows like one guy just kind of
responding to what's going on in a really

736
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:58,230
interesting way. I will stop there. I will
see you on Tuesday. Have a good weekend.
