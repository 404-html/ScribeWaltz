1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:02,071
Um,

2
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:07,071
Thursday I gave the world's most
condensed lecture about the constitution.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:10,430
Um,

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:15,430
and I mentioned three controversies that
represented long standing concerns in

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:20,580
Revolutionary America,
the question of representation,

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,260
the problem of slavery,

7
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:26,970
and then the question of a
national executive so that
that really boils down to

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,970
the problem of investing power in one man.

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,490
Now I did manage to discuss all three of
those things briefly before the end of

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,240
the lecture. Um, I did not have
time to discuss one last issue,

11
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:43,710
which I do want to talk about here before
I go into the real topic of today's

12
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:48,390
lecture. Um, I just ran out of time and
it actually combines two of those issues.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,160
It's the combination of the problem of
representation and the problem of slavery.

14
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,190
Um, and it's something you've all
studied in high school, I am sure.

15
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:59,850
And that is the three fifths
compromise. Um, and in a sentence,

16
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:04,320
the three fist compromise is the
decision to count three fifths of a state

17
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,870
slaves and apportioning representatives,

18
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:09,930
presidential electors and direct taxes.

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,220
So obviously by doing that,
I mean that is a compromise of sorts.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,520
It is trying to grapple with the
problem of slavery and the question of

21
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:18,390
representation,

22
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,040
but obviously that's a compromise that
bolsters southern political power.

23
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,770
Now the, the great historian of
slavery, Yale professor and Meredith,

24
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:29,071
David,

25
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:33,810
Brian Davis has this little
calculation associated with this issue.

26
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,500
Um, Davis writes that in
the continental congress,

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,000
there had been five states in which
slavery was a major institution.

28
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,390
So the southern states in the continental
congress had about 38% of the seats in

29
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:50,910
that Congress because of
the three fist compromise.

30
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,450
When the first US Congress opened
under the new constitution,

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,610
seven states now had 45%
of the seats in the house.

32
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,010
So 38 to 45 mins,
a significant slide.

33
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:05,850
Now that doesn't stay in grained that
way because population increases in the

34
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:07,560
north and things change over time.

35
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,060
But certainly that's one way in which
you can see the impact of that three

36
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:12,000
fifths compromise

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,540
now in a way that compromise. That's
a great segue into my lecture today.

38
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,020
Um,

39
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,020
it's a great example of the larger dynamic
of the period that we're focusing on

40
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:26,520
here towards the end of the course.

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,570
Because as we've been looking at
in the constitutional convention,

42
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,810
as we're going to see today when we're
looking at at ratification at the heart

43
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,740
of the political developments that we're
looking at in this period is compromise,

44
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,190
compromise between north and south
compromise between big states and small

45
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:47,400
states.

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,180
Compromise between people who want to
centralize power and people who want

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,740
strong state governments.

48
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,820
So basically what we're looking at in
this period is Americans deciding where

49
00:02:58,891 --> 00:03:01,510
and how to invest power.

50
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,970
Obviously a highly charged decision
that would have been impossible to make

51
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:11,200
without a string of compromises.
And in a way,

52
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,790
as we're going to be discussing today,

53
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,960
this is sort of a fundamental question
at the heart of the revolution and its

54
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:20,620
immediate aftermath.
Where should the nation invest power?

55
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,150
Where does power go?
So in a way,

56
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:28,150
if you look back to the beginning of
the course, think about the revolution,

57
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:29,710
think about some of the central issues.

58
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,880
You could say that the revolution
certainly was about power, right?

59
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:37,870
It was a rebellion against what
many perceived as tyrannical power.

60
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:40,870
And that means a lot of things.
But to sum that all up in a sentence,

61
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,733
you could say that.

62
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:47,110
You could say that the 17th seventies
and then the 1780s show Americans trying

63
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:52,111
to figure out how to rebalance
and reorganize power,

64
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,680
the power of state,
you know,

65
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,520
they strip away the British administration
and now they have to figure out where

66
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:59,410
else to place power and how to balance it.

67
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,730
And we've seen the articles of
confederation and now the constitution,

68
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:05,080
which is again,

69
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,640
part of this ongoing dialogue trying to
figure out the balance of power and all

70
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:10,750
sorts of different ways.

71
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,700
And it's no wonder if you think about
what I've already just talked about as far

72
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:17,110
as the constitution is concerned,

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,440
it's no wonder that it demanded a string
of difficult and often experimental

74
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,420
compromises creating the constitution.

75
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:30,421
And this we'll see today ratifying the
constitution was a difficult process.

76
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,400
We, we tend to think of the outcome
and we don't think of the process.

77
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,700
And I'm always reminded of this fact when
I read an exchange of letters between

78
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:40,240
Jefferson and Madison,

79
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,720
and it's actually written not long
after the constitution goes into effect.

80
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:47,470
I think it's written
in uh, early 1790. Um,

81
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,010
and at that point Jefferson
had been overseas.

82
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:53,290
He'd been in France on diplomatic duty,

83
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:58,000
so he's off in the distance knowing that
they're debating the constitution in

84
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:01,570
the United States, but he's, he's on
foreign shores, lounging and sell loans,

85
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,390
chatting about philosophical
issues with the French. Meanwhile,

86
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:09,100
Madison is in the constitutional
convention slaving away
and then he's outside

87
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,230
of it sort of hammering
away at ratification.

88
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:14,890
So Madison's like climbing over
the issue of the constitution.

89
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,870
Jefferson is kind of looking from afar.

90
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,010
So he writes this letter
to Madison early 1790,

91
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,220
saying that no generation should be
bound to the actions of any previous

92
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:29,210
generation. It's one of those Jefferson
letters in which he's like, oh good.

93
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,980
An interesting idea because we shared
with you and he starts out with this sort

94
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:35,860
of idea about generations.
Each generation is a distinct thing.

95
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:40,861
It should never be bound by the one that
came before and it has his famous line.

96
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:45,730
Some of you may have heard it already.
Um, the earth belongs to the living right,

97
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:48,690
that the living should be
controlling things. The Pat,

98
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,990
the dead hand of the past should
not have weight in the presence.

99
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,800
In Typical Jefferson style, he then
calculates what a generation is. Right.

100
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:00,860
It's not enough to say generations
are distinct. His, well,

101
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,040
how long has it generation anyway,
I will calculate this out. Oh,

102
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,100
and generation is 19
years by Thomas Jefferson,

103
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,670
so he decides a generation is 19
years and then says to Madison,

104
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,290
so every 19 years we
need a new constitution.

105
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,593
Okay,

106
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,100
so Jefferson writing to the
slaving away constitution guy,

107
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,790
because let's do this every 19 years.
I think that would be much fairer.

108
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,280
It wouldn't bind the present to the past.

109
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,700
Now when I read that letter and
then I read Madison's response,

110
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,960
Madison is really tactful.

111
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:35,780
Madison's a tactical guy and
he's tactful in his response.

112
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,690
But when you look beneath the
surface of Madison's reply,

113
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,550
I always feel like what you see there
is this sustained Howell of disbelief.

114
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,610
You know, like, Oh yeah,

115
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,090
you try that next time teach and then you
come back here and tell me you want to

116
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:55,010
do that in 19 years. You know? I was like,
no, I'm so, Madison's not happy about it.

117
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:59,810
But he actually is tactful. And
what he says to Jefferson is, um,

118
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,290
he praises Jefferson's quote. Many
interesting reflections. Sorry.

119
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,490
Thank you. Mr Madison. And
then ads unfortunately quote,

120
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,530
they're not in all respects compatible
with the course of human affairs or in

121
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:19,130
other words, real people don't
act that way. Like Jefferson.

122
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,700
Nice idea,
not gonna Work and implementation.

123
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:26,660
That's not like for real life for real
people. It doesn't work but cute idea.

124
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,260
Keep them coming like it's interesting.
We can just keep the conversation going.

125
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,550
We're not doing another constitution
in 19 years. So that's certainly one,

126
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,090
one compromise than Madison
is not willing to sign onto.

127
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,990
But of course the compromises don't
end with the closing of the federal

128
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:47,840
convention. Creating the constitution
is a major accomplishment now.

129
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:49,610
It has to be ratified.

130
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:54,260
There needed to be nine states to
ratify it for it to go into effect.

131
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,540
And each state would have its own
ratifying convention to decide the issue.

132
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,760
Now things would have been difficult
enough if that was the only challenge at

133
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:09,680
hand if all that they were facing was
ratification debates in the states.

134
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,490
But the fact is there were a slew of
things that could have gone wrong even

135
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:16,490
before we got to actual ratification.

136
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,740
For one thing,

137
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,390
the Confederation Congress might just
disapprove of the constitution and refuse

138
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:24,770
to send it on to the states.

139
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,160
It was entirely possible that that the
congress might have said, you know,

140
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:31,790
you didn't just amend the articles.
He wrote a new constitution.

141
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:36,320
I'm sorry we don't consider that valid.
Nice try. We're not going to send it on.

142
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,300
And that would have been a
little interesting moment.

143
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,050
It's just as possible that individual
states might refuse to consider it for the

144
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:45,710
same reason.

145
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,400
And even if some states did consider this
constitution and did decide to ratify

146
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:52,280
it,

147
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,280
if large influential states like Virginia
or Massachusetts or New York rejected

148
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,240
the constitution,

149
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,390
they're influence might actually compel
other states to follow their example and

150
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:10,050
vote against it. So all of this
is sort of looming out there.

151
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:12,030
It's unclear if any of
this is going to happen.

152
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,510
But for those who are really
supporting this new constitution,

153
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,170
they really knew that they had a
pretty big challenge facing them.

154
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,310
If the constitution made it to
the states for ratification.

155
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,730
If the states agreed to consider it,

156
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,680
then they had to worry about the actual
debate over whether this constitution

157
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,930
was adjust. Trustworthy
division of power. Now the,

158
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:40,050
the first horrible possibility did not
take place and the Confederation Congress

159
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,200
passes on the Constitution to the states
for consideration on September 28th,

160
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:52,050
1787 but still with the question
of ratification looming,

161
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,610
clearly the fate of the constitution
is left hanging for a good many months.

162
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,180
And I mentioned last time I was
going to go back to Ezra styles, um,

163
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,290
because his diary is useful and wonderful
and I'm going to go right back here to

164
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,060
as a styles, um, just
for a few minutes. Um,

165
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,490
because his diary shows you
one man as certainly one elite,

166
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,520
highly educated, influential man
with very high place friends,

167
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,670
but still one man who is watching events
unfold related to the constitution and

168
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:22,890
is trying to figure out
what he thinks about them.

169
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:24,270
He's interested to know what's happening.

170
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:26,910
He's not sure what he thinks and
he's trying to figure this out.

171
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,520
So one thing that his diary shows is it's
certainly he was intensely interested

172
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:34,470
in whatever the heck was
going on in Philadelphia.

173
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,950
He didn't know what was
going on in Philadelphia,
but he really wanted to know.

174
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,900
And on June 19th he apparently asked
Yale college seniors to debate the

175
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:43,860
following question,

176
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,180
whether the states acted
wisely and sending delegates
to the general convention.

177
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,340
Now sitting in Philadelphia,
I didn't know what they're doing,

178
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:54,000
but Yale students debate
amongst yourselves. Do you
think that was a good idea?

179
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,440
Um,
in November of 1787,

180
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,330
the question that he poses
for Yale College seniors has
changed. Now he says, Yo,

181
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,770
college seniors debate for yourself
whether it is expedient for the states to

182
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:11,580
adopt the new constitution
in late December,

183
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:14,970
some of his curiosity gets
satisfied because he actually
gets to spend the night

184
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,480
with Abraham Baldwin,
who had been a delegate in the convention.

185
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,520
So this is his chance.
He's a guy who was there.

186
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:24,270
He's going to really sort of plug away at
Baldwin, find out what really happened,

187
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,350
and at the end of the evening,
this is what styles wrote in his diary.

188
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,170
I have for,
this is my opinion,

189
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,880
that it is not the most
perfect constitution yet,

190
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,120
number two, that it is a very good one
and that it is advisable to adopted.

191
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,680
However, number three, that though much
of it will be permanent and lasting,

192
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,880
yet much of it will be here after altered
by future revisions and number four,

193
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,430
that the best one remains
yet to investigated.

194
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,270
And then he goes on to add.
When the convention was proposed,

195
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,830
I doubted its expediency. Number
one, he's really a guy for lists,

196
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,903
number one,

197
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,890
because I doubted whether our wisest
men had yet attained light enough to see

198
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:13,270
and discern the best and what ought
finally to prevail. Number two,

199
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,290
neither did I think the people were ripe
for the reception of the best one if it

200
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:21,310
could be investigated. And yet
number three, I did not doubt,

201
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:24,760
but time and future experience would
teach open and lead us to the best one.

202
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,370
And then we've got a much
better one than I expected.

203
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,450
I did a very good one yet my judgment
still remains as before and then he gets

204
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,770
very specific and he says,

205
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,970
I think there's not power enough yet
given to Congress for from government.

206
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,950
So he thinks about that on the one hand.

207
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:43,330
At the same time he worries that
surrendering too much power to this new

208
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:47,380
government will end up quote prostrating
the sovereignty of the particular

209
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:52,120
states. On the one hand he worries that
the president might become quote an

210
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:56,680
uncontrollable and absolute monarch.
On the other hand he says,

211
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,210
I think first he says, I think the
last as well guarded as possible.

212
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:04,180
So yeah he might become a monarch but I
think the constitution did as well as it

213
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:07,030
could to prevent that from happening.
And then goes on to say,

214
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:10,780
I know not whether it is possible
to vest Congress with laws,

215
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:15,781
revenues and army and navy
without endangering the
ruin of the interior powers

216
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:17,470
and liberties of the states and that's a,

217
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:20,350
that's a long passage for
someone to put in his own diary.

218
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,530
But what's interesting about that to
me is you can see styles going back and

219
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:27,100
forth. He says it's good, but
there's probably a better one.

220
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,040
It's better than I expected,
but somehow it's not good enough.

221
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,200
It doesn't give enough power to Congress,

222
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,860
but maybe it gives too much power
in the states will be prostrated.

223
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,690
Maybe the president is too powerful,

224
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,880
but if we give some of
that power to Congress,

225
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:42,310
maybe congress will end up
really destroying the states.

226
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,150
So you can see him there sort of
reasoning through what he thinks about the

227
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:50,650
constitution and when one way or another
it's boiling down to the balance of

228
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:54,850
power. Where should power be? He's not
exactly sure where power should be.

229
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:58,570
He knows it's the issue, but he's not
quite sure how to find his way out

230
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,040
so clearly.
And styles is an example of this.

231
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,640
Although the delegates of
the constitutional convention
had agreed on a new form

232
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:09,881
of government,

233
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:14,881
there were certainly not
some huge sweeping national
consensus on the best kind

234
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:19,270
of government for the new American nation.

235
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,350
So the ratification debates
throughout the states,

236
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,820
except for Rhode Island,

237
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,610
we just not having a debate
but and the rest of the states,

238
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,790
the ones that are actually
having big ratification debates.

239
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,910
These are really real debates and often
these debates focused on the question of

240
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:40,810
power
as suggested by styles.

241
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:44,710
One big question along these lines was
how do you divide power between the

242
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:46,960
national government and the states?

243
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,760
Patrick Henry of Virginia had this to
say about the constitution even before he

244
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,170
got passed its first three words.

245
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,230
Patrick Henry is upset by the first
three words of the constitution.

246
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,530
This doesn't bode well for the
Virginia debate. Henry says,

247
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,540
my political curiosity,

248
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,880
exclusive of my anxious solicitude for
the public welfare leads me to ask who

249
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:12,881
authorized them to speak the language of
we the people instead of we the states,

250
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,600
states are the characteristic
and the soul of a confederation.

251
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,080
If the states be not the
agents of this compact,

252
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,580
it must be one great
consolidated national government.

253
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,110
Samuel Adams is more concise
but has the same idea. He also,

254
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,400
those first three words,

255
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,020
he can't get past the first three
words he says as I enter the building,

256
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,010
I stumbled at the threshold constitution.
We the people,

257
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,560
we the people like what?
What, what does that,

258
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,490
what does that suggest about
this government? They're
both basically asking what,

259
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,420
what kind of government is this?
It's not a League of states,

260
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:53,420
the Confederation of States.
It doesn't seem to be about the states.

261
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,620
It appears to be some kind of new powerful
national government linking itself

262
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,420
with the American people and potentially
dismissing the importance of individual

263
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:06,530
states in the minds of
men like Henry and Adams.

264
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,350
If this was a really federal constitution,

265
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,150
surely the document should begin with we
the states as opposed to we the people,

266
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,700
what they're getting at Henry and Adams
and those kinds of statements is one of

267
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:23,660
the most unique aspects of
the proposed constitution.

268
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,400
And I think in a sense its most brilliant
compromise and that's the idea of

269
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,473
federalism.

270
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,030
The idea that both the states and the
national government could have large areas

271
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:37,130
of power with the federal courts,

272
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:40,760
sort of acting as arbiters about the
limits of state and federal power.

273
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,340
The real brilliance of federalism is that
it suggested that sovereignty could be

274
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:50,900
divided between two levels of government.
That was an interesting idea.

275
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:54,560
It was one that many people didn't
believe could actually be put into play,

276
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,600
but it's a,
it's a brilliant suggestion,

277
00:16:56,601 --> 00:17:01,601
a really brilliant compromised
for a population of people
who were worried about

278
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:05,390
the birth of some kind of tyrannical
centralized national government.

279
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,700
The concept of federalism at least
had some potential. On the other hand,

280
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,280
the idea of nationalism was a
lot more frightening, right?

281
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:21,281
Nationalism suggests one big national
blob and the obliteration of states or a

282
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:26,150
styles put at the
prostration of the states.

283
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,300
It's interesting to note
that in the constitution,

284
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,970
the word national does not appear,
and as a matter of fact,

285
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:35,870
not only is the word national,
not in the original constitution,

286
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,270
but during the debates.
What someone put it in,

287
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:41,900
somebody else always took it out by, no,
no, we're not talking about national.

288
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,560
It's federal. It's all federal. It's
not the scary big national thing.

289
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:48,860
It's a federal constitution.
And that's why of course,

290
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:52,650
the people who are defending
the constitution called
themselves federalists,

291
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,910
not nationalists.

292
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,930
And thus the opponents call
themselves anti federalists.

293
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,340
So federalism is a really brilliant
compromise in this battle over where to

294
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:08,880
invest power. But obviously it
did not solve all questions.

295
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,780
And for some people it didn't
even solve any of the questions.

296
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,080
The ongoing ratification debate
was actually really fierce.

297
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,450
And since by default we end up sort of
all siding with the federalists. Um,

298
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,930
let's look for a moment at the anti
federalists and the sorts of things that

299
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:28,200
they were arguing in these debates
throughout all of the states.

300
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,050
For one thing, like everyone else, they
are concerned with the placement of power.

301
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,060
They worry that this new national
executive is going to be a tyrant and

302
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:43,860
eventually a king. They worry that
state rights, state boundaries,

303
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:49,010
state constitutions will be violated
by a tyrannical national government.

304
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,990
They fear that the constitution is going
to foster the creation of a standing

305
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:58,590
army, which everyone of course
believes to be the tool of tyranny.

306
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:04,020
They fear that some kind of overbearing
aristocracy is going to take over and

307
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,150
repress the common man.

308
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,600
They fear a lack of proper representation.

309
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,860
They fear that they're not going to have
the right sort of a voice or any voice

310
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,380
in this new centralized government.

311
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,100
When you read about these
fears in their original form,

312
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:22,560
and of course throughout this period
and throughout all of these debates,

313
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,380
you know they're writing newspaper essays,
they're running pamphlets,

314
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:26,910
they're giving speeches.
This is a,

315
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:30,990
this is a literal debate in print and in
person and when you read some of these

316
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:33,690
anti federalists essays and pamphlets,

317
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,760
you can really see how some of them are
directly relatable to the revolution.

318
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,090
Just fought and hopefully one,
I guess in their mind,

319
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:44,550
maybe it hadn't been one yet because
it depends on what happens with this

320
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:48,360
government. They're talking about
tyranny, they're talking about monarchy,

321
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,840
they're chucking about violated liberties.
They're talking about aristocracy,

322
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:54,300
they're talking about unjust
representation. I mean,

323
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:57,930
you could sort of draw a line and
understand where these fears come from.

324
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,910
Just listen to how some anti federalists
actually expressed these fears.

325
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,910
One writer wrote that the
constitution was quote,

326
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,480
the most odious system of
tyranny that was ever projected.

327
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,590
Patrick Henry, who is always
useful for wonderful quotes, uh,

328
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:18,210
in the Virginia Convention says that by
giving so much power to a new national

329
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:22,500
government quote, the tyranny of
Philadelphia, the federal convention,

330
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,160
maybe like the tyranny of
George the third. Okay.

331
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:31,140
You can't draw a more direct link than
that. Right? Okay. Constitution George,

332
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:34,860
the third tyranny directly harkening
right back to the revolution.

333
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,880
And for many people these
arguments really rang true.

334
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,140
Now of course in the end,

335
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,620
the federalists proved successful this
despite the fact that they really were

336
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,970
promoting a pretty radical change of
government and there are a good number of

337
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:53,110
reasons why they're successful.

338
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:57,490
I'm just going to mention a few here
and one of them in a sense is really

339
00:20:57,491 --> 00:21:01,990
obvious but makes a lot of sense that
it acts in their favor and that is the

340
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:04,360
federalists are really national minded,

341
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,890
so they're actually thinking beyond the
bounds of their states and it makes them

342
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:13,891
much more likely to be able to create
some kind of United publicity campaign to

343
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:18,850
argue on a national level in a way that
perhaps anti-federalists couldn't or

344
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:21,370
wouldn't.
Also,

345
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,140
one reason why the federalist proves
successful is partly because the anti

346
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:29,710
federalists don't offer any
alternative to the constitution.

347
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,600
They critique what's there, but they
don't offer an alternative suggestion.

348
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,830
So the debate is criticism and the
federalists defending and countering

349
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,190
criticism and the federalists
defending and countering.

350
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,140
That's a very particular
kind of debate if the,

351
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:47,380
if the anti federalist could come forward
with another suggestion would have

352
00:21:47,381 --> 00:21:51,010
been a very different kind of debate.
In some ways,

353
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:55,660
you might argue that the
federalist victory was
something of an anti federalist

354
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,470
default as South Carolina anti federalist,

355
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:04,180
a Danish Burke put it after the fact.
We had no principal of concert or union.

356
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,650
We were sort of all objecting on our own
and we didn't have any unified campaign

357
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,460
or as Madison put it, I think in
a little bit of an exaggeration,

358
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,830
the Anti federalists quote had no plan,

359
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:19,180
whatever they look no farther than to
put a negative on the constitution and

360
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:22,570
return home. Okay, so maybe
that's a little exaggerated,

361
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:27,571
but in fact there was no obvious concrete
alternative presented by the anti

362
00:22:27,731 --> 00:22:31,780
federalists and that really was a
fundamental weakness in their position.

363
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,050
This does not mean however,

364
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:39,970
that there were no good arguments against
the constitution and the best proof of

365
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:42,250
that is the federalist essays,

366
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,060
which you're going to be reading this
week because those essays aren't just

367
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:48,790
explaining the constitution,

368
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:53,910
they're defending the constitution and
they're defending it against the sea of

369
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,200
fears and accusations and all these
sort of wild ideas floating around about

370
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:03,850
what might happen or what's implied or
what's suggested or what's allowable in

371
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:05,230
this new government.

372
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:11,850
The federalist essays where Hamilton's
idea and Hamilton invited his nationalist

373
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,940
buddy James Madison to join him in the
effort and they also invited John Jay to

374
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:20,200
take part in.
John Jay ended up getting sick,

375
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,030
so he wrote a few essays and
then he dropped out. So, um,

376
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,380
as I'm sure you well know, most of them
are written by Madison and Hamilton.

377
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:32,650
The federalists was not the only
printed defense of the constitution.

378
00:23:32,651 --> 00:23:36,610
There are lots of them. There's obviously,
as I said, it's a big print debate,

379
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,690
but the federalists was something that
was written with really big ambitions

380
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:45,010
because its authors really,
essentially we're creating a broad,

381
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:49,670
comprehensive step by step
defense of the constitution.

382
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,940
And they really hoped that by swaying
the state of New York in favor of

383
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:56,090
ratification,

384
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,650
maybe they would bring other states
like Virginia along in its wake.

385
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,520
The essays were all signed Publius.

386
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,920
The authors all wrote under the same
pseudonym because they actually wanted the

387
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:14,460
essays not to seem like
the crafty arguments of to
really leading nationalists

388
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,630
were going to say anything to get
us to sign on to the constitution.

389
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,610
They wanted to suggest that these were
just even handed rational ideas that were

390
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:27,470
sort of generally out in the
public sphere. Now, of course,

391
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:29,580
among insiders,
people figured out who the authors were,

392
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,900
even though supposedly no one's supposed
to know it's Boodley who can that be?

393
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,940
People figured it out pretty quickly
and sometimes the authors helped people

394
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:41,120
along.
And there's an anecdote about Hamilton.

395
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,690
I went digging to see if I could find
ultimate verification and I can't find the

396
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:47,270
ultimate verification, but I'm
going to offer it anyway. Um,

397
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,460
because there's a suppose
witness to the story,

398
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,820
but people aren't sure whether to
believe the witness at any rate.

399
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,860
Hamilton supposedly,

400
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,640
the day before his fatal duel with
Aaron Burr paid a call on a friend,

401
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,390
good 18th century named Egbert Vinson.
He went to visit Edward Benson,

402
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,490
who was a lawyer and supposedly one of
Benson's law clerks answered the door,

403
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,080
said that he would go find Benson, walked
off to find Benson. And as he came back,

404
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,510
he said he saw Hamilton
in Benson's library,

405
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,580
put something in a book and put the book
up on the shelf. And the clerk said,

406
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,310
Mr. Benson is not here. And
Allison said, thank you and left.

407
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:28,190
So of course the guy's like,
I knew it. That was right.

408
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:30,050
So he goes over to the shelf
and he pulls down the book.

409
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,970
He wants to see what it is and supposedly
what it was is a piece of paper in

410
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:37,970
Hamilton's and writing in which he'd
written all of the federalist essays that

411
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:41,540
were his, you know, supposedly the
night before the dual when he's like,

412
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,740
got my checklist of things I better do
in case I died tomorrow. Number One,

413
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,840
get credit for federalist
essays. No, you know,

414
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,580
it's unclear whether that
actually happened or didn't
happen that the guy, the,

415
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,570
the fellow who saw it in later years
said he did see it and said he saw the

416
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:02,000
piece of paper and said
the piece of paper,

417
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,250
at some point it was given to
the New York public library,

418
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,700
but then nobody quite knows where it
is and the New York public library. Um,

419
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,680
so it's unclear whether it
really happened, people that,

420
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:13,640
some people at the time insisted it really
did. Um, whether or not it really did.

421
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:17,510
The fact is that actually the people who
wrote it did care about it and didn't

422
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:19,630
care about which ones they wrote.
Um,

423
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,730
and we don't entirely know who wrote which
in some cases we know summer Hamilton

424
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:26,540
essays and Summer Madison essays.

425
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:29,750
And then there were somewhere it's
blurrier and historians argue, you know,

426
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:33,590
give one guy credit or the
other guy credit over who,
and I think that's partly,

427
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,600
well,
partly because they were rushing,

428
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,690
but also partly because in some cases
they probably were working together on

429
00:26:38,691 --> 00:26:40,190
some or sharing things.

430
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,980
The humbling thing to remember when you
read the federalist this week and this,

431
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,770
this actually should really mean
something to, to any student,

432
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:54,390
is that many of them are first drafts.
Those are rough drafts.

433
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,960
That just makes me want to cry
as a writer. It's like, oh,

434
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,280
why can't my rough drafts look
like that? These guys were, were,

435
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:06,360
were writing for newspapers,
so they were in a hurry sometimes,

436
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,950
literally like dashing something off and
getting it to the newspaper immediately.

437
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,890
So they're writing these in a hurry
there and don't have time for a lot of

438
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:18,630
revision. That to me is, is
in amazingly humbling thought.

439
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:25,260
All told there were 85
federalists essays. Um,

440
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:27,300
as I said,
they're published in New York newspapers.

441
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:31,350
The thought is they're going to sway the
New York ratification debate and they

442
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:34,320
appear between October,

443
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,320
1787 and may of 1788 and then later in
June of 1788 they get put out in book

444
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:45,600
form. And then obviously they
migrate wherever they migrate to.

445
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,880
Lots of other people read the federalist
now as suggested by its title.

446
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,500
The federalist,

447
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,160
while it did demonstrate a lot of
things about the new constitution,

448
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,320
it did have one overriding argument,

449
00:27:58,321 --> 00:28:02,850
and that was the benefits of
federalism, right? Not Nationalism.

450
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,400
And they're sure to stress that
throughout all of the essays,

451
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,570
we're not talking about
nationalism. Federal, federal
states are still important.

452
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,290
The subtext of the common
component of the federalist essays,

453
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:18,060
a federal government would energize
the government without prostrating the

454
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:21,690
states or trampling on the
American people. That's the
compromise, a federalism.

455
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:26,670
And as I mentioned at some point earlier
in an earlier lecture to demonstrate

456
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,760
just how badly this government
needed to be energized.

457
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:35,150
The federalists essay show again and
again the disaster that would reign if the

458
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:39,810
articles of confederation were allowed
to continue and at some point I did talk

459
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:44,190
about the sort of acts job that the
federalists essays due on the articles of

460
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:45,660
confederation.
They really want to,

461
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:49,380
because they have to prove
that the articles are so
bad that of course this new

462
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:51,390
constitution, it's the
perfect thing. It makes sense.

463
00:28:51,391 --> 00:28:53,040
You have to move in this direction.

464
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,300
So in New York and elsewhere,

465
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:02,810
the ratification debates roar on
state's proceeding at different paces.

466
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:08,450
But there is one thing that emerged from
these debates on the part of the Anti

467
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:14,150
federalists and it's actually is a
specific suggestion on their part specific

468
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:18,570
idea about something that has to be
there basically throughout the states.

469
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,080
One thing that anti federalists
consistently demanded with some kind of

470
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:25,290
guarantee of personal liberties,

471
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:30,890
some kind of a declaration of rights
like those that existed in many state

472
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:32,730
constitutions.

473
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:37,910
Something that would protect personal
liberties in the same document that seemed

474
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:42,370
to be investing this new government
with so much power. So in essence,

475
00:29:42,371 --> 00:29:46,180
the anti federalist want a bill of rights.
Now,

476
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:47,440
from our vantage point,

477
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,890
a bill of rights just seems like an
unquestionably good thing, right?

478
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:53,140
We love our bill of rights.
The bill of rights is good.

479
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,560
Why would the federalists
not want a bill of rights?

480
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,990
But the problem is some federalists did
have problems with this idea of a bill

481
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,660
of rights.
For one thing,

482
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,740
they claimed that the entire constitution,

483
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,520
by providing a well framed government
that had checks and balances that

484
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,050
government by election,
in a sense,

485
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:20,500
you could argue that that document was
so framed and the government was so

486
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:23,980
checked and balanced that it was in
and of itself a sort of bill of rights.

487
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:25,390
It was a controlled government.

488
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:30,940
They also said the federal government
has a numerated powers in this document.

489
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,261
So in other words,

490
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:36,280
a power that is not given to the
government is not owned by the government.

491
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,670
Why do we need a bill of rights
saying, Whoa, we need to protect power?

492
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,151
Of the press.

493
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:43,750
We haven't given power of the press to
the national government so why do we need

494
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:45,880
some lead to mention
it in a bill of rights?

495
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:51,060
Some federalist even argued that if we
start to write things down like put doc,

496
00:30:51,061 --> 00:30:52,450
you put rights into writing,

497
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,770
we might actually imply something bad
might actually imply like if we tried to

498
00:30:56,771 --> 00:31:01,480
define the freedom of press freedom
of religion and put it into words,

499
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,300
maybe the implication will be that
in some way or another the national

500
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:07,960
government actually does have
some power over those things.

501
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:10,180
Maybe once we get into the sea of rights,

502
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,870
we might lead people to be able to
conclude things about that government down

503
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:16,600
the road that we might
not want them to conclude.

504
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,350
But the anti federalist had a pretty
powerful argument in favor of a bill of

505
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:25,420
rights.
It was a multi leveled argument,

506
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:30,370
but one part of it was particularly
hard to argue with and that is any

507
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,420
Republican government,

508
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:36,421
any small r Republican government ought
to do everything that it could do to

509
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:39,100
keep it citizens aware of their rights,

510
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:44,200
including something like listing them
as amendments to the constitution.

511
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:46,450
In other words, the federalist
say, well I never republic.

512
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,320
The people need to know their rights,
they need to have them in writing.

513
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:55,540
So of course we should have a bill of
rights so that the American public knows

514
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,020
what their rights are.
In the end,

515
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:02,770
it was only with the promise that a list
of rights would be amended and added to

516
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:06,280
the constitution that it
was ultimately ratified.

517
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:11,580
And so one by one the states debated
and then over time decided to ratify the

518
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:14,860
constitution. Um, I think again,

519
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,460
as with so many things about this
period and the constitution debate,

520
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:23,590
we don't tend to think of it as a
real fight or debate or controversy.

521
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,520
We sort of see things turning along
and we imagined ratification of the

522
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:31,490
constitution equals a bunch of guys in a
room signing pieces of paper. Like hug,

523
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:35,260
ratify the end. Now let's have
a government. But in fact,

524
00:32:35,261 --> 00:32:39,190
people were really anxiously
watching this and curious,

525
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,920
our state's going to ratify how many
will ratify? Is this going to happen?

526
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:45,530
Won't it happen?
What happens if only half of them ratify?

527
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,440
This is something that people
all over the United States,

528
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,860
we're watching and wondering what was
going to happen here as freestyles helps

529
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,650
us out. One more time. Um,

530
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,270
because he put in his diary every time
he heard that a state had ratified the

531
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:02,330
constitution, though in the midst
of everything else in his diary,

532
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,440
you'll see like, um, on January 9th, 1788,

533
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:11,441
he writes that a Korea raced from Hartford
to new haven and made the entire trip

534
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:15,890
in a mere hour and six minutes,
which actually since it takes what,

535
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:18,860
like 45 minutes by car to go to Hartford,
an hour and six minutes,

536
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:20,360
it's pretty good for a horse,
I think.

537
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:25,670
So that guy really raised to announce
two new haven that Connecticut had

538
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,760
ratified the constitution. Right. And
he puts that down and he's clearly,

539
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:30,290
it was impressed with
the speed of the writer.

540
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:36,550
On February 11th new haven gets the news
that Massachusetts ratified styles puts

541
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:42,020
this in his diary and he adds bells were
rung throughout the city and Canon were

542
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,240
discharged.
So now clearly Connecticut has signed on,

543
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,300
they're watching to see who else is
signing on and when someone else does sign

544
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:51,410
on,
there's a celebration at the end of June.

545
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,810
Styles noted that at about
one 30 in the afternoon. And,

546
00:33:54,811 --> 00:33:56,900
and I love when they know what the
precise time, cause then you know,

547
00:33:56,901 --> 00:34:00,710
it's something they believe to be
significant. At one 30 this afternoon,

548
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:06,010
new haven received the news that New
Hampshire had ratified and that New

549
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,460
Hampshire is the ninth state.

550
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,620
So what that means is that now the
constitution could go into effect and it

551
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,380
styles described it.
As soon as the news arrived,

552
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,270
the four bills and the city were set a
ringing and the federal flag displayed

553
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,000
and federal federal discharges of Canyon.

554
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:26,750
What does it actually a federal discharge
of cannon? I don't know what a federal,

555
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:29,960
I never typed that out without stopping
to think what a federal discharge of

556
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:30,321
Canada,

557
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:35,180
but there was a federal discharge of
Canon and rejoicing general rejoicing in

558
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:38,810
new haven like the constitution has
kicked in. Thank you. New Hampshire.

559
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,960
Meanwhile, throughout this period style
still had Yale college seniors debating

560
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,170
constitutional issues.

561
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,870
If you are not interested in politics
at this point at Yale College,

562
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:49,580
you were in deep trouble.
Um,

563
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:53,810
he had them debate whether it had been
better to refer the new constitution to

564
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:58,250
ratification by town meetings or a
plurality of personal votes of all the

565
00:34:58,251 --> 00:35:01,130
Freeman of the United States.
Now that's kind of interesting actually.

566
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,150
That's kind of a radical thing for him
to ask the students to debate or whether

567
00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:08,360
the president of Congress,
president of Congress,

568
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,590
the president ought to be visited with
an independent power of commanding the

569
00:35:12,591 --> 00:35:13,424
American army.

570
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:18,440
If you're curious about what other things
styles has people debating in addition

571
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:20,390
to random constitutional issues.

572
00:35:20,391 --> 00:35:23,090
I just have a little sampling here to
give you a sense of what it would have

573
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:27,320
been like to be a senior at
Yale college in 1788 and 1789.

574
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,720
Um, they debated whether the breaking
up of the Roman Empire by the GAAPS and

575
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,220
vandals was prejudicial to
the progress of literature.

576
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,830
Kod doing that one day and
then the next day like, uh, no,

577
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,460
let's talk about the president.
Um,

578
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,100
they debated whether the
scriptures are divinely inspired,

579
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,230
whether good policies ever inconsistent
with justice and whether all mankind

580
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:50,870
descended from Adam. Okay. That's,

581
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,290
so that's a wide ranging bunch
of things they're debating. Um,

582
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,330
I love the fact that style's always
puts that in his diary, you know,

583
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,650
so it's actually fascinating just to read
through and see what students were set

584
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:05,430
to discuss at a given time.
Okay.

585
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:10,431
So we've seen a national
debate over a new constitution.

586
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:16,220
We've seen a debate taking place between
people who by no means had an absolute

587
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,880
consensus about what kind of
government should be put into place.

588
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,210
Given that this was a national debate,

589
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:28,950
what does it show us about the
state of the nation at the time?

590
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:33,360
What does it really suggest about
the new nation and its principles?

591
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,270
Well,
certainly for one thing,

592
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,510
underneath all of the disagreement
and the wrangling and the arguing,

593
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,640
there was some consensus.

594
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:46,620
So certainly both federalists and
anti federalists agreed that I,

595
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:50,520
small r Republican government
was the general aim and goal.

596
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,260
A government based on popular
sovereignty on the will of the people,

597
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:00,890
a government that place the ultimate
power in the hands of the people.

598
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,020
So that's a general consensus.

599
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,820
I'm going to talk in a
moment about what that means,

600
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:07,980
but certainly in a general way
people could agree on that.

601
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,970
Americans also could generally agree that
this was an experiment in government,

602
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,200
that it was something unique,

603
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,870
that they were experimenting in the
possibility of having people sit down and

604
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:24,420
deliberately create,
adjust government,

605
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:29,370
grounded on the rights and will of the
populace and to to communicate this,

606
00:37:29,371 --> 00:37:31,830
to get this across. Um, I'm
going to read something.

607
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:33,320
I don't think I've read this before.
Have I?

608
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,150
I don't think I've read
the first paragraph or the
first couple sentences from

609
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:37,290
the first federalist essay.

610
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,320
I went digging back in the other lectures
and I don't think I've done it yet and

611
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:43,320
if I have, you're going to have to listen
to it twice. But I don't think I have.

612
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,420
Um, and I tend to read these couple
sentences in a lot of my classes, um,

613
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,480
because I think they really capture
this idea about experimentation that's

614
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,070
looming over what they're
doing at the time.

615
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,770
The sense that they really
are deciding something major,

616
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,320
not just in the constitution
that they're creating,

617
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:04,320
but also in the process by
which they're creating it.

618
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:05,940
That the fact that they're deliberating,

619
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,440
debating and then creating
and it's stepping back to
allow it to go into effect.

620
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,860
That also is something that
they see as major. So this is,

621
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:18,540
this is from within the first paragraph,
a federalist number one by Hamilton.

622
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:24,150
It has been frequently remarked that
it seems to have been reserved to the

623
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:28,410
people of this country by their conduct
and example to decide the important

624
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:33,411
question whether societies of men are
really capable or not of establishing good

625
00:38:33,571 --> 00:38:38,320
government from reflection and choice
or whether they are forever destined to

626
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:43,120
depend for their political
constitutions on accident and force.

627
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:48,520
The crisis at which we are arrived may
with propriety be regarded as the era in

628
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:53,521
which that decision is to be made and a
wrong election of the part we shall act,

629
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:59,020
may deserve to be considered as
the general misfortune of mankind.

630
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,870
Okay.
UHMM like that's a big statement.

631
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:05,680
He's literally saying the United
States is deciding for all time.

632
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:09,700
If you can sit and deliberate and
create a just government or not,

633
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,890
and if we do something stupid,

634
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:15,910
the answer would appear
to be not for all time.

635
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,610
So this experiment is
not just an experiment,

636
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:21,550
but it's one that to people at
the time actually means something.

637
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,640
They feel that they're proving something
in this experiment that they're

638
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:29,470
undertaking. It has real
consequences. Now, that said,

639
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,920
of course, even with the
ratification of the constitution,

640
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
all kinds of questions are still looming
about exactly how this experiment was

641
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:44,401
going to play out or indeed
if it would survive at all,

642
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,980
and wrapped up in this question about
what's going to happen with the government

643
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,360
is a deeper question about whether the
promise of the revolution is actually

644
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:56,290
going to be fulfilled. The revolution
has all of this promise attached to it.

645
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:00,850
There's all of this debate about how
to bring that kind of promise to life.

646
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,800
Here's one try.
It's a constitution.

647
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:06,490
We're going to put it into effect and
people now have to step back and see if

648
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:08,200
it's going to work and many,

649
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:12,310
many people that are absolutely not
convinced that it's going to fulfill all

650
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:14,260
that promise that was
unleashed by the revolution.

651
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,480
It's one thing to assign power in a
document and it's another thing to really

652
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:22,750
bring that document to life.
If you think about our constitution,

653
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,160
it's a pretty short document. It's
pretty brief. It's, it's a framework.

654
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,050
It doesn't go into lots of detail,

655
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:34,030
so there's a lot of things that had to
be fleshed out and worked out once that

656
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:37,720
government went into effect
and in Thursday's lecture.

657
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,390
I'm going to touch on some of that.

658
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:44,290
I'm going to talk a little bit about how
this begins to play out in the 70s and

659
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:49,291
nineties and what that suggests about
the legacy of the revolution overall.

660
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,580
I will stop there.
I will see you on Thursday or last class.
