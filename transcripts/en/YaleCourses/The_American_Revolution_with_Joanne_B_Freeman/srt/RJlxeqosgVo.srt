1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,003
Okay.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,760
So a quick review of what we covered
on Thursday in the first of these two

3
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:17,151
lectures in which I'm going to be talking
about the war and hopefully as you

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,590
hopefully remember,

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,280
we began by talking about the British
and the logic of their actions during the

6
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:27,151
war.

7
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:32,151
And I talked for a little while
about a number of their logistical

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,180
disadvantages,
like um,

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,700
problems getting supplies and then
dragging them all over the American

10
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:43,140
countryside. Like the large expanse
of land that the British confronted.

11
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:45,540
That was one big battlefield in a sense.

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,760
The ways in which some kind of
traditional battle strategies,

13
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:55,500
war strategies didn't necessarily
work so well in this campaign.

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,680
And along the same lines that they were
different kinds of challenges that the

15
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:03,490
British faced in fighting
against a citizen army. Um,

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,430
I talked about how Britain couldn't
turn its back on the rest of the world,

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,260
particularly France.

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,050
They had to keep an eye on what France
was doing in France is you're going to

19
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:16,170
see in today's lecture is
going to play a large role.

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,960
And then finally I talked about the
simple fact that for the British to when

21
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,380
they needed to stamp out a widespread
rebellion over large expansive land,

22
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,540
while the Americans didn't necessarily
have to defeat the British to emerge

23
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,171
victorious,

24
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:39,171
they just had to keep fighting long
enough to exhaust British supplies and

25
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:43,230
funding and energies.
And I also mentioned, um,

26
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:46,770
a few mistaken assumptions
on the part of the British,

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,510
like the way that they consistently
underestimated the Americans.

28
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,160
And then along similar lines,

29
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,190
the ways in which they
consistently overestimated
the amount of loyalist support

30
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,840
that they were expecting
to find in the colonies.

31
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,000
And I spent time in Thursday's class
going into those kinds of details before

32
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:11,001
talking about phases of war and strategies
and things like that because they

33
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:15,780
help us to understand the logic of
British military strategies throughout the

34
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:19,080
war. I think it's really easy to
look back on any historical event,

35
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:22,560
but I think it's particularly true for
the American revolution that leads to the

36
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:23,520
American founding.

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,710
It's easy to look back and blame
the loser for making dumb mistakes,

38
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,300
but they were really logical reasons
for what the British did during this

39
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:33,841
campaign.

40
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:37,230
And that's part of what I'm trying to
bring out in last week's lecture and in

41
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:39,660
today's lecture that there were logical,

42
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,210
logistical reasons why
they did what they did.

43
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:46,560
There are equally logical reasons as to
why the war ultimately had the outcome

44
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,300
that it did.
Um,

45
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,570
but all of those things that I talked
about in the last lecture at the start

46
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,070
show how the British were acting under
pretty challenging circumstances and they

47
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:59,830
were guiding their decisions and doing
whatever they decided to do based on

48
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:04,570
whatever information and insight
and tradition they had at hand.

49
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,820
So their actions have a logic.
And I,

50
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:11,410
I bring that up at the start
of this lecture because
it's part of what I've been

51
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:14,800
doing overall in this class
over the course of the semester.

52
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,230
And that is throughout whatever
I've been lecturing about. Um,

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,280
I've tried to explain the logic and
reasoning behind people's choices and

54
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,600
decisions to give you a view of unfolding
events from the viewpoints of people

55
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:31,000
who were there. Now, of course,

56
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,810
it's just inherently interesting to look
at historical events from the viewpoint

57
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:35,561
of people who are there.

58
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:39,040
So that's part of the reason why I do
this because it's interesting and it's fun

59
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,800
and I find it fascinating,
but more important,

60
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,240
I actually take this approach because
I want to emphasize the idea that the

61
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:49,870
revolution wasn't inevitable.
It wasn't an inevitable event,

62
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,220
it wasn't a good revolt
against bad people.

63
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,090
It was actually a product
of individual choices,

64
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,910
individual actions on all sides.

65
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,060
And that's ultimately what
history is all about, right?

66
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:07,450
It's about people making
choices and then taking action.

67
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,630
And particularly in the case of
the American founding period,

68
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,250
I think it's an important
thing to remember because
it's easy to forget that the

69
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:19,120
revolution and its aftermath warrant
inevitable or inherently right?

70
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,130
And it has to do with
our nation's founding.

71
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:23,650
So it's natural to sort
of assume those things.

72
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:28,060
But neither one of those things helps us
to really understand what was unfolding

73
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,840
as the revolution unfolded.
So basically in all of my classes,

74
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:36,841
I always try to counter this sort of
seeming inevitability of things in the

75
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:42,070
founding period by really
trying to recreate the logic
of decisions at that time

76
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,941
in that moment.

77
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:46,210
So that's part of why I've been focusing
in that way throughout the semester.

78
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,670
But okay, back to the decisions of the
revolution. Um, and Thursday's lecture,

79
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,930
the bulk of my lecture on Thursday was
spent discussing three of the four faces

80
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,160
of the revolution. Um, and again,

81
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:04,870
hopefully you remember I defined these
phases based on shifts in British

82
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,640
strategy at various points.
So the British would shift their strategy,

83
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,110
the Americans would respond,

84
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,800
and then that phase would continue
until there'd be a new shift in a new

85
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,130
response. Um, just to
review very briefly here,

86
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:23,131
the first phase lasted until roughly July
of 1776 and was largely guided on the

87
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:28,660
part of the British by the assumption
that just a little coercion and maybe a

88
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,740
little sign of reconciliation would be
all of the Americans needed to sort of

89
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:36,250
push them into backing away and
would bring matters to a close.

90
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,210
That phase lasted through July,

91
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,410
1776 and at that point the British
stepped up their strategy by deciding to

92
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,970
seize New York,

93
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,200
seemingly one of the major cities
in the colonies. And again,

94
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:53,410
by sort of traditional war standards,
you get a major city,

95
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:54,910
you turn the tide of war.

96
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,580
Plus the British were hoping that if
they could sort of separate new England

97
00:05:58,581 --> 00:05:59,690
from the rest of the colonies,

98
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:03,290
they might isolate the troublemakers
up in New England. And again,

99
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:07,910
maybe that would draw things to a
close. Um, in part at that point,

100
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:12,911
the British were underestimating
the intercolonial and
inter regional bonds that

101
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:17,240
were beginning to be forged
throughout the conflict thus far.

102
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,580
And they also were over estimating what
it would mean along those same lines to

103
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:23,840
isolate New England.

104
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,820
So that strategy obviously didn't end
things which leads us to the third phase

105
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:33,821
which began in 1777 and that phase
largely consisted of the British trying to

106
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:40,121
subdue the middle colonies
now states by 1777 again,

107
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,080
sort of the basic assumption being keep
going for those major cities and if we

108
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:47,990
get enough of those major cities,
they're going to have to cave.

109
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,240
So now Philadelphia and Pennsylvania
become major targets in this third phase.

110
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,510
And then I ended the lecture by talking
about America's shocking victory at the

111
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:03,200
battle of Saratoga, which ended up
being a real turning point in the war.

112
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:06,800
And I'm going to go a little bit more
into that reasons why that's the case

113
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,980
today. But I do want to mention
at the, at the very end,

114
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:11,420
after I finished my lecture on Thursday,

115
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:16,421
a few people came up to me with questions
about precisely how the Americans won

116
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,540
at Saratoga.

117
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,530
Cause I just sort of generally talked
about problems with supplies and then the

118
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:25,040
Americans won. And a few
people had questions. Well,
what actually really happened?

119
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,730
So I'll offer just a little bit more
detail here to give you a sense of how it

120
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:32,120
is that the Americans came to
have this unexpected victory.

121
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,700
So remember at that point,

122
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,890
British General Howe is headed off to
Philadelphia as part of the major sort of,

123
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,560
um,
attempt of that third phase of the war.

124
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,920
So General John per going is up north
with his army and Lo and behold,

125
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:52,460
part of the continental army under
her ratio gates general Horatio gates,

126
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,910
attacks Burgoyne and gates,

127
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,660
part of the army is joined by
another part of the continental army,

128
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,760
led by General Benjamin Lincoln.

129
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,840
Also militia men from nearby
areas individually and in
groups began heading to

130
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:13,250
Saratoga when they sort of got a sense
that something major was happening there.

131
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,670
So by October 7th of 17,
77,

132
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,180
there were roughly 11,000 American troops
all told facing roughly 5,000 British

133
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:27,890
troops under Burgoyne. So now we're
going isn't a little bit of trouble.

134
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,240
And how couldn't help him because
he's down in the south somewhere.

135
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,050
And for a little while for going thought
that there might be another group of

136
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:39,620
British soldiers led by Sir Henry
Clinton coming to save the day.

137
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,640
Clinton and his men did
not come to the rescue.

138
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,740
So per going is in trouble.

139
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:49,400
And to give you just a little sense
of what I'm talking about here, um,

140
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,810
here's a quote from a British lieutenant
who actually took part in the battle

141
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:59,040
and he writes that on October 7th
in his regiment, quote, our Canon,

142
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,970
we're surrounded and taken the
men and horses being all killed,

143
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,680
which gave them the Americans additional
spirits and they rushed on with loud

144
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:12,330
shouts when we drove them back a little
way with so great a loss to ourselves,

145
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,380
it evidently appeared to retreat was
the only thing left for us. Okay?

146
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,860
So that's a British soldier taking
part describing massive deaths.

147
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,790
The Americans get cheered by
what's happening and sort of surge.

148
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,450
And the British come to the realization
that they're going to have to retreat.

149
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,050
So Americans ultimately wage a war on the
actual fort at Saratoga and ultimately

150
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:38,721
breach the fort and per going withdrew
his army to the heights of Saratoga.

151
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,010
He lost roughly 600 men,

152
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,910
which was about four times the number
of Americans that are killed in that

153
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:45,331
battle.

154
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:49,170
And that's the moment where we're going
meets with his chiefs of Staff and

155
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:53,310
decides that at this point what they
need to do is actually surrender.

156
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,980
And I mentioned at the very
end of Thursday's lecture,

157
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,520
the surrender ceremony when both sides
were sort of so shocked at what was

158
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,870
unfolding that they,

159
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:04,500
everyone was sort of quiet and the
Americans sort of had their eyes down

160
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:07,770
supposedly because they couldn't quite
believe what was happening in front of

161
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:08,580
them.

162
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,580
Now I'm going to mention one last fact
regarding Saratoga that I just sort of

163
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:15,720
stumbled across today actually.

164
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:19,860
But I thought it was really interesting
because it relates back to my earlier

165
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:24,780
point about the British overestimating
the amount of loyal support that they had

166
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:28,200
in America after he lost the battle.

167
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,670
We're going ends up going back to England
and he ends up getting examined by

168
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:36,150
parliament to explain exactly
what happened at Saratoga.

169
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:37,770
That must've been really fun for Burgoyne.

170
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:43,320
And here are just one or two sentences
from his testimony before parliament.

171
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,710
He said with the Tories have risen,

172
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,310
why did they not rise
round Albany and below it?

173
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:53,400
At the time they found Mr.
Gates army increasing Mr. Gates,

174
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,630
not general gates army.

175
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,820
A critical insurrection from any one
point of the compass within distance to

176
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:04,170
create a diversion would probably have
secured the success of the campaign.

177
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,250
So there is, we're going
talking to parliament and
saying, where were the Tories?

178
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,600
Like just a little action.

179
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:13,590
Some diversion on the part of American
Tory's might've saved the day,

180
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:15,990
but where were they? I
didn't. They weren't there.

181
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,670
So he's puzzled and he's partly blaming
that for what happened at Saratoga.

182
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,820
So the victory at Saratoga accomplished
important things militarily.

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,391
Of course,

184
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:31,650
psychologically it was a
tremendous victory for the
Americans after a series of

185
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,820
somewhat less inspiring battle moments.
But in many ways,

186
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:41,150
the most important impact of the battle
of Saratoga was on the world stage

187
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:47,510
because when news of the battle reached
Europe in December of 1777 it gave some

188
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:54,280
credibility to the American cause,
particularly in France,

189
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,930
which the Americans had already been
eyeing as a potential source of support

190
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,540
during the war,
and that makes sense.

191
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,810
Given Francis Longstanding
and muddy to England,

192
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:09,100
it makes perfect sense that the Americans
think, hm, maybe even the French,

193
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:12,790
you're going to come eight us as we're
fighting against their longtime enemy.

194
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,850
Now,
Franklin,

195
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:20,851
Benjamin Franklin was in Paris at this
point when the news begins to reach

196
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:21,670
Europe,

197
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:26,050
he is serving as an American
ambassador and while he's in France,

198
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:28,030
he proved that among his many talents,

199
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:33,031
he had an amazing talent at self promotion
because although he was an extremely

200
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:35,950
cultured American,

201
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,790
he was incredibly shrewd at
playing the American in Paris.

202
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,810
Basically he knew what the French sort
of expected Americans to be like and they

203
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:47,290
thought Americans are going to be
the sort of simple, pure, virtuous,

204
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,190
natural backwoods been.
So there's Franklin,

205
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,060
he's in the splendor,
the grand splendor of the French court,

206
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,430
and he dressed really,
really simply.

207
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,380
And many of you have
probably seen this image.

208
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:01,900
He always wore this sort of for cap.
Like,

209
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:05,350
I just went out and killed myself on
animal and now I'm wearing this hat,

210
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,050
you know, like, yeah, I'm
a backwoods philosopher,

211
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:11,500
was basically the role he was playing
was the sort of amazing, rustic,

212
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:14,410
natural backwoods American philosopher.

213
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,560
He continually presented
himself in that way,

214
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:21,490
which really stood out among all
the splendor of the French court.

215
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,920
And the French absolutely adored it.

216
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,940
He became a sort of fad
of the French court.

217
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,680
There were countless portraits and
images made of him. He was put on dishes.

218
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,950
He was put on medallions,
uh, as Franklin himself,

219
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:39,580
put it in my face is now almost as
well known, is that of the moon, right?

220
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,290
They just adored him in France.

221
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,660
Apparently Franklin also knew how to
enjoy himself and France because a little

222
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:47,710
later in the war,

223
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,800
one of Washington's aids was sent
to France to control Franklin.

224
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,780
Sort of keep him from having
a little bit too much fun. Um,

225
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,190
let's just say that Franklin who was in
his seventies at this point, so he's,

226
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,660
you know,
advanced in age,

227
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,460
Franklin liked the ladies and the ladies
liked Franklin and particularly given

228
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:07,720
that he was the fad of the court,

229
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:12,430
I think Franklin had a very enjoyable
time in Paris. And so Washington,

230
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,640
one of Washington's aids actually gets
sent to sort of babies had Benjamin

231
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,360
Franklin.

232
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Now all of this adulation of
Franklin irked John Adams.

233
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,110
Surprise,
surprise.

234
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,800
John Adams really sort of on some
fundamental level thought that he,

235
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,120
he deserves some too.
And Franklin was so beloved,

236
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,610
it really proved irksome to Adams.

237
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,820
He had kept a diary and in the diary he
tend to do record adulation moments of

238
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:39,911
Franklin.

239
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:44,210
Like here's another one of
those darn moments where
they just loved this guy. Um,

240
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,900
and I want to offer one just so you can
get a sense of what this would have been

241
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,840
like. I guess both for
Adams and Franklin. Um,

242
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:53,570
this is from Adams diary from
his journal from April 29,

243
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:56,180
1778 and this is what Adam's writes.

244
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,830
After dinner we went to the
Academy of Sciences Voltaire.

245
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:03,650
And Franklin were both present
and they're presently arose.

246
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,320
A general cry that Miss Your Voltaire,

247
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:08,330
I Miss Your Franklin should
be introduced to each other.

248
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,340
This was done and they bowed and spoke
to each other. This was no satisfaction.

249
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:14,780
There must be something more.

250
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,070
Neither of our philosophers seem to
divine what was wished or expected. They,

251
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:22,400
however, it took each other by
the hand, but this was not enough.

252
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:25,040
The clamor continued until
the explanation came out.

253
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,950
It'll Folsom plus Aalf ponces right?
They have to,

254
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,750
they have to embrace themselves.
French style,

255
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,150
the two aged actors upon this great
theater of philosophy and frivolity then

256
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,730
embraced each other by hugging
one another in their arms,

257
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,630
kissing each other's cheeks,
and then the tumbled subsided.

258
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,680
So there's Franklin sort of
everyday existence in Paris,

259
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,790
which was pretty extreme. So Franklin
is, they're living it up in Paris.

260
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,070
He's there when news of Saratoga
reaches France on hearing the News,

261
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,370
France decides ultimately that they're
going to formally recognize America as an

262
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:01,970
independent nation.

263
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:06,020
Obviously with Franklin and Adams
and others helping things along,

264
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,370
and upon recognizing America
as an independent nation,

265
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,820
the French went one step further and
agreed to enter the war as allies to the

266
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:21,230
Americans. So obviously Saratoga happens,
the news gets to Europe, France hears it,

267
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,930
and those are two major developments.

268
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,300
France recognizes American independence.

269
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,560
France joins the war on
the side of the Americans.

270
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,200
With this agreement, this really major
two agreements for the first time,

271
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:39,800
there seemed to be a remote possibility
that the Americans might actually have a

272
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:42,530
chance of being victorious.
This is a major,

273
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:47,060
major ally that's just signed
up on the American side.

274
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,710
Not only did the French bring
credibility to the American cause,

275
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,760
but of course they also brought military
supplies and most important of all is

276
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:59,270
we're going to see a little later in the
lecture they brought the French navy.

277
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,110
America at this point is still
figuring out how to have a navy.

278
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,470
So having the French navy
was of huge importance.

279
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:13,450
Now it's important to note at this point
that it's not the dynamic here isn't

280
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:18,320
that the French were so inspired by the
nobility of the American cause that they

281
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:21,050
decided they would join the
war with the Americans there.

282
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,690
That is true for some French individuals.

283
00:17:23,691 --> 00:17:27,080
I'll talk a little bit more later on
in the lecture about the Marquis de

284
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,081
Lafayette.

285
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:31,610
He's one of a number of people
who actually were inspired
by the American cause.

286
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,200
But as a nation,

287
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,550
the French were particularly eager to
help the Americans because they assumed

288
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:42,320
that after the war they might be able
to take over much of the lucrative trade

289
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,590
with America that the British
had controlled before.

290
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:51,250
So basically joining America in this war
effort was an investment now that they

291
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,510
thought would probably pay off later.

292
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:58,710
And of course add to that the fact
that by aligning themselves with the

293
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:03,330
Americans, they're now fighting
their long term, long time enemy,

294
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,990
the British. So that makes it an
attractive proposition as well.

295
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,700
So in February of 1778 France
signed two treaties with America.

296
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,060
The first was the Treaty
of Amity and Commerce,

297
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,220
the Treaty of Amity.

298
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:28,221
And comers that said that
France recognized the
United States as a sovereign

299
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,173
nation.

300
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,520
Yeah.

301
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,750
It also said that France
had trading privileges with
America as a favored nation,

302
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,880
but America preserved the
right of free trade. Second,

303
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,570
France signed the Treaty of alliance

304
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:50,430
that would go into effect if war erupted
between England and France because of

305
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:54,090
the first tree,
which indeed it did five months later.

306
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,120
So basically the first tree of
Amity and Commerce is signed.

307
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,020
Britain and France now decide they're
warring and then Francis. Okay.

308
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:02,850
Now the Treaty of alliance
is going into effect.

309
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,730
We are now officially allied with America.

310
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,520
The stated purpose of the Treaty of
alliance was to assure the quote, liberty,

311
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,440
sovereignty and independence,

312
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,740
absolute and unlimited
of the United States,

313
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,990
France renounced claims to
the mainland of North America,

314
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,850
east of the Mississippi,

315
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,280
or to the Bermuda islands if
captured by America. In return,

316
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:34,281
France asks the United States to recognize
whatever France might capture in the

317
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:35,670
West indies.
In other words,

318
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:40,200
a France capture some British islands
in the West indies. America says, fine,

319
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,900
we'll recognize that for sure.

320
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,620
America was given a free
hand to conquer Canada.

321
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:53,100
Yay. Conquer Canada could think
we got that in the treaty.

322
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,540
And then,
um,

323
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,540
both sides agreed not to negotiate for
peace without consent of the other.

324
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,100
So now you've got Britain and
France in war against one another.

325
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,480
And with that,

326
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,400
the American revolution becomes something
of a world war because Spain and the

327
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:17,550
Dutch ultimately join on
the side of the French.

328
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:22,551
So now Europe and European powers and
their own disputes also ended up playing a

329
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,330
role in who siding with
who during the revolution.

330
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,810
Now it's really important to note at
this point that with the involvement of

331
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:37,800
other European nations, and particularly
with the involvement of France,

332
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,280
America became far less of a central
concern to the British who now felt

333
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:49,281
compelled to send thousands of soldiers
to the west to guard against French

334
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,703
invasion,

335
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:56,220
which means that less manpower was
available to fight in the United States,

336
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,780
the West indies,

337
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:01,810
or what at the time that would have been
known as the sugar islands where the

338
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:05,440
truly great prizes as far
as colonies were concerned,

339
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:08,590
they were greater prizes than
the North American colonies.

340
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,980
That's where the real money was in,
in the sugar islands.

341
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,250
So some British manpower very naturally
went right to the indies to protect

342
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:22,210
British properties from the French.
At this point,

343
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,350
feeling a little desperate because
of the French American alliance.

344
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,400
The British actually make one
last stab at reconciliation.

345
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:33,430
They're persistent though.
As we'll see in a few minutes.

346
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,470
They made some misjudgments
that ultimately did not
achieve the success of this

347
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:39,304
attempt.

348
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,660
On February 17th,

349
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:48,660
1778 lord north proposed in the House
of Commons be conciliatory propositions.

350
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,790
The conciliatory propositions,
February 17th, 1778

351
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,710
and the propositions called for the repeal
of all of the acts that Americans had

352
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:06,550
found obnoxious. Right?
Okay, well take it all back.

353
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,450
No standing army in time
of peace in the colonies.

354
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,310
No changes in colonial charters unless
colonial assemblies request them.

355
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:20,910
England would agree to consider American
representation in parliament or if

356
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:25,480
American's preferred to recognize
the American Congress as a permanent

357
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:27,760
institution. Right? Suddenly
England's like, okay,

358
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:33,270
we'll take back all the things you hate
if we just end this now based on those

359
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:36,310
propositions,
a conciliatory propositions,

360
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:41,350
a British commission was sent to America
with instructions to deal with the

361
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:44,650
continental Congress by
this point in a sense. Um,

362
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,750
it's also could be called
the confederation Congress,

363
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:49,180
but I'll talk more about the
confederation later on. Um,

364
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,780
to deal the continental congress
as if it was a legal body.

365
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,430
But Congress refused to appoint
commissioners to meet with a British

366
00:22:57,431 --> 00:22:58,780
commissioners.
Instead,

367
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,830
they considered the propositions on their
own in Congress and then sent a letter

368
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:07,750
with their response to the British
commissioners as Henry Lawrence,

369
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:11,050
who's the president of the congress
at the time. Put it in this letter,

370
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,780
the acts of the British parliament,
the commission for your sovereign right,

371
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,980
your sovereign,
not our sovereign and your letter.

372
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,730
Suppose the people of the states to be
subjects of the crown of Great Britain

373
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:27,370
and her founded on the idea of dependence,

374
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,290
which is utterly inadmissible.
And Lawrence then went
on to add that, you know,

375
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,460
if the British wanted,

376
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,760
the Americans would be happy to talk
about peace if the king would either admit

377
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:42,070
American independence or withdraw
all of his forces from America.

378
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:43,810
So it's a British are ready to do that.

379
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:47,000
The Americans say we're willing
to talk to you otherwise, no,

380
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,540
there were not willing to admit that
we're dependent on you in any way.

381
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:53,060
This is utterly inadmissible.
Take them back.

382
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,070
So clearly it's too late for what
could have been some pretty radical

383
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,680
propositions at this point.

384
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:05,270
We come to the misjudgments because the
British commission made the fatal error

385
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,000
when they realize that that
angle wasn't going to work.

386
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,960
They tried to bribe some high
ranked American officials,

387
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:15,290
including George Washington,
who they offered to make a Duke.

388
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,300
If George Washington would agree to their
terms as one of the commissioners put

389
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:24,680
it, Washington is certainly to
be bought honors, we'll do it.

390
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,750
And I'm assuming that you
know the commission somewhere
or others thinking back

391
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:32,960
to Washington and the French and Indian
war and he's an ambitious guy and he

392
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,010
actually wants military honors. So the
British were thinking we can buy him,

393
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,760
like show them a couple honors. He's
an ambitious guy. We've got him.

394
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,920
They also attempted to bribe
Franklin as well. Again,

395
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:49,160
showing some misjudgment on the part of
the British towards either one of those

396
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,180
men.
Um,

397
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,590
and also assuming clearly how wonderfully
attractive British honors would be,

398
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,770
that they would easily seduced
either one of these two men.

399
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,490
Neither one of them was
attracted to this British honors.

400
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,300
We're not going to sway them from
their cause. So not surprisingly,

401
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,780
both sides of this British
effort where a complete flop.

402
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,453
Okay.

403
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Now we're about to advance to the
fourth and final phase of the war.

404
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,750
But I do want to mention something else
that happened in the winter of 1777

405
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:25,940
before I move on to this fourth
phase. And that is the, uh,

406
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:29,050
the American armies and
camp men at valley forge.

407
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,050
Yeah.

408
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,970
They're Americans for time,

409
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:37,170
had really serious problems getting
supplies and these supplies are always a

410
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:40,780
problem generally,
partly because the congress,

411
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,890
the continental Congress does not
have a way of insisting on anything.

412
00:25:43,891 --> 00:25:46,130
I mentioned back when we
talked about organizing a war,

413
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,120
the continental congress
was not very strong,

414
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,170
couldn't demand things from the
states, could just ask, so supplies,

415
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:54,030
organizing supplies was a problem,

416
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,240
but at valley forge they
became a serious problem.

417
00:25:57,241 --> 00:25:59,940
Even just basic supplies like food,

418
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,710
partly because of the weakness of the
continental congress as well as a simple

419
00:26:04,711 --> 00:26:07,560
lack of organization and
actually some graft as well.

420
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:13,320
So men were starving some of them
half naked, some froze to death,

421
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,750
hundreds of horses starve to death.

422
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,700
The army didn't dissolve or mutiny at
this point, which actually says something,

423
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:26,280
but the experience of valley
forge suggested to some
of the men at Washington's

424
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:30,660
headquarters that there were problems
with the weakness of the continental

425
00:26:30,661 --> 00:26:31,230
congress.

426
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:35,520
And I'm going to come back to this lesson
in future lectures when we begin to

427
00:26:35,521 --> 00:26:40,521
talk about the articles of confederation
and the lead up to the constitutional

428
00:26:40,741 --> 00:26:45,570
convention because the experience of
Revolution taught some people are led,

429
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:50,571
some people to believe that
they had learned some hard
lessons about what wasn't

430
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:54,540
present there as what were during the war
as far as the government was concerned

431
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:59,850
and led them to believe something stronger
needed to be there. So in some ways,

432
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,700
um, working at Washington's
headquarters during the war,

433
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,150
it was like a little nationalist creating
machine where people at the center who

434
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:10,230
saw how things were so hard to
organize because of the weakness of the

435
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:11,064
continental congress.

436
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,760
Many of those people ended up believing
that there needed to be a stronger

437
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:19,420
government after the war that will
come in future lectures. Okay.

438
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:22,620
That brings us to the fourth
and final phase of the war.

439
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,120
It's the southern campaign.

440
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,440
The southern campaign
lasted from 1779 to 1781

441
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:37,430
and this phase is marked by a decision
on the part of the British to transfer

442
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:39,810
their attention to the south,

443
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,150
hoping that by possessing ports of
the south closer to the West indies,

444
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,420
they can maybe maneuver there fighting
better. They can keep their eye on,

445
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:50,460
was ever have whatever's
happening in the indies.

446
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:53,460
They can also fight the
Americans in the south as well.

447
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:59,210
Here the British again made a faulty
assumption because they assumed that the

448
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:02,820
south would be an easy target because
they assumed that there'd be a large

449
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,490
reservoir of loyalist support,

450
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,030
so they really assumed they
would seize key southern ports.

451
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:12,540
There'd be all these loyalists there to
help them and then they would move their

452
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:13,560
way back north,

453
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,550
taking one region after another
as they worked their way north.

454
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:23,910
So the British sailed to the Carolinas.
They took Charles town, South Carolina,

455
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:27,030
which was the most important
city south of Philadelphia.

456
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,440
They then left behind British general
Charles Co Cornwallis with kind of a

457
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:38,460
mopping up crew in the south while the
rest of the army began to move north to

458
00:28:38,461 --> 00:28:40,770
attack the rest of the continental army.

459
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,870
Between 1779 and 1781,

460
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,070
there was a series of battles between the
Americans and the British in the south.

461
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,730
American suffered defeat after defeat.
They persisted,

462
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,050
but they were not winning these
battles. The British one, Georgia,

463
00:28:58,051 --> 00:29:02,940
they already had Charleston and then the
British began to pursue the Americans

464
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,470
into Virginia and that's where
the Americans began to rally.

465
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:13,440
Now, in part, this is due
once again to supply problems.

466
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:16,350
This time for the British
army, um, for Cornwallis,

467
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:21,351
the British supply lines were stretched
to their maximum and continued fighting

468
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,380
was beginning to take a real toll on
Cornwallis his forces who suffered worse

469
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,070
losses than were expected,

470
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:32,610
particularly considering they hadn't
really expected much in the way of losses

471
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,590
at all.
Also,

472
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,910
loyalists remained largely
silent in the south,

473
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,910
partly because the British didn't
really treat them very well.

474
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,570
The British didn't do anything
to court loyalists and the south.

475
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:52,290
The British ruled captured areas in
the south under martial law and made no

476
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:57,580
allowances for loyalists.
They didn't grant any power to loyalists.

477
00:29:57,581 --> 00:30:02,500
So basically they did nothing
to solicit loyalist support,

478
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,380
and thus they didn't get
much loyalists support.

479
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,370
So Cornwallis is following
the American army.

480
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:12,220
He limps into Virginia
with a supply problem.

481
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,030
And while the British army is in Virginia,

482
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,460
they plundered George
Washington's plantation.

483
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:22,150
Mount Vernon just for like a little zing,
you know. Well, as long as we're here,

484
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,840
let's attack Mount Vernon.
Um,

485
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,540
they took slaves as they left George
Washington's plantation manager,

486
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:32,290
Lund Washington,

487
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:36,430
to protect the plantation to
prevent further damage being done.

488
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,730
Actually went on board a British vessel
in a nearby harbor and served the

489
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:44,710
British RefreshMints right.

490
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,700
So please don't attack Mount Vernon
and maybe you'll even give us back our

491
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:53,260
slaves. And I'm bringing
food. Have some cookies.

492
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:56,260
I don't know what they brought,
but they forgot. Refreshmints um,

493
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:01,350
this did not please George Washington
at all as he wrote to Lund Washington to

494
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:07,540
go on board their vessels,
carry them refreshments.

495
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:13,020
Commune with a parcel of
plundering scoundrels and
request a favor by asking the

496
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:18,310
surrender of my negroes
was exceedingly ill judged.

497
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,840
It would have been a less painful
circumstance to me to have heard that in

498
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:25,660
consequence of your non
compliance with their requests.

499
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,050
They had burnt my house and
laid the plantation in ruins.

500
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,540
Not really good judgment on
the part of London, Washington.

501
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:34,060
Can you imagine like he,
he's sort of on their,

502
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:39,061
on the boat sort of hanging out with the
British and he's clearly a relation of

503
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:43,690
the guy leading the continental
army. It's like not good, not good,

504
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:46,030
not good thinking on the part of London,
Washington,

505
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,910
but so Cornwallis is in Virginia.

506
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,300
He forms a new base of action
after he's plundered Mount Vernon.

507
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,690
He forms the new base
of action at Yorktown,

508
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,580
Virginia near the coast,

509
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,620
planning to fan out into
Pennsylvania and Virginia.

510
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,400
But just then August 30 1781 a French
fleet under French Admiral de Grasse

511
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:14,800
arrived at the Virginia coast with troops.

512
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:16,960
And as we're about to see,

513
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:20,950
this ends up being a really crucial
turning point for what's happening in

514
00:32:20,951 --> 00:32:23,950
Virginia. And then ultimately
for the war as a whole,

515
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,330
Washington had troops on land in Virginia,

516
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:32,410
but in the end it was the arrival of the
French fleet in the harbor that really

517
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:36,670
decided the battle because basically it's
surrounded the British and they had no

518
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:39,860
way to escape the troops,
surrounded them on land.

519
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,950
They probably would have tried to
escape to their ships in the harbor,

520
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:46,130
but now the French fleet was
there making that impossible.

521
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:51,050
If the French fleet had arrived at
the wrong time or in the wrong place,

522
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:54,110
this plan would have collapsed
and sort of miraculously,

523
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:57,830
they actually get to the right place at
the right time for the plan to really go

524
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:58,664
into effect.

525
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:05,020
So the arrival of the French really looks
bad for the British and Cornwallis is

526
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:09,020
low on supplies.
He's also low on men at this point,

527
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:11,330
and now he's trapped at Yorktown,

528
00:33:11,331 --> 00:33:14,750
trapped between American
forces and the French fleet,

529
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,200
which now put the British under siege.

530
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,720
So Corn Wallace is roughly 7,000 men
and there actually were some loyalists

531
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,350
fighting there, so they didn't antagonize
all the loyalists in the south.

532
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:29,360
There was some fighting alongside
the British at Yorktown.

533
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:35,410
Cornwallis is roughly 7,000 men held
off a siege of roughly 15,000 combined

534
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,080
American and French
troops for three weeks,

535
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,840
which is actually a pretty
amazing accomplishment,

536
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,530
but ultimately Cornwallis
was forced to surrender.

537
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,130
On October 17th,
1781

538
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,920
Cornwallis wrote a terse
note to Sir Henry Clinton,

539
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,060
who was then in command of the British
forces in America. He wrote, quote,

540
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:04,070
I have the mortification to inform Your
Excellency that I had been forced to

541
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:08,450
surrender the troops under my command
by capitulation on the 19th incident as

542
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:11,990
prisoners of war to the combined
forces of America and France. Period.

543
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,940
Mortified is a good word.

544
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:18,941
He could not believe what had happened
stunned by what happened in this battle

545
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:25,250
and just the incredible drama of the
moment. There are actually many, many,

546
00:34:25,251 --> 00:34:29,060
many eyewitness accounts of what was
unfolding at Yorktown because people

547
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:32,990
understood on all sides that
something major was happening.

548
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,740
People described during
the formal surrender and
October 19th the slow passage

549
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,430
of the British troops past the eyes of
the American troops who are lined up in

550
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:46,400
two columns that
stretched for half a mile.

551
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,750
The British band played a tune
titled the world turned upside down,

552
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,600
which they surely felt it was.

553
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,200
Witnesses said that the British
looked quote unsold Shirley.

554
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,320
And I think what that means is
according to another witness,

555
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,150
they were very much in liquor.
So I'm British, I'm mortified.

556
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,740
Not just the Cornwallis, but they're
mortified. And basically they were drunk.

557
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,810
They couldn't quite believe
that this was happening.

558
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:15,320
Someone said that their ranks for
broken in their step was irregular.

559
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:21,530
Cornwallis was so mortified
that he claimed to be sick
and refuse to attend the

560
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:22,310
surrender.

561
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:27,310
And he sent a deputy to surrender his
sword to Washington and Washington who's

562
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,520
so good at sort of upholding
the dignity of the cause,

563
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:35,180
refuse to accept the sword from a deputy
and had it delivered to his deputy.

564
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,800
So that terms were equal.

565
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:40,950
Washington's always good at this sort
of symbolic gesture and Wa and then the

566
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:42,960
British, as they were marching
by the American troops,

567
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:45,810
they had to lay down their arms
under the terms of the surrender.

568
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,990
And when the British were
told to lay down their arms,

569
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:53,490
one witness noted that quote there,
mortification could not be concealed.

570
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,950
I am a witness that they performed this
duty in a very anonymous or like manner

571
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:03,780
and that many of the soldiers manifested
a sullen temper throwing their arms on

572
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:07,470
the pile with violence as if
determined to render them useless.

573
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,210
We're not to be surprised at the pride
or the British officers is humbled on

574
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:15,990
this occasion as they
have always entertained an
exalted opinion of their own

575
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:20,070
military prowess and affected to
view the Americans as a contemptible

576
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,690
undisciplined rabble.

577
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,280
Now here we come to some documents I
want to mention just cause I discovered

578
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:29,250
them years ago at the library of Congress
and I found them so interesting at the

579
00:36:29,251 --> 00:36:32,790
time. Um, it's just something I
would never had thought of before,

580
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,390
which is the glory of doing research
when you're a historian is you just never

581
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:38,550
know what you're gonna find.
Um, and I was actually,

582
00:36:38,551 --> 00:36:42,930
I was at the library of Congress.
Um, I was actually researching,

583
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,090
um, dueling, right? So what,

584
00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:48,600
what I really wanted to know was
supposedly Americans learned to duel by

585
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:51,570
watching the French during the revolution
and they think this is such a great

586
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:54,780
idea. They take it themselves.
Sounds dubious to me.

587
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:57,720
But I was researching this to see
if I could find any record of this.

588
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:03,110
And I found these letters from between
actually British commanders and French

589
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:06,540
commanders during the
surrender at Yorktown.

590
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,900
And what was fascinating about them
is that the British and the French are

591
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:10,770
writing to each other.

592
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,700
And what they're both basically saying
in their letters is that the British are

593
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:19,230
saying, okay, would you please tell
the Americans to step out of the way?

594
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,420
Because they don't know
how to do a surrender.

595
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,420
They don't know what they're doing.
And they're in the way like,

596
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:28,530
just please French commander
tell the Americans to step aside.

597
00:37:28,531 --> 00:37:32,640
Because they're pesky and they're amateurs
and the French are basically writing

598
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:36,600
back to the British and saying, yeah, we
understand the Americans are in the way.

599
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:38,550
You know, aren't they cute?
Those little Americans,

600
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,550
well we'll have the step off
to the side like you and I,

601
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,400
we know how to really have a
real surrender. Don't worry.

602
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:45,990
Like your knees will be tended to.

603
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,230
So basically I found these letters in
which the French and the English were

604
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:53,130
treating each other as absolute equals
and neither one was treating the

605
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:55,590
Americans as equals on the same plane.

606
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,250
And it really gives you a sense of
how the French and the English were.

607
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:04,251
These sort of long time old world war
veterans who even though they were enemies

608
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:07,500
really sort of understood
and appreciated each other.

609
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,860
And the Americans are such little
sort of pipsqueak newcomers,

610
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:12,690
they're not even on the radar screen.

611
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,450
So I thought that was fascinating
to find the French and the English,

612
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,610
not what I thought I would
find. I was like, oh cool.

613
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,480
Letters between the French and the British
during Yorktown. Hey, wait a minute.

614
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,100
The French are telling us to get out
of the way. So it was interesting.

615
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:29,490
It really gives you a sense of of sort
of American status, relatively speaking,

616
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,310
back in England,

617
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:37,550
one witness was with Lord north when he
received word of the loss at Yorktown

618
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,040
and is this witness wrote north,

619
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:43,630
took the news as he would have taken a
shot in the breast for he opened his arms

620
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:47,200
exclaiming wildly as he
paced up and down Oh God.

621
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:49,240
It is all over words,

622
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:52,900
which he repeated many times under
emotions of the deepest consternation and

623
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:57,760
distress. So at this point, England,
which has already overtaxed,

624
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,150
definitely sees no sign
of victory on the horizon,

625
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:04,090
decide to commence peace negotiations.

626
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:09,310
Now clearly you can see
how French aid had a major,

627
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:14,140
major impact on what happened at Yorktown.
And that's on the war in general.

628
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:18,310
The French gave supplies, they
gave men, they gave naval support,

629
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:22,480
they gave moral support, they
distracted the British in lots of ways.

630
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:26,800
The French had a huge influence
on the outcome of the war. Now,

631
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:31,780
I noted earlier that French self-interest
played some role in the decision of

632
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:34,390
the French to join on the
side of the Americans,

633
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:38,680
but it is also worth noting that there
were some Frenchman who came to the aid

634
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:42,760
of America because they actually really
did get swept up into the American

635
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:46,780
revolutionary cause and they saw it as
a justified fight for freedom in the

636
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:50,620
marquis. De Lafayette is maybe
the most notable example of this.

637
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:54,760
He was really young at the time. He
was about 19 years old. He's a marquee,

638
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:56,960
so he's clearly very wealthy.
Um,

639
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:00,490
and obviously he was really moved
by what was going on in America.

640
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:02,830
So he actually took a large ship,

641
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:08,010
loaded it with men and supplies and
sailed to America just to volunteer his

642
00:40:08,021 --> 00:40:09,940
ship, his men, his supplies, and himself.

643
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:15,030
Here I am joining the American cause and
he ended up being this really beloved

644
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,800
figure in America.
I mean,

645
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:22,050
Washington really almost treated him
like a son when you read letters, uh,

646
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,780
that Washington rights and why, why she's
not exactly a cozy kind of individual.

647
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,900
Um, but clearly he had a lot
of affection for Lafayette.

648
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,560
But Americans in general really admired
and appreciated Lafayette because he was

649
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:39,490
sort of this starry eyed youth who
sacrificed for the American cause for no

650
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:42,880
reason. He just appeared because
he was swept into the cause.

651
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:48,280
And between 1824 and 1825 right on the
cusp of the 50th anniversary of the

652
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:49,450
declaration of independence,

653
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:53,870
Lafite had actually came back to America
for the sort of triumphal tour you have

654
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,880
to sort of visit old friends that he
met with like Jefferson and Adams.

655
00:40:58,991 --> 00:41:01,370
And I think Andrew Jackson like,
you know,

656
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:05,800
by 1824 there's a weird conglomeration
of people that he's meeting with. Um,

657
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:08,710
but he went on a grand
tour of all of America.

658
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:13,090
He went to all of the 24 states and he
think he was in his seventies at the time.

659
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:16,750
So He's, he's pretty vigorous.
Um, and he was celebrated.

660
00:41:16,751 --> 00:41:20,470
He was paraded all over the place. He
had receptions where he sort of hung out,

661
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,750
like ready to talk to Americans.

662
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,920
Americans of all kinds would line
up on the street just to see him,

663
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,730
to watch parades go by to look at him,
enter their city.

664
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,850
So he was beloved at the time.

665
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:37,490
Then was sort of in a way maybe he
sort of symbolized French assistance,

666
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:42,200
the French alliance afterwards
cause America Americans
gave a lot of love to the

667
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,510
Marquis de Lafayette.
And it's important to note,

668
00:41:44,511 --> 00:41:47,330
I mean I'm mentioning Lafayette cause
he's maybe the best known figure,

669
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:50,870
but he's not the only freshmen who
volunteered to come and fight for the

670
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:51,561
American cause.

671
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:56,561
And actually France is not the only
country where people came voluntarily to

672
00:41:56,691 --> 00:42:01,370
join the American cause.
So back to the French,

673
00:42:01,371 --> 00:42:05,870
the aid of the French clearly major,
major factor in the American victory.

674
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:10,940
And with the American victory at
Yorktown in 1781 the British decided to

675
00:42:10,941 --> 00:42:12,470
commence peace negotiations.

676
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:17,090
It is important to note that even though
the British have now informally decided

677
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:19,520
that they're going to start
negotiating for peace,

678
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,140
it doesn't mean that there was
an instant cease fire in the war.

679
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:29,180
There was kind of a fuzzy period here in
which there was still a sizable British

680
00:42:29,181 --> 00:42:31,640
armed force in America.

681
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,210
The British hadn't officially
declared surrender.

682
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:40,750
Authorities in London told British forces
that they should avoid battle unless

683
00:42:40,971 --> 00:42:43,880
attacked and they should
begin to evacuate troops.

684
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:48,680
But Yorktown was not really
like the instant end of the
revolution and there are

685
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:51,980
still skirmishes and battles afterwards.
For some time,

686
00:42:51,981 --> 00:42:54,650
people don't have any way of
really knowing the war is over.

687
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:56,360
There's still a British army there.

688
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:03,130
It's not until June of 1782 that
negotiations began in Paris.

689
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:09,350
American sent a commission of Foreman,
John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay,

690
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:12,150
and Henry Laurens.
Um,

691
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,840
it's interesting to note that even now,
okay,

692
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:19,220
Yorktown surrender war over,
we're going to have a peace negotiation.

693
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,083
Even now,

694
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,810
the British still hope that maybe there'd
be some way to come to terms with the

695
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:28,040
Americans that would still somehow
leave America within the British empire.

696
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,270
They're really persistent.

697
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:34,660
And it wasn't until John Jay arrived in
Paris and he's a no nonsense sort of,

698
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:39,260
you know, straight forward
person. Jay Actually said, look,

699
00:43:39,261 --> 00:43:42,980
we're not going to proceed with peace
negotiations unless independence is

700
00:43:42,981 --> 00:43:45,170
assumed. Guys. Like, okay,

701
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,880
and this is not negotiable.
We're independent. We're over.

702
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:55,090
It wasn't until he really insisted that
negotiations began and independence was

703
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,610
really finally accepted as
inevitable by the British.

704
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,180
So Britain recognized
American independence.

705
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,770
They agreed to evacuate all
royal troops from American soil.

706
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:11,570
John Adams thinking of New England got
American fishing rights off of the grand

707
00:44:11,571 --> 00:44:13,700
banks of Canada.
Canada appears again.

708
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,330
I'd like the fact that John Adams is there
working for fishing rights. Look, yeah.

709
00:44:17,331 --> 00:44:21,060
Yeah. Independence. Fishing
rights. Thank you. John Adams. Um,

710
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,120
the American's promised that they would
urge state legislatures to compensate

711
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:31,121
loyalists for property loss during the
war and agreed that British creditors be

712
00:44:31,261 --> 00:44:32,850
able to collect prewar debts.

713
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,510
Even though those two very nice things
were agreed to by the Americans. In fact,

714
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,560
neither one happened in a very reliable
manner and created all sorts of problems

715
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:43,770
because there are a lot of states that
were just not really excited about

716
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:46,800
compensating loyalists or
about repaying the British.

717
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:50,910
No mention was made of native Americans,

718
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,720
many of whom had supported the
British for really logical reasons,

719
00:44:54,721 --> 00:44:58,800
given their fears about the spreading
domination of an independent American

720
00:44:58,801 --> 00:45:01,500
republic with settlers swallowing up land.

721
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,210
And ultimately many Indian nation simply
didn't recognize American claims of

722
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:10,080
sovereignty over their
territory for the Americans.

723
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:12,360
Overall independence had been won,

724
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:18,140
but at a high price and actually only
the civil war produced a higher ratio of

725
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:20,670
casualties to the nation's population.

726
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:26,750
And still undecided at the close
of the war were too obvious.

727
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:29,700
Big major questions.

728
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:35,450
What kind of society was America going
to become and what kind of government

729
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,350
with the new nation and it states possess.

730
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,010
These are two questions which are going
to be talking about in lectures to come

731
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,250
on Thursday,
I'm going to talk about American society.

732
00:45:47,251 --> 00:45:51,000
And then we sort of segue
into a discussion of people
wondering exactly what's

733
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:52,350
supposed to be happening,

734
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:56,520
what kind of a national
something is supposed to be
governing over these states.

735
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:56,910
Um,

736
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:01,910
and that's gonna lead us up to why a
constitutional convention actually made

737
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:03,810
sense because it didn't
make sense to everybody.

738
00:46:03,811 --> 00:46:07,110
And it took a while for it
to make sense to anybody.

739
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:09,750
So that's to come.
Uh,

740
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:12,840
I will conclude there and
I will see you on Thursday.
