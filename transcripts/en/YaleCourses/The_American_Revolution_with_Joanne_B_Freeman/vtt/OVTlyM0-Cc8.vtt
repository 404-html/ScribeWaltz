00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.970
So today I've titled The lecture for Today Confederation,

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.050
but in a sense of going to be talking about something larger than that.

3
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:13.140
And by the end of the lecture I'll be talking about the articles of

4
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:17.430
confederation.
I'll talk a little bit more about them on Thursday.
Um,

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.570
but as I mentioned last Thursday,
um,

6
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.890
last Thursday's lecture,

7
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:26.670
today's lecture and actually some of the few that are left but that are still to

8
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:27.660
come,
um,

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.880
are all in one way or another dealing with big questions that were left looming

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.150
after the fighting of the revolution had passed.

11
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:38.610
And we dealt with one of them on Thursday.

12
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:42.210
And that was the co the question of what would happen to American society.

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.070
And I looked at that in a very specific way,

14
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:46.920
but I was touching on that broader question,
which is,
okay,

15
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.870
so we've had a revolution,
what does that do?

16
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.560
And we sort of explored some things that did or didn't do.

17
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.260
Today I'm going to discuss a different big question leftover after the fighting

18
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.420
and actually going on even during the fighting.

19
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.980
And that is the question of what would happen to American governance.

20
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.930
How would independence from Great Britain actually affect the way that the

21
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:14.931
states individually functioned and the way that they were governed together and

22
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.520
it's not.
Obviously,

23
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.110
it's not just a question of little political technicalities because as people at

24
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:23.340
the time really knew,

25
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.770
aside from the obvious task of winning the war and gaining independence,

26
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.810
it was really political change.
It was the,

27
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.840
the shaping of new state governments and the creation of some kind of a new

28
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.080
national or American government that would most shape the real outcome of the

29
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:46.980
revolution as a whole as Jefferson put it right in the middle of the revolution.

30
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.260
In truth,
a new government is the whole object of the present controversy.

31
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.930
I love finding quotes from founders in which I think to myself,

32
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:58.500
I need a founder to say that politics is important.
Dick,
Dick,
Dick,
Dick.
Oh,

33
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:01.050
there's Thomas Jefferson.
No,
no government.

34
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:04.040
Just a whole object of the present controversy for Shit,

35
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.780
a bad government be instituted for us in the future.

36
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.880
It had been well to have accepted at first,

37
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:13.680
the bad one offered to us from beyond the water without the risk and expense of

38
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:14.514
the contest.

39
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.410
So basically as people at the time well knew it was in the creation of

40
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:24.411
governments in the states and one for all of the states that the revolution

41
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.540
ultimately would be lost or won.
We're going to hear this,

42
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.020
people talking about the seventies and eighties when they were a little alarmed.

43
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:33.420
It's what ha what is happening in the 17 is they're going to repeat that

44
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:34.560
sentiment like,
oh,

45
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.920
we thought we won and now we're going to lose because everything's going to fall

46
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:42.900
apart because of problems of government.
So on a really immediate level,

47
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.340
Americans knew that if they wanted to win the war in a broader sense,

48
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.860
they had to have effective governments

49
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.940
and obviously also in the longer term,

50
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.770
they needed effective governments to survive,
to prosper,
to last more than years.

51
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.760
It's fascinating when you look at letters between these people and the first

52
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.550
couple years under the constitution,

53
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:09.010
and they're really not convinced it's going to last more than a few years.

54
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.860
Nifty little experiment,
maybe it's not going to work.

55
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.460
So people understood government is the key.

56
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.130
So when the colonies declared independence in 1776 and these former colonies

57
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:26.131
became states they needed to create new state governments that would basically

58
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:31.750
write the royal government out of their form of governance and they,
they,

59
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:36.250
each state now needed to come up with a new way to govern itself or some

60
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:38.350
decision about how they were going to govern themselves.

61
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.390
So from roughly 1776 through the 70s,
80s,

62
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.230
the individual states,
and as we'll see in a little bit,

63
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.450
the continental Congress grappled with trying to figure out the best mode of

64
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:57.451
establishing new governments according to prevailing hopes and ideals.

65
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.710
And this whole period,

66
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.090
it was really a remarkable period of political experimentation.

67
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.300
As Benjamin Franklin said,
we are,

68
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:11.680
I think in the right road of the spirit of improvement for we are making

69
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:16.600
experiments,
right?
There was a man of science,
um,
basically in this whole period,

70
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:17.590
not just the revolution,

71
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:22.591
but a little before and certainly after fueled by the optimism of the revolution

72
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.390
and fueled by the whole spirit of the enlightenment.

73
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.660
This was an age of experiments in government and I always find when I'm trying

74
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:35.080
to get across what it felt like at that time,

75
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:37.840
how people thought about politics at that time.

76
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:40.930
I'm always sort of trying to figure out some great metaphors.

77
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.230
Some thing that I can say and I always come back to the same comparison,

78
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:49.231
which somehow at least in the last five or six years has always been true.

79
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:54.661
And that his innocence to get a feeling for what it felt like to think about

80
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:57.670
politics and experience politics in the late 18th century.

81
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.410
Think about how we now experience and think about technology.
Okay.

82
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:07.411
Cause basically they could announce tomorrow that apple was secretly coming up

83
00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:11.380
with a device that allows you to see inside every home in America.

84
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.400
And we would go,
Ooh,
interesting.
But we would accept that then maybe that exists.

85
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:16.510
You know,
I mean there's,

86
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:20.500
on our part there's a sort of expectation that new technological innovations are

87
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:25.501
popping up all the time and they might have us doing our thinking things that we

88
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:28.570
never did before,
but communicating in new ways.

89
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.310
Technology I think for us is this realm where anything can happen and things are

90
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:37.600
happening all the time and we're adjusting and were excited and were interested

91
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.690
and that's where a lot of the innovation is now.

92
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.340
If people sort of trying to pour,
you know,
every app maker in America,
um,

93
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.550
people creating and innovating and devising and creating and that kind of spirit

94
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.520
transport that back to the late 18th century,

95
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:57.470
that's the way that people were feeling about government.

96
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.310
That was a period in which government was doing all of those things.

97
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:05.060
There were innovations,
there were,
there were,
it was experimental.

98
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.470
People didn't know what was going to happen.

99
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:10.610
They were challenging rules of government and sort of seeing what would happen.

100
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.120
It was particularly for people who are interested in politics.

101
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.020
It was a fascinating sort of wonderful time because all of these weird things

102
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:19.910
were happening and they were big,

103
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
literally constitutional things on a really big level and you can hear this kind

104
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:30.851
of excitement and a statement that John Adams wrote in 1776 and a pamphlet that

105
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:37.421
I'll be discussing in a few minutes and it's titled Thoughts on government and

106
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:40.400
Adams wrote,
you and I,
my dear friend,

107
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.840
had been sent into life at a time when the greatest log givers of antiquity

108
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.670
would have wished to have lived.

109
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.890
How few of the human race has ever enjoyed an opportunity of making an election

110
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:54.680
of government for themselves or their children.

111
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.960
People knew that what they were doing at that time was a big deal and they knew

112
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.420
it could affect enormous change.

113
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.790
So what I'm going to be talking about today in that spirit are these experiments

114
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:10.070
in government,
people experimenting and government,

115
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:13.640
and I'm going to talk about these kinds of experiments on two levels.

116
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
First I'll talk about state constitution making and how people were trying to

117
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:23.360
figure out what to do on a state level and then I'll discuss the process of

118
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:28.361
joining all of these states together into some kind of a confederation or as the

119
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:32.960
articles of confederation themselves,
put it a League of friendship.

120
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.950
That's how the government defines itself,
the articles,
they league a friendship,

121
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.750
but I want to start with state constitutions and the fact is,

122
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:46.130
although to us we think constitution is sort of the big looming thing that's

123
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:49.130
important in that period to people.
At the time,

124
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.080
certainly in the middle of the revolution,

125
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.640
it was really in the drafting of state constitutions that they really thought

126
00:07:55.641 --> 00:08:00.641
the future of the American people was going to be decided even before the formal

127
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:06.020
declaration of independence in July of 1776 already,

128
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.280
people in the colonies had been giving some thought to the fact that they were

129
00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:14.930
going to need new state constitutions because already things were unstable

130
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:18.890
sources of authority,
royal sources of authority.
We're not necessarily in place,

131
00:08:18.891 --> 00:08:21.050
but it was unclear what was in place instead of them.

132
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.790
So people will already saw the need for some kind of new legitimate source of

133
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:29.930
authority.
And they began thinking,
okay,
well if we do end up being independent,

134
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:31.580
we need some kind of a new government.

135
00:08:31.581 --> 00:08:34.580
So we better start talking about it now cause sooner or later,

136
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.670
probably sooner we're going to actually have to implement something.

137
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.750
So as early as the beginning of 1776 states began considering what they should

138
00:08:44.661 --> 00:08:49.160
do about the unsettled state of governance in their own colonies.

139
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.110
And some colonies actually wrote to the continental Congress asking for advice

140
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.840
on what they should do about governance in their colony.

141
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.820
And there were some people in the continental congress that suggested,
well,

142
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.760
you guys should take some kind of an interim measure.

143
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.580
Things aren't sorted out yet with England.
We don't know what's going to happen,

144
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:13.050
sort of do something to tide you over until we figure out what's coming next.

145
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.590
But there were others who were more radical in their politics and the

146
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:20.640
continental congress who thought that the colonies actually should really

147
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:25.440
establish new political institutions.
Basically new constitutions,

148
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:31.190
more conservative congressmen argued that adopting new forms of government would

149
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:37.041
be as good as declaring independence even if independence hadn't been declared.

150
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.600
If the colony start creating their own constitutions,

151
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.370
these conservatives are arguing.

152
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.460
It's just as good as saying you're independent and it's going to make,

153
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.270
it's a reconciling with England even harder if you begin to do that.

154
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.020
Even so in May of 1776 the continental congress adopted a resolution saying that

155
00:09:56.401 --> 00:10:01.401
colonial assemblies should adopt new governments and just as the Conservatives

156
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.840
in Congress argued certainly to John Adams and many others,

157
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.990
that resolution was what really was the instrument of American independence.

158
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:15.960
That's to Adams.
He saw that resolution is a really key turning point.

159
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:21.090
When the continental congress said to the colonies becoming states,

160
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.930
I think it's time that you should devise your own constitutions.

161
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.300
Now it's important to note the continental congress wasn't in the lead here.

162
00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:34.110
What would happen is that colonies were asking them what to do and congress sort

163
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:38.550
of responded and figured out what it thought and then made a recommendation.

164
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.320
So states we're thinking about government before the continental congress

165
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:44.910
necessarily.
Did anything about it.

166
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.600
The first new constitution had already been drafted in New Hampshire in January

167
00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:56.991
of 1776 making it the first written constitution drawn up by one of the colonies

168
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.290
without consultation with or approval of the crown or parliament.

169
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.730
So the states are all occupied with constitution making.

170
00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:10.731
And that continued through 1777 now at first,

171
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.990
people in the congress were undecided about whether maybe it would be smart to

172
00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:19.770
recommend to all of the colonies,
one model constitution.

173
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.950
Maybe they should come up with one model and sort of send it out and say,

174
00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:26.520
here's what we think the best kind of government would be.

175
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.820
But after a brief debate,
the idea of went nowhere.

176
00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:32.700
And that's basically for two reasons.
I think one of them is really obvious,

177
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:36.360
which is what is the likelihood that everybody in that Congress was going to

178
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:40.320
agree on what a model constitution ought to look like for all of the states?

179
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.970
Okay.
Not,
I mean,
on a,
on a purely pragmatic level,
that would be very hard to do.

180
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.370
But second and more important than that,

181
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:53.120
the Congress ultimately felt that people in each colony or each state should

182
00:11:53.231 --> 00:11:58.231
really be adopting and devising their own governments that really suited their

183
00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:02.830
own character,
their own habits,
their own specific needs,

184
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.330
local conditions.
So really it was the colonies themselves who were best suited.

185
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:11.110
It wasn't a smart idea to the congress ultimately for them to be imposing a

186
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:11.471
model,

187
00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:15.670
anything since part of the purpose of the revolution was for people to devise

188
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:20.671
governments that suited them better and in making this suggestion that each

189
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:25.681
colony should be free to create a constitution that reflected their particular

190
00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:26.860
values and habits.

191
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.120
The congress was pretty much acting in accordance with a prevailing belief at

192
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:33.130
the time that there was,

193
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:37.630
or certainly that there should be an intimate connection between the values of a

194
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:37.961
people,

195
00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:42.160
between the habits of a people on the one hand and between their instruments of

196
00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:45.580
government and systems of law.
On the other,
this general assumption,

197
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.520
one shapes the other one should shape the other,

198
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.060
and that's part of the assumption that the continental congress is acting on.

199
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:58.030
But just because Congress didn't mop,
didn't design a model constitution,

200
00:12:58.031 --> 00:13:02.320
it doesn't mean that individual continental congressmen didn't begin thinking

201
00:13:02.321 --> 00:13:06.910
about what ought to be happening in their own states back home.
And in fact,

202
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:11.911
so many continental congressmen became so obsessed with the idea of state

203
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.550
constitution making for their own states that some people feared that some of

204
00:13:15.551 --> 00:13:19.000
the basic demands of the revolution were falling by the wayside because everyone

205
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:22.120
was saying,
oh well,
you know,
back home they're making up a constitution.

206
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.900
That's amazing.
Like I have some ideas about that.
I mean,

207
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.250
maybe I should even go back there.
Okay,
maybe not,

208
00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:29.620
but I'll send them some ideas about what they ought to be doing.

209
00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:33.340
So these delegates and the continental congress are extremely interested for

210
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:37.720
really obvious reasons in what's being devised back in their home colony,

211
00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.613
their home state.

212
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:44.790
One result of this obsession with constitution making was this pamphlet I

213
00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:46.540
mentioned a few moments ago,

214
00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:50.830
which ends up being an important and influential pamphlet written by John Adams

215
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.580
that's titled Thoughts on government.
Now,

216
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:59.200
am's had long been really interested in constitutional issues and he actually

217
00:13:59.201 --> 00:14:03.820
had something of a reputation for being someone who was pretty knowledgeable on

218
00:14:03.821 --> 00:14:04.654
the subject.

219
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.890
So when these states began talking about new constitutions,

220
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.181
beginning at the very,

221
00:14:10.181 --> 00:14:15.181
very end of 1775 going through 1776 several men from different states came to

222
00:14:16.811 --> 00:14:20.230
him to ask his advice,
hey,

223
00:14:20.231 --> 00:14:22.660
you're the guy who knows a lot about constitutions.

224
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.300
What do you think we ought to be doing,
Mr. Adams?

225
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.550
So Adam's so many people asked him that he wrote up what he called a sketch of

226
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:34.360
what a new constitution might look like and he gave the sketch out to a few

227
00:14:34.361 --> 00:14:37.120
people.
Oh,
you want to know what I think a new constitution?
And it looked like,

228
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:42.010
here you go,
my best idea.
Well obviously if everyone's casting about like,

229
00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:45.250
I dunno what to do,
what should I say?
And one guy pipes up and says,

230
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.670
I think this is a pretty good idea.
Not surprisingly,

231
00:14:48.671 --> 00:14:52.320
other people went to Adams and said,
hey,
I'd like a copy of sketch too.
Like I,

232
00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:57.020
I'd like to see what your model constitution looks like.
So by April of 17,

233
00:14:57.021 --> 00:15:00.020
76,
Adams had turned this sketch into this pamphlet.

234
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:03.560
The full title of his pamphlet is one of these great 18th century titles,

235
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.520
thoughts on government applicable to the present state of the American colonies

236
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:09.470
in a letter from a gentleman to his friend.

237
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.580
We can call it thoughts on government now,

238
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.240
besides the obvious practical use of the pamphlet.

239
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.700
And I'm going to come back to some of the things he recommends in a minute.

240
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:25.130
Adams also intended it to be a response to the concluding section of Thomas

241
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.710
Paine's common sense published a few months earlier.

242
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:31.920
And you'll remember the wonderful opinion that John Adams registered on common

243
00:15:31.921 --> 00:15:36.620
sense quote,
a poor,
ignorant,
malicious,
shortsighted,
crappy ulous mass.

244
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.710
Thank you John Adams.
Um,

245
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:45.250
so Adam's basically thought that that final section of common sense was

246
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.020
irresponsible and impractical.

247
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:52.430
It was giving ideas about forming a new government that didn't make sense.

248
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.020
And if you remember,

249
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:59.021
pain had said that there should be a unicameral a one house legislature for each

250
00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:03.240
of the colonies and the that would be all of those would be subordinate to

251
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.590
unicameral legislature,
like the continental congress.

252
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.460
No level of government would have an independent executive.

253
00:16:10.461 --> 00:16:12.500
So basically is Adams is thinking about it,

254
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.910
pain is just tossing off separation of powers and the balance of powers and

255
00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:19.130
saying,
yeah,
we don't need to think about that.

256
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.290
We should be thinking about the people,
right?

257
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:23.690
We should be thinking about making a government responsive to people,

258
00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:24.860
which is a nice idea.

259
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.080
But Adam's thought in reality there's no way that that's going to work.

260
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.510
Adams and others though they valued what pain had to say.

261
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:40.511
Obviously about independence did not appreciate that whole plan and in slots on

262
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:41.534
government.

263
00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.500
Adam's argued that whatever the state's did with these new governments,

264
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:50.060
they should at least preserve the best of Anglo American traditions of

265
00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:53.210
government and particularly separation of powers.

266
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:59.170
Adams really did not like the idea of having a one house assembly and having no

267
00:16:59.751 --> 00:17:00.950
executive at all.

268
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:05.660
He argued that there was no way that that could work well at one house.

269
00:17:05.661 --> 00:17:08.900
Legislature would never be effective.
We could never do anything.

270
00:17:08.901 --> 00:17:12.830
Executive could never do anything judicial as he put it,

271
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.540
a one house legislature could not act as an executive power quote for want of

272
00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:21.480
two essential properties,
secrecy and dispatch.
Okay.

273
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:25.730
That's what executives need to be.
No Congress will ever manage those two things.

274
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:31.010
He also said that a one house legislature couldn't be a judicial power because

275
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:33.020
it was too numerous,
too slow,

276
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.560
and too little skilled in the laws and just as bad to Adam's a unicameral

277
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:43.700
legislature was just unstable in and of itself.
As he put it,

278
00:17:43.701 --> 00:17:47.900
it was liable to all the vices,
follies and frailties of an individual.

279
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.470
Subject to fits of humor starts with passion,
flights of enthusiasm,

280
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.940
partiality or prejudice,

281
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:57.660
and consequently productive of hasty results and absurd judgements.

282
00:17:57.661 --> 00:18:00.990
I think that sounds like a quote from a guy who's really tired of being in

283
00:18:00.991 --> 00:18:03.510
congresses.
It's like,
I know what Congress is.

284
00:18:03.511 --> 00:18:07.800
Do this unicameral legislature,
bad idea.

285
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:12.360
He really preferred a bicameral legislature,

286
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.540
both houses of which would elect a governor.

287
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.660
The governor would have a veto over legislation,

288
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.370
could appoint judges and some other officers with the consent of the upper

289
00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:24.204
house.

290
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:29.100
Judges would have tenure for life during good behavior and all officials apart

291
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:34.101
from judges would be elected annually to prevent an aristocratic ruling class

292
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:38.700
from rising up and to keep politicians humble because they'd have to go home

293
00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:43.260
every year and get reelected and to Adams that would successfully keep

294
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:44.430
politicians humble.

295
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.860
Rotation in office would be something that would keep the right spirit of

296
00:18:49.861 --> 00:18:50.694
government going.

297
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.620
Now it's hard to say how much direct influence thoughts on government had.

298
00:18:55.621 --> 00:18:59.310
It's always very hard.
You always want to say,
wow,
these five states,

299
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.040
we're extremely influenced.
It's hard to say that,

300
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:07.050
but the fact is that most of the state constitutions ended up being in hailing

301
00:19:07.051 --> 00:19:11.880
distance of what Adam suggested in that pamphlet and he did receive letters from

302
00:19:11.881 --> 00:19:14.190
a number of friends saying,
well,
we actually,
that was helpful.

303
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.190
Thank you very much,
John Adams.
That was actually very helpful.

304
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.340
So we have this little moment in which John Adams must've been smiling cause

305
00:19:20.341 --> 00:19:23.250
he's getting recognition.
Right.
Yay.
He's like,

306
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:28.410
I wrote a good pamphlet in there saying thank you.
Yay.
Poor John Adams.

307
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.240
Um,
okay.

308
00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:33.960
So all this talking about new governments,

309
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:35.340
the fact is,

310
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.990
as I suggested when Adam says we should be preserving the best features of Anglo

311
00:19:39.991 --> 00:19:40.920
American governance,

312
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:46.790
the state constitutions generally did preserve some basic features of Anglo

313
00:19:47.761 --> 00:19:51.780
American governance.
So take for example by cameral legislature,

314
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:56.520
obviously resembling parliament's House of Commons and House of Lords.

315
00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:00.360
Obviously American did not have Lords and Commons in quite the same way,

316
00:20:00.361 --> 00:20:05.361
but the idea remained you had two houses and you had different sets of people in

317
00:20:05.851 --> 00:20:06.271
the two.

318
00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:10.500
Although it was not entirely clear what that meant in the American example,

319
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.510
and this was actually a source of confusion,
right?

320
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.620
When the constitution first starts with this new by camera legislature,

321
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.150
people aren't sure if the Senate is kind of like a House of Lords,

322
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.540
meaning that the people in the Senate or sort of higher up than the

323
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:28.890
representatives,
do they have like special privileges?
Should there be?

324
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.390
Should they get a higher salary or they like special people in comparison to the

325
00:20:33.391 --> 00:20:33.661
house?

326
00:20:33.661 --> 00:20:37.020
Should we really be making that kind of difference between the House and the

327
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:39.720
Senate?
And you can see this throughout this period.

328
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.730
You can see it in somewhat ridiculous ways,

329
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.440
but you can see how people were so focused on it.
And one example of this is um,

330
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.650
from 1790,

331
00:20:47.651 --> 00:20:52.651
so the one year of government and the Senate wrote some kind of a bill and they

332
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:54.430
included I suppose,

333
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:58.960
names of people who had drafted the bill and before the names of the people,

334
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:03.040
they put the honorable at the honorable miss years,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

335
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.430
And they sent this to the house.
The House got this bill.

336
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.850
They didn't even look at the content of the bill.
They just looked at the bill.

337
00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.140
Why are the senators calling themselves the honorable?
We don't like that.

338
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:18.040
What's it suggesting about who they are?
I think they're better than us.
No,

339
00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:18.910
they're not better than us.

340
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:22.690
So the house before it votes on the content of the bill votes to cut those two

341
00:21:22.691 --> 00:21:25.120
words out.
Right.
That's not going to be on the document.

342
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:26.560
None of this honorable stuff.

343
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.320
Then they pass it and it goes back to the Senate and the Senate passes another

344
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.720
amendment in which they take their names off the document because they don't

345
00:21:34.721 --> 00:21:38.590
want them printed without the honorable attached to them.
Okay.

346
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.110
Seemingly little trivial petty thing,

347
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:46.060
but that clearly two parts of the legislature we're focused on and there was

348
00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:49.420
even a letter from Madison and I can't remember who he's writing to and he says,

349
00:21:49.421 --> 00:21:51.280
this seems trivial,

350
00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.470
but it really isn't because it's getting down to these kind of basic questions

351
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:59.920
of exactly what is the house and what is the Senate and what's their

352
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:02.410
relationship to the House of Lords,
the House of Commons.

353
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.170
So a by camera legislature is one tradition that Americans held onto,

354
00:22:08.171 --> 00:22:11.110
generally speaking,
and I'm going to come back to an exception,

355
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:16.510
a second traditional assumption that was represented in the new state

356
00:22:16.511 --> 00:22:20.770
constitution is concerned the need for property requirements for voting and for

357
00:22:20.771 --> 00:22:25.771
holding elected office and the reasoning they're being men who owned property.

358
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:31.230
We're independent men so they could vote for themselves as they thought rather

359
00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:35.140
than being dependent on someone else and thus maybe having to vote in a way that

360
00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:36.850
somebody else wanted them to vote.

361
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:41.470
And likewise it was thought that if you had literally financial investment in a

362
00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:42.304
community,

363
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:47.230
you are the people best qualified to affect that community through elections.

364
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.600
So though the revolution would inspire many states to reduce the level of the

365
00:22:54.071 --> 00:22:55.900
property requirement for voting,

366
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.110
the fact is those kinds of restrictions remain in place.

367
00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:04.270
And on average in the new state constitutions roughly there was an increase of

368
00:23:04.271 --> 00:23:07.960
15% in the number of adult white males voting,

369
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:12.550
which in a sense compared I suppose with England maybe seems a little bit of

370
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.270
somewhat substantial as not revolutionary in scope.

371
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.020
So that was held onto as well as something that people felt comfortable with.

372
00:23:20.021 --> 00:23:22.930
That was a precedent,
a tradition that made sense to them.

373
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.660
Now there were other ways in which these constitution,

374
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.520
the state constitution,
rather than reflecting traditions,

375
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:38.550
Anglo American traditions instead more obviously reflected the immediate impact

376
00:23:39.521 --> 00:23:40.354
of the revolution.

377
00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.830
And the first and most obvious example of that is the simple fact that they're

378
00:23:44.831 --> 00:23:46.990
writing constitutions,
right?

379
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.050
Americans were revealing their recognition of what they believe to be the

380
00:23:51.051 --> 00:23:55.250
instability and lack of security in unwritten constitutions.

381
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.880
As they looked at Great Britain,
they thought,
we don't like that system.

382
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:01.670
Pretty much.
We want everything in writing.
We want it all on paper.

383
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:07.630
Americans wanted to fix the principles of their new governments in writing in a

384
00:24:07.761 --> 00:24:12.650
form that was distinct from and superior to mere legal statutes.

385
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:19.540
You can also see the immediate impact of the revolution in the three main ideas

386
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:22.850
that were at the core of most of the state constitutions.

387
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.020
Three sort of basic ideas.
Number one,

388
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:30.770
most of these constitutions were premised on the idea that they had to be

389
00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:35.771
grounded on natural rights and you can really see this belief reflected in the

390
00:24:36.561 --> 00:24:41.561
declarations of rights that were appended to most state constitutions.

391
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:42.951
And again,

392
00:24:42.951 --> 00:24:47.300
there is a lot that's traditional in these declarations of rights because a lot

393
00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:51.440
of the rights that are being declared in these declarations are traditional

394
00:24:51.441 --> 00:24:52.370
English rights,

395
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:58.240
but they're being put in on paper in these documents and then attached to these

396
00:24:58.431 --> 00:25:00.680
sort of constitutional statements,

397
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.160
creating whatever these new states we're going to be

398
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:11.270
most of these declarations of rights specified things like the right of trial by

399
00:25:11.271 --> 00:25:13.160
jury,
right?
They thought back to the revolution.

400
00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:17.150
They remembered those vice admiralty courts not popular,
so now they're like,

401
00:25:17.151 --> 00:25:19.880
okay,
we want the right of trial by jury.

402
00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.190
We want the right not to be deprived of life,

403
00:25:22.191 --> 00:25:25.490
liberty and property through the protection of due process of law,

404
00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.450
freedom of speech,
freedom of the press and in some states like Virginia,

405
00:25:29.451 --> 00:25:32.570
freedom of religion,
again,
rights that are familiar to us,

406
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.320
rights that they're putting down on paper and attaching to constitutions at this

407
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:37.250
moment in time.

408
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:43.370
So declarations of rights were shared by constitutions.

409
00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.490
This sort of idea that there are these natural rights that need to be written

410
00:25:46.491 --> 00:25:47.870
down and memorialized.

411
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.350
One of the things that all of the state constitutions generally share.

412
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:57.310
The other two main ideas that were at the core of these constitutions are

413
00:25:57.681 --> 00:25:58.251
related.

414
00:25:58.251 --> 00:26:03.200
So these are the last two ideas are most constitutions declared that

415
00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:06.230
representation is based on consent.
Again,

416
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:07.880
obviously coming right out of the revolution,

417
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:11.330
consent is important in the process of representation.

418
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:15.020
And then the third and last basic idea related to that is,

419
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:19.430
and maybe it's the most central one of all sovereignty rests with the people.

420
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.350
The people are sovereign

421
00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.140
as the Virginia Constitution declared and and a lot of the other states in one

422
00:26:27.141 --> 00:26:28.910
way or another rephrased it,

423
00:26:28.911 --> 00:26:33.911
but said something like it all power is vested in and consequently derived from

424
00:26:35.121 --> 00:26:40.121
the people that the magistrates are their trustees and servants and at all times

425
00:26:40.401 --> 00:26:41.570
amenable to them.

426
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:46.860
The main question about this was as John Allen's put it at the time,

427
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.400
to what extent should we carry this principles like nice idea.

428
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.140
What does that exactly mean?

429
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:55.860
How's it going to actually boil down into what people are actually doing?

430
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.190
How beholden should the government be to the people?

431
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:04.110
And this varied in different states depending on a number of different kinds of

432
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:04.944
factors.

433
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:10.290
One dramatic way in which you could really see the sovereignty of the people

434
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:15.030
being emphasized in these new state constitutions is through the way in which

435
00:27:15.031 --> 00:27:17.400
they curbed executive power.

436
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:20.460
They curved the power of state governors.

437
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.860
They made state governors less important.

438
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:27.330
They usually made the lower house of their legislature is more important.

439
00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:31.200
They often made the upper house of their legislatures less important.

440
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:35.040
They're really trying to limit power to curb power.
Again,

441
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:38.970
that's obviously really connected to what they had just experienced in the

442
00:27:38.971 --> 00:27:39.511
revolution,

443
00:27:39.511 --> 00:27:44.511
which felt to them like this sort of monarchical unlimited power that they had

444
00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:48.630
no control over.
So they're really worried about executive power,

445
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:53.070
fear of a concentration of power,
fear of executive power,

446
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.930
like the power of the monarch that they had just,

447
00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:00.180
or at least in the process of breaking away from.
So as I said,

448
00:28:00.181 --> 00:28:04.350
almost every new state constitution increase the power of the lower house,

449
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.540
decreased the power of the governor,

450
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.990
decreased the power of the upper house of their legislatures.

451
00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.480
And as we'll see in a moment,

452
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:16.440
the national government government that ends up being created under the articles

453
00:28:16.441 --> 00:28:19.140
of confederation follows the same general pattern.

454
00:28:19.141 --> 00:28:23.190
They just eliminate executive and they don't have a judicial branch either.

455
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:26.130
So basically everyone's really scared of executive power of,

456
00:28:26.131 --> 00:28:28.920
of centralized power at this point.
Okay.

457
00:28:28.921 --> 00:28:31.860
So summing up what I've just been discussing,
in essence,

458
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:36.690
most new state constitutions shared a few basic institutional features.

459
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:40.950
They had a bike camera,
legislature,
they had a weak executive,

460
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:45.390
they had rotation in office,
they had,
um,

461
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.860
as far as principals go that a lot of them at least had declarations of rights.

462
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.310
The idea that representation should be based on consent,

463
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.700
that the government rests on the people,
that the people are sovereign.

464
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.530
A somewhat broader electorate voting in annual elections.

465
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.530
Now that said,

466
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.150
the most extreme constitutional revisions actually took place in Pennsylvania

467
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:13.800
and Pennsylvania is really where the constitution ultimately reflected the most

468
00:29:13.801 --> 00:29:15.720
radical impulses of the revolution.

469
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.560
The new Pennsylvania Constitution had no property requirements for voting.

470
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:27.470
It had a one house legislature and it has some special features that clearly to

471
00:29:27.931 --> 00:29:31.710
the people who were devising that constitution were aimed at making the

472
00:29:31.711 --> 00:29:36.510
government as responsible to popular consent as possible.

473
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.120
So for example,
this is kind of wild to me.

474
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.970
Imagine how many laws would actually pass if this is the case for a lot to

475
00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:44.770
become a law in Pennsylvania,
uh,

476
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:48.310
Bill had to be passed in two consecutive sessions of the legislature.

477
00:29:48.311 --> 00:29:52.840
So a bill had to be passed twice.
So,
and between those two sessions,

478
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.670
the politicians who were passing the bill had to go home and explain it to their

479
00:29:57.671 --> 00:30:00.040
constituents.
So you would pass a law.

480
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.970
These got the representatives would go to their constituents and explain why

481
00:30:03.971 --> 00:30:07.240
they liked it and then they'd have to go back and pass it again.
Right.

482
00:30:07.241 --> 00:30:09.160
Obviously the idea of being,
okay,

483
00:30:09.161 --> 00:30:13.300
these people are really beholden to their constituents and nothing's going to

484
00:30:13.301 --> 00:30:16.510
happen unless the constituents really approve of it.

485
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:22.600
The Pennsylvania Constitution also created this nifty little sort of body called

486
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:24.220
the council of sensors.

487
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.990
And this council of sensors was kind of like a big grand jury.

488
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:31.210
It would be elected every seven years.

489
00:30:31.211 --> 00:30:36.211
And the job of the council of sensors was to evaluate all aspects of government

490
00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:37.774
action.

491
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:42.670
So basically they create this little body and the job of it is to just police

492
00:30:42.671 --> 00:30:46.630
government and make sure that everything is above board and operating in the way

493
00:30:46.631 --> 00:30:47.680
it's supposed to be operating.

494
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:51.310
So you can really see in comparison with what I was just saying about the sort

495
00:30:51.311 --> 00:30:53.800
of generality of the state constitutions.

496
00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:59.130
Pennsylvania really has an extreme reaction to the experience of the revolution

497
00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:04.480
against what the colonists perceived to be as tyranny.
So in a sense,

498
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:05.500
if you,

499
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.250
if you think of ideas about government as being kind of a pendulum and on one

500
00:31:09.251 --> 00:31:13.360
end you've got sort of British monarchical centralized power in Pennsylvania.

501
00:31:13.361 --> 00:31:15.800
Boy that pendulum went way over onto the other side.

502
00:31:15.801 --> 00:31:19.240
Like we don't want any centralized executive power.

503
00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:24.130
We're just going to be over here sort of experimenting with this interesting

504
00:31:24.131 --> 00:31:26.380
government that we haven't ever had one legged before.

505
00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:31.980
And as we'll see as we look at what happens over the next 10 15,

506
00:31:32.471 --> 00:31:33.490
17 years,

507
00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:38.500
the constitution in a way represents a midpoint between these two ends of the

508
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:43.100
spectrum.
One last point I want to,
um,

509
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:47.260
discuss about state constitutions before we get into the articles.
Um,

510
00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:51.160
while all of the state constitution revision was taking place,

511
00:31:51.161 --> 00:31:54.820
there were actually two states that we're not taking part in in it,

512
00:31:54.821 --> 00:31:55.960
not out of protest,

513
00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.820
but because their colonial charters actually had in a sense been more radical

514
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.860
than the other colonies to begin with.

515
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:08.310
And of course they are Connecticut and Rhode Island Continuing Theme Connecticut

516
00:32:08.981 --> 00:32:09.820
and Rhode Island,

517
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:15.070
their colonial charters had basically made them self governing already in on a

518
00:32:15.071 --> 00:32:20.071
certain level so they didn't have to do dramatic changes to make them into state

519
00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:22.570
constitutions.
So they basically,

520
00:32:22.571 --> 00:32:26.230
Rhode Island and Connecticut basically preserved their colonial charters is

521
00:32:26.231 --> 00:32:30.250
constitutions and didn't really change them until into the 19th century.

522
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.043
Okay.

523
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:36.460
That gets us out of the world of state constitutions and into the world of

524
00:32:36.461 --> 00:32:41.461
creating some kind of government for the new union of American States.

525
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.500
And that's ends up being the articles of confederation.

526
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:50.810
Now on July 12th,

527
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:55.100
1776 just after they had declared independence,

528
00:32:55.550 --> 00:33:00.550
the continental congress also was trying to create some kind of a proposal for a

529
00:33:01.011 --> 00:33:02.720
new national government.

530
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:08.080
And between 1776 and 1777 the continental congress drafted the articles of

531
00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:11.390
confederation

532
00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:17.940
and the articles are the document that literally created the United States of

533
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:22.310
America.
They literally gave that name to the United States of America.

534
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:26.510
But it's important that to know that they actually meant that really literally,

535
00:33:26.511 --> 00:33:28.820
I mean,
and we don't,
we sort of don't think of what that phrase means,

536
00:33:28.821 --> 00:33:32.570
but it was meant really literally in the context of what I'm talking about now.

537
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:37.010
What that said was this was not one consolidated nation.

538
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.140
This was United States.

539
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:41.810
What the article is created at United some states together.

540
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.870
That's what that phrase literally meant.

541
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.090
As John Adams explained later,

542
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.770
they never thought of consolidating this vast continent under one national

543
00:33:51.771 --> 00:33:55.730
government,
but instead erected a confederacy of states,

544
00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.220
each of which must have a separate government.

545
00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:04.540
So when 13 free and independent states had defeated England and now had to

546
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:06.980
figure out how to come together,

547
00:34:06.981 --> 00:34:11.600
they were not thinking of one big unified republic at this point.

548
00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:13.100
They really definitely we're not.

549
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:17.060
And that's the articles of confederation went along with that thinking it did

550
00:34:17.061 --> 00:34:19.900
not create one unified government.

551
00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:23.960
It did not bond people together in anything other than a loose league.

552
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:29.000
The articles created a loose league of individual Republican governments.

553
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:30.973
Now,

554
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:36.310
if as the founding generation assumed absolute power corrupts absolutely than

555
00:34:37.881 --> 00:34:41.030
the articles of confederation was a very virtuous form of government.

556
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.640
Because under the articles,

557
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:48.800
the Confederation Congress had almost no power to enforce.

558
00:34:48.801 --> 00:34:50.030
It's will at all.

559
00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:56.170
The newly created confederation was almost more of a United Nations than a

560
00:34:56.661 --> 00:35:01.370
central governing institution.
As the articles themselves stated,

561
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:07.030
they were intended to create quote a from League of friendship for their common

562
00:35:07.701 --> 00:35:08.534
defense,

563
00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:13.220
the security of their liberties and their mutual and general welfare.

564
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:19.460
The articles were basically a pact between 13 sovereign states,

565
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:24.770
which agreed that certain powers would be delegated to this new central

566
00:35:24.771 --> 00:35:27.230
government for very specific purposes.

567
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:31.310
But these 13 sovereign states retained all powers,

568
00:35:31.311 --> 00:35:35.450
not expressly delegated by them in the articles.

569
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.860
So under the articles,
the national government consisted of a one chamber,

570
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:45.030
National Congress elected by the state legislatures.

571
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.130
Each state had one vote.

572
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:52.200
Congress could request funds from the states,

573
00:35:52.201 --> 00:35:57.030
but it could not enact a tax of its own without every state's approval.
Again,

574
00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:01.110
how likely is that to happen?
So it could not really make its own taxes.

575
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.970
It could not regulate interstate commerce between the states.

576
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.800
The article did not provide for any kind of an executive branch or any kind of

577
00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:13.020
an executive character at all.
Instead,

578
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:18.420
congressional committees oversaw anything having to do with finance or diplomacy

579
00:36:18.421 --> 00:36:19.710
or military affairs.

580
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:25.520
There was no judicial system by which this new national government could compel

581
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:29.580
allegiance to its laws.
So basically,

582
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.520
as far as the powers of Congress were concerned,

583
00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:37.860
the confederation congress was kind of feeling the place of the imperial system.

584
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:43.920
It could regulate foreign affairs,
it could declare war with foreign countries,

585
00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:45.960
it could negotiate peace treaties,

586
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:51.060
it could fix standards for weights and measures.
It could manage Indian affairs.

587
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.240
It could borrow money,
although it couldn't really tax.

588
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:59.790
Basically the Confederation Congress had power over war and foreign affairs and

589
00:37:00.001 --> 00:37:04.530
the states maintained control over what they called internal policing.

590
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.380
Now it's important to realize that in the context of the time when they were

591
00:37:10.381 --> 00:37:14.220
created,
the articles of confederation actually make perfect sense.

592
00:37:14.221 --> 00:37:16.890
I think it's really easy,
and I'll talk a little bit more about this on Thursday.

593
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.860
I think it's really easy to look at the articles and say,
Huh,

594
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:23.370
what were they thinking?
How did that make sense?

595
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:27.180
Let's create a government and give it no power go.
Yeah,
so I think,

596
00:37:27.181 --> 00:37:31.350
I think the articles get a bum rap basically in the long view of history and I

597
00:37:31.351 --> 00:37:35.670
think it's important to realize at that moment in time they made perfect sense

598
00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:40.110
given the experience of the revolution and what people had just experienced in

599
00:37:40.111 --> 00:37:41.550
the realm of government.

600
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:46.200
Basically the articles denied to this new government,

601
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:51.240
the very powers and violations that they had seen at the heart of the

602
00:37:51.241 --> 00:37:55.050
revolution.
So the Congress can't tax,

603
00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:58.470
the Congress can't overrule local laws.

604
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:01.650
The congress can't alter a state constitution.

605
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.860
It can't interfere with state judicial proceedings.

606
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:09.990
All of these things are things that we saw in past weeks happening during the

607
00:38:09.991 --> 00:38:14.730
course of the revolution inflicted by the British.
So this is a really,
I mean,

608
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:17.370
again and again,
when people are creating constitutions,

609
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:21.090
they learn a lesson and then they act based on that lesson that they learned.

610
00:38:21.091 --> 00:38:24.600
And Then Bay,
they look at this new thing they created and go,
okay,

611
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.070
new lesson learned.

612
00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.980
Let's make another government because we didn't like that one so much.

613
00:38:28.981 --> 00:38:32.910
But you can actually see people experiencing someone thinking about what that

614
00:38:32.911 --> 00:38:36.700
means and then creating a government based on those immediate lessons.

615
00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:39.640
That's what we see here with the articles of confederation.

616
00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.940
And then to avoid an entrenched elite,

617
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:48.070
we don't want any kind of a little aristocracy coming up in America.

618
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.370
The articles did establish rotation in office.

619
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:55.360
So you could not be in office more than three of every six years.

620
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.290
You couldn't be president of Congress more than one in any three years.

621
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.510
And any delicate could be instantly recalled by his home state.

622
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:10.420
Okay,
so there are,
we see this,
this weak central government.

623
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:14.500
Lots of things that can't do.
There were very,

624
00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:19.501
very few things that the states were restricted from doing under this new

625
00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:20.613
compact,

626
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:23.950
but there were a couple of things that the states were not supposed to do.

627
00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:27.700
And you'll hear they're not exactly Dyer restrictions.
Okay.

628
00:39:27.701 --> 00:39:32.470
So no state could enter into an alliance or treaty with a foreign nation without

629
00:39:32.471 --> 00:39:36.520
the consent of Congress.
So New Jersey cannot make a treaty with France.
Okay?

630
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:39.580
They need to go through congress.
No,

631
00:39:39.581 --> 00:39:44.110
two or more states could enter into a confederation without the consent of

632
00:39:44.111 --> 00:39:45.460
Congress.
Okay?
Think about that one.

633
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:49.010
So New England can't break away and form its own confederation without least

634
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:50.290
checking with us first.

635
00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:55.070
Would you allow us to break off and form our own confederation?
No.
I,

636
00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.270
that would've been an interesting little game.
No.
Well,
we'll try to stop us,

637
00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:01.630
but at least it's saying states are not supposed to form their own little mini

638
00:40:01.631 --> 00:40:03.580
confederations states.

639
00:40:03.581 --> 00:40:08.470
We're not to keep warships or troops in peacetime unless Congress deemed it

640
00:40:08.471 --> 00:40:11.620
necessary for defense states.

641
00:40:11.621 --> 00:40:14.770
We're not supposed to declare war without consent of Congress.
That's nice.

642
00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:19.270
Except where sudden invasion admitted have no delay.
Okay?

643
00:40:19.271 --> 00:40:23.920
Those are the restraints,
right?
Ooh,
those are not dire restraints.

644
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:27.100
Don't don't like make war with another country all by yourself.

645
00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:30.520
Don't break away from the articles from the League of friendship and form your

646
00:40:30.521 --> 00:40:34.690
own little country.
Don't make a treaty with a foreign nation all by yourself.

647
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:36.490
Those are the restrictions on the states.

648
00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:41.760
Obviously none of these restraints placed too serious a check on the sovereignty

649
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.950
of the states under this compact.

650
00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:50.940
So essentially the articles of confederation were designed so that the new

651
00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:55.960
nation's central government would not infringe on the states.
As I said before,

652
00:40:55.961 --> 00:41:00.670
it would kind of fill the hole where the the British imperial system had been

653
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:04.420
before.
Have a very,
very limited sphere of actions,

654
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:08.200
not really have a power of enforcement and leave everything that wasn't

655
00:41:08.201 --> 00:41:12.580
specified to the states to control on their own.
Now,

656
00:41:12.581 --> 00:41:16.930
this is a document that's being drafted in the middle of a revolution and what

657
00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:20.410
we're going to see over the course of the next few lectures is that once

658
00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:22.270
revolutions end,
and this,

659
00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:26.140
remember we started the course by talking about how the colonies came together

660
00:41:26.141 --> 00:41:28.060
basically when they needed to defend themselves.

661
00:41:28.061 --> 00:41:29.920
And then as soon as I didn't need to defend themselves,

662
00:41:29.921 --> 00:41:32.740
they went boom and sort of parted.
Okay,

663
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:36.470
we had this revolution and the states,
the colonies,
they come together,

664
00:41:36.471 --> 00:41:39.470
they unite,
they fight together,
and then the war ends.

665
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:42.200
So guess what the 1780 [inaudible] is going to look like.
Okay.

666
00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:44.030
It's going to look like just what you think it will look like.

667
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:46.760
The states basically all turn their back on each other and say,
well,

668
00:41:46.761 --> 00:41:50.810
that was nice.
Now we're going to do our own thing.
Thank you very much.

669
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:55.310
So the articles is drafted in a time when there's this cooperation going on

670
00:41:55.311 --> 00:41:59.870
between the states.
What we're going to see in the next two lectures,
um,

671
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:03.740
is what happens when these articles actually go into effect.

672
00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.260
What do the 70s and eighties look like?

673
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:11.500
And that's going to take us on the road to new lessons being learned and yet

674
00:42:11.961 --> 00:42:13.280
another government think about,

675
00:42:13.281 --> 00:42:15.740
think about the pace at which governments are being created in this period.

676
00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:19.490
It gets back to where I started at the beginning of this lecture.
They're just,

677
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.150
hey,
we need a new government.
Let's make one now.
Okay,
how do you like that one?

678
00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.470
I Dunno,
we need to revise it there.

679
00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.760
Also revising these governments throughout this period that's also got to be a

680
00:42:28.761 --> 00:42:30.320
little unsettling.
You know,

681
00:42:30.321 --> 00:42:34.640
it's part of why in this period people tend to get very upset or scared.

682
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.730
Something goes a little wrong and they think it's the end of the government.

683
00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:42.080
Well,
if it's only two years old,
you know,
maybe it will collapse.

684
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:45.200
And if these are the guys who actually made the government,

685
00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:48.290
then they kind of have a good reason for thinking that it could fall apart.

686
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.800
They were there when they put it together,
maybe it's actually going to collapse.

687
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.810
So that's actually,
and we're gonna see that,

688
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:57.260
particularly in the seventies and eighties,
and then the 1790,

689
00:42:57.261 --> 00:42:59.880
if you won't be talking so much about the 1790 [inaudible] um,

690
00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.840
if you want to take my early national America course,

691
00:43:02.841 --> 00:43:05.290
that will start right where this one drops off actually,

692
00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:07.280
and takes us into the 1790s.

693
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.640
But you can see that spirit in the 17 nine [inaudible] of people saying,
wow,

694
00:43:10.641 --> 00:43:12.320
we've been creating a lot of governments.

695
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.950
You think this one's going to stick around?
I don't know.
I hope so.

696
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:19.130
Maybe it'll last for five years.
That'll be exciting.
So,
okay,

697
00:43:19.131 --> 00:43:20.840
I will stop there on Thursday.

698
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:24.350
We will look at what happened when the articles go into effect.
