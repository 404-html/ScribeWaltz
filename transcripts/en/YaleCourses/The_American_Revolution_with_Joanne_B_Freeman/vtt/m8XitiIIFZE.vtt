1
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.440
Today's lecture basically is titled a Union without power.

2
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.890
Um,
in past years I've titled it powers of powers,

3
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:15.340
problems of the confederation,
and you'll see why by the end of the lecture.
Um,

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.980
on Tuesday,

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.380
I started to talk about the larger question of the legacy of the revolution in

6
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:27.381
the process of governance and I started us off by talking about the drafting of

7
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:32.391
state constitutions and the drafting of the articles of confederation and in a

8
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:33.504
sense,

9
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.540
one uniting theme that ran through both parts of that lecture was the ways in

10
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:43.380
which the states and their rights and their sovereignty.

11
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.480
We're really at the center of things.
I mean,

12
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:48.540
in a way you could say that that entire lecture was about the states,

13
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.810
even though it was about really talking about a way to unify them.

14
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.010
Certainly you can see that in the content of the articles themselves and the

15
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:03.000
ways in which they were largely centered on defining and limiting the amount of

16
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:07.170
power that was given to the Confederation Congress.
Well,

17
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:10.980
today what we're going to look at is the impact of that.

18
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.010
We're going to basically be looking at how the articles played out in the

19
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.940
seventies and eighties given the amount of power that they had or the amount of

20
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:22.440
power that they didn't have,

21
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:27.090
but one way or another we're going to see what happened in the 1780s and as an

22
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:28.200
introduction to that.

23
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.210
I want to talk for just a few minutes about some of the actual debates in

24
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:36.060
Congress about the articles themselves,

25
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.010
some of the things that gave people in Congress pause when the articles were

26
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:42.960
being written because as you'll see,

27
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.590
this reveals a lot about the mindset of the time regarding centralized power and

28
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:53.670
state power and understanding that mindset is going to explain some of what

29
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:55.770
we're going to see in the bulk of today's lecture,

30
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:59.420
which is really going to be looking at events that took place in the 70s and

31
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.390
eighties I'm also going to mention these things right now that I'm going to talk

32
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:07.680
about briefly because in a couple of lectures from now when we begin talking

33
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:11.880
about the constitution,
you're going to see them basically all crop up again.

34
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.220
So just a few minutes about the debate over the articles.
Now,

35
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:21.870
one thing worth noting is that even as Congress was trying to figure out some

36
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.980
form of union,

37
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.870
even the people on the committee appointed to draft the articles of

38
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:32.871
confederation were not entirely at ease with the idea of centralizing power in

39
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.660
that way.
So this is just a random comment,

40
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:40.560
but it's from Edward Rutledge of South Carolina and it's a private letter that

41
00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:45.561
he wrote to a friend and he was actually on the congressional committee that was

42
00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:47.580
given the task of writing,

43
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.670
coming up with something that would be ultimately the articles of confederation.

44
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:52.560
So this is what Rutledge says to his friend.

45
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.220
If the plan now proposed should be adopted,

46
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.520
nothing less than ruin to some colonies will be the consequence.

47
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.960
The idea of destroying all provincial distinctions and making everything of the

48
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:09.961
most minute kind bend to what they call the good of the whole is in other terms

49
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:13.450
to say that these colonies must be subject to the government of the eastern

50
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:17.710
provinces,
the force of their arms,
I hold exceeding cheap,

51
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.950
but I dread their overruling influence in council.

52
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.580
I dread their low cunning and those leveling principles,

53
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:27.730
which men without character and without fortune in general possess,

54
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:32.731
which are so captivating to the lower classes of mankind and which will occasion

55
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:36.820
such a fluctuation of property as to introduce the greatest disorder.

56
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.860
I am resolved to vest the congress with no more power than what is absolutely

57
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:45.610
necessary for.
I am confident if surrendered into the hands of others.

58
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.180
A most pernicious use will be made of it.
Okay,

59
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:52.450
so listen to some of what relish just said there.
Okay.

60
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:57.430
He's afraid that making everything Ben to the good of the whole is basically

61
00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:02.230
saying the same thing as subjecting all of the colonies to the eastern provinces

62
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:05.260
and by eastern provinces.
He means New England.
He says,

63
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:07.450
well as soon as we do sort of bend the,

64
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:10.900
my newest thing to the good of the whole New England is just going to take over.

65
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.910
That's basically what he is saying in that letter.

66
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.360
I don't want to be ruled by New England and then right after that he says the

67
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:21.700
force of their arms,
I hold exceeding cheap.
Okay.

68
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.920
I'm not scared of them militarily.
Like we could beat them in a fight.
However,

69
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.450
that low Cunnington those kinds of people have,
they will take over in councils,

70
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:32.890
right?
They'll control congress.

71
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.000
I don't like the whole idea of being governed by New England and because of
that,

72
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.170
I'm not entirely sure about this whole articles of confederation idea.

73
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.880
So it how's that for spirit of League of friendship that guys on the committee,

74
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.030
this actually drafting the document and he's that suspicious about regional

75
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.130
prejudices about New England trying to take over.

76
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.080
So that just gives you a little bit of a sense of how uneasy people were with

77
00:04:59.081 --> 00:05:04.081
centralizing power in any way on this sort of national [inaudible] kind of

78
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.930
level,

79
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.250
particularly given their fears about giving up some of the power and sovereignty

80
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:13.630
that was held by their own independent states.
Now,

81
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:16.480
once congress actually began debating the articles,

82
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:20.650
there were actually three main controversies I'm going to bring up now and for

83
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:22.160
obvious reasons as I mentioned them because you'll,

84
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.420
you'll see why they all come up again.

85
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:27.490
As soon as we begin talking about the constitution.

86
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.620
These three things all helped to slow down and complicate debate over the

87
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:36.730
articles so that even though they start talking about the articles in 1776

88
00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:41.350
there's a reason why it takes all the way until November of 1777 for Congress to

89
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:43.510
decide that they're done with them.
Okay,

90
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:47.140
so the first of these three controversy's,
not surprisingly I,

91
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:49.600
but I can even ask you to guess them.
You probably would guess them,

92
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.220
but the first one is representation.
Surprise,
not a surprise at all.

93
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.210
The idea of representation caused an extended over whether voting in Congress.

94
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.790
Once again,
it should be based on population,

95
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:05.300
which is what the larger states want or one vote,
one state,

96
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.610
which is obviously what the smaller states want.

97
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.400
As James Wilson of Pennsylvania put it,

98
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.940
it is strange that annex in the name of state to 10,000 men should give them an

99
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:20.870
equal right with 40,000 this must be the effect of magic,
not a reason.

100
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.470
Okay.
That argument appears almost verbatim,

101
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:27.500
but certainly that argument appears again once,
once again,

102
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:30.500
we're talking about representation,
centralized power,
the constitution,

103
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.480
not surprisingly related to representation.

104
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.560
The second controversial topic I'm going to raise here is taxation.

105
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.230
There was an extended debate over whether the common expenses of the war should

106
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:49.310
be divided up among the states on the basis of total population,

107
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.810
including slaves or on the basis of the free population only.

108
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:55.310
So here we have taxation,

109
00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.200
representation and slavery all bound together happily in one issue that

110
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:04.160
obviously is going to be controversial and obviously is not going to go away.

111
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:07.850
And he's going to come back to the very next occasion when they're talking about

112
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:12.410
representation,
centralized power,
so representation,

113
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:13.040
taxation.

114
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.780
And the third main controversy that slowed down the passage of the articles was

115
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:22.010
the question of the West Western territories.
Not surprisingly,

116
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:27.011
there was a big division between large landed states with extensive western land

117
00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:32.660
claims.
States like Massachusetts,
Connecticut,
New York,
Virginia,

118
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:37.160
North Carolina,
and small landless states like Maryland,

119
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.620
Delaware,
New Jersey,
New Hampshire.

120
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.830
Landless States saw the Confederation Congress as a sort of successor to the

121
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:50.180
crowns,
property rights in the West.
So,
in other words,
smaller states,

122
00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:55.181
landless states wanted Congress to take over vast western territorial claims and

123
00:07:56.781 --> 00:08:01.781
then convert them into some kind of a common stock of land who sale could help

124
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.360
discharge some of the national war debt.
So that's what the,

125
00:08:05.361 --> 00:08:09.320
the smaller states or the landless states want.
And the idea behind that,

126
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:13.460
the logic behind that was that what was gained at common expense,

127
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.640
independence and control of those western lands should be used for common

128
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.083
benefit.

129
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.900
Now obviously the states that owned western lands are going to feel really

130
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:25.370
differently about that whole issue,

131
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.840
but it's not surprising that that would be a point of controversy.
Okay.

132
00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:34.700
So those are three central concerns over the articles,
representation,
taxation,

133
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:38.480
and the western lands thanks to issues like those.

134
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:43.690
The articles were debated from mid 1776 through November of 1777 when they

135
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:48.731
finally were completed and then submitted to the states for ratification.

136
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:54.430
The main reason why debate stopped at that point in 1777 is not because everyone

137
00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:58.020
decided those questions had been settled,

138
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.170
but because of the American victory at Saratoga.

139
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.980
So basically people realized if the states weren't United into one joint

140
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:12.000
political entity at that point it would be almost impossible for them to get

141
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:12.990
foreign aid.

142
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.710
They had to at least prove that they could unite somehow if they were going to

143
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:20.010
convince foreign countries that it was worthwhile investing in whatever was

144
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:21.270
happening in America.

145
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.460
So signing the articles of confederation and sending them off for ratification

146
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:27.780
was a way of giving,

147
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.730
added credence to the American cause in the eyes of the world at a very

148
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.870
strategic moment as Samuel Chase of Maryland road,

149
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:39.270
right in the midst of the debate over the articles,

150
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.160
what contract will a foreign state make with us when we cannot agree among

151
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:46.050
ourselves is a pretty good point.

152
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.480
This basic reality led Congress to complete the article,
send it to the states,

153
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.210
the states,
ultimately they discuss them.

154
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:59.300
Some came to a conclusion quicker than others and it was not until 1781 that the

155
00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:02.850
articles formally were put into effect.

156
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.980
Now I want to turn to what happened once the article is actually went into

157
00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:10.920
effect.
And as we set out into this discussion,

158
00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:14.610
I want to take just a moment here to defend the articles just a little bit.

159
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:18.480
And I did this a little bit in,
in Tuesday's lecture too because as you'll see,

160
00:10:18.481 --> 00:10:21.990
it'll be very clear by the end of this lecture why I'm doing this.
Um,

161
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.730
it's very easy to listen to what happened in the seventies and eighties and

162
00:10:26.731 --> 00:10:29.130
conclude this is the most inadequate,

163
00:10:29.131 --> 00:10:31.770
goofy form of government I can possibly imagine,
right?

164
00:10:31.771 --> 00:10:35.430
Cause all we're going to see in this lecture is one after another after another

165
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:38.910
instance of this government not working so well.
Um,

166
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.980
and it doesn't help that you have all of these really strident nationalist in

167
00:10:43.981 --> 00:10:46.230
this time period.
We're going to hear from a couple of them too,

168
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.930
who threw out the 1780s is for some of them,

169
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:53.931
even in part of the 1770s felt really strongly that there needed to be a

170
00:10:55.141 --> 00:11:00.141
stronger centralized government and were really vocal in expressing their doubts

171
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.320
and expressing what they thought really needed to happen.
So Hamilton,

172
00:11:04.321 --> 00:11:06.600
Alexander Hamilton's always griping about the weak government.

173
00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:11.601
George Washington always griping about the weak government added to the sort of

174
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:15.690
bad PR for the articles of confederation are the federalist essays,

175
00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:17.850
and I'll talk about them in a couple of lectures too,

176
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:23.220
but as we'll see when we look at them,
the federalist essays are not objective.

177
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.520
They're written with an agenda.
I'll go more into this in more detail later,

178
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:32.180
but they are aimed at proving that the proposed constitution is absolutely

179
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.620
necessary and one of the ways in which they did that was to just rip the

180
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:39.930
articles of confederation to shreds,
right?

181
00:11:39.931 --> 00:11:42.300
To prove that the constitution was really necessary.

182
00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:46.110
One of the things the federalist essays really try to accomplish is proving how

183
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:50.370
horrible and incompetent and in an inadequate the articles of confederation are.

184
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.440
And if you believe that,
then you're going to be even more likely to think,

185
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:57.220
oh wow,
they're so bad.
Maybe this constitution actually really is.

186
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.990
We absolutely have to go for it.

187
00:11:58.991 --> 00:12:02.980
So it was part of their sort of rhetorical strategy and the federalist essays to

188
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:06.790
make the articles look really bad.
Not that they need a lot of help necessarily,

189
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:09.790
but they were really emphasizing that in the federalist essays.

190
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.310
So for a moment,

191
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.820
all I'm trying to say with this is just consider that there are all of these

192
00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:19.920
reasons why for natural reasons,
for bad PR reasons,
um,

193
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.950
it's natural for us to look at the articles and think of them as just a big

194
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:24.671
mistake.

195
00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:29.410
But of course the problem with that kind of reasoning is presentism,

196
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.160
right?
It's judging the articles based on what we know comes next.

197
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.650
So we know like write down the pike,

198
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:37.510
there's a constitution just waiting to happen.

199
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:40.120
So we know there's a stronger government coming.

200
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.340
We know that it works because it's still working.

201
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:47.260
So we know in a sense the end of this particular story and knowing that it's

202
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:50.500
very hard for us to look at the articles and give them,

203
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.590
they don't get much respect to keep very much respect to the articles of

204
00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:54.221
confederation.

205
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:58.690
But that's not quite fair to judge those historical actors in that moment,

206
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.780
in that way.
Because of course they don't know what's coming next.

207
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.460
They're acting in the moment.

208
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.630
They're acting based on lessons they've just learned with the knowledge of the

209
00:13:07.631 --> 00:13:11.860
moment.
So I think rather even after everything I say in today's lecture,

210
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.980
rather than condemning the articles as a kind of broken or faulty or sad system

211
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:18.214
of government,

212
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:23.320
we should instead really understand them in the context of the time and really

213
00:13:23.321 --> 00:13:28.090
understand the ways in which they represent precisely what should have been the

214
00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:33.040
first attempt at a national government based on the fears and assumptions that

215
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:36.280
prevailed in the United States at that time.

216
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.560
As I talked about on Tuesday,

217
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:43.180
there were natural fears about a strong centralized national government and of

218
00:13:43.181 --> 00:13:48.181
course there were given the revolution has just happened and given that people

219
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:50.800
could look back on the revolution and say,
well,
okay,

220
00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:53.800
we know that the continental congress had problems but we won.

221
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:58.210
People had some reason to assume,
well that worked basically.

222
00:13:58.211 --> 00:14:02.890
So we'll kind of assume that some version of that we'll continue to work as long

223
00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:07.891
as we have some kind of a sense of common purpose and there is the problem and

224
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:10.960
that is what we're going to see today.

225
00:14:10.961 --> 00:14:15.961
Because the unhappy surprise of the 1780s was that once the war was over,

226
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:21.100
there was not all that much of a sense of common purpose anymore.

227
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.720
So as I detail all of these problems today with the articles,

228
00:14:25.721 --> 00:14:27.010
try to bear in mind that yes,

229
00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:29.980
they did not function as well as people maybe hoped they would,

230
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.810
but that rather than a stupid mistake,

231
00:14:31.811 --> 00:14:36.811
they were a logical first step in a larger process of nation making.

232
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.480
They made sense as a first step.
Now,

233
00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:45.481
even before some of the problems of the 1780s began to unfold,

234
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:50.290
there were already people who felt that the continental congress had been

235
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:54.710
frustratingly,
we heard about some of these couple of weeks back.
Um,

236
00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:55.790
and not surprisingly,

237
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:59.330
people who'd been angry about the continental congress are now irritated with

238
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:02.480
the Confederation Congress too often,

239
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:07.610
or at least some of these people had experienced in one way or another firsthand

240
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.620
frustrations because of what they viewed as the inadequacies of these various

241
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.840
congresses.
So for example,

242
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:17.930
I mentioned I think actually in an earlier lecture that there were some people

243
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:22.190
at Washington's headquarters during the war who experienced firsthand how hard

244
00:15:22.191 --> 00:15:25.070
it was for Congress to get them supplies and men,

245
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.640
partly just because congress wasn't functioning necessarily very well.

246
00:15:28.641 --> 00:15:32.630
And so a lot of people that Washington's headquarters during the war ended up

247
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.010
being really strong.

248
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.460
Nationalists and Hamilton and Washington obviously are among that group,

249
00:15:37.461 --> 00:15:40.550
but there's a whole string of other people as well who are all writing letters

250
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:45.530
to each other throughout the 1780 sing,
ah,
we're dying.
It's all going down to,

251
00:15:45.531 --> 00:15:48.680
oh well you fought the war.
We won.
Now what's happening?

252
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.500
We'll hear a Washington letter along these lines and just a couple of minutes.

253
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.420
Other people who are unhappy with the Confederation Congress,

254
00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.800
where people who had attempted to deal with foreign affairs during the

255
00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:05.801
revolution and again on that front had seen how congress had dilly dallied.

256
00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:10.580
It had failed to give effective,
efficient concrete instructions.

257
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.590
And John Jay was one of those people who distrusted what was I ever was going to

258
00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:19.340
happen with the articles because he'd seen what happened with a similar congress

259
00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:20.180
during the revolution.

260
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.440
Some other people had been actual members of the continental congress and found

261
00:16:27.741 --> 00:16:31.640
themselves frustrated at some point about getting things implemented.

262
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.460
And James Madison falls into that category.

263
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.490
And obviously I'm just naming a few random instances here.

264
00:16:37.491 --> 00:16:39.200
There are many other people who felt this way.

265
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:44.270
These men perceive what seemed to them like a supreme irony.

266
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:50.290
It would be the ideals and principles of the revolution that would tear apart

267
00:16:50.721 --> 00:16:54.890
the new nation that the revolution had created.
So in their mind,

268
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.640
all of these fears about state sovereignty,
about concerns,

269
00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:02.630
about centralized power,
about tyranny,
about protecting property,

270
00:17:02.631 --> 00:17:03.830
about protecting liberties,

271
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:08.000
all of those things might actually lead people to be so distrustful of a

272
00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:12.110
government that maybe it would bring the entire experiment in government

273
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.580
crashing down almost before it had had a chance to begin.
Now,

274
00:17:16.581 --> 00:17:20.840
what was it that so upset these men about the 1780?

275
00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:25.841
So let's turn to some of the events of the 1780s and see now for one thing right

276
00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:27.500
off the cuff,

277
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:32.500
the state of foreign relations in the 1780s seemed alarming to them,

278
00:17:32.631 --> 00:17:34.970
particularly regarding Great Britain.

279
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:40.970
Despite the fact that Americans had won the war,
that they had to go shake it.

280
00:17:40.971 --> 00:17:43.460
A treaty with Britain that had cleared terms in it,

281
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.930
Britain was still putting up barriers and hurdles and basically not being very

282
00:17:47.931 --> 00:17:50.610
cooperative.
So throughout the 1780s,

283
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.960
they largely refuse to cooperate with aspects of the Treaty of Paris.

284
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:56.401
So for example,

285
00:17:56.401 --> 00:18:01.020
although they had agreed to abandon their posts in the western territories,

286
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:05.730
they just didn't,
sorry,
we're still here.

287
00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:10.380
Um,
they also have implemented a number of different trade restrictions.

288
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:13.920
Some of them were implemented not just towards the United States,

289
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:18.600
but America for example,
found itself suddenly unable to import,
um,

290
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:22.370
like machine tools to build manufacturing,
um,

291
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.140
institutions to build factories in America.

292
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.140
Suddenly America found itself unable to import these things.

293
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:31.950
There are other places who also were not being able to take these things from

294
00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:35.220
Britain,
but now that suddenly Americans out of the British imperial system,

295
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.700
they don't have access to things that they once had access to before in Britain

296
00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:43.230
is certainly not being cooperative on that front.
Along similar lines,

297
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.220
the French and the Spanish were also proving difficult,

298
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:52.200
doing things like attempting to exercise control over the Mississippi,
uh,

299
00:18:52.201 --> 00:18:53.670
to control shipping,

300
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.900
holding back attempts by Americans to expand throughout the area.

301
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.110
So just on the foreign affairs front alone,

302
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.520
things don't look really thrilling and it's not at all clear what this congress

303
00:19:05.521 --> 00:19:06.840
is going to be able to do about it.

304
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.680
And you can hear the impact of these kinds of developments in a letter that

305
00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:13.770
Washington wrote to a friend,
and this is as early as 1784,

306
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:20.160
the disinclination of the individual states to yield competent powers to

307
00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:21.720
Congress for the federal government.

308
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.170
They're unreasonable jealousy of that body and of one another.

309
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:29.820
And the disposition which seems to pervade each of being all wise and all

310
00:19:29.821 --> 00:19:34.020
powerful within itself will if there is not a change in the system,

311
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:39.050
be our downfall as a nation.
This is as clear to me as the ABC.

312
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.050
This is clear as the alphabet,
but that's a weird Washingtonian version of it.

313
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:48.350
This is clear to me as the ABC and I think we have opposed Great Britain and

314
00:19:48.511 --> 00:19:51.930
have arrived at the present state of peace and independency to very little

315
00:19:51.931 --> 00:19:55.230
purpose.
If we cannot conquer our own prejudices,

316
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:59.250
the powers of Europe began to see this and our newly acquired friends,

317
00:19:59.251 --> 00:20:03.210
the British are already acting upon this ground and wisely to,

318
00:20:03.211 --> 00:20:05.550
if we are determined to persevere in our folly,

319
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.380
they know that individual opposition to their measures is futile and boast that

320
00:20:10.381 --> 00:20:12.480
we are not sufficiently United as a nation.

321
00:20:12.481 --> 00:20:17.481
To give a general one is not the indignity alone of this declaration sufficient

322
00:20:17.821 --> 00:20:22.620
to stimulate us to vest more extensive and adequate powers in the sovereign of

323
00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:23.850
these United States.
Okay.

324
00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:28.620
That's one passage of a stream of letters of this sort that are being sent back

325
00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:31.410
and forth throughout the 1780 so of course they're being sent from one

326
00:20:31.411 --> 00:20:33.580
nationalist guy to another nationalist guy.
So they're,

327
00:20:33.581 --> 00:20:36.870
they're sort of preaching to the choir,
right?
This is our whole,
yes,

328
00:20:36.871 --> 00:20:40.050
it's horrible.
It's really horrible.
Yes,
it's really horrible things.

329
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.800
They all agree with each other,
but they all strike that kind of a tone.

330
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:48.340
So that's just in the world of foreign affairs domestically,

331
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.740
things seemed equally alarming.

332
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:56.230
The Confederation Congress could not even manage to consistently summon a quorum

333
00:20:56.231 --> 00:20:59.530
of states so that they could conduct business.

334
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:04.060
Typical of many complaining letters of the period is one by Rufus king of New

335
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.910
York in 1785 and he wrote to a friend,

336
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.130
we have only five states represented.
Pennsylvania and Connecticut are expected.

337
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:15.520
And when they are here,
we can form a house.
Oh boy,

338
00:21:15.521 --> 00:21:18.850
we're going to be almost able to actually do something as soon as Pennsylvania

339
00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:22.090
and Connecticut get here.
Thank you very much.
Again.

340
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.130
Not a lot of excitement and power and energy being vested in this congress.

341
00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.950
Why were there so few delegates even bothering to attend Congress?

342
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.980
Well,
for one thing,
as I sort of hinted in the last lecture,

343
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:39.370
people were much more interested in what was going on in their own states.

344
00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:44.770
So a lot of people just remained at home centralized issues that affected other

345
00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:49.771
states very often seem to people to be of secondary importance to concerns in

346
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:54.550
their own state.
And an extreme example of what I'm talking about here,

347
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.750
a sort of good example of people being more concerned with their own state.

348
00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:03.751
Then with anything national in scope took place in Vermont beginning in 1777 and

349
00:22:04.271 --> 00:22:08.500
continuing through the seventies and eighties now basically for a long period of

350
00:22:08.501 --> 00:22:13.090
time,
New York and New Hampshire both claimed possession of the territory that

351
00:22:13.091 --> 00:22:17.160
eventually would become the state of Vermont.
Well,

352
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:22.170
in 1777 residents of that territory led by Ethan Allen declared their

353
00:22:23.261 --> 00:22:25.480
independence from New York and New Hampshire.

354
00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.260
So the revolution is inspiring in many ways and here you can see the power of

355
00:22:29.261 --> 00:22:31.510
the revolution.
We're declaring our independence,

356
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.830
so they declare themselves quote to the Independent Republic of Vermont.

357
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.320
We are now of the independent republic of Vermont.

358
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.900
So there and they actually begin to write up their own constitution and you,

359
00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:46.600
you can really see the influence of revolutionary events.
Naturally enough,

360
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.440
the governor of New York became concerned about this because to him,

361
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.860
part of his State was trying to succeed and this was not a good thing.

362
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:58.330
So he pleaded with New York's congressional delegates to please do something

363
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.770
like maybe declare that that territory belongs to New York and get the other

364
00:23:02.771 --> 00:23:05.680
states to agree with this.
So this problem will go away.

365
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.840
New York's governor,

366
00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:11.470
as well as a number of other people became more concerned when they heard that

367
00:23:11.471 --> 00:23:16.471
Ethan Allen was supposedly negotiating in one way or another with the British to

368
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:21.640
abandon Vermont's claims to independence if the British would recognize their

369
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:25.300
separate status,
supposedly.
So,
okay.

370
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:30.100
Supposedly we have a territory declaring itself an independent republic and then

371
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.010
negotiating with the British in the middle of the war.
Right.

372
00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:36.310
Except this is a republic and we won't fight for independence.

373
00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:37.960
It's a little alarming.

374
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:42.580
So among all of the reasons why that's unacceptable and alarming.

375
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:47.700
One major reason is it obviously represents the dismemberment of potentially two

376
00:23:47.781 --> 00:23:52.130
states,
right?
In New York and New Hampshire.
So what does the Congress do?

377
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:57.590
Nothing as a delegate from Maryland road home to his state governor.

378
00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.580
He had been called back to Congress because of the supposed crisis of Vermont.

379
00:24:01.581 --> 00:24:02.300
But quote,

380
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:07.160
we have business enough on our hands without carving out more at this time.

381
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.370
So this guy is basically saying,
you know,
please,
we have enough to do,

382
00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:15.260
I don't care about this whole thing is Vermont thing.
What a pain.

383
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.530
Like why don't they just sort of deal with it up there wherever it's happening.

384
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:24.140
Vermont seeing something of a lack of action on the national front became a

385
00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:27.740
little more aggressive,
began to annex to their republic's.

386
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.060
Some towns in New Hampshire,

387
00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:34.100
there were a little few little skirmishes with New York in 1781 on the border

388
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.880
and then ominously everything got very quiet on the border between Vermont and

389
00:24:40.731 --> 00:24:42.050
Canada.
Right?

390
00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:44.540
So people get in their thinking if these guys let somehow negotiating with the

391
00:24:44.541 --> 00:24:47.030
British is there's some weird thing happening between these guys and the British

392
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:51.230
and now people are sort of skirmishing about borders in New York.

393
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.910
What congress kind of panicked at this point because all of this up and it seems

394
00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:58.040
scary,
strange and potentially threatening.

395
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.990
So they made some sort of a vague counter deal with Vermont that's like,
okay,

396
00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:04.940
you okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Like we'll,
we'll,

397
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.980
we'll sort of think about this whole statehood thing.

398
00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.730
Vermont certainly held back from talking with the British and then Congress

399
00:25:10.731 --> 00:25:12.770
failed to follow through at all.

400
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.100
So nothing happened.

401
00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:20.660
Yorktown and the seeming end of the war came 1781 the British lost interest in

402
00:25:20.661 --> 00:25:21.410
Vermont.

403
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:25.430
Congress lost interest in Vermont and Vermont remained in this kind of limbo,

404
00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:30.350
unknowing what it was.
Is it an independent republic?
Is it part of New York?

405
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.320
Is it part of New Hampshire?
Is it a state?
Is it not a state?

406
00:25:33.321 --> 00:25:38.321
And this persisted throughout the entire 1780s this weird limbo for the people

407
00:25:38.391 --> 00:25:41.330
of Vermont.
Nobody really quite deciding what was going on.

408
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.740
A similar problem took place when part of North Carolina attempted to secede

409
00:25:47.751 --> 00:25:51.500
from the state of North Carolina and declared itself the state of Franklin.

410
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.200
We are now the state of Franklin.

411
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.370
I just love the fact that the revolutions inspiring all these people to declare

412
00:25:58.371 --> 00:25:59.780
themselves independent states.

413
00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:04.820
So in 1784 basically the way that this works is you have people living on the

414
00:26:04.821 --> 00:26:07.390
western territories,
the western edge of,

415
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:09.620
of lands that belonged to North Carolina,

416
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:15.250
and they hear that North Carolina Ted contribute to the paying back of war debts

417
00:26:15.591 --> 00:26:18.380
is going to give up these western lands to the congress.
Right?

418
00:26:18.381 --> 00:26:20.390
I've already talked about that being discussed.

419
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.260
So these people in this Western territories say,
oh great,

420
00:26:24.261 --> 00:26:27.260
well if the lands are being given up to Congress,
then we're kind of independent.

421
00:26:27.261 --> 00:26:28.940
So they petitioned congress and say,
fine.

422
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:33.020
Then we are now the independent state of Franklin recognize us as a new state

423
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.250
and they began drafting their own constitution I think in 1785,

424
00:26:37.251 --> 00:26:39.650
like learn independent state and now we're going to have a new republican

425
00:26:39.651 --> 00:26:41.980
constitution,
um,

426
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:46.590
some Western territories of Virginia disgust joining the state of Franklin.

427
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.130
There was some discussion of the Cherokee being accepted into the state of

428
00:26:50.131 --> 00:26:50.731
Franklin.
Okay.

429
00:26:50.731 --> 00:26:54.000
So we have a little brewing new state happening here near North Carolina.

430
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:59.330
The problem is North Carolina took back their session of Western lens that there

431
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:03.090
was a whole flurry of controversy about this issue and were other states giving

432
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:06.300
up their land?
Yes.
No,
we don't know.
So North Carolina said,
well forget it.

433
00:27:06.301 --> 00:27:08.970
Whatever.
We're not,
you're not getting the land.

434
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:14.100
This now left the people of the state of Franklin in a state of limbo and they

435
00:27:14.101 --> 00:27:17.160
petitioned to Congress and asked,
well,
please like give us statehood.

436
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.560
We don't know what's happening with all this land stuff,
but hey,

437
00:27:19.561 --> 00:27:21.600
we're here drafting a constitution,
give a statehood.

438
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:26.130
And ultimately Congress didn't really act concerning the state of Franklin and

439
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:30.330
it's North Carolina that ultimately dealt with the question and suppressed the

440
00:27:30.331 --> 00:27:34.560
problem.
There's a there when I was poking around,
um,

441
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.230
researching this this morning I found some book,

442
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.680
I think it's called something like the last state of Franklin.

443
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.320
It's like the lost city of Atlantis,

444
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.670
the law state to Franklin at this little tiny moment of almost existing and then

445
00:27:47.671 --> 00:27:50.040
poof,
it was put out okay.

446
00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:55.041
So faced by the seeming dismemberment of states based by at least discussion of

447
00:27:56.131 --> 00:27:59.610
a joining the British during the war,
Congress has not,

448
00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:02.040
we have not seen a lot of action here on the part of the congress.

449
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.890
Now in these cases,

450
00:28:04.891 --> 00:28:08.670
Congress just couldn't muster the interest or the energy to act on behalf of

451
00:28:08.671 --> 00:28:13.260
these individual states and other cane cases.
Congress actually did respond,

452
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.880
but it had no power to do anything other than observe and report and advise.

453
00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:18.930
So for example,

454
00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:22.110
during the early seventies and eighties there was a boundary dispute between

455
00:28:22.111 --> 00:28:26.850
Pennsylvania and New York and the Congress actually appointed a committee to

456
00:28:26.851 --> 00:28:28.140
investigate the issue.

457
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:32.010
And the committee actually reported a decision about where they thought the

458
00:28:32.011 --> 00:28:34.950
boundaries should fall.
So there is a case in which congress acts and says,
okay,

459
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:39.300
this is where the boundary should be.
End of controversy,
you would think,

460
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:41.100
but of course,
no,

461
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.760
because in 1784 despite the fact that Congress had supposedly decided the issue,

462
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.060
Pennsylvania sent someone to New York to investigate the issue,

463
00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:55.080
and this is the letter of introduction sent to introduce this Pennsylvania and

464
00:28:55.081 --> 00:28:57.540
agent to New York's governor quote.

465
00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:03.080
It becomes our duty to be prepared in the best manner we can for opposing

466
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:07.650
attempts that threatened the honor,
the piece and the welfare of Pennsylvania.

467
00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:09.690
Okay.
Is this like a vaguely threatening letter?

468
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.940
So Congress has done what it thinks it's supposed to do,

469
00:29:11.941 --> 00:29:14.520
but it has no power to enforce it.
It's just said,
yeah,

470
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:17.910
we think the boundaries here and Pennsylvania basically says,

471
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.530
we don't really care.

472
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.950
We're going to go to New York and fight it out with them and figure out where

473
00:29:22.951 --> 00:29:27.720
the boundary is.
So here it's almost as though Congress has not acted.

474
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.730
Their ruling is almost irrelevant here.

475
00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.950
So clearly we're seeing some of the problems inherent in Congress just not being

476
00:29:34.951 --> 00:29:36.930
able to enforce decisions

477
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.800
with no central control of finance,

478
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.680
no effective way for Congress to overcome state rivalries,

479
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.490
interstate commerce,
all these things are sort of brewing up.

480
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:53.960
Logically interstate commerce between states becomes a big issue in the 1780

481
00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.780
eighties I'm not going to go into it in great detail here,

482
00:29:55.781 --> 00:30:00.781
but we will be seeing soon that ultimately it's problems of interstate trade and

483
00:30:01.391 --> 00:30:06.160
complications between dozens of separate sort of system set up between different

484
00:30:06.161 --> 00:30:07.210
states to trade.

485
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:12.750
That ultimately really helps lead to what becomes the constitutional convention.

486
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.000
Again,
things that are sort of,
you can,

487
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.650
you can harken right back to the revolution.

488
00:30:17.651 --> 00:30:21.340
People are worried about shipping and control of shipping,
customs duties,

489
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.780
control of trade and makes sense that states would be feeling sensitive about

490
00:30:25.781 --> 00:30:29.950
surrendering any control for those sorts of things to some kind of a centralized

491
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.420
power.
So again,

492
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:34.840
logically enough that's going to continue to be an issue and ultimately becomes

493
00:30:34.841 --> 00:30:38.920
a big enough issue that it leads to a series of steps that gets us to the

494
00:30:38.921 --> 00:30:41.740
constitutional convention.
Okay.

495
00:30:41.741 --> 00:30:46.630
So we've seen so far a little cluster of different kinds of problems affiliated

496
00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:48.370
with the articles of confederation.

497
00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:52.870
Many of these came into play in what was essentially for many at the time at

498
00:30:52.871 --> 00:30:57.190
least a low point for the Confederation Congress that took place in September of

499
00:30:57.191 --> 00:30:59.830
1786 and that's Shay's rebellion.

500
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:05.610
It's a controversy that ended up being a great PR tool for extreme nationalists

501
00:31:05.711 --> 00:31:08.860
who really wanted to reform the articles of confederation.

502
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:15.180
In September of 1786 farmers in Massachusets began to protest about the fact

503
00:31:16.511 --> 00:31:20.320
that their property was being seized because they were unable to pay off their

504
00:31:20.321 --> 00:31:24.730
debts and were unable to pay state taxes.
And at first,

505
00:31:24.731 --> 00:31:28.360
many of these Massachusetts farmers protested in kind of a traditional way,

506
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:33.450
and we've seen these ways before they wrote petitions then when they didn't feel

507
00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:34.840
like their petitions were being listened to,

508
00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:38.980
they stage sort of ritualistic demonstrations when these didn't work,

509
00:31:38.981 --> 00:31:43.240
that however the farmers began to murmur that their petitions were not being

510
00:31:43.241 --> 00:31:45.340
respected by their government,

511
00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.060
that they were being forced against their will to pay unfair taxes.

512
00:31:49.061 --> 00:31:50.290
Sound familiar,
right?

513
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.160
These are revolution era complaints that are coming back and just happens to be

514
00:31:54.161 --> 00:31:58.540
against the government of Massachusetts.
So here you see people in Massachusetts,

515
00:31:58.541 --> 00:32:01.540
these farmers are making a pretty strong statement about how they think

516
00:32:01.541 --> 00:32:05.950
government should work and about the importance of popular sovereignty.

517
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.270
So feeling that they're being repressed and disrespected their liberties under

518
00:32:10.271 --> 00:32:14.140
attack their property under attack,
their political voice being ignored,

519
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:17.380
these farmers began to take more drastic action.

520
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:22.660
Now a large number of these protestors were led by a revolutionary war officer

521
00:32:22.661 --> 00:32:27.661
named Daniel Shays and Daniel Shays actually was followed by roughly 1100 debt

522
00:32:28.631 --> 00:32:33.631
ridden farmers chaise and his followers criticized their creditors and merchants

523
00:32:34.571 --> 00:32:38.800
in general as a rising aristocracy bent on depriving them of their liberties.

524
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.440
They marched on the courts of Massachusetts and ultimately closed them demanding

525
00:32:45.471 --> 00:32:50.471
that the state legislature respond to their demands in response to these actions

526
00:32:52.231 --> 00:32:55.370
of the these,
these upset farmers closing down to the courts.

527
00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:00.500
The Confederation Congress called out 800 Massachusetts militia men to suppress

528
00:33:00.501 --> 00:33:01.334
the revolt.

529
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.570
The problem is the militia refused to act cause they sympathized with the

530
00:33:05.571 --> 00:33:09.080
farmers.
Okay,
bad plan didn't work.

531
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:14.530
So now the local militia is entirely disregarding a request for national defense

532
00:33:14.631 --> 00:33:16.700
from what's acting as the national government at the time.

533
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.710
Congress next responded by requesting roughly half a million dollars from the

534
00:33:21.711 --> 00:33:26.711
states to raise a special special force of men to crush the rebellion.

535
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.360
And only Virginia responded little Virginia.
Okay,

536
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.100
we'll contribute a little bit of money.
No one else responded.
Okay.

537
00:33:37.101 --> 00:33:42.020
Congress could not even raise money to suppress and internal rebellion.

538
00:33:42.021 --> 00:33:46.550
So New England is moving into becoming up in arms and congress is trying twice

539
00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:50.300
now to do something and can't.
In the end,

540
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:55.040
a number of the established elite in Massachusetts lawyers,

541
00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.200
particularly merchants,
wealthy merchants,

542
00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.960
were forced to come up with their own solution.

543
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:04.490
So many of the wealthiest merchants in Massachusetts and some of these lawyers

544
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.640
raise their own money and created their own private army to suppress the

545
00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:12.920
rebellion of several thousand men.

546
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:17.240
So they funded their own army to suppress the rebellion.

547
00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:22.370
Now with the history of the revolution as hindsight,

548
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.210
what do you think would happen when these rebellious farmers feel that a hostile

549
00:34:26.211 --> 00:34:29.590
armies descending on them to steal their liberties and crush?
Right?

550
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.260
You're already laughing.
It's like,
yeah,
they're going to just fold and go home.

551
00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.213
No,

552
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.620
they became more rebellious right now they're like staging gorilla raids against

553
00:34:39.621 --> 00:34:44.360
prominent merchants and office holders trying to overthrow what they saw as the

554
00:34:44.361 --> 00:34:48.410
oppressive government of the state and ultimately there were several battles

555
00:34:48.411 --> 00:34:51.800
between the private army and the Massachusetts farmers.

556
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:56.570
About 50 of the farmers were wounded or killed a few dozen of the private armed

557
00:34:56.571 --> 00:34:59.810
force men were wounded or killed as well,

558
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:05.230
and all of this trouble ended in roughly 1787 when an economic upturn made some

559
00:35:06.231 --> 00:35:08.330
of the farmers tents easier to pay,

560
00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.450
and many of the farmers began to see that surrounding states were not

561
00:35:11.451 --> 00:35:14.960
particularly thrilled with the idea of Massachusetts going up in arms.

562
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.940
So some of these farmers fled rather than face whatever they fear the

563
00:35:19.941 --> 00:35:22.970
consequences might be.
They went some of them to the north,

564
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:24.260
some of them to the west.

565
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:28.760
This is my favorite random factoid about Shay's rebellion guests were Daniel

566
00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.170
Shays.
When he fled Massachusetts,
he went to the independent republic of Vermont.

567
00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.010
It's like if I were writing the story,

568
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.160
I would have made him go to the independent republic of Vermont.
Okay.

569
00:35:41.161 --> 00:35:44.490
So Shay's rebellion shook a lot of people,

570
00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:49.170
but it was really upsetting to people who had doubts about the powers of the

571
00:35:49.171 --> 00:35:53.580
confederation government because it seemed to throw a really harsh light on the

572
00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:57.390
congress and how defenseless it was to maintain order.

573
00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:02.520
And this was not the only uprising or the only potential uprising even in this

574
00:36:02.521 --> 00:36:07.050
period that that particularly these nationalist found so upsetting,
upsetting.

575
00:36:07.051 --> 00:36:11.220
I'm going to mention only two here that potential military uprisings.

576
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:12.211
And in this case,

577
00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:15.600
both of these took place as the continental army was beginning to disband.

578
00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:20.040
One of them ends up becoming known as the Newburgh conspiracy because it takes

579
00:36:20.041 --> 00:36:21.240
place in Newburgh,
New York.

580
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:26.550
And the Newburgh conspiracy consisted of a group of disgruntled army officers

581
00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:30.210
who got tired of waiting for Congress to grant them their pensions because of

582
00:36:30.211 --> 00:36:32.490
course,
Congress has no way to grab them,
their pensions.

583
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:38.090
So in 1783 they formed a plan that they would refuse to disband as an army

584
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.920
unless they were granted their pensions.

585
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:45.750
So there's the vague threat of a COO basically from this group of officers in

586
00:36:45.751 --> 00:36:47.000
Newburgh.
Like,
we're,

587
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:50.430
we're going to stay here and we're going to remain a little army unless you give

588
00:36:50.431 --> 00:36:54.480
us our pensions.
And if you don't,
then we'll see what happens.
Okay?

589
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:59.310
What ultimately stopped this?
Again,
not the congress.
George Washington,

590
00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:00.720
a little George Washington moment.

591
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.480
George Washington personally stopped the Newburgh conspiracy,

592
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.630
and this shows you the real power of George Washington.
He goes to Newburgh.

593
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:09.510
It's like,
oh boy,
I got to go deal with the officers at Newburg.

594
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:10.344
This is looking ugly.

595
00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:14.730
He goes in person and he stands up to address the assembled officers who are

596
00:37:14.731 --> 00:37:19.710
getting ready to potentially stage a coup and he's trying to plead with them,

597
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:24.510
please,
you know,
don't do this.
This is not in this for the good of the country.

598
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:27.090
But before he even really has a chance to argue anything,

599
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.050
he reaches in his pocket to get out his glasses so that he can read something

600
00:37:31.051 --> 00:37:34.140
that he's written and he says as as he is great.

601
00:37:34.141 --> 00:37:37.020
The another example of great sort of theater on the part of George Washington.

602
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:40.650
He takes the glasses out and as he puts them on,
he says,
excuse me gentlemen,

603
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:44.490
but I've grown not only gray but blind in the service of my country.

604
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:49.530
And the officers start to cry.
Oh,

605
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:54.480
we're sorry.
And of Newburgh conspiracy.

606
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.040
It's just the magic of George Washington's glasses.
That was it,

607
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:02.220
man knew how to like stage a moment.
Okay?

608
00:38:02.221 --> 00:38:04.500
So that does actually full the Newburgh conspiracy.

609
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:10.010
There's another sort of mini semi revolt that takes place in 1783 involving

610
00:38:10.831 --> 00:38:13.860
Pennsylvania soldiers,
Congress disbands,

611
00:38:13.861 --> 00:38:18.270
this particular group of Pennsylvania soldiers in 1783 and sends them home with

612
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.300
no payment of any kind.
You know,
sorry,
we can't pay you right now.

613
00:38:21.301 --> 00:38:24.810
We'll get back to you.
Okay.
This does not thrill these particular soldiers.

614
00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.150
They hear that they've been dismissed from the army.

615
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:29.610
They hear that nothing's gonna get done about their pay.

616
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:34.820
A few hundred of them marched to Philadelphia and barricaded members of the

617
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:36.520
Confederation Congress in the State House,

618
00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:40.450
sticking their band nets through the windows and making threatening gestures

619
00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:43.390
like pay us now.
Okay,

620
00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.610
so this was not thrilling to the Confederation Congress.

621
00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.540
That was kind of a standoff where there's armed guys with bayonets surrounding

622
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:52.840
the State House and Confederation Congressman in the State House not knowing

623
00:38:52.841 --> 00:38:56.020
what to do.
This sort of sputters to a close.

624
00:38:56.021 --> 00:39:01.021
When several congressmen walked outside and just left and no one did anything to

625
00:39:01.601 --> 00:39:05.350
them,
they were just like,
bye and I wouldn't realize,
okay,

626
00:39:05.351 --> 00:39:06.850
these guys actually really don't want to hurt us.

627
00:39:06.851 --> 00:39:11.851
They're just making a point and of semi Ku slash rebellion in Pennsylvania.

628
00:39:12.521 --> 00:39:13.150
However,

629
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:16.660
Congress was so thrown by this that they decided Princeton might be a better

630
00:39:16.661 --> 00:39:19.660
place to meet from then on,
and so they temporarily moved to Princeton,

631
00:39:19.661 --> 00:39:23.080
New Jersey rather than stay in Philadelphia because Philadelphia had just become

632
00:39:23.081 --> 00:39:26.350
scary.
It's worth mentioning,

633
00:39:26.351 --> 00:39:31.000
I should actually mentioned that both of these events really strongly reinforced

634
00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:34.390
the prevailing wig distressed of standing armies,
right?

635
00:39:34.391 --> 00:39:37.330
Look at what happens when you have a standing army sitting around.

636
00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.800
They can't help themselves.

637
00:39:38.801 --> 00:39:40.420
They're always threatening to overturn the government.

638
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:44.920
So this reinforces fears of standing armies for certain,
for a while to come.

639
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:49.930
But certainly all of these incidents are really fueling the fears and the

640
00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:54.931
anxieties and the concerns of these extreme nationalists who already are feeling

641
00:39:55.721 --> 00:39:58.630
that this articles of confederation or not strong enough,

642
00:39:58.631 --> 00:40:03.631
and now look what's happening as the 1780s are unfolding as housing or Hamilton

643
00:40:04.271 --> 00:40:06.970
would write in the federalist number 21 and again,

644
00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:09.730
he's writing in the federalist,
which means he really wants to make a point.

645
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:15.100
He wrote who can determine what might've been the issue of Massachusetts

646
00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:19.510
convulsions if the malcontents had been headed by a Caesar or chrom?
Well,

647
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:24.700
who can predict what effect a despotism established in Massachusetts would have

648
00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:30.040
upon the liberties of New Hampshire or Rhode Island of Connecticut or in New

649
00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:30.820
York?

650
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:35.820
The problem demand like Hamilton and other really strong nationalists was that

651
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.930
Americans seem to be so focused on their individual interests,
on their states,

652
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:41.950
on their homes,

653
00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:46.690
that they had seemingly forgotten how to think about themselves as Americans,

654
00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:48.340
as a United people.

655
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:53.470
This concept would be at the core of the debate over the constitution,

656
00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.240
what it be possible.

657
00:40:55.630 --> 00:41:00.630
If somehow the states could agree that it was necessary to strengthen their

658
00:41:00.701 --> 00:41:05.260
central government to devise some kind of government that would actually be

659
00:41:05.261 --> 00:41:07.870
acceptable to all 13 states.

660
00:41:07.871 --> 00:41:10.270
Were there enough common bonds?

661
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:14.080
Could Americans only be defined when pitted against enemies?

662
00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.550
Was there no American identity in and of itself and wasn't enough to really hold

663
00:41:18.551 --> 00:41:23.551
people together in some kind of unified government and during the battle to

664
00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:28.660
ratify the constitution?
In 1788 Hamilton stated just that very fact.

665
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.570
He said the real question was about who and what.

666
00:41:31.571 --> 00:41:35.570
We're Americans speaking to the New York ratifying convention.

667
00:41:35.571 --> 00:41:38.150
He said it has been asserted that the interests,

668
00:41:38.151 --> 00:41:42.140
habits and manners of the 13 states are different and hence it is too.

669
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:45.650
It is inferred that no general free government can suit them.

670
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:50.060
This diversity of habits has been a favorite theme with those who are disposed

671
00:41:50.061 --> 00:41:54.380
for a division of our empire and like many other popular objections seems to be

672
00:41:54.381 --> 00:41:55.640
founded on fallacy.

673
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:58.760
I acknowledged that the local interest of this Tate's are in some degree,

674
00:41:58.761 --> 00:42:00.800
various.
Yeah,
thanks.
I guess so.

675
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:04.460
And that there is some difference in the manners and habits,
but this,

676
00:42:04.461 --> 00:42:07.940
I will presume to affirm that from New Hampshire to Georgia,

677
00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:12.110
the people of America are as uniform in their interest in manners as those of

678
00:42:12.111 --> 00:42:14.300
any country established in Europe.

679
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.680
So basically Hamilton's arguing we are a common people.

680
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.140
When you compare us with Europe,

681
00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:25.820
look at all of the similarities between us and we need a common government to

682
00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:28.250
join us and American government.

683
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:33.440
This is really the theme of the nationalists who took the lead in moving the

684
00:42:33.441 --> 00:42:38.120
nation towards the constitutional convention.
Now,
before I conclude this lecture,

685
00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:39.780
I do want to mention one thing.
Um,

686
00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:42.290
I was going to mention it a little earlier when I was talking about Shay's

687
00:42:42.291 --> 00:42:44.000
rebellion,
um,
and forgot,

688
00:42:44.001 --> 00:42:47.030
but I can't resist adding it in only because it's another little Yale moment and

689
00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:50.240
I'm always looking for Yale moments in the revolution.
And this is another one.

690
00:42:50.241 --> 00:42:52.880
It's just a random little thing that I found,
but I thought it was interesting.

691
00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:53.840
Um,

692
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.080
it makes me realize that to be the president of Yale during the revolution was

693
00:42:57.081 --> 00:42:59.350
no fun.
Right?
I think as her,

694
00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:02.710
like this is just couldn't have been fun for Ezra styles.
Um,

695
00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.890
this is actually from 17 early in 1787 and what it,

696
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.670
what I found was a letter from styles to George Washington and what the letter

697
00:43:10.671 --> 00:43:14.660
says is one of my,
actually two of my students are one of my students,

698
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:16.130
two of my students.
Okay.

699
00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:21.340
Two of my students just arrived here from Massachusetts and they were caught by

700
00:43:21.351 --> 00:43:24.950
Shays rebels who kept them there for a while.

701
00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:29.780
But the students spied and they like saw how many men they were basically these

702
00:43:29.781 --> 00:43:33.800
two Yale students are on their way from Massachusetts here and they get caught

703
00:43:33.801 --> 00:43:34.760
by Shays rebels.

704
00:43:34.761 --> 00:43:38.000
And while they're there they try and like scope things out and then they come

705
00:43:38.001 --> 00:43:41.120
back and they report to styles.
Like okay,
there's roughly 2,500 men.

706
00:43:41.121 --> 00:43:45.140
Like they become like little war strategists and styles rights to George

707
00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:48.230
Washington and says,
okay,
let me give you the update on the Shays rebels.

708
00:43:48.231 --> 00:43:51.950
And he has this whole letter with like numbers and like he draws a little map,

709
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.480
you know,
here's where I think they are.
You know,

710
00:43:53.481 --> 00:43:56.180
all from these Yale students who got captured by Shays rebels.

711
00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.400
I love that letter because I mean,

712
00:43:58.401 --> 00:44:01.580
Shay's rebellion is not something that everyone knows about Shay's rebellion,

713
00:44:01.581 --> 00:44:05.770
but the Yale connection with Shay's rebellion like that,
that was news to me.
Um,

714
00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:07.000
and the fact that this,

715
00:44:07.001 --> 00:44:11.690
this particular one guy who student who estimates how many troops were there,

716
00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:16.310
um,
styles calls him a young gentleman of solidity and good information.

717
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:19.680
He's the guy who I guess did counting and estimating.
Um,

718
00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:22.880
so there are Yale students informing George Washington about the nature of

719
00:44:22.881 --> 00:44:26.710
Shay's rebellion and how many men were involved.
Um,

720
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:30.680
the last thing that I'll mention before we run out of time here,
um,
again,

721
00:44:30.681 --> 00:44:32.220
was another random document that I found,

722
00:44:32.221 --> 00:44:37.200
but I thought it was interesting because I think we tend to think of the shays

723
00:44:37.201 --> 00:44:39.590
rebels as like crazy farmers with pitchforks.
You know,

724
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:43.500
I hate taxes and the fact is,
I mean,

725
00:44:43.501 --> 00:44:46.410
these actually were people with principles and ideas.

726
00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.920
They happen to be protesting,
but they weren't crazy people with pitchforks.

727
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:53.790
And what I found was one of the generals,
you know,

728
00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:56.820
one of the people sort of leading the rebels,
um,

729
00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:00.990
wrote a statement to Massachusetts,
um,

730
00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:05.490
basically asking them to eliminate the private army.

731
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.430
But I wanted to read it to you because it gives you a sense of some of the

732
00:45:08.431 --> 00:45:13.431
rationale and the feelings behind some of these Shays rebels and stated January

733
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:17.970
25th,
17,
87,
headquarters west Springfield,
again,

734
00:45:17.971 --> 00:45:20.310
really gives you a sense of how the rebels envisioned themselves,

735
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:23.760
the body of the people assembled in arms,

736
00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:27.580
which is they themselves adhering to the first principles of natural self

737
00:45:27.581 --> 00:45:32.160
preservation do in the most peremptory mannered demand that the troops in

738
00:45:32.161 --> 00:45:33.810
Springfield lay down their arms,

739
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.950
that their arms be deposited in the public stores under the care of the proper

740
00:45:37.951 --> 00:45:41.580
officers to be returned to the owners at the termination of the present contests

741
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:46.710
that the troops returned to their homes upon parole.
Signed Luke Day,
captain,

742
00:45:46.711 --> 00:45:50.350
come in,
don't have this division.
Okay,
that's by one of the rebel.

743
00:45:50.351 --> 00:45:54.420
So I read that only because it kind of gets us past the crazy farmer guys with

744
00:45:54.421 --> 00:45:58.650
pitchfork image that these were people really who had,
um,
a sense of principle.

745
00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.170
And again,
a principal,
you can just hear in the language that I read,

746
00:46:01.171 --> 00:46:06.171
they're inspired and driven by the revolution that they had just been through in

747
00:46:06.181 --> 00:46:08.460
their mind.
It's all part of the same fight.

748
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:11.040
But you can hear just in that language,

749
00:46:11.041 --> 00:46:14.430
if people are associating what's happening in the 1780 eighties to what happened

750
00:46:14.431 --> 00:46:17.910
in the revolution,
and if the revolution is the story of government overturned,

751
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:18.691
again,

752
00:46:18.691 --> 00:46:23.400
you can see why these nationalists would have been so disconcerted and so upset

753
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.040
by what they saw unfolding in the 1780s.
Right?

754
00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:30.300
That already seen a pretty major government get overturned with this kind of

755
00:46:30.301 --> 00:46:32.130
action during the revolution.

756
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:35.580
Now we've instituted this government and we see some of the same kind of

757
00:46:35.581 --> 00:46:37.080
behavior happening again.

758
00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:41.580
So what we're going to hear in the next couple of lectures is people discussing

759
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:45.450
what needs to happen.
Not everybody thinks that this is the sign of a horrible,

760
00:46:45.451 --> 00:46:46.830
horrendous crisis.
But boy,

761
00:46:46.831 --> 00:46:50.250
the people who really felt that the articles was a problematic government were

762
00:46:50.251 --> 00:46:51.061
very loud,

763
00:46:51.061 --> 00:46:55.470
and over time they become very United in thinking that there's a serious problem

764
00:46:55.770 --> 00:47:00.120
about the center of government in the new nation.
I will stop there.

765
00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:03.810
I will see you on Tuesday.
Have a good weekend.
