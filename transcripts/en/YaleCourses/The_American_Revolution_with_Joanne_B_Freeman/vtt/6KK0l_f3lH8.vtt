00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.150
Last week,

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.470
we ended with the Boston massacre in 1770 and I mentioned at the very end of the

3
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:13.584
lecture,

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.770
the ways in which both onlookers and the British government and the colonists

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.650
ended up wondering each one if the other one was somehow engaged in a plot.

6
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.611
Right.

7
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:29.760
And I mentioned that the British were perhaps wondering if this had all been a

8
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.590
plot to rob the customs house.

9
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.250
The colonists were wondering about the possibility of this being some kind of

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.330
ongoing plot to subdue and repress the American colonists.

11
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.570
So clearly at the end of the lecture from last week,

12
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:46.740
you can really begin to sense a growing sense of mounting hostility,

13
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.280
even among some people,
a sense of growing alienation.

14
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.180
And you can hear this on both sides coming from the accounts of the Boston

15
00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:59.070
massacre by both gauge and Adams.

16
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:02.620
And I read from them last week.
Um,

17
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.870
and I did mention in class when I read from them that they were of course

18
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:08.160
writing with a purpose in mind.

19
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.090
So they were interested in being particularly bold and dramatic and what they

20
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:14.700
were saying gauge really had to excuse what happened in Adams,

21
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:19.030
was trying to promote people to get upset about what had happened.
Um,

22
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.640
but even so you can hear even just in the way that they framed their accounts,

23
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.780
some of what I'm talking about here with growing hostility,
growing alienation.

24
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.860
So for example,

25
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:33.861
gauge at the very start of the letter that I read from in the last lecture tells

26
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:39.210
the person he's writing to that he's writing this letter to inform the king's

27
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:44.211
ministry quote of the critical situation of the troops and the hatred of the

28
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:48.810
people towards them.
That's how he starts his letter,
which is really interesting.

29
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.020
So to gauge clearly what he's stating in this letter to his people back home in

30
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:57.480
the king's ministry is that it doesn't really even feel safe for British

31
00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:00.570
soldiers on the streets of Boston.
The people here hate us.

32
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.380
And Adams also emphasizes this kind of growing alienation and animosity.

33
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:07.560
And in his case,

34
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.240
he does it in a particularly strong way in a series of newspaper articles for

35
00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:16.980
the Boston Gazette that he wrote a few months after the massacre.

36
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.960
So Adams writes,

37
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.710
I appealed to the common sense of mankind to what a state of misery and infamy

38
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.900
must have people be reduced to have a governor by the soul appointment of the

39
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:35.901
crown under the absolute control of a week and arbitrary minister to who's

40
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:40.971
dictates he has to yield an unlimited obedience or forfeit his political career

41
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.480
while he used to be supported at the expense of the people by virtue of an

42
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:50.310
authority claimed by strangers.
And that's really an interesting statement.

43
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:53.580
Strangers,
he's referring to parliament,
right?

44
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.720
It's these strangers who are telling these officials what to do.
That's again,

45
00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:01.480
a striking word,
a striking statement.
Now of course here,

46
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.600
Adam says that really striking thing and then he's careful to add right after it

47
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.750
that quote,
um,
for opposing a threatened tyranny,

48
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.120
we have been not only called,

49
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.010
but in effect a judged rebels and traders to the best of kings.

50
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.570
Okay?
He's making a really important distinction there.
He's saying,
yes,

51
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:24.730
maybe we're upset at what parliament is doing.

52
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.880
Maybe parliament is behaving like a group of strangers,

53
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.620
but we are still good British subjects and we are loyal to our king to the best

54
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:33.454
of kings.

55
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.900
And it's an important point that even in the midst of all of this animosity and

56
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:42.850
all of these misunderstandings troops are in Boston streets and the colonists

57
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.150
obviously still feel like British subjects who are loyal to their king and who

58
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:51.880
are objecting because their rights as British subjects are being violated.

59
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.120
That's the logic that we're working on here and you can see this in Adams Samuel

60
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:58.743
Adams actions.

61
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.200
At the same time that he's writing all these sort of propaganda newspaper

62
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:04.810
accounts and trying to stir up animosity.

63
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.990
He also was writing letters to people in England trying to persuade them and

64
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:14.920
hopefully inspire them to persuade others that the people of Boston were

65
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:19.720
rightfully defending their liberties and deserve to be defended by people in

66
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:22.960
parliament,
not condemned and punished.

67
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.710
Equally important,
the colonists,

68
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.010
we're not saying that they wanted nothing to do with parliament or even that

69
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:35.800
parliament had no authority over the colonies.

70
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.980
Even though the occasional bold statements sort of runs out on an edge and says,

71
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.900
uh,
parliament,

72
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.260
most colonists thought that the colonists,

73
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:47.800
the colonies were subordinate to parliament in some way.

74
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.550
The problem Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson,

75
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:53.710
later remarked is that subordination,

76
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:57.550
quote was a word without any precise meaning to it.
Okay,

77
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.930
that's a really insightful comment.
Yeah.
Okay.
Colonies or subordinate.

78
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.150
But what does that mean?

79
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.890
And obviously what we're looking at now is a sort of non debate debate in which

80
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:12.370
it's clear people have different understandings of exactly what the imperial

81
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:16.840
system is supposed to look like and how it functions.
So all in all,

82
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:21.730
it's important to remember here that even with all of this friction that we're

83
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:23.680
seeing between colonists and the British,

84
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.330
the colonists are still loyal British subjects who want the imperial system to

85
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:30.280
function happily again.

86
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.270
And this is a really great example of why it's always important.

87
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.600
And I think it's particularly important when studying anything in the founding

88
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:39.220
era,
but I think history generally,

89
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.710
but when studying the revolution or the founding era,

90
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:42.880
but it was setting the revolution,

91
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.650
it's important not to jump onto the independence bandwagon too quickly and

92
00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:52.651
assume that a separation is inevitable because the people that were studying did

93
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:58.100
not assume that it's so easy for us to assume that cause we know what's coming.

94
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.270
But remember Freeman's top tips for studying the revolution,
right?
Contingency.

95
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.020
Our historical subjects didn't know what was going to happen and anything could

96
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.620
have happened.
So from our perspective,
we're looking at the events here.

97
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:15.830
We almost can't help it,
I think on all of our parts.
Even on my part,

98
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.600
it all looks like a ticking clock.

99
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.330
Like there's an inevitable pulling away from the British.

100
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.860
And everything I talk about here represents one step closer to independence and

101
00:06:23.861 --> 00:06:25.580
another step closer to independence.

102
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.260
And part of what I'm trying to say here is clearly that's not how the colonists

103
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.390
or the British at this point are thinking.

104
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.460
That's not how they understand their actions.

105
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.350
That's not how they understand what's happening.

106
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.620
The colonists at this point are not trying to rebel,

107
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.130
and they're not trying to retreat away from the British empire.

108
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.580
They're trying to fix things or trying to figure out how to fix things.

109
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.010
So in a sense,

110
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.700
the best way to understand the events of the first half of the 17th seventies is

111
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:59.790
to look at the whole revolutionary era without thinking about the revolution.

112
00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:03.860
And by that I mean the war,
just forget that there's going to be a war.

113
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.320
The war doesn't exist.
I always,
as a historian,

114
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:09.140
I do this to myself when I'm sitting down to write something,

115
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:10.190
like if I'm writing a project,

116
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.190
I'm working on a book now that takes me up to the civil war.

117
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.040
So I have to constantly say civil war,

118
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.870
I don't know if there's a civil war that's at war because my subjects aren't

119
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:23.180
assuming until the very late point that there might be one.

120
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.430
And I'm sort of saying the same thing here,

121
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.960
that it's useful to just sort of put the assumption that there's going to be a

122
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:34.500
war over here and watch the logic of events as they unfold.
It's,

123
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.390
it's a good reminder,

124
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:38.960
I think for the study of history generally because part of what you're trying to

125
00:07:38.961 --> 00:07:43.961
do as historians is understand what your historical subjects are thinking and

126
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:45.920
why they're thinking that way.

127
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.360
And you make that much harder when you stick the outcome right in front of them

128
00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:54.770
and compare what they're doing with what you assume to be an inevitable outcome.

129
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.620
Okay.
Now,

130
00:07:57.621 --> 00:08:02.621
I mentioned last time that one way in which the colonists responded to the towns

131
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:07.250
and acts was to propose boycotting British goods again,

132
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:12.410
as they had before in their minds successfully with the stamp act.

133
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.980
So now feeling even more threatened,

134
00:08:15.981 --> 00:08:20.210
the colonist didn't simply urge a boycott in an informal way.

135
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.550
Now they actually organize.

136
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.090
So remember there's a pattern I pointed out in an earlier lecture,
um,

137
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.790
when I was talking about previous attempts that colonial union and I mentioned

138
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:35.540
in that lecture that one of the main things that really drives the colonies to

139
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:38.570
join together in an effort is some kind of a threat.

140
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.210
So basically self defense is a really good motivator.

141
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.340
And so typically in the past,

142
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:46.700
something with threatened the colonies intercolonial unity suddenly seemed

143
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:47.480
important.

144
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.810
There'd be some kind of a movement to do something together for the moment.

145
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.290
And then when the crisis passed the unity past as well.

146
00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.260
So we're sort of seeing some of that going into operation here way down the

147
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:02.910
road,
four Americans,

148
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.970
one of the big lessons of the revolution would ultimately be how powerful it is

149
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:12.890
when you combine and organize an associate when you form associations or

150
00:09:12.891 --> 00:09:13.740
organizations.

151
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.980
And as we'll begin to see soon when people organize into small coordinated

152
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:21.960
groups,
they can have an enormous impact.

153
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.440
And that's essentially what happens here in the course of the American

154
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:26.274
revolution.

155
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.780
So between 1768 and 1770 as they begin to contemplate boycotting British goods,

156
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:36.684
yet again,

157
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.760
people begin to form non importation associations.
Okay.

158
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:46.680
Non Importation Associations.
Now these associations,

159
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:47.830
these organizations,

160
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.860
in a sense we're extra constitutional so they're springing up from outside of

161
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.520
the formal political system,
but in a variety of different ways.

162
00:09:56.521 --> 00:10:01.521
They actually had some real power in the north merchants were at the core of

163
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:05.910
this movement,
this non Importation Association movement,

164
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.280
although it was grounded on popular support,

165
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:12.330
but merchants were really at the center of it because one key to the success of

166
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:16.260
this whole endeavor was for merchants to join together in promising not to

167
00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:17.790
import British goods.

168
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.590
And sometimes merchants actually signed written agreements that they would not

169
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:24.240
import British goods.

170
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.250
So unity among the merchants could be a powerful thing and in the north that

171
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:32.550
operated pretty effectively.
So for example,
when,

172
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:38.030
I swear I'm really not like inserting Rhode Island into every moment in which a

173
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.610
random bad thing happens.
Today we have like two,
at least two.

174
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.550
We have several Rhode Island woman's and every time I come across one I think is

175
00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:45.384
it just cause I'm,

176
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.790
I'm aware of Rhode Island is because I'm thinking about Rhode Island.

177
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.650
Rhode Island appears to be there so much that it makes me think of,
um,

178
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:58.310
I got my undergraduate degree at Pomona College in California and Pomona has a

179
00:10:59.131 --> 00:11:02.760
thing about the number 47,
which they think appears everywhere,
right?

180
00:11:02.761 --> 00:11:04.710
Everything is 47.
So when you go to Pomona,

181
00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:07.820
it's like the magic of 47 constantly being talked about.

182
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.720
You add letters up to various things and had always equals Ooh,

183
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:15.360
47 and then people graduated from Pomona and go on to become film writers.

184
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:18.180
And then you'll see these 40 sevens,
like everyone's like,

185
00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:21.950
there's another one in star wars,
it's a 47.
Um,
so,

186
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.720
so 47 was like the Pomona thing.
And after a while you begin to think,
well,

187
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:27.390
if I'm looking for 40 sevens,
I'm always going to find 40 sevens.

188
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.340
So today I actually,
when I was writing this,

189
00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:32.430
I thought maybe I'm doing that to Rhode Island and I hope not.

190
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.600
But here's the Rhode Island moment.
Okay.
What's an actual Rhode Island moment?
Um,

191
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.290
some Rhode Island merchants threatened to pull out of the non importation

192
00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:43.800
agreement because it's proving to be troublesome in a variety of ways.

193
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:49.310
So when these Rhode Island merchants threatened this merchants in Boston and New

194
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:54.380
York and Philadelphia actually imposed a boycott on Newport and Providence,

195
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:57.550
Rhode Island,
right,
okay.
There's the power of association.
Oh,

196
00:11:57.551 --> 00:12:00.160
you couldn't think you're going to import British goods.
Okay,

197
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.980
we boycott you Rhode Island,
you're now going to be boycotted.

198
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.010
That's pretty powerful.

199
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:11.470
So merchants were key here as was the public.

200
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:17.110
So for example,
in various places in the north colonial legislature's,

201
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:22.350
sometimes passed resolutions commending these non importation associations to

202
00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:27.631
the people at the people are vital to so you have colonial legislature's passing

203
00:12:27.971 --> 00:12:32.560
resolutions to the public saying you know this whole association never hear as

204
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:33.940
good and you should really listen to it.

205
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:38.350
Basically lending legitimacy to what we're essentially really ad hoc

206
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:43.380
organization's ad hoc committees now in the south the non importation

207
00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:47.230
associations were more centered on the populace,

208
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.410
not quite as centered on merchants.

209
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:55.890
So southern non importation associations were often very careful to have members

210
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.760
sign on from throughout the community.

211
00:12:57.761 --> 00:13:00.670
So not just merchants but artisans and planters.

212
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.230
And because in the south they were more popularly based,

213
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.450
they were more centered on non consumption than on non importation.

214
00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:11.740
But of course you know you're looking at the north,

215
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:14.830
which is all about sea ports and importing goods.

216
00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:17.500
It makes sense that in the south maybe there'd be more of a focus on not

217
00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:22.060
consuming imported British goods.
The poster not importing British goods.

218
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:28.510
Now,
as suggested in the comments that I just made about northern legislatures

219
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.930
supporting northern not importation associations,

220
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.920
it's important to note that these are not rebellious groups acting against the

221
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:42.520
structure of colonial government.
They're not competing with colonial assemblies.

222
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.170
Their actually in some ways acting in harmony with them.
And as a matter of fact,

223
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.700
some people who were in these bond importation associations probably were in the

224
00:13:51.701 --> 00:13:55.120
colonial legislature is too.
So we're not talking about opposing efforts.

225
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.810
We're talking about sort of parallel efforts that sometimes intersect.

226
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:00.311
Okay.

227
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:05.311
So as organizations linking the will of the people with politicized action,

228
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.620
these associations are pretty significant because I'm sure you can see now,

229
00:14:11.621 --> 00:14:16.180
but just based on my description of them,
they're really promoting broad,
popular,

230
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.390
organized,
coordinated,
politicized action.

231
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:23.110
And this model is going to become more and more significant as the revolution

232
00:14:23.111 --> 00:14:23.944
continues on

233
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.180
and broadly based as they were.

234
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.600
These associations really did help to spread a sense of popular involvement in

235
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.970
resistance to British policy.

236
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:43.140
Boycotting British goods was a political act and everyone from all levels of

237
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:48.010
society,
including women,
could be involved in this in some way.

238
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:53.090
It's spreading a real sense of popular involvement in acts of resistance to

239
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:56.360
these seemingly unfair acts of parliament.
So average people,

240
00:14:56.361 --> 00:14:59.630
we're not just talking legislators and political radicals like Samuel Adams,

241
00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:04.400
but average people had a sense of involvement in a larger cause and newspaper

242
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:08.270
articles and broadsides helped spread this sense of involvement,

243
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:13.570
urging the colonists to avoid luxuries like imported silks or English rum.

244
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.170
And instead people should be virtuous and they should wear homespun clothing

245
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:22.430
made of cloth that could be made in the colonies and they should drink whiskey

246
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:25.970
and beer and cider that could be made in the colonies.

247
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.740
Now you'll notice things to drink,
include whiskey,
beer and cider,

248
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.540
but you'll notice water isn't included in that list.

249
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.500
Um,

250
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:41.390
and actually it wasn't considered a normal beverage at this point in time,

251
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:45.320
which I always thought was an interesting fact.
And when I was in Grad School,

252
00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:50.321
I read this really interesting British novel written in 1796 has a very strange

253
00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:55.040
title.
The title is herms sprung or man as he is not,

254
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.610
there are a lot of novels at the time called man as he is,
is not.
Um,

255
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.740
but what herms wrong,
it's about,

256
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:06.040
among other things is the central character is this American in England and he's

257
00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:10.730
the sort of exotic,
strange independent minded creature.

258
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.360
And two things that he does that are sort of shocking,

259
00:16:13.361 --> 00:16:18.290
lead bizarre to all of the British onlookers and this novel is he walks places

260
00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:20.810
instead of riding in a carriage.
Oh my gosh.

261
00:16:20.811 --> 00:16:23.900
She got up this morning from the tavern and went walking.

262
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.090
And then the second even more horrifying thing is he drinks water.

263
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.250
I drank water,
he had a normal dinner,
he drank water.

264
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.430
And there's a weird scene in it in which someone says,
you know,

265
00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:40.760
I can't even describe to you at water.
Tastes like,
why do you drink it?
I mean,

266
00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:44.570
water has no taste.
Water tastes like,
you know,
Herms Francaise water,

267
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.780
water tastes like water.
And it was kind of radical.

268
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:52.460
So I'm being very patriotic here.
Drink whiskey,
beer and cider period.

269
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.400
Don't worry about that boring water stuff.

270
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.630
It's fascinating that that's considered a weird thing at the time.
Okay.

271
00:16:59.631 --> 00:17:04.631
So people are encouraged to drink and wear only colonial made goods.

272
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.280
And this was true all over the place.
So as I symbolic gesture,

273
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Harvard students gave up drinking tea students at the College of New Jersey.

274
00:17:16.401 --> 00:17:20.880
Now Princeton were homespun clothing and students at Yale,

275
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.830
he says about Yale renounced imported wines.

276
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.270
I actually went and double check that.
I was like,
really?

277
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.110
Yeah,
Yale.
Okay.
Um,

278
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:43.450
South Carolina assemblymen renounced the wearing of wigs and stockings,

279
00:17:43.731 --> 00:17:46.460
which must've looked very odd with the result.

280
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.490
One observer noted that a foreign visitor arriving Charleston quote would

281
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:54.960
probably from their dress take them for so many unhappy person's ready for

282
00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:57.350
execution.
Who'd come to petition for,
pardon?

283
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.070
I have all these people with no wigs and know,

284
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:03.900
like kind of dressed really badly and like hanging out in the legislature.
Okay.

285
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.290
So clearly based on those examples,
even Yale Students,
um,

286
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.970
non portable than maybe I don't know what the,
not having imported wine,
um,

287
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.220
not importation does represent one way in which many people.

288
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.150
And as I said before,

289
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.410
including women became directly involved in colonial protest efforts,

290
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.950
but women were often the primary purchasers of goods.

291
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.640
So their actions were central on this front.

292
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.490
They had to be appealed through.
They had to be included.

293
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
So not importation politicize the daily activities of women as well as men

294
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:44.120
spreading feelings of community level patriotism with people joined in a joint

295
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.830
political effort to defend their rights.

296
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.500
So you have people who are sort of joined and this effort,

297
00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:51.120
it patriotic austerity.

298
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.110
They're all sort of joining and a willingness to sacrifice luxuries for a worthy

299
00:18:55.111 --> 00:18:57.750
cause.
And of course,
not every American,
not every communist is doing this.

300
00:18:57.751 --> 00:19:00.510
So when I say joined,
everyone's joined,
maybe not everyone,

301
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:05.520
but there are a lot of people who are paying attention to this idea of non

302
00:19:05.521 --> 00:19:06.354
importation.

303
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.970
But of course now that I've made not importation sounds so impressive.
Um,

304
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.790
I will add that it ultimately it was not a roaring success.
Um,

305
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.070
because as I just hinted a minute ago,

306
00:19:17.071 --> 00:19:21.030
not everyone really found it very easy to surrender English luxuries.

307
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.760
And as always,
there was a lot of smuggling,

308
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.690
so it wasn't an amazing roaring success.
But that said,

309
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:33.260
there was some impact on British manufacturers and there was some recognition

310
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:40.070
that considering the relatively small amount of revenue being raised by the

311
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:44.400
towns and acts,
maybe the effort wasn't worth all of the trouble.

312
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.140
So some onlookers in Britain began to regret the Townsend acts.

313
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.570
And it's important to note even members of parliament who were sympathetic to

314
00:19:54.571 --> 00:19:57.600
the colonies and who wanted the towns and acts repealed,

315
00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:02.670
even these sympathetic members didn't question the right of parliament to tax

316
00:20:02.671 --> 00:20:03.540
the colonies.

317
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:08.190
They may have felt that parliament was behaving too aggressively or unwisely.

318
00:20:08.191 --> 00:20:09.810
Maybe it's an unwise policy,

319
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.230
but even people who were considered themselves sort of supporters,

320
00:20:13.231 --> 00:20:16.890
real dire supporters of the American colonists even they were not questioning

321
00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:21.540
the constitutional supremacy of parliament to tax the British colonies.

322
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.950
That's almost like a line in the sand.
So along these lines,

323
00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:29.250
despite the fact that you have some people in parliament who were sympathetic

324
00:20:29.251 --> 00:20:30.180
towards the colonies,

325
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:35.310
parliament could not just back down and take all of the towns and acts back.

326
00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.680
And there are two main reasons for that.

327
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.540
There's such power when you say that there are two reasons and a hundred people

328
00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:47.400
go dunk satisfaction,
no taking.
Um,

329
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.430
but there are two main reasons.

330
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.860
First and most obvious parliament just didn't want to lose face,
right?

331
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:58.000
They felt that they truly were upholding the supremacy and sovereignty of the

332
00:20:58.001 --> 00:21:01.750
British parliament.
Second,
related to that,

333
00:21:01.751 --> 00:21:06.610
and perhaps more important as far as our understanding of different to evolving

334
00:21:06.611 --> 00:21:08.020
mindsets is concerned,

335
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.930
the sovereignty of parliament over the colonies by this point had become

336
00:21:13.931 --> 00:21:17.920
inextricably bound up with the right of taxing Americans.

337
00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:20.350
And I'll repeat that again.
By this point,

338
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:25.480
the sovereignty of parliament over the colonies had become inextricably bound up

339
00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:28.690
with the right of taxing American colonists.

340
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.300
So at this point,

341
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.860
parliament couldn't back down on a tax without seeming to give up their

342
00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:40.390
sovereignty over the colonies by 1770.

343
00:21:40.391 --> 00:21:45.391
The right of taxation was not just a means of producing revenue for the British,

344
00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:51.520
but it actually had become an assertion of British sovereignty over its own

345
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.490
colonies.
Okay,

346
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:59.350
so now we're in 1770 and surprise,
surprise.

347
00:21:59.351 --> 00:22:01.540
By this time we have a new prime minister.

348
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.170
Lord north is now Prime Minister Townsend is gone,

349
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:08.590
although sort of in a period of revolving doors of prime ministers.

350
00:22:08.591 --> 00:22:10.630
But in this case,
towns and tie downs,

351
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:13.900
it actually died back in 1767.

352
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.300
And so lord north is the next person who comes along.

353
00:22:16.301 --> 00:22:19.240
Townsend's acts live on without him for a little while.
Um,

354
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.430
but now lord north is the prime minister.

355
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:25.150
So he assumes this position and with familiar logic,

356
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.800
he decides that the only way to withdraw the towns and acts,

357
00:22:29.801 --> 00:22:34.801
it's going to be to leave behind a token tax in the colonies to prove that

358
00:22:36.101 --> 00:22:41.101
England reigned supreme over its colonial properties as Lord North himself.

359
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:43.654
Put it.

360
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.850
If I thought I could appease that factions and disobedient temper,

361
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:52.630
which prevails in the colonies,
I should be glad to do it.

362
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.530
And yet to these people who ought to be our subjects.

363
00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.850
We are to make concessions because they have the hardy hood to set us at

364
00:23:00.851 --> 00:23:03.250
defiance upon my word.

365
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:06.700
If we are to run after America in search of reconciliation in this way,

366
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:10.660
I do not know a single act of parliament that will remain,

367
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.730
but despite having settle that north concluded this speech by saying he wanted

368
00:23:15.731 --> 00:23:19.720
to be quote,
thought what I really am to the best of my conviction,

369
00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.620
a friend to trade a friend to America.
Okay.

370
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.600
Is that a lot of stuff bound up in that statement,

371
00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:30.340
but you can really see him processing through what's happening versus what he

372
00:23:30.341 --> 00:23:33.220
assumes about the workings of the imperial system.

373
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:38.440
It's a complicated situation to north and the British as well as to the
colonies.

374
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.370
So in the end,
thinking about all of this and thinking,
well,

375
00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.970
I need to leave some kind of tax in place to prove parliamentary supremacy.

376
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.510
He decides to leave the t techs in effect.

377
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:55.280
And the logic behind that is of all the tax items,

378
00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:01.090
this was the most profitable to England and it couldn't be manufactured in the

379
00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:04.250
colonies,
so we would have to be imported.

380
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.480
Plus it was kind of central to socializing and everybody drank tea.

381
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.670
That was the thing to do.

382
00:24:09.671 --> 00:24:13.580
It's to drink tea with great ceremony among some people to have tea cups and

383
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.060
teaspoons.
So north just assumed on a whole bunch of levels,

384
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:18.800
can't be easily boycotted.

385
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.190
They really like tea and those colonies just like us here,

386
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.510
it makes us a reasonable amount of money.
That's the thing that'll stay.

387
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.220
Now when I was writing this lecture I was thinking about that.

388
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:36.250
I'm thinking about tea and tea ceremonies and the drinking of tea and it,

389
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:40.430
I mean I feel that we all have in our mind a sense of that being the case in

390
00:24:40.431 --> 00:24:44.120
England.
Um,
but it was no less the case in the colonies.

391
00:24:44.121 --> 00:24:48.980
And when I was,
I guess when I was researching my first book,

392
00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.210
I came across a story,

393
00:24:50.211 --> 00:24:53.570
I'm going to mention it now only because it relates to the tea ceremony.

394
00:24:53.571 --> 00:24:55.340
And this is my opportunity to tell the story.

395
00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.920
They will be random moments when I just have to tell a story.

396
00:24:57.921 --> 00:25:02.300
Cause you guys are like hostages and he's like,
I just say whatever I want.

397
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.530
And I get to tell random stories,

398
00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:08.630
but this actually does demonstrate the sort of ritual of tea drinking
everywhere.

399
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.080
So the whole tea ceremony was important in the colonies.

400
00:25:12.081 --> 00:25:17.081
I came across this account from a foreign observer actually from France and he

401
00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:20.870
shows up in the colonies and he says in a letter to a friend that he'd never

402
00:25:20.871 --> 00:25:24.620
quite seen anything like the colonial obsession with serving tea.

403
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.210
And he describes this visit that he paid to a woman,
um,

404
00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.780
and he said that he will take a sip and then she would immediately refill the

405
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:36.320
cup so he couldn't figure out how to empty the cup.

406
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:39.980
Basically he doesn't want any more tea and he can't figure out how to make it

407
00:25:39.981 --> 00:25:43.220
stop coming.
Yeah,
dig a little more fast.
Maybe she'll end.

408
00:25:43.221 --> 00:25:46.610
He kept basically trying out one thing after another and she kept refilling the

409
00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:49.760
cup and then he felt compelled to drink because it was the proper thing to do

410
00:25:49.761 --> 00:25:51.860
was to eat or drink what he was served.

411
00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.240
He didn't know that the code and the tea ceremony to stop t from being poured

412
00:25:56.241 --> 00:25:59.450
with to place your teaspoon across the top of your cup.
Right.

413
00:25:59.451 --> 00:26:00.560
He didn't think about that.

414
00:26:00.561 --> 00:26:05.561
So at one point he's desperate because he just can't deal with anymore d so she

415
00:26:06.051 --> 00:26:08.690
pours more Teen Cup and when she turned away,

416
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:12.770
he actually swallowed everything in a cup and a gulp and then put the cup in his

417
00:26:12.771 --> 00:26:13.604
pocket.

418
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.720
Like she's not gonna notice like,
Oh,

419
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:25.700
you ate the cup
and he doesn't say what happened,
you know,

420
00:26:25.701 --> 00:26:28.790
he just describes putting it in his pocket like they are now.
I settled back,

421
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:33.280
you know,
great thinking
there was serious about it.

422
00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.770
Tea Ceremonies.
Okay.
Um,

423
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:40.690
so with full knowledge of the,
the cultural importance of t and the colonies,

424
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.950
um,
north left the tea in effect,

425
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:48.900
hoping that a slight concession on the part of England maybe would chip away at

426
00:26:48.901 --> 00:26:53.580
colonial unity.
Right.
Maybe some colonists would be convinced to stop resisting.

427
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:58.790
Maybe non importation would thus collapse and eventually not importation does

428
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:03.360
collapse.
It kind of dribbles to a close 17,
70 1771.

429
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.510
And as with the stamp act,

430
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:11.670
both the colonies and the British administration assumed that they had emerged

431
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:13.080
from this victorious,
right?

432
00:27:13.081 --> 00:27:16.950
The colonies think ha we got most of those offensive acts repealed.

433
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.680
Parliament thinks,
well we are still maintaining our sovereignty.

434
00:27:19.681 --> 00:27:22.830
So our point stands firm.
Now of course,

435
00:27:22.831 --> 00:27:27.630
this did nothing to resolve the conflict about the precise nature of

436
00:27:27.631 --> 00:27:28.291
sovereignty,

437
00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:33.270
the precise nature of the imperial system and the precise power of parliament

438
00:27:33.271 --> 00:27:37.800
over the colonies
at about this time.
However,

439
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:42.540
Lord north,
once again thinking about the colonies attempting reform,

440
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.910
he's struggling.
Clearly you have to feel,

441
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.780
I just feel bad for a prime minister at this moment of massive confusion in the

442
00:27:48.781 --> 00:27:52.440
colonies.
He's trying to figure out some way to get colonial affairs in control.

443
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.090
So at this point he figures maybe one way to sort of calm things down is to

444
00:27:57.091 --> 00:28:00.450
focus on Massachusetts,
right?
Massachusetts is the pesky colony.

445
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.340
Bad things happen in Massachusetts.

446
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:06.570
So he says maybe one way to resolve things is to make a few little tweaks in

447
00:28:06.571 --> 00:28:07.710
their political system.

448
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.920
So he decides that Henceforth Superior Court judges will be paid by tax revenue

449
00:28:13.531 --> 00:28:17.760
collected by the crown from the colonies,
which means in effect,

450
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.940
Superior Court judges are not going to be paid by colonial legislature.

451
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.210
Is there going to be paid by the crown?
Okay.

452
00:28:24.211 --> 00:28:26.880
So certainly to some people in Massachusetts,

453
00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:31.881
the seemed like it's a way to make judges accountable to British authorities and

454
00:28:32.251 --> 00:28:34.140
not to colonists.

455
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.440
And in a sense that was part of what north was trying to do here.

456
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.930
But unfortunately,
at about the same time,
in June of 1772,

457
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.930
there was a crisis in Rhode Island,

458
00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:51.180
um,
a British ship,
the gas bay,

459
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:57.140
which was used in Rhode Island to prevent smuggling ran aground in Rhode Island.

460
00:28:57.811 --> 00:29:00.070
And that night colonist swarmed aboard.

461
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.240
It forced the crew off and burned it to the ground.
Okay.

462
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:06.420
That's kind of a strong anti British,

463
00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:08.460
like we hate that you're stopping smuggling act.

464
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:14.270
So the crown responded by creating a commission of inquiry to investigate the

465
00:29:15.391 --> 00:29:19.980
matter.
And ultimately this committee decides it's going to let this slide,

466
00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:25.340
which is a major concession because burning one of his majesty's ships is a

467
00:29:25.471 --> 00:29:28.800
serious matter,
right?
It's not like a minor crime even.

468
00:29:28.801 --> 00:29:32.970
So Collin is just took offense at the existence of the commission,

469
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:37.230
which seem to interfere with the internal affairs of a colony.

470
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.970
And even worse,

471
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.500
this gets back to something that people have been upset about in the colonies

472
00:29:41.501 --> 00:29:46.060
before the commission would have sent the people who are going to be tried to

473
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.130
England for their trials.
Right?
So,

474
00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:51.190
and this also feels like a threat to self rule.

475
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.460
So you have these sorts of things going on.
Their individual acts,

476
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:58.240
they're not connected,
but they're in the eyes of many Collin is not good things.

477
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.010
Samuel Adams,

478
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:05.460
brilliant propagandists than he is decides there has to be an immediate response

479
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:08.890
to these new encroachments on colonial rights.

480
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.770
And it needs to not just be in Boston.

481
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.980
There needs to be a widespread interstate protest to what's happening and to the

482
00:30:17.291 --> 00:30:18.550
implications of what's happening.

483
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:23.970
So in November of 1772 building on the whole model of the non importation

484
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.700
associations,

485
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:33.270
he suggests in the Boston town meeting that a committee of correspondence be

486
00:30:33.641 --> 00:30:38.641
formed in Boston to communicate the current state of affairs in Boston to the

487
00:30:39.821 --> 00:30:44.590
rest of the colony end quote to the world,
right?
He's ambitious,
Samuel Adams,

488
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.020
and to solicit responses.

489
00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:52.770
So a committee of correspondence of roughly 21 men is created with the purpose

490
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:58.120
as stated in the Boston town meeting of stating quote the rights of the

491
00:30:58.121 --> 00:31:03.121
colonists and of this province in particular as men and Christians and as

492
00:31:03.851 --> 00:31:05.890
subjects,
which is an interesting trio as men,

493
00:31:05.891 --> 00:31:10.000
as Christians and as subjects and to communicate and publish the same to the

494
00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:15.001
several towns and to the world as the sense of this town with the infringements

495
00:31:15.851 --> 00:31:20.050
and violations there of that have been or from time to time may be made right.

496
00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:23.710
Infringements that have been made or maybe made right.
So he's even,

497
00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.840
something else is going to happen.
And if it is,

498
00:31:25.841 --> 00:31:27.730
we've got a committee of correspondence in place.

499
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:32.260
So by the end of November of 1772,

500
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:36.970
the committee had produced an open letter to all of the towns in Massachusetts

501
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:40.720
urging them quote not to dos or sit supine,

502
00:31:40.721 --> 00:31:43.840
Lee in different on the brink of destruction that Samuel Adams,

503
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.520
it's really a master at the strong words.
Um,

504
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.720
and to create their own committees of correspondence.

505
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.800
And more than half of the towns in Massachusetts responded encouraging more

506
00:31:56.651 --> 00:32:00.190
widespread participation in the controversy than before.

507
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:05.730
More widespread willingness to act alongside the normal political system to

508
00:32:06.401 --> 00:32:09.610
protest what people saw as an unconstitutional act.

509
00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.710
And there were more than 80 of these local committees of correspondence created

510
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:19.510
within just a few months.
One observer called these committees,

511
00:32:19.511 --> 00:32:24.511
quote the foulest subtlest and most venomous serpent ever issued from the egg of

512
00:32:25.571 --> 00:32:29.500
sedition.
And you can kind of see this person's fears,
right?

513
00:32:29.501 --> 00:32:33.670
This is the person who sees what he perceives to be as organized resistance to

514
00:32:33.671 --> 00:32:38.671
the British government sort of bubbling up in Massachusetts and this sort of

515
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:42.410
bubbling committees or committees of correspondence.

516
00:32:42.411 --> 00:32:45.890
They're going to be spreading sedition according to this person throughout the

517
00:32:45.891 --> 00:32:48.020
colonies and possibly to the world.

518
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.790
And this person had a right to be suspicious because organized resistance is

519
00:32:52.791 --> 00:32:54.560
partly what these committees are all about.

520
00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:01.330
So this unfolding of events in Massachusetts led radicals elsewhere to do what

521
00:33:03.441 --> 00:33:08.441
Massachusetts had done and create their own committees of correspondence for

522
00:33:08.631 --> 00:33:12.380
communication within colonies and between the colonies.

523
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:15.170
So within roughly a year,
by very,

524
00:33:15.171 --> 00:33:17.480
very early in 1774,

525
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.810
there were committees of correspondence and almost every colony

526
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.350
and these committees did a number of things.

527
00:33:24.351 --> 00:33:29.351
They strengthened ties between radical colonies like Massachusetts and less

528
00:33:30.891 --> 00:33:33.080
active or less radical colonies.

529
00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:38.450
And they created a way for radical minded people in different colonies to

530
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:43.430
interact with each other.
So clearly these committees of correspondence,

531
00:33:43.431 --> 00:33:48.110
just like the non importation associations are an important stepping stone in

532
00:33:48.111 --> 00:33:52.100
the growing sense of colonial unity.
Now,

533
00:33:52.101 --> 00:33:56.280
it was at this moment that Lord north past the tea act,
um,

534
00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:01.730
it actually had less to do with the colonies then it had to do with a miserably

535
00:34:01.731 --> 00:34:03.500
timed necessity.

536
00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:08.860
North was trying to save the east India tea company from collapse the tea act of

537
00:34:09.711 --> 00:34:14.711
1773 removed import duties on east India tea,

538
00:34:15.321 --> 00:34:20.150
which basically made British teach cheaper than Dutch tea in the hope that this

539
00:34:20.151 --> 00:34:24.140
would inspire colonist to purchase British tea.
Okay,

540
00:34:24.141 --> 00:34:25.520
so you would think,

541
00:34:25.521 --> 00:34:29.420
and certainly you can understand why Lord North would think that this would make

542
00:34:29.421 --> 00:34:34.421
the colonists happy because he is lowering duties on t the east India company

543
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.810
hopefully as he's thinking would be solvent,

544
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:42.350
maybe the towns than to act my little t tags left in place.

545
00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:46.700
There is going to matter less because I've just lowered duties on some tea so

546
00:34:46.701 --> 00:34:51.320
maybe now the colonists we'll pay the t tax parliament will obviously have the

547
00:34:51.321 --> 00:34:54.800
right to tax the colonies in their eyes and maybe this will actually quiet

548
00:34:54.801 --> 00:34:55.634
things a little,

549
00:34:56.390 --> 00:35:00.800
but once again the British government misjudge the colonial reaction.

550
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.520
Again,
showing how you have different evolving mindsets here and they're not

551
00:35:04.521 --> 00:35:08.510
necessarily either one understanding what's happening in the other case.

552
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:14.150
So if the colon is not surprisingly had their own interpretation of the act,

553
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:19.360
they actually felt that the act was granting a monopoly to the east India tea

554
00:35:19.461 --> 00:35:24.461
company in forcing the control of the British government over what they felt

555
00:35:24.471 --> 00:35:26.450
like was supposed to be free trade.

556
00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.700
So maybe in the future the British would begin to control the importation of

557
00:35:31.701 --> 00:35:34.430
other goods as well.
Okay.

558
00:35:34.431 --> 00:35:39.431
So somewhat paradoxically by the duty on English tea north helped fuel colonial

559
00:35:42.601 --> 00:35:47.280
fears that there was a plot in England against colonial rights,

560
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.350
which inspired the colonist to imagine the worst immediately when a suspicious

561
00:35:52.351 --> 00:35:57.060
act was passed.
So,
oh,
this must be part of that plot.
This TX,
yes,

562
00:35:57.061 --> 00:36:01.500
he may seem to be lowering the duty on Auntie,
but there must be another motive.

563
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:03.690
Ah,
they must be trying to control our trade.

564
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:07.160
You could sort of see on both sides how the logic makes sense.

565
00:36:07.161 --> 00:36:09.270
You can also see how this is a problem.

566
00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:12.510
As with the stamp act,

567
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:16.740
colonist responded by pinpointing the people who would be distributing the t,

568
00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:18.810
right?
So first he didn't want to be a stamp agent.

569
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.660
Now you don't want to be a person selling tea.

570
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.130
So they pinpointed the merchants who were selling tea and they pressured them

571
00:36:26.131 --> 00:36:26.911
not to sell it,

572
00:36:26.911 --> 00:36:31.911
and broadsides were posted in public places to inform and involve the populace

573
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.580
saying things like friends,
brethren,
countrymen,

574
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:37.320
that worst of plagues,

575
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:42.440
the detested t shipped for this port by the east India company is now arrived in

576
00:36:43.051 --> 00:36:43.884
this harbor,

577
00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:49.250
the hour of destruction or manly opposition to the machinations of tyranny.

578
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.770
Stare you in the face.
It's like big drama.
You know,

579
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:57.771
these are not people who do things halfway destruction staring you in the face.

580
00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.670
Tyranny,
manly,
opposition.

581
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:05.780
So when ships loaded with t began arriving in major colonial ports,

582
00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:10.380
obviously things become more heated in some cities.

583
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:13.560
The t was just unloaded and then locked up in a warehouse and left.

584
00:37:13.561 --> 00:37:17.760
They're not sold in Philadelphia and New York.

585
00:37:17.761 --> 00:37:21.630
They actually kept these ships with tea on them out,

586
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.470
away from the harbor so that they just never came in close to shore.

587
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:27.930
However,
in Boston,

588
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:33.890
Governor Hutchinson decided to force the issue in his mind as a means of

589
00:37:34.351 --> 00:37:37.110
protecting British sovereignty in the colonies.

590
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.210
So Hutchinson ordered the ta ships to be unloaded.
Okay.

591
00:37:42.211 --> 00:37:47.211
So we have an eye witness account of someone who heard the response to that

592
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:49.470
announcement.

593
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:53.460
Who heard what happened when it was people heard that Hutchinson was going to

594
00:37:53.461 --> 00:37:58.461
ask for the to be unloaded and it was at a Boston town meeting December 16th,

595
00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:01.510
1773.
Um,

596
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.480
basically people knew that there was this t bearing ship in the harbor and they

597
00:38:06.481 --> 00:38:09.600
knew that on December 16th in the evening,

598
00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:14.670
the captain of that ship was going to go to the town meeting and tell the town

599
00:38:14.671 --> 00:38:16.620
meeting Samuel Adams who was chairing the meeting,

600
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:19.140
what was going to happen with the T.
People knew that.

601
00:38:19.141 --> 00:38:23.130
And thus there was an enormous crowd gathered outside of the old south church

602
00:38:23.131 --> 00:38:26.040
where the meeting was being held to see what would happen.
Right.

603
00:38:26.041 --> 00:38:29.040
So everyone knows this is like the stare down.
Okay,

604
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:31.900
what's going to happen is the t coming off the boats and if the [inaudible]

605
00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.650
coming off the boats,
what happens next?
Big crowd.

606
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:39.280
And here's what this eyewitness heard as the crowd learned that Hutchinson was

607
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:42.070
insisting on the unloading of the tea.
So this eye witness,

608
00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:46.990
he's at home drinking tea.
When he said,

609
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:52.380
I heard such prodigious shouts that induced me while drinking tea at home to go

610
00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:56.320
out and know the cause of it.
The meeting house was so crowded,

611
00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:59.620
I could get no farther than the porch you'd have fought.

612
00:38:59.621 --> 00:39:03.760
The inhabitants of the infernal regions had broke loose from my part.

613
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:08.380
I went contentedly home and finished my team.
What's going on?

614
00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:09.520
I got to go finish my day.

615
00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:15.630
But with soon informed what was going forward.
Right as soon told,

616
00:39:15.631 --> 00:39:20.170
like they're going to unload the tea but still not crediting it without ocular

617
00:39:20.171 --> 00:39:23.200
demonstrations.
Okay.
18th Century.

618
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.330
I wanted to see it for myself,

619
00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:30.730
but not crediting it without ocular demonstrations I went to watch.
Okay.

620
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:35.680
So our eye witness goes off to get ocular demonstrations of the unloading of the

621
00:39:35.681 --> 00:39:37.010
tea.
Um,

622
00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:42.120
but what he ends up watching is an assemblage of somewhere between 30 and 60 men

623
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:47.080
disguised as Indians,
a board,
three ships on Griffin's wharf.

624
00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:53.010
And these men basically worked on those shifts for several hours and through 342

625
00:39:53.051 --> 00:39:55.390
chests of tea over the side.

626
00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:59.260
A huge number of people watched from the docks.

627
00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.540
And as I mentioned before,

628
00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.770
when I was talking about the stamp act riots and popular demonstrations were

629
00:40:05.771 --> 00:40:08.530
kind of a regular part of the system in the colonies.

630
00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:12.220
Riots were not normally chaotic moments of violence and disorder unless you were

631
00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.320
shingle by shingle picking apart the house of the stamp agent for example.
Um,

632
00:40:17.321 --> 00:40:20.440
but usually they were almost ritualized demonstrations of protest.

633
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:25.330
So what we have here is not a wild riot on these ships.

634
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:30.840
Protesters were so careful not to do anything other than make their point not to

635
00:40:31.121 --> 00:40:35.050
do anything other than destroyed t that allegedly they brought a locksmith with

636
00:40:35.051 --> 00:40:38.680
them to open lots or repair locks that were broken.
I mean,

637
00:40:38.681 --> 00:40:41.860
these are people who understand property rights,
right?
We value property.

638
00:40:41.861 --> 00:40:43.000
We don't want to break your locks.
I mean,

639
00:40:43.001 --> 00:40:46.210
they're not actually out to get the ship owners.
They just want the tea.

640
00:40:46.211 --> 00:40:49.960
So they actually were very orderly about the way in which they went to destroy

641
00:40:49.961 --> 00:40:53.020
the team.
So to give us a sense of what happened,

642
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:56.950
I'm going to use an account by another man.
His name is George Hughes.

643
00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.850
He actually helped destroy the tea.

644
00:40:58.851 --> 00:41:01.300
So he's one of the people throwing chests of tea over the side.

645
00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:05.380
And in his account he says that back at the old south church,

646
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:09.880
the announcement that Hutchinson was going to order the unloading of the t led

647
00:41:09.881 --> 00:41:13.730
to quote a general Hassan for Griffin's wharf that has ah,

648
00:41:13.731 --> 00:41:18.680
is like an 18th century who ray,
you know,
off to Griffin's war.

649
00:41:18.681 --> 00:41:20.290
So these guys were like,
you're going to unload the tea,

650
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:23.560
we're there and something bad is gonna happen.

651
00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:29.050
So Hughes a participant in what would come to be known but not until well into

652
00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:32.950
the 19th century as the Boston tea party continues his account,

653
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.340
he says it was now evening.

654
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:38.300
And I immediately dress myself in the costume of an Indian equipped with a small

655
00:41:38.301 --> 00:41:39.620
hatchet with which,

656
00:41:39.621 --> 00:41:43.430
and the club after having painted my face and hands with coal dust in the shop

657
00:41:43.431 --> 00:41:47.590
have a blacksmith I repaired to Griffin's wharf where the ships lay that

658
00:41:47.591 --> 00:41:48.530
contained the tea.

659
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:53.270
And he uses order to go to the captain and demand of him the keys to the hatches

660
00:41:53.271 --> 00:41:57.230
because they don't want to damage the ship and it doesn't candles so they can

661
00:41:57.231 --> 00:42:01.100
see what they're doing.
I mean there've been very sort of polite here.

662
00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:05.060
The captain probably replied and delivered the articles but requested me at the

663
00:42:05.061 --> 00:42:07.310
same time to do no damage to the ship or rigging.

664
00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:12.350
So these Indians cut and split the teacher tests with their Tomahawks and threw

665
00:42:12.351 --> 00:42:13.184
them overboard.

666
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.420
There were some people who tried to climb on board the ship to scoop up t to

667
00:42:17.421 --> 00:42:18.470
take back home with them.

668
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:22.640
This was not a wise thing to do because they were caught and their hats and wigs

669
00:42:22.641 --> 00:42:26.360
were dumped in the water with the tea and they were kicked away.

670
00:42:26.361 --> 00:42:30.170
Like literally the crowds are just kicked them away from the ships on the wharf.

671
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:36.170
So heels concludes his account by saying we then quietly retired to our several

672
00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:40.250
places of residence without having any conversation with each other or taking

673
00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:42.890
any measures to discover who we are,
our associates,
right.

674
00:42:42.891 --> 00:42:43.970
Cause they're all disguised.

675
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:48.050
Nor do I recollect of our having had the knowledge of the name of a single

676
00:42:48.051 --> 00:42:49.070
individual concerned.

677
00:42:49.071 --> 00:42:52.400
And the affair there appeared to be an understanding that each individual should

678
00:42:52.401 --> 00:42:53.780
volunteer his services,

679
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:57.500
keep his own secret and risk the consequences for himself.

680
00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:00.710
No disorder took place during that transaction.

681
00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.910
And it was observed at that time that the stillest night ensued that Boston had

682
00:43:04.911 --> 00:43:09.350
enjoyed for many months.
So not wild abandoned.
It's a pretty controlled riot.

683
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.473
However,

684
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:15.890
Lord North was dumbfounded because he really thought he had given the colonies

685
00:43:15.891 --> 00:43:18.620
what he called a relief instead of an oppression.

686
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.870
And he assumed that only what he called quote New England fanatics would've

687
00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.850
rebelled against his measure.
So this event,

688
00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:29.091
this,

689
00:43:29.091 --> 00:43:33.830
this tea event in Boston is proved to him that the issue no longer is one of

690
00:43:33.831 --> 00:43:34.491
taxation,

691
00:43:34.491 --> 00:43:38.630
but now this appears to him to be more about whether Britain had any authority

692
00:43:38.631 --> 00:43:42.650
over quote the Hottie American Republicans at all.

693
00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:47.540
And this is an actual transcription of part of the parliamentary debate of what

694
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:50.420
to do after this was discovered.
North said,

695
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:54.440
the Americans have tarred and feathered your subjects plundered,

696
00:43:54.441 --> 00:43:58.730
your merchants burnt.
Your ships denied all obedience to your laws and authority.

697
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.830
Yet so Clement and so long for bearing has our conduct bin.
That is,

698
00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.770
it is incumbent on us now to take a different course.

699
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:11.420
Whatever may be the consequence,
we must risk something if we do not.

700
00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:15.780
All is over and another member of parliament said he thought quote,

701
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:20.000
the town of Boston ought to be knocked about their ears and destroyed.

702
00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.090
Okay,
I am of opinion.

703
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:27.440
You will never meet with that proper obedience to the laws of this country until

704
00:44:27.441 --> 00:44:29.660
you have destroyed that nest of locusts.
Okay.

705
00:44:29.661 --> 00:44:33.630
Boston is not popular in parliament.
Another member said,

706
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.270
we're moving back into arrogant British quotation territory.

707
00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:41.460
Lord north could not do a better thing than to put an end to their town
meetings.

708
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:46.760
I would not have a man of a mercantile cast every day collecting him so

709
00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:49.590
themselves together and debating about political matters.

710
00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:53.520
I would have them follow their occupations as merchants and not consider

711
00:44:53.521 --> 00:44:58.350
themselves as ministers of that country.
You have sir?
No government,
no governor.

712
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:02.550
The whole,
or the proceedings of a tumultuous and riotous rabble who aught,

713
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:07.230
if they had the least prudence to follow their mercantile employment and not

714
00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:12.120
trouble themselves with politics and government,
which they do not understand.

715
00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:17.220
Okay.
Go back to your regular jobs,
guys like don't miss and government.
It's like,

716
00:45:17.221 --> 00:45:20.790
what,
what are they doing?
Why are they doing this?
They're merchants.

717
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:22.890
They're not politicians.
And look what they're doing.

718
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:26.100
They're messing up the imperial system.
Okay.

719
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.810
The result of that kind of sentiment would be the passage of four acts that

720
00:45:30.811 --> 00:45:35.811
Americans termed the intolerable act passed in parliament in the spring of 1774.

721
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:43.110
Um,
and I'm so on the cusp of running out of time.

722
00:45:43.111 --> 00:45:48.111
I think what I will do is pause there since we're just about out of time for

723
00:45:48.181 --> 00:45:50.070
class.
Um,
we will continue,

724
00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:55.310
we will add the details of the intolerable acts and then move into the logic of

725
00:45:55.921 --> 00:45:56.461
resistance,

726
00:45:56.461 --> 00:46:00.600
which is going to look at how this is adding up to an ongoing logic in the

727
00:46:00.601 --> 00:46:03.510
colonial mindset.
How's that there?
