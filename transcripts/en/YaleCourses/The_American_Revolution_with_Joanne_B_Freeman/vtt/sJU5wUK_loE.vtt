1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.550
Um,
but now I will actually talk about the declaration of independence.
Um,

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.090
obviously at the core of today's lecture we have a piece of paper.

3
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.250
Um,
of course it's an iconic piece of paper to us,

4
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.410
but it's a piece of paper,
just the same.

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.450
And part of what we're going to be looking at today in this lecture is that

6
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.940
obviously this declaration was more than just a piece of paper produced by a

7
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:34.941
bunch of guys in one room that actually declaring independence was an event and

8
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:39.690
it was an event that reached far beyond the second continental Congress and

9
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:43.890
actually was hashed out in towns and cities throughout the colonies.

10
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:48.660
And I'll be talking some about that today.
So as you'll see today,

11
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:51.420
and it'll be logically following through other things that I've said in the

12
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:55.770
course,
what we're talking about here is a wrenching progress,

13
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.460
a major decision that was an act of treason and action that the colonists new

14
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.660
would set them on a dangerous path.
Now,

15
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:09.390
given lots of the stuff I've said so far in this course,

16
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:11.930
hopefully you're expecting your,

17
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.960
you're understanding why this would be a wrenching process.

18
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.990
Why it would seem radical or as radical as it did.

19
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.670
It represented a break from the mother country that American colonists obviously

20
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:25.440
had long embraced as their own,

21
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:30.441
as well as a dangerous act that set a collection of colonies in warfare against

22
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:35.100
the most powerful nation on earth.
So big step.

23
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.920
So it's an important act,

24
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.320
but we need to be careful in assuming that the piece of paper that explained

25
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.870
it's rationale had some kind of magical,

26
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:50.490
iconic value at the time that it was created because it didn't.

27
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.110
And as you'll see,

28
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.230
it was not seen as the main focus of the process of declaring independence.

29
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:02.490
And in a way it was almost seen as a formality to the actual act of declaring

30
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:07.230
independence.
And it wasn't intended to say something dramatically new.

31
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:10.500
It's come to mean a lot of things over the centuries,

32
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.480
but at the time it was not supposed to be something radically new as Jefferson

33
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:19.160
put it.
And you know,
all of these,
all of these founder types,
um,

34
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.460
those who live into old age are asked eternally through their old age to tell
us,

35
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:25.560
you know,
tell us about right Jefferson got all these.

36
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.020
Tell us about the declaration letters from people.

37
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.270
Adam's got the same kind of letters I'm going to be quoting,
um,

38
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.340
later on from one or two of their explanations of what happened surrounding the

39
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:36.360
declaration of independence.

40
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:39.520
But in one of these letters when someone asks Jefferson,
you know,

41
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.020
so how did you decide what was going to be in the declaration?

42
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:47.850
Where do the ideas come from?
And Jefferson said that the declaration was quote,

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.480
neither aiming at originality of principle or sentiment,

44
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.930
nor yet copied from any particular and previous writing.

45
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.410
It was intended to be an expression of the American mind.
Hey,

46
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:02.170
that was what it was,
not only Jefferson intended it to be,

47
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:04.990
but what he understood the document was supposed to be doing.

48
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.440
So as we'll see in today's lecture,

49
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.850
the declaration isn't filled with original thoughts beaming out of the brain of

50
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:14.770
Thomas Jefferson.
Rather,

51
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.190
it reflected American assumptions about government and the rights of the body

52
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:22.780
politic.
So in essence,

53
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.810
it transcribed a mass of ideas that had been brought into the open and defined

54
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.200
by what the colonists took to be British transgressions against their rights as

55
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:39.820
colonists and as British subjects.
Now,

56
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.970
as I suggested in last Thursday's lecture,

57
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.220
the Declaration of independence came roughly six months after the publication of

58
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:53.221
common sense in 1776 but it was by no means the only or even the most important

59
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:57.430
thing that the congress had to do with that time,

60
00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:01.480
which is sort of not what we would express expect given that it's this iconic

61
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.643
document,

62
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.010
and I'll be talking more about the other things that Congress had to do in

63
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:07.720
Thursday's lecture.
But for now,

64
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.220
I'll say that by the time the second continental Congress met and at first met

65
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:17.221
in May of 1775 shots had already been fired at Lexington and Concord,

66
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.310
so it's Thomas Paine put it.
I quoted him last week.

67
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.490
The colonies had been set on fire and the congress now face the monumental task

68
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:31.360
of organizing some kind of other defensive effort or war effort.

69
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:33.970
But whatever it was,
they had to organize it.

70
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.370
That was going to be a big problem.

71
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:41.050
It was gonna be a huge challenge that's happening at the same time that

72
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:42.850
everything that I'm talking about today's happening.

73
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:45.280
So even as we're debating independence,

74
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.580
the congress also has to do with a whole range of other issues that really are

75
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:55.240
immediate and pressing and are about Oregon basically organizing a war.

76
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.260
So not surprisingly,

77
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.730
given the British soldiers had killed some colonists in Massachusetts in April

78
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.120
of 1775 when the second continental Congress came into session in May,

79
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.700
there was already a strong feeling of colonial unity and what at the time they

80
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:17.290
called rage military,
right?

81
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.860
This sort of fervent support of the colonial cause.

82
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.870
And you can see the mood of the colonists generally in the treatment that they

83
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:29.920
gave the congressional delegates as they traveled down to Philadelphia for the

84
00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:30.754
meeting.

85
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.360
So as Samuel Adams and John Hancock traveled down from Massachusetts and they

86
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:40.450
met up with delegates from Connecticut and New York as they went south all along

87
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:40.811
their way,

88
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:45.811
local militia units came out to accompany them and seemingly to protect them

89
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:47.890
from the British.
It's not like actually British,

90
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:50.980
we're going to jump out from Connecticut and shoot down the delegates of the

91
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:54.310
continental congress,
but still the,
the impulse was there.

92
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:58.100
These militia came out to guard the delegates heading down to Congress.

93
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:02.420
And all along the route people came out to watch these delegates as they passed

94
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:06.830
by and greeted them with shouts of has ah,
has,
ah,

95
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.870
because Ah,
is um,
the 18th century equivalent of hooray his Ah,

96
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.850
um,
which is very somehow 18th century sounding.
I don't know who ray with a Z in.

97
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:20.780
It just doesn't sound very modern.
Um,
and I have to,

98
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.520
what pops into my head is a million years ago,

99
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:27.470
actually I had a Hassan moment,
I had a personal,

100
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.530
is that moment in which I was invited to some big black tie celebration of a

101
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:35.360
founder who shall go nameless.
And um,

102
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.810
at the founder sort of celebration,

103
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.590
all in like our long dresses and Tuxedos black tie event.

104
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.830
The organizer actually got us all to stand and yell three houses for the

105
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:51.080
founder.
So there's a group of all these very formal people going.

106
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.620
So even now it feels ridiculous to me.
But even at the time I thought,

107
00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.061
yeah,
you just,

108
00:06:59.061 --> 00:07:02.540
you haven't lived as an 18th century historian until you've had the chance to

109
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:06.860
scream Hassan in honor of a founding fathers.
So I had my has a moment,

110
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.640
um,
there's my Hassan moment,
there's an explanation of hose off.

111
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.960
We have a lot of design going for the delegations if they're heading down to

112
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:19.610
Philadelphia.
Um,
so in all of that has,
ah,

113
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.640
and you can see that the colonial cause is not an isolated effort being managed

114
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:30.521
by a few dozen men in a room to all of these people at the time,

115
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.250
just after Lexington and Concord,
the mere existence of the congress,

116
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.670
which was a body formed by all of the colonies together,

117
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.040
was proof of colonial unity.

118
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.540
So it had great significance even just on that most basic level.

119
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.800
And actually although people didn't know it at the time,

120
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.080
the continental congress would end up being the sole government for the colonies

121
00:07:57.081 --> 00:08:02.081
until 1781 when the articles of confederation ended up being ratified.

122
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:05.090
And obviously I'll talk more about that in electric to come

123
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.400
now in Thursday's lecture on common sense,

124
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:14.450
I mentioned some of the efforts of the second continental congress to reach

125
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:19.460
reconciliation reconciliation with Britain.
And as I've already said,

126
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.870
the delegates did not arrive in Philadelphia assuming that they were supposed to

127
00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:28.370
be working for independence.
They were working at reconciliation.
Now,
of course,

128
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.630
as I've just explained,

129
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:34.631
they were also worrying about organizing armed forces for defensive purposes and

130
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:40.520
they were pursuing these two sort of con conflicting motives at the same time.

131
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.600
So they're thinking about reconciliation and worrying about defense I suppose in

132
00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:46.700
case that doesn't work,
we really better worry about that.

133
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.640
So we can't take independence for granted.

134
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.320
We also shouldn't take colonial unity for granted because yes,

135
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.970
there's this rage military people are United because of Lexington and Concord.

136
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.480
But if you look up close at the continental congress,

137
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.590
you can see some of the ways in which it really wasn't one United body,

138
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.670
but it really did represent independent bodies,

139
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:16.350
independent colonies joining together for the moment.
So one example,

140
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.040
there was actually no single method set to determine how many delegates should

141
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:24.960
attend from each colony.

142
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:30.150
So basically each colony decided on its own how many people it felt like sending

143
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.950
to the second continental congress.

144
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.450
So Virginia sent seven men and then they seem to have some kind of rotation

145
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:39.090
systems.
So the guys always seem to be coming and going,
Whoa,

146
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:40.710
we've got these guys there,
let's take them home.

147
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:43.980
And bring these new guys there and no one else really knew the system of what

148
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:45.860
was happening in Virginia,
but they always had people there.

149
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.010
They just changed a lot.

150
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.360
New York ultimately appointed 12 men,

151
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.430
but they didn't come really reliably.

152
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:57.450
And so ultimately New York decided that you only needed to have three of them

153
00:09:57.451 --> 00:10:01.650
present to vote.
Okay.
So first of all,
obviously attendance is a little quirky,

154
00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:04.530
but beyond that,
every colonies deciding on its own,

155
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.600
how many people that wants to send.

156
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.500
So you can really see how the continental congress is a body encapsulating

157
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:17.220
delegations from separate and distinct colonies.

158
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:20.610
And before anything really major could be done,

159
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.880
delegations either needed to confer on their own or more often I suppose confer

160
00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:30.360
with people back home in their colony to determine what it was that their colony

161
00:10:30.361 --> 00:10:31.380
wanted them to do.

162
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:36.810
And obviously the different ideas and biases and interests in the various

163
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:41.370
colonies were different enough to make some decisions extremely difficult.

164
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.080
So you've got a pretty distinctive kind of legislative body.

165
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.260
And as I mentioned on Thursday,

166
00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:54.090
one of the notable things that this congress produced was the olive branch

167
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:58.320
petition,
which was this one final stab at reconciliation.

168
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:04.340
The olive branch petition was approved on July 5th,

169
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.770
1775 and the hope of ending bloodshed,

170
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:13.700
the petition walked a delicate line declaring loyalty to the king,

171
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:19.130
not talking about rights or making demands and asking for the kings assistance

172
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:25.350
in reaching some kind of reconciliation.
So it's appealing to the loyalty.

173
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.180
There's people saying they're loyal to the king,

174
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.460
they're not raging about rights and demands,

175
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.510
but they are asking for assistance and helping somehow to smooth things over.

176
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.333
Unfortunately,

177
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:40.230
the petition reached the king at the same time as news of Bunker Hill.
Okay.

178
00:11:40.231 --> 00:11:44.220
One of those unfortunate strikes of fate.
So not surprisingly,

179
00:11:44.221 --> 00:11:48.960
the petition did not have a wonderfully convincing impact.
The crown.

180
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:54.220
And in August of 1775 the king declared the colonies be in rebellion

181
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.320
and basically he ignored,
as I mentioned also in the last lecture,

182
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:01.750
he ignored the olive branch petition.

183
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.900
And by doing so basically played into the hands of more radical colonists by

184
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:08.140
making reconciliation.

185
00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:13.141
See pretty unlikely and really almost demanding some more dramatic action from

186
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:14.824
the colonies.

187
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.580
So August of 1775 George the third declares the colonies in rebellion.

188
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.980
He also did two other things at roughly that time,

189
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.450
neither one of which helped the situation or certainly helped to smooth it over

190
00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:31.660
at all.
So number one,
two months later,

191
00:12:31.661 --> 00:12:36.661
in October of 1775 he stated in parliament that the American rebellion was

192
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:43.510
carried on for the purpose of establishing an independent empire.

193
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:47.440
And this is October,
1775 you're not in 1776 yet.

194
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.470
The king explained that the authors and promoters of this desperate conspiracy

195
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:58.710
meant only to amuse by vague expressions of attachment to the parents state and

196
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:04.510
the strongest protestations of loyalty to me whilst they are preparing for a

197
00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:07.720
general revolt.
Okay.
First of all,
it sounds like he actually saw that petition,

198
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:12.010
right?
Yeah,
yeah.
They're claiming were so loyal to you.
And then at the same time,

199
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.380
there's a desperate conspiracy lurking.

200
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:19.710
So the king is arguing that actually already they're planning revolt and he

201
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:20.591
says,

202
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:24.610
you can see this because the colonists are raising troops because they'd seize

203
00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:29.170
the public revenue because they were trying to seize governmental powers.

204
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.330
Not all members of parliament agreed with this.

205
00:13:33.331 --> 00:13:35.830
This sort of conspiracy theory on the part of the king,

206
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:41.430
those who supported the American cause argued that the American colonies had not

207
00:13:41.861 --> 00:13:44.710
yet declared themselves in revolt.

208
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.350
They had not said that they were rebelling.

209
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.440
They had not said that they wanted independence yet.

210
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.650
And by speaking as he was,

211
00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:57.970
the king could very well push the colonies into more radical action.

212
00:13:57.971 --> 00:14:02.971
And they had yet declared in 1775 but the majority of members of parliament at

213
00:14:03.911 --> 00:14:07.900
the time supported the king statement,
supported his actions.

214
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.310
So first he declares the colonies and rebellion.
Second,

215
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:14.350
he makes this bold statement in parliament.

216
00:14:14.351 --> 00:14:19.351
And then finally third in December of 1775 he proposed and parliament passed a

217
00:14:21.941 --> 00:14:26.941
prohibitory act and the prohibitory act prohibited commerce with the colonies

218
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.480
period and said that colonial ships,

219
00:14:31.481 --> 00:14:34.150
we're no longer under British protection.

220
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:39.760
So basically colonial American ships are fair game on the open seas.
Okay.

221
00:14:39.761 --> 00:14:40.810
That's clearly,

222
00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.890
there's another bold sort of slap on the part of the crown.

223
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:51.120
When news of these actions arrived in the colonies in January and February,

224
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:57.710
1776 many colonists were pushed towards really serious consideration of

225
00:14:57.711 --> 00:15:01.550
independence for the first time.
They're at least considering it aided.
Of course,

226
00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:03.740
as I explained last week by common sense,

227
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.680
the prohibitory act was particularly upsetting to many because it made it lawful

228
00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:13.270
to attack and read American ships as,

229
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.000
as John Hancock put it in a pretty obvious statement.

230
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.250
The making all our vessels lawful prize don't look like a reconciliation.

231
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.910
Like thank you John Hancock and you're right.

232
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:31.330
John Adams went further stating that the prohibitory act should be called the

233
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:35.450
act of independency because it makes us independent in spite of our

234
00:15:35.451 --> 00:15:40.220
supplications and in treaties.
Despite that kind of statement,

235
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.480
it is important to remember regardless of how logical,
even at this moment,

236
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.530
independent seems to us,
we still need to go through a process here.
We're still,

237
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.000
it's still not an obvious choice.

238
00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:55.001
And there were lots of questions hovering with the mere thought of independence.

239
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.120
What kind of a future does declaring independence hold?

240
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.220
Many well realized that that kind of a declaration would bring with it a

241
00:16:04.221 --> 00:16:06.290
devastating war with Great Britain,

242
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:11.450
death and destruction of various kinds and then quite possibly even probably

243
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:12.523
defeat.

244
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.700
And on top of these pretty logical fears,

245
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.130
even as independence seemed,

246
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:22.610
at least it's part of debate if not absolutely looming on the horizon.

247
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:28.210
Most colonists still assumed they're fighting for British rights despite the

248
00:16:28.581 --> 00:16:33.410
fact that clearly their understanding of the British constitution and colonial

249
00:16:33.411 --> 00:16:36.470
rights is differing by this point.
From that,

250
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:39.230
the understanding of those same things in England,

251
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:44.620
most colonists still had so deep a connection with the mother country that

252
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.250
independence almost felt like a physical condition.
And John Dickinson,

253
00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.590
who is a moderate at this period basically put that into words and said that,

254
00:16:54.591 --> 00:16:56.450
um,
by declaring independence,

255
00:16:56.451 --> 00:17:01.340
the colonies were being torn from the body to which we are United by religion,

256
00:17:01.341 --> 00:17:05.090
liberty laws,
affections,
relations,
language and commerce.

257
00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:07.220
So it's almost a physical ripping away.

258
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:13.280
So this is the atmosphere in which common sense comes out and buy swaying large

259
00:17:13.281 --> 00:17:15.500
portions of the people towards independence.

260
00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:18.350
Obviously that pamphlet is extremely important.

261
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:23.570
One of the most important things about it is that because it's suede large

262
00:17:23.571 --> 00:17:24.261
groups of people,

263
00:17:24.261 --> 00:17:27.770
it wasn't just a high falutin political pamphlet written for the elite,

264
00:17:27.771 --> 00:17:28.370
but it really,

265
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:32.870
as I've mentioned already was for the masses that it enabled the continental

266
00:17:32.871 --> 00:17:37.871
congress to consider independence and ultimately to move towards independence as

267
00:17:38.331 --> 00:17:41.000
representatives of the popular will.
Right?

268
00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:46.001
So common sense is swaying the people and so the continental congress now is

269
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:48.440
basically acting on the popular will,

270
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:54.230
some who favored independence actually wanted to distribute common sense at the

271
00:17:54.631 --> 00:17:59.631
congresses expense since it was so useful in arousing public sentiment to move

272
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:01.410
towards independence.

273
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:07.170
Now I want to turn at this point to something that often gets left behind or

274
00:18:07.171 --> 00:18:10.260
left out when we talk about declaring independence,

275
00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:13.950
but it's actually really crucial and in a way I think it's really at the center

276
00:18:13.951 --> 00:18:14.784
of the story.

277
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.500
And what I want to talk about is what people generally in the colonies thought

278
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:21.870
about independence.

279
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:27.150
Because obviously it's not only guys in the continental congress who are

280
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:31.770
debating,
discussing and considering independence.
And even there,

281
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.060
there was great recognition that they are acting on the heart on behalf of the

282
00:18:36.061 --> 00:18:37.110
larger populous.

283
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:43.040
Many colonial delegations felt compelled to have direct orders from the people

284
00:18:43.561 --> 00:18:47.460
of their colony before taking this kind of an enormous step.

285
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.510
And there's a book by Pauline Mayor,
um,

286
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.730
which is titled American Scripture Making the Declaration of independence.
Um,

287
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.790
and it makes this point really well.
It's,
and this,

288
00:18:56.791 --> 00:19:00.120
this sort of larger point that I'm going to make here as partly drawn from her

289
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:01.140
book.
Um,

290
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:06.350
and she emphasizes that the continental congress wasn't the sole focal point for

291
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:08.430
discussion of independence.

292
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:13.200
And she explains in her book that while she was studying what was going on in

293
00:19:13.201 --> 00:19:17.700
the colonies during the months of April,
May,
June,
and July of 1776,

294
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:22.850
she actually discovered over 90 other declarations of independence.

295
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:28.290
All of them written by local communities or towns or conventions representing

296
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.860
individual colonies.
And as she states in her book,

297
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:37.520
these local declarations of independence get us as close as we can to the voice

298
00:19:38.101 --> 00:19:41.550
of the colonial public on the eve of independence.

299
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:47.520
And actually just looking at the process of creating these local declarations

300
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.380
reveals a vast amount of information about how the people at large,

301
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:53.730
we're mobilized,

302
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:59.150
how seriously many colonies took the idea that the people at large had to

303
00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:03.690
request independence,
that the delegates in the continental congress,

304
00:20:03.691 --> 00:20:05.010
we're representing them.

305
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.660
And just the way I suppose the congress that the colonists felt parliament was

306
00:20:09.661 --> 00:20:13.470
not.
So for example,
in Massachusetts,

307
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:18.740
the assembly asked individual towns throughout the colony to have meetings to

308
00:20:19.621 --> 00:20:20.161
discuss,

309
00:20:20.161 --> 00:20:23.190
and this is a quote from the document that the assembly sent to all of these

310
00:20:23.191 --> 00:20:24.024
towns.

311
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:29.250
If the honorable continental congress should decide that for the safety of the

312
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.610
United colonies,
it was necessary to declare them independent of Great Britain,

313
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.680
would they solomnly engage with their lives and fortunes to support the congress

314
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:42.540
in the measure?
Okay,
so the assembly is sending this and saying pounds,

315
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.400
you need to consider this resolution.

316
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.710
If the Continental Congress decides that it makes sense to declare independence,

317
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.650
will you actually support that with your lives and your fortunes?

318
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.630
Is that something you're in favor of?

319
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.400
Obviously it's being treated like really in a sense,
a personal decision.

320
00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:01.780
A highly significant decision s colonists are asked,

321
00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:05.320
are being asked by the statement to join in groups and discuss independence and

322
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:10.321
decide what it is they think should happen next and clearly.

323
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.440
That kind of statement also reveals that they're aware of the seriousness and

324
00:21:16.511 --> 00:21:17.051
they're aware.

325
00:21:17.051 --> 00:21:20.710
I mean ultimately this is an act of treason that's being debated here.

326
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.580
Now the Massachusetts Assembly thought that,
you know,

327
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:28.210
they're asking towns to vote that this might not be necessarily a really lengthy

328
00:21:28.211 --> 00:21:32.290
process since already there's a lot of circulating talk about maybe what should

329
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:32.741
come next.

330
00:21:32.741 --> 00:21:37.741
But actually it wasn't until July that all of the towns reported themselves in

331
00:21:38.291 --> 00:21:42.070
favor of independence.
The process took that long.

332
00:21:42.071 --> 00:21:47.071
It took months because people actually were seriously debating the issue as a

333
00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:51.170
man from one town observed independence was quote,

334
00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.850
the greatest and most important question that ever came before this town.

335
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.160
Now,
of course,

336
00:21:57.161 --> 00:22:02.161
by the time that every town had reported what it thought in Massachusetts to the

337
00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:06.550
continental congress,
the Congress had already decided in favor of independence,

338
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.750
but the people were a part of this decision making process.

339
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:15.930
And if the first towns from Massachusetts had not supported independence,

340
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.930
the Massachusetts delegates might have had a hard time promoting it in

341
00:22:19.931 --> 00:22:24.550
Philadelphia.
So it mattered in Maryland as well.

342
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:29.310
There was widespread participation in this decision about whether independence

343
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:34.320
off to be declared and individual popular declarations supporting independence

344
00:22:34.781 --> 00:22:38.680
there were possibly even more important than in Massachusetts because the

345
00:22:38.681 --> 00:22:43.090
Maryland congressional delegation was undecided in what it thought about

346
00:22:43.091 --> 00:22:43.721
independence.

347
00:22:43.721 --> 00:22:47.380
And it wasn't until the Maryland government received these declarations of

348
00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:52.381
independence from towns in Maryland that they decided to instruct the delegates

349
00:22:52.601 --> 00:22:56.950
in the Congress to support independence.
Some colonies,

350
00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.240
like at this point,
I should just wait for the response.

351
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:05.560
Which colony might have a quirky response,
right?
Rhode Island,

352
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.850
somewhere out there in and like the filming land,
you know,
they're filming this,

353
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:10.420
this,

354
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.620
there's gonna be a lot of Rhode Island people were going to be really mad at me

355
00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:18.190
for saying negative things about Rhode Island and yet here we have Rhode Island.

356
00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:22.540
Again,
Rhode Island did not have such widespread participation.

357
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.410
There was a logic to what went on in Rhode Island.
Um,

358
00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.400
apparently in Rhode Island the legislature did consider asking towns what they

359
00:23:30.401 --> 00:23:31.450
thought about independence,

360
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:35.260
but they did a little investigation first and they discovered that it was

361
00:23:35.261 --> 00:23:39.820
possible that a few towns in Rhode Island might vote against independence.
Okay.

362
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.410
Rhode Island wisely thought,

363
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.070
if we ask people what they think and they say we don't want independence,

364
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.970
this could be a bad thing.

365
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.900
And so I decided that wasn't necessarily the best plan.

366
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.330
Certainly it wouldn't help the common cause.

367
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.920
Now when I discuss colonial legislatures at this point point,

368
00:23:59.961 --> 00:24:04.961
it's important to realize that most of the royal colonial governments had pretty

369
00:24:05.091 --> 00:24:07.700
much collapsed by this point.

370
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:13.990
The continental congress in May of 1776 thus instructed the colonies to form new

371
00:24:16.101 --> 00:24:19.520
governments.
And so roughly throughout this period,

372
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:22.800
some of the colonies had already started doing this before may some of the

373
00:24:22.801 --> 00:24:23.840
waited until May,

374
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.950
but throughout this period in a lot of the colonies there was some kind of a

375
00:24:27.951 --> 00:24:32.951
convention debating what basically the new government and really in a way the

376
00:24:32.961 --> 00:24:37.961
new constitution of these colonies should be in the absence of having a royal

377
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:43.160
presence.
So they're like little Leni colonial constitutional conventions.

378
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:48.320
And it was these conventions often that we're receiving these local declarations

379
00:24:48.321 --> 00:24:51.590
of independence and to some people in the colonies,

380
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.920
it was actually this resolution asking the colonies to create their own

381
00:24:57.411 --> 00:25:01.880
governments that constituted the real declaration of independence.

382
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:07.300
And you can even hear echoes of the later official declaration in the resolution

383
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:10.640
itself asking the colonies to make their own governments.

384
00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.440
It has a preamble,

385
00:25:12.441 --> 00:25:15.650
a very radical preamble that certainly we're radical than anything that the

386
00:25:15.651 --> 00:25:17.600
congress had said thus far.

387
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.940
Whereas his Britannic Majesty in conjunction with the Lords and comments of

388
00:25:22.941 --> 00:25:25.730
Great Britain has by a late act of parliament,

389
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.240
excluded the inhabitants of these United colonies from the protection of the

390
00:25:29.241 --> 00:25:31.640
crown and whereas no answer,

391
00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:35.660
whatever to the humble petitions of the colonies for redress of grievances and

392
00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:39.260
reconciliation with Great Britain has been or is likely to be given.

393
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:43.310
But the whole force of that kingdom aided by foreign mercenaries is to be

394
00:25:43.311 --> 00:25:46.940
exerted for the destruction of the good people of these colonies.

395
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:50.930
It is necessary that the exercise of every kind of authority under the said

396
00:25:50.931 --> 00:25:55.400
crown should be totally suppressed and all the powers of government exerted

397
00:25:55.401 --> 00:25:59.300
under the authority of the people of the colonies for the preservation of

398
00:25:59.301 --> 00:26:03.830
internal peace,
virtue,
and good order as well as for the defense of their lives,

399
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.660
liberties and properties.

400
00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:09.320
So it's a radical statement to Adams,

401
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.570
John Adams as well as many others.

402
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:15.410
This pretty much constituted a declaration of independence even though it didn't

403
00:26:15.411 --> 00:26:20.270
declare independence officially.
And it's significant that in that preference,

404
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:24.320
in that preface,
Congress isn't attacking the king's ministers.

405
00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.370
They're not attacking parliament.
They're attacking the king himself,

406
00:26:28.371 --> 00:26:31.610
which is almost as good as a formal declaration of revolt.

407
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.090
Meanwhile,
in the colonies,

408
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.180
the individual towns are debating what they want to do about independence.

409
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:42.440
They are expressing their opinions and written statements that as Pauline mayor

410
00:26:42.441 --> 00:26:46.690
points out,
we're remarkably alike in tone and content.

411
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.700
A lot of them listed the same grievances and had the same kind of sense of

412
00:26:50.701 --> 00:26:53.430
betrayal at how the king had betrayed them.

413
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:58.440
Most of them mentioned the contempt with which the king had received their

414
00:26:58.441 --> 00:27:00.000
attempts at reconciliation.

415
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:05.840
They mentioned recent violence and destruction of American property by British

416
00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:09.330
troops.
They,
of course mentioned the prohibitory act,

417
00:27:09.331 --> 00:27:12.750
which declared the con the colonists out of British protection.

418
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:16.680
They mentioned German mercenaries hired by George the third to fight the

419
00:27:16.681 --> 00:27:17.520
colonists,

420
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
and most of them had a sort of a personal tone that they adopted towards the

421
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:28.041
king blaming him personally for the present state of affairs and expressing

422
00:27:28.771 --> 00:27:31.750
great sadness at their realization that their,

423
00:27:31.751 --> 00:27:35.820
their monarch basically had fallen to this level and allowed this to happen.

424
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.940
Some petitions went even further suggesting the type of government that they'd

425
00:27:41.941 --> 00:27:46.470
prefer to be there in place of the monarchy.
And in one way or another,

426
00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:50.430
some of these declarations specified they wanted to establish a republican

427
00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:54.420
government in the colonies.
They wanted governments grounded on popular will,

428
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.700
an actual representation.

429
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.600
So what we're seeing here is average people in towns throughout the colonies

430
00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:05.250
immersed in the current state of affairs,

431
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:09.090
committing themselves personally to a course of action,

432
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:13.800
expressing their ideas about what government should be and personally taking

433
00:28:13.801 --> 00:28:17.730
part in the political process in a radical kind of a way.

434
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.770
So obviously we're not talking about a couple of dozen men in a room in

435
00:28:22.771 --> 00:28:24.270
Philadelphia.
Now,

436
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.620
news of these declarations written in May,
June,

437
00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:33.210
and even as late as July helped push the continental congress towards

438
00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:35.550
independence.
So let's move back to Congress.

439
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.290
On June 7th,

440
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:45.290
1776 Virginia took a major step forward by making a resolution that it sent to

441
00:28:45.541 --> 00:28:48.840
it's delegates and Philadelphia via Richard Henry Lee,

442
00:28:48.841 --> 00:28:49.920
who was one of the delegates.

443
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.210
And the resolution from Virginia said that the delegates should promote

444
00:28:54.211 --> 00:28:58.830
independence because the colonies are and of right ought to be free and

445
00:28:58.831 --> 00:29:02.190
independent states.
Bang.
So there you have it.

446
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.300
But the response,
okay,
there it is.
We should be independent.

447
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.300
The resolution that's going to push them to debate independence,

448
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:13.350
the response to that resolution is a reminder that there were a lot of other

449
00:29:13.351 --> 00:29:15.840
things that were more pressing at the time.

450
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.980
So Richard Henry Lee presents this to Congress and Congress says,

451
00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.100
we got to put it off till tomorrow because we actually have more important

452
00:29:23.101 --> 00:29:25.170
things that we need to debate today first.

453
00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:28.470
So hold on about independence tomorrow.
Thank you Richard.

454
00:29:28.471 --> 00:29:31.890
And really onto these other matters.
So the next day,

455
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:35.850
June 8th debate on independence got underway.

456
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.500
And those who are less enthusiastic about independence,

457
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:45.340
men like John Dickinson who is moderate in his politics or James Wilson also of

458
00:29:45.341 --> 00:29:48.700
Pennsylvania.
Um,
Edward Rutledge of South Carolina.

459
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.890
They said that they were friends to the idea,
but at the time wasn't yet right.

460
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:59.170
Some colonial delegations weren't yet ready to declare independence.

461
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:03.430
They didn't have permission to declare it from their home governments and

462
00:30:03.431 --> 00:30:08.431
forcing the issue might force these colonies to succeed from what was already a

463
00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:12.520
relatively weak colonial union or so they argued.

464
00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:15.040
So and disunion if that were to happen,

465
00:30:15.041 --> 00:30:18.310
if they were to push independence and a colony should pull out,

466
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.640
this union would be disastrous to their cause.

467
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.070
Not only because it would hurt the cause,

468
00:30:24.071 --> 00:30:28.150
but it would certainly not encourage foreign nations to potentially help these

469
00:30:28.151 --> 00:30:30.970
little colonies in fighting against Great Britain.

470
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.400
So this is what Rutledge,

471
00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:37.750
Edward Rutledge of South Carolina wrote on June 10th the Congress that till

472
00:30:37.751 --> 00:30:41.950
seven o'clock this evening and consequence of emotion of Richard Henry Lee's

473
00:30:41.951 --> 00:30:44.200
rendering ourselves free and independent states,

474
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.410
the sensible part of the house oppose the motion.

475
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:52.810
They saw no wisdom in a declaration of independence nor any other purpose to be

476
00:30:52.811 --> 00:30:53.561
enforced by it.

477
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:57.700
But placing ourselves in the power of those with whom we mean to treat,

478
00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:02.050
giving our enemy notice of our intentions before we had taken any steps to

479
00:31:02.051 --> 00:31:07.051
execute them and thereby enabling them to counter act us in our intentions and

480
00:31:07.571 --> 00:31:12.250
rendering ourselves ridiculous in the eyes of foreign powers by attempting to

481
00:31:12.251 --> 00:31:16.180
bring them into a union with us before we had United with each other.

482
00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.610
There's a lot of strong arguments Rutledge just presenting,

483
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.580
but of course on the other side of the spectrum,

484
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:26.950
those who supported independence argued that without a formal declaration of

485
00:31:26.951 --> 00:31:30.970
independence,
no nation would be willing to aid the colonies.

486
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:36.010
The colonies are basically independent already.
The matter needs to be discussed.

487
00:31:36.011 --> 00:31:37.180
It needs to be pushed forward,

488
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:43.380
lack of agreement and the importance of the decision led Congress to postpone

489
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:48.880
the decision until the first week of July so that individual colonies could

490
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:54.030
decide on a course of action and in the meantime so no time would be lost.

491
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:59.400
They appointed a committee to compose a written statement formally declaring

492
00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:04.270
colonial independence.
And the committee included John Adams,
Thomas Jefferson,

493
00:32:04.271 --> 00:32:08.200
Benjamin Franklin,
greatest hits,
Roger Sherman of Connecticut,

494
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.470
and Robert Are Livingston,
one of the many living students of New York.

495
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.900
And ultimately the committee appointed Jefferson to draft the document.

496
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:21.700
And he worked during the last two weeks of June in 1776.
Now,

497
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:25.600
as I mentioned at the start of the lecture in later years when Adams and

498
00:32:25.601 --> 00:32:29.130
Jefferson were retired presidential types,
um,

499
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.730
lots of people wrote to them asking,
you know,

500
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.930
so tell us what really happened with the declaration of independence.

501
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:39.500
What was it like?
Why didn't you do x?
Did you really do x?
What was he,
you know,

502
00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:42.850
sort of all the things that you would want to ask if you could ask these people,

503
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:43.910
like what really happened?

504
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:49.010
And both men offered accounts of the writing of the declaration and their

505
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:51.020
accounts do not necessarily agree.

506
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.850
And they're also pretty a character for each one of these men,

507
00:32:55.851 --> 00:33:00.851
particularly John Adams account of what happened with the decision about who's

508
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.010
going to write the declaration of independence.
And,

509
00:33:04.011 --> 00:33:09.011
and actually in 1822 Adams wrote a pretty lengthy explanation of how Jefferson

510
00:33:09.591 --> 00:33:11.200
was chosen to write the declaration.

511
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:14.180
I just want to offer you a little piece of it because it's actually a pretty

512
00:33:14.181 --> 00:33:17.660
amazing little recreation.
So Adams writes in his letter,

513
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.980
you inquire why so young man is Mr. Jefferson was placed at the head of the

514
00:33:21.981 --> 00:33:24.230
committee for preparing a declaration of independence.
Okay,

515
00:33:24.231 --> 00:33:26.780
so there's the what the person wrote.
So a lot of them,
it's like,

516
00:33:26.781 --> 00:33:31.490
why did you pick that young new guy to write this document?
Adam says,

517
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:35.810
I answer.
Mr. Jefferson came into congress in June,

518
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:38.270
1775 and brought with him a reputation for literature,

519
00:33:38.271 --> 00:33:40.670
science and a happy talent of composition.

520
00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:44.930
Writings of his were handed about remarkable for the peculiar Felicity of

521
00:33:44.931 --> 00:33:48.740
expression though a silent member in Congress.
He was so prompt,
frank,

522
00:33:48.741 --> 00:33:51.680
explicit and decisive upon committees and in conversation,

523
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:56.210
not even Samuel Adams was more so,
but he soon seized upon my heart.

524
00:33:56.211 --> 00:34:00.110
And upon this occasion I gave him my vote and did all in my power to procure the

525
00:34:00.111 --> 00:34:03.050
votes of others.
Okay.
So in the end,
the committee's voting,

526
00:34:03.051 --> 00:34:07.490
who should write it and Adams and Jefferson get the most votes to write the

527
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:08.324
declaration.

528
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.380
So they're made according to Adam's like a little subcommittee of Adams and

529
00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:14.500
Jefferson.
And now the subcommittee,

530
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:18.080
supposedly he's going to draft the declaration.
So Adam's continues.

531
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:23.440
The sub committee met Jeffers and proposed to me to make the draft.

532
00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.250
I said,
I will not and and what I'm going to be reading from here now,

533
00:34:28.251 --> 00:34:29.600
it's my favorite part of this story.

534
00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:33.800
He wrote a little script like what Jefferson says.
And when he responds,

535
00:34:33.801 --> 00:34:35.960
he's no longer even like himself and the letter,

536
00:34:35.961 --> 00:34:38.630
he's just recording like he said.
And then I said,
and then he said,

537
00:34:38.631 --> 00:34:43.220
and then I said,
so Jefferson says,
Adams,
you should write it.
And Adam says,

538
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:48.320
I will not.
You should do it.
Jefferson insists.
Oh no,

539
00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:52.670
says Adams.
Why will you not as Jefferson?
You ought to do it.
This is like,

540
00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.080
he's like writing a film.

541
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:59.720
He's already imagining like the movie of my life.
If movies existed,

542
00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.860
I would be imagining the movie of my life.
You ought to do it says Jefferson.

543
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:08.180
I will not.
Why reason enough?

544
00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:12.320
What can be your reasons?
Okay.
This is Adam's response reason.
First,

545
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:16.760
you are a Virginian and Virginia not to appear at the head of this business.

546
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.210
Reason second,
I am obnoxious,

547
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.230
suspected and unpopular.
Oh,

548
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:28.490
John Adams.
I am of noxious,
suspected it unpopular.

549
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:32.960
Don't make me write the document.
You are very much otherwise reason.
Third,

550
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.030
you can write 10 times better than I can.

551
00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.820
Well Adam has respond if you are decided,

552
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.110
I will do it as well as I can.
Okay.
That's part of a really lengthy,

553
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.490
great letter by Adams.

554
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:49.710
Jefferson's account is much less humorous and actually briefer and he writes in

555
00:35:49.711 --> 00:35:54.711
1823 to James Madison and he says no such thing as a sub committee with

556
00:35:54.931 --> 00:35:55.764
proposed.

557
00:35:55.900 --> 00:36:00.900
It's like basic disagreement but they unanimously pressed on myself alone to

558
00:36:02.071 --> 00:36:06.450
undertake the draft.
Okay.
Little disagreement between the two guys,

559
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:10.500
which they never really agreed upon and he then goes on to discuss in this

560
00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:13.860
letter whether the ideas and the declaration were new or not and he says,
no,

561
00:36:13.861 --> 00:36:16.980
no American mind,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Okay.

562
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:20.100
Regardless of the precise details as to whether there was or wasn't a

563
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:23.760
subcommittee.
Jefferson did draft the declaration,

564
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:28.920
he submitted it to the others for comment.
Um,
they commented on it,

565
00:36:28.921 --> 00:36:31.110
they sort of discussed it amongst themselves.

566
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:34.800
You'll get some chance in section to actually talk about some of the real

567
00:36:34.801 --> 00:36:38.730
specifics of the document,
the declaration of independence for the moment.

568
00:36:38.731 --> 00:36:42.810
I'll just mention briefly,
um,
what were some of Jefferson sources?
Right.

569
00:36:42.811 --> 00:36:43.800
He's sitting in Philadelphia.

570
00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:47.760
He has basically two weeks talk about a paper deadline to write the declaration

571
00:36:47.761 --> 00:36:51.330
of independence.
Um,
what is he going to use?
He's pretty pressed for time.

572
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.630
So logically he turned to whatever he could for fodder.

573
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:59.190
And two notable sources were both Virginia documents.
Logically enough,

574
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:04.380
he drafted a constitution for Virginia since the colonies in the middle of doing

575
00:37:04.381 --> 00:37:05.820
that and along with everything else.

576
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:09.900
And that ended up being a source for him of some of the grievances,

577
00:37:09.901 --> 00:37:12.030
that long list of grievances in the declaration.

578
00:37:12.031 --> 00:37:16.830
He pulled some of them from that.
And then the Virginia Declaration of Rights,

579
00:37:16.831 --> 00:37:21.831
which was also part of this constitution making process helped contribute to the

580
00:37:21.961 --> 00:37:24.180
preamble of the declaration.

581
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:29.100
Now of course Jefferson was careful not just to focus on Virginia words,

582
00:37:29.101 --> 00:37:30.060
Virginia charges,

583
00:37:30.061 --> 00:37:34.140
Virginia things because obviously the document is supposed to represent all of

584
00:37:34.141 --> 00:37:37.350
the colonies.
So for example,
when you read the declaration,

585
00:37:37.351 --> 00:37:40.590
you could see some of the things he siding happened in Massachusetts and some of

586
00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:42.810
them actually happened in other colonies as well.

587
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.960
It needs to be something that is coming from some United expression of the

588
00:37:48.601 --> 00:37:49.434
colonial will,

589
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:55.820
one of the passage that ultimately did not end up displaying colonial unity,

590
00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:01.590
not surprisingly concerned slavery.
So in Jefferson's draft,

591
00:38:01.591 --> 00:38:06.591
he actually has a passage that charges the king that the king quote had waged

592
00:38:07.831 --> 00:38:10.410
cruel war against human nature itself,

593
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:15.180
violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant

594
00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:16.830
people who never offended him,

595
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:21.270
captivating and carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere or to encour

596
00:38:21.271 --> 00:38:25.290
miserable death and their transportation either.
Okay,

597
00:38:25.291 --> 00:38:30.291
so that's a notable attempt to blame the king for slavery.

598
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:36.110
But the passage ultimately gets stricken out by the congress in part for obvious

599
00:38:36.431 --> 00:38:40.060
reasons,
right?
The South is not going to support this,

600
00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:45.040
but also ultimately Jefferson's declaration as far as slavery is concerned,

601
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:49.210
had some tortured logic in it because at first the tax the king for creating

602
00:38:49.211 --> 00:38:53.830
slavery for transporting slaves to America and then attacks him for offering

603
00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:56.230
them freedom.
If they fight for the British,

604
00:38:56.650 --> 00:39:01.270
you inflicted slavery upon us and you're threatening to free the slaves.

605
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.270
Okay.
Continental Congress said,
okay,

606
00:39:04.271 --> 00:39:08.800
not only is the south not really able to grasp this at this particular woman,

607
00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.400
but this doesn't entirely match up Jefferson.
So in a sense,

608
00:39:12.401 --> 00:39:16.960
his ambiguity and ambivalence reflected general ambiguity and ambivalence.

609
00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:18.813
But in the end,

610
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:24.190
the total effect of all of these charges was to suggest that the king,

611
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:28.270
that sort of deep kinged himself,
he had displaced himself,

612
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:33.130
that he and not the colonies had brought events to where they now stood.

613
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:36.370
Now,
you know,
I think generally we,

614
00:39:36.371 --> 00:39:41.371
and also often scholars tend to really focus on the preamble of the declaration,

615
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:47.050
but in fact at the time it was the specific charges against the king that were

616
00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:50.110
considered to be the real meat of the document.

617
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.060
The preamble was actually just supposed to be a preamble to the real charges

618
00:39:55.061 --> 00:39:58.390
against the king,
which were the radical part of the document at the time.

619
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:04.150
And since this document was intended possibly to be a declaration for foreign

620
00:40:04.151 --> 00:40:06.970
audiences as well as domestic audiences,

621
00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:10.450
it was important that that preamble be a statement,

622
00:40:10.451 --> 00:40:15.451
a broad sweeping statement of epic proportions to inspire people to support the

623
00:40:16.031 --> 00:40:20.000
cause,
the committee's draft.
Ultimately,

624
00:40:20.001 --> 00:40:25.001
it was presented to Congress on June 28th and then debating and editing began on

625
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:28.930
July 1st.
Um,

626
00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.980
some of the changes had to do with specific word choices.
So for example,

627
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:37.360
was the king really guilty of quote unremitting injuries?

628
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.320
Congress preferred repeated injuries.
Yeah.

629
00:40:41.321 --> 00:40:44.680
That was the level of editing taking place in the declaration.
Um,

630
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:48.280
so they thought,
well repeated as a little less extreme than unremitting.

631
00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:50.290
That word gets changed.

632
00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.800
Not all of the changes were intended to tame the document.

633
00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:58.750
Sometimes Congress made some of Jefferson's charges more extreme as when they

634
00:40:58.751 --> 00:41:03.550
added to Jefferson statement about foreign mercenaries.
Words that described it,

635
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:08.560
the act of sending them to the colonies as quote scarcely paralleled in the most

636
00:41:08.561 --> 00:41:12.130
barbarous ages.
And then as I mentioned before,

637
00:41:12.131 --> 00:41:16.150
they struck the entire passage on slavery for this.

638
00:41:16.151 --> 00:41:19.090
For many southern delegates,
pretty much it was a deal breaker.

639
00:41:19.091 --> 00:41:22.570
And as happens so often in this period will certainly come up with it.
Again,

640
00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:26.770
I think towards the end of this course,
the issue of slavery comes up.

641
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.130
It can't be dealt with.
People don't know how to deal with it,

642
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.890
particularly the southerners,
and it keeps getting shunted to the side.

643
00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:37.460
And so in a sense that's what happens here.
Um,
I'm going to stop at this point.

644
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.630
Um,
and I will start with a story that should be here,

645
00:41:41.631 --> 00:41:45.290
but I can't tell it here and I want to do it justice about Jefferson's response

646
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.600
to the editing of his precious draft.

647
00:41:47.601 --> 00:41:50.570
He was not a happy camper at the editing of the declaration of independence.

648
00:41:50.571 --> 00:41:54.470
And then I will move on,
uh,
to really discussing organizing a war.
