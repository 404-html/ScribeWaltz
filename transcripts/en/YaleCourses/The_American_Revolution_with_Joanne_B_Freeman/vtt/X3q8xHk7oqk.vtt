1
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.660
Coming into the home stretch,
like we're moving towards the constitution.

2
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:11.340
It's kind of amazing,
kind of weird.
Um,
and so as a matter of fact,

3
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:15.400
that's what we're going to be doing a with today's lecture,
um,

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.350
which is going to get us on the road to the federal convention.

5
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.580
I'm now just quick review before we plunged down the road.

6
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.080
I'm on Thursday,
uh,
as I hope you all remember,

7
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.370
I talked about some of the problems of the articles of confederation and I

8
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:37.371
talked about things that caused confusion or complications like boundaries

9
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.420
between states,
talked about Vermont,
talked about the state of Franklin,

10
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.440
um,

11
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.150
talked about Shay's rebellion towards the end of the lecture and throughout that

12
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:53.151
lecture from time to time I talked about some people who were strong advocates

13
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.400
for a stronger central government for the confederation.

14
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:01.110
And I mentioned a few names in passing.

15
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.520
I think I mentioned James Madison and I mentioned Alexander Hamilton and I

16
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:08.130
mentioned George Washington.
Obviously there are others.

17
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:12.180
Those are just three big name contenders.
There are others though.

18
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:14.820
At first we're not talking about a massive group of people here.

19
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:19.620
We're talking about a select group of people who really believe that there has

20
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.810
to be a stronger national government.

21
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.670
Now these men saw a host of problems with the articles of confederation.

22
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.590
I mentioned some of them on Thursday.
Um,

23
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.030
one of them you'll actually see a couple of times in the course of today's

24
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.240
lecture.
So these nationalists,

25
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:39.120
they saw problems with things like currency,

26
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.400
congressional indecision,

27
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.880
the fact that Congress was powerless to enforce things,

28
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.240
obviously boundary complications between states and a host of other problems

29
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.220
that at least to them signal the really obvious need for some kind of wide

30
00:01:56.221 --> 00:02:00.390
ranging national political reform that would put more power at the center.

31
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.340
And for years and years and years,

32
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:07.341
these people kept calling for some kind of a national convention to reform the

33
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:11.670
government.
Now,
as I mentioned just a minute ago,

34
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:13.650
and I said it's sort of a select group.
Um,

35
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.580
it's important to note that this drive for a stronger national government was

36
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:20.820
not initially widespread.
And as a matter of fact,

37
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.470
there were any number of reasons for people really to fear the idea of

38
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:27.330
strengthening the national government.

39
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.920
And you're going to get a sense of some of these reasons next week when you look

40
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:33.840
at some of the federalist essays,

41
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.220
because part of what the federalist essays are doing is explaining and promoting

42
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.700
the new constitution,
or hopefully what will be the new constitution.

43
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.330
But the other thing that the federalist essays are doing is they're actually

44
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.390
trying to calm people's fears down.
Like,
okay,

45
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:51.840
you think that if you approve of this new constitution,

46
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.550
horrible things will happen,

47
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.520
but here's yet another way in which horrible things won't happen.

48
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.700
So you'll see that kind of as a running sub theme in the federalist essays too.

49
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:05.380
When you read them next week.
And as I suggested in the lecture,

50
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.960
I think on Thursday's lecture,
um,

51
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.430
obviously after he fought a revolution against what you perceive to be as a

52
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:16.270
tyrannical centralized power,
right?
The British monarchy,

53
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.490
it would make perfect sense in general to be a little worried about centralized

54
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:22.324
power.

55
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.540
Plus many people assumed that America was just bound to drift back into hid what

56
00:03:29.931 --> 00:03:31.330
it had been before.

57
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:36.331
This fear goes actually even into the 1790s people assumed that because people

58
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:38.800
in America,
we're so used to one way of things.

59
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:41.560
It was a kind of a nifty little experiment they were undertaking now,

60
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.500
but as a matter of fact,
over time when push came to shove,

61
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:46.750
everything would sort of drift back to where it had been.

62
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:50.170
So the assumption is waiting out there in the wings somewhere,

63
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.910
there's an aristocracy it's going to leap up and take over as soon as they have

64
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:56.590
an opportunity and then suddenly poof,

65
00:03:56.591 --> 00:04:00.040
we'll have an aristocracy and maybe a monarchy and everything will go back to

66
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:01.300
the way it was before.

67
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.310
So it makes sense that people were nervous about centralized power and it makes

68
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:10.000
sense that the states would be nervous too about centralized power because

69
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:14.920
they'd be nervous about giving up power to whatever this stronger centralized

70
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.800
government was going to be.
So what,

71
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.210
what today's lecture is going to do is look at how things evolved over the

72
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:26.620
course of just a few years.
So that by 1787,

73
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:28.030
which is where we're going to be on Thursday,

74
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.420
there actually was a call for a national convention to reform or amend the

75
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:39.931
government and then ultimately the new nation really did end up strengthening

76
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.440
the national government significantly,
which is all in all pretty remarkable.

77
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.110
When you think about some of what I've just been talking about,

78
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.860
it is pretty remarkable that there was that much change over in the end.

79
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:55.480
What isn't that huge expanse of time.
And as you'll see,

80
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.270
part of what's important to think about,
and I'll,

81
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:01.370
I'll mention it a couple times in the course of today's lecture,
um,

82
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.690
is the way in which America found its way into strengthening the government.

83
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.800
Because as you're going to see,

84
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:13.370
there's a series of individual events or individual meetings,
um,

85
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.380
none of them really focused on centralizing,

86
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.880
strengthening the central national government.
Although over time,

87
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:25.480
each one of these decisions as you're going to see today pushed things in that

88
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:27.580
direction.
So in a sense,

89
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.050
what you're going to see in today's lecture particularly is how the new nation

90
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.490
backed its way into a stronger central government.

91
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.210
One decision at a time.
They didn't leap into a new stronger government.

92
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:45.211
They backed their way in aided of course by some really strong nationalists in

93
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:49.660
the background trying to push things in that direction like Madison,
Hamilton,

94
00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:52.960
Washington,
and the other crew of really from nationalists.

95
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.710
So basically that's kind of the sub theme or one of them,

96
00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:58.670
at least of today's lecture.

97
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.540
It's how the new nation backed its way into a new,

98
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:06.140
stronger central government.
One decision at a time.

99
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.670
And in a sense it shouldn't be surprising that one of the main issues that

100
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:17.270
pushed this series of events into operation was commerce.

101
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:21.080
The question of commerce with 13 different states,

102
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.860
each with its own its own arrangements of commerce,

103
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.810
they were bound to be complications.
And obviously commerce is a big deal,

104
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:34.160
right?
Commerce matters,
commerce has prosperity,
commerce is livelihoods,

105
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.270
commerce is going to make or break individual states and make or break the new

106
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.133
nation.

107
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.060
If you think back to the revolution and think back to some of the things that

108
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:45.230
people were upset about,
again,

109
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:48.860
you're going to realize commerce is underlying a lot of what we're talking about

110
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:52.910
here,
right?
Rights are intermingled with these thoughts about commerce,

111
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:57.350
but we talked about taxation,
direct taxes,
imports,

112
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.580
exports,
shipping,

113
00:06:58.581 --> 00:07:03.581
all of these kinds of things and more were among the many central components

114
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:06.020
that we're also helping to fuel the revolution.

115
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.020
So it shouldn't be a really big surprise that they continue to play a major role

116
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.310
in the development of the new nation.

117
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.960
And so what we're going to see in today's lecture is that the strong

118
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:23.030
nationalists pushing for a stronger national government would find that problems

119
00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:23.864
of commerce,

120
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.880
sometimes open little doors of opportunity for political reform in ways that

121
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.030
might not have been expected.
Okay.
So that's what I want to do.

122
00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:35.990
I want to sort of show the little process of reform or the process of change

123
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:37.070
over time and action.

124
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.790
And one major moment of opportunity that I'm going to start by talking about

125
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:48.221
here for these nationalists took place in 1785 because of a local complication

126
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:54.440
between Virginia and Maryland about navigating the Potomac river.

127
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.700
Okay.
So this is uh,
it's local and it also has to do with shipping.
Again,

128
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:03.410
more commerce.
So in response to this question,
v,

129
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:08.470
both Virginia and Maryland named commissioners to meet in Alexandria,

130
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:12.770
Virginia to discuss the issue and work out some kind of a policy.

131
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.800
So it doesn't seem necessarily like a really big deal.

132
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.570
There were a total of seven men named to be at this meeting.

133
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:23.720
There were three from Maryland,
there were four from Virginia,

134
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:27.950
including James Madison.
Unfortunately,
Virginia,

135
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:31.550
Governor Patrick Henry,
somehow or other managed to fumble something.

136
00:08:31.551 --> 00:08:36.551
So he basically didn't tell the four Virginia delegates when the meeting was

137
00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:39.320
happening and where the meeting was happening.

138
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.650
It's one of those administrative mistakes that you don't realize when you make

139
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:46.970
it,
it will be remembered forever.
Sorry,
Governor Henry.
But you goofed.

140
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.570
So the Virginia delegation is never told about where or when the meeting is.

141
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:55.690
The Maryland delegates arrive in Alexandria and find nobody waiting them.

142
00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.420
Like where here and ultimately to Virginia delegates,

143
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:03.860
the ones who live closest to Alexandria managed to make their way there.

144
00:09:03.861 --> 00:09:06.120
As soon as they found out they were supposed to be there,

145
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.030
Madison was not one of the people who ended up being there.

146
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.130
So now you have five people,

147
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.080
three from Maryland to from Virginia meeting in Alexandria and now they begin

148
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:19.950
talking about the problem and maybe entering into some kind of negotiations.

149
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.163
Now.
Meanwhile,

150
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.500
George Washington knew about this conference and given that Mount Vernon is not

151
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.940
that far away,
just down the road from the town of Alexandria,

152
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.040
he invited the commissioners out to mount Vernon to meet there.

153
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.050
Now Washington wasn't just being hospitable.

154
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.160
He actually had a really keen interest in having a canal built on the Potomac,

155
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:55.320
partly to promote its use and hopefully thus to make Alexandria and important

156
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:59.100
link to the West.
And that's the big center of shipping in the United States.

157
00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:02.850
So Washington's thinking about promoting the importance of Alexandria through

158
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:04.260
doing something with the Potomac.

159
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.060
And he had been interested in this idea of building a canal for a while and he

160
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:13.590
had met with engineers and he had served in various committees and this was

161
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:17.400
really something that he felt very strongly about enough so that apparently

162
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.840
during a certain period of time,

163
00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:23.220
anyone who went to visit him at Mount Vernon ended up just getting talked to

164
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:26.610
about canals.
Right?
You just knew in that phase of Washington's life,

165
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.670
if you visit him at Mount Vernon,
you're going to hear about canals,

166
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.260
so as one visitor to mount Vernon and put it at the time hearing little else for

167
00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:38.880
two days,
I confess,
completely infected me with canal mania.

168
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.880
So Washington is suffering from canal mania too.

169
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.440
So he invites these commissioners to meet at his home at Mount Vernon,

170
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.660
knowing that are he can wine and dine them and hopefully encourage some kind of

171
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:55.350
compromise and maybe even promote the development of the Potomac.

172
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.990
The meeting at Mount Vernon was ultimately known as logically enough.

173
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.600
The Mount Vernon conference.
Surprise,
surprise.

174
00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:06.540
It should be an easy one to remember.
The Mount Vernon conference.

175
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:11.010
It took place on March 25th,

176
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.530
1785 and continued for three days.

177
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.220
Mount Vernon conference March 25th,

178
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.080
1785 in the end,

179
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:24.390
the Malvern conference not only settled some matters of navigation,

180
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.980
but it also dealt with things like customs duties between the two states,

181
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:34.340
trade regulations between the two states and made recommendations about somehow

182
00:11:34.681 --> 00:11:38.640
or other coordinating one states currency with the other states currency.

183
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.720
And the delegates also recommended that they meet annually to keep channels of

184
00:11:46.141 --> 00:11:48.210
cooperation and communication open.

185
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.330
There's the key to not running conference,

186
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.590
let's meet annually to talk about this.

187
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.090
So although it wasn't intended to set any kind of a precedent,

188
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.930
that conference ends up being a step in the direction of some kind of regular

189
00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:09.331
interstate cooperation apart from the Confederation Congress.

190
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.660
It's not just a local conference about the Potomac in two states.

191
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.570
Now it's proposing some kind of long term,

192
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:19.900
something in which two states get together and sort of figure out how to

193
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:21.670
cooperate amongst themselves.

194
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.530
And a little side note that actually won't really play a role in today's
lecture,

195
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:30.490
but it'll sort of echo something in Thursday's lecture.
Um,

196
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.661
in a sense,

197
00:12:31.661 --> 00:12:36.160
the Mount Vernon conference ended up kind of violating Virginia's instructions

198
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.970
to its commissioners because the Virginia assembly and appointing the

199
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:43.420
commissioners had said,
okay,
so for you to approve of something,

200
00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:47.260
three out of the four of you have to approve of it.
Right.

201
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:49.570
But only two guys actually showed up.

202
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.720
So even though the two guys were there and voted and things happened,

203
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:57.490
three out of four of them didn't vote on anything.
Right.
So officially,

204
00:12:57.491 --> 00:12:58.510
formally speaking,

205
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.710
they weren't abiding by the mandate that they had gotten from their home state.

206
00:13:02.711 --> 00:13:05.830
And I only mentioned this now because this will echo with some of the things

207
00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:08.650
that happened in conjunction with the Federal Convention,

208
00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:12.220
the Constitutional Convention on Thursday too.
Okay.

209
00:13:12.221 --> 00:13:17.221
So let's pause here for a minute just to note how these people back their way

210
00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:19.480
into this agreement.

211
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.170
Because the Malvern and conference didn't consist of five really ardent

212
00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:27.130
nationalists just trying to find a sneaky way to do something that'll push

213
00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:31.030
people towards being more organized in a centralized way.

214
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.900
The conference wasn't branded as anything other than a meeting for commissioners

215
00:13:34.901 --> 00:13:37.420
from Maryland and Virginia to discuss navigation.

216
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.160
That led into a conversation about interstate trade that led into a decision to

217
00:13:42.161 --> 00:13:47.080
maybe meet regularly and talk about this more broadly.
So in a sense,

218
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.210
what's begins this chain of events,

219
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:54.310
somewhat significant interstate agreement is kind of unintentional.

220
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.010
It's something really practical that gets it going.

221
00:13:57.011 --> 00:13:58.540
We've seen this a lot in this course,
right?

222
00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:01.840
It's something very practical that moves people to take action and then there

223
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:06.010
are really interesting outcomes from that response to something.

224
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:09.220
So I'm really practical need and as we'll see,

225
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.400
given all of the fears about centralized power,

226
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:17.430
in some ways it's this kind of informal indirect way of proceeding that's maybe

227
00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:23.641
the best way for people to move towards centralizing or to move towards giving a

228
00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:27.400
central government more power.
I'm going to see that again and again today.

229
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:32.530
Okay.
So it's informal,
it's indirect in a sense.

230
00:14:32.531 --> 00:14:37.531
But the Mount Vernon conference did have the support of some eager nationalists.

231
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.590
So certainly James Madison was in favor of it even though he didn't make it,

232
00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:44.950
but he was in favor of it.
Should have been there.
Um,

233
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.140
and of course George Washington is the host,

234
00:14:47.141 --> 00:14:50.590
so yet another strong nationalist who is clearly in favor of it.

235
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:55.760
Both men certainly would've done their best to usher the agreement through the

236
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:57.050
Virginia legislature.

237
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.980
It also passed the Maryland legislature legislature as well.

238
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.940
Even more significant Maryland proposed bringing Delaware in the next time they

239
00:15:08.181 --> 00:15:11.330
met inviting them to attend the next year's meeting.

240
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.230
And the commissioners themselves when they were at Mount Vernon,

241
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:20.120
they thought maybe they should invite Pennsylvania to,
okay.

242
00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:25.121
So now we potentially have four states maybe agreeing to meet every year to talk

243
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:29.030
about interstate trade matters.
Now,

244
00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:34.031
James Madison thinking nationally hoped that the Virginia legislature would

245
00:15:35.091 --> 00:15:39.950
agree to submit this agreement to the Confederation Congress and then maybe all

246
00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:43.400
of the states would agree to meet in this way every year.

247
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.900
And of course that I did,
it did not happen.
It failed.
Instead,

248
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.680
the Virginia legislature proposed a resolution that calls on the other states to

249
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:59.291
appoint delegates and to deliberately sit back and consider quote the trade of

250
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:04.751
the United States as a group and to propose some kind of an act regarding the

251
00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:10.220
issue that could be sent to the Confederation Congress for passage.

252
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.590
So clearly I missed fears about centralized power at the time.

253
00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:20.210
This is a pretty significant suggestion on the part of the Virginia legislature

254
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:25.870
and it's worth noting that even the mere suggestion of something like this had

255
00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:29.300
to be helped along in its passage by some really careful strategy.

256
00:16:29.301 --> 00:16:32.600
So although Madison really clearly wanted this,

257
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.030
this proposal to go through the legislature,

258
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.240
Madison is not the guy who proposed it because of Madison.

259
00:16:38.241 --> 00:16:40.730
Mr Nationalists stood up and said,
hey,

260
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.300
I really think that we should all meet all the states together and consider the

261
00:16:44.301 --> 00:16:46.310
trade of the United States.
Everyone would've said,
oh,

262
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.810
it's Mr Nationalists speaking.
I'm sorry we don't trust you.
So instead,

263
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.370
another man,
actually John Tyler,
who's the father of a future president,
Tyler,

264
00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.480
um,
no,
he's not particularly known for his nationalist sentiments.

265
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.550
So his motors wouldn't be held suspect.

266
00:17:01.551 --> 00:17:03.440
And he's the guy who actually makes this proposal.

267
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.350
So even just to recommend something along these lines,

268
00:17:06.351 --> 00:17:08.210
people are being very strategic.

269
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:14.150
So ultimately there's a decision to hold a meeting about American trade,

270
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.160
a meaning that supposedly is going to include all of the states it's agreed to

271
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.750
by the Virginia legislature and it's scheduled to meet in Annapolis,

272
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:27.560
Maryland the next year,
September,

273
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.940
1786 okay.
So that's been going on in the south.
We have Virginia,

274
00:17:31.941 --> 00:17:36.350
we have Maryland,
maybe Delaware and Pennsylvania,
but it's not as though none of,

275
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.410
none of this sort of activity or none of these fears had been happening in the

276
00:17:39.411 --> 00:17:43.040
north.
And they had been also involving trade.

277
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.460
So at roughly the same time that all this is going on in the south,

278
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:52.060
the Massachusetts legislature ended up proposing their own resolution to think

279
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:57.480
more broadly about the national government.
Again,
spurred by trade complications,

280
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.180
basically northerners.

281
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:04.470
And then in particular merchants in Boston found themselves affected by British

282
00:18:04.471 --> 00:18:06.960
trade restrictions in some ways that they really didn't like.

283
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.960
And they wanted the confederation Congress to do something about it.

284
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:13.470
And they also realize the Confederation Congress probably didn't have enough

285
00:18:13.471 --> 00:18:18.090
power to do anything about it.
So the Massachusetts legislature,

286
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:20.820
thinking along these lines proposed something more broadly.

287
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.780
So instead of just saying,
well,
let's get together and talk about trade.

288
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.680
The Massachusetts state government asked the Massachusetts delegates in the

289
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.900
Confederation Congress to suggest calling a general convention of all of the

290
00:18:33.901 --> 00:18:38.640
states to revise the articles of confederation as a whole.
Okay.
That's,

291
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.680
that's a big suggestion.
So the Massachusetts legislature basically asks,

292
00:18:43.681 --> 00:18:47.220
it's delegates in the confederation Congress,
Hey,
would you,

293
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.520
here's a proposal for us to call some kind of meeting for all of the states,

294
00:18:50.521 --> 00:18:54.120
just to revise the articles.
Would you present it to the Confederation Congress?

295
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:59.640
And the response of the three Massachusetts delegates in the Confederation

296
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.230
Congress is really interesting because it shows you why it's seemingly took

297
00:19:04.231 --> 00:19:08.970
things happening outside of official channels like the Mount Vernon conference

298
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.360
for there to be broad interest date changes because basically in short,

299
00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:20.250
the Massachusetts delegates responded by just refusing to submit the whole

300
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:22.770
proposal to the Confederation Congress and their,

301
00:19:22.771 --> 00:19:24.360
their written response is really interesting.

302
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.020
I'm going to quote just a couple sentences from it here.
Um,

303
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.810
and this is what the delegates and the Confederation Congress responded to.

304
00:19:30.811 --> 00:19:34.290
The people back in Massachusetts.
Many are of opinion.

305
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:38.460
The states have not yet had experienced sufficient to determine the extent of

306
00:19:38.461 --> 00:19:43.380
powers vested in Congress by the Confederation and therefore that every measure

307
00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:46.710
at this time proposing an alteration is premature.

308
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:52.470
The present confederation with all its inconveniences is preferable to the risk

309
00:19:52.471 --> 00:19:54.900
of general dissensions and animosities,

310
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:59.490
which may approach to anarchy and prepare the way to a ruinous system of

311
00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:00.324
government.

312
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:05.160
And what specifically did these guys think when they said general dissensions

313
00:20:05.161 --> 00:20:09.810
and animosities will impart?
They met the following.
Again,

314
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.640
their words,
we are apprehensive and it is our duty to declare it.

315
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:16.110
That's such a measure.

316
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.250
Reforming the articles would produce throughout the union and exertion of the

317
00:20:20.251 --> 00:20:24.750
friends of an aristocracy to send members who would promote a change of

318
00:20:24.751 --> 00:20:27.870
government.
And we can form some judgment of the plan,

319
00:20:27.871 --> 00:20:31.620
which such members would report to Congress.
Okay.

320
00:20:31.621 --> 00:20:35.100
So essentially the Massachusetts delegates to the Confederation Congress say,
no,

321
00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:39.960
we're not even going to consider this idea of revising the articles because it's

322
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:43.890
going to result in what they call baleful aristocracies,
right?

323
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.030
This is dangerous.
It's opening things up so that it's going to more centralized,

324
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.620
scary.
Aristocratic types are going to take over.
Bad things will happen.
Poof.

325
00:20:51.621 --> 00:20:53.770
Spirit of the revolution all gone.

326
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.080
So here in 1785 we have Maryland,

327
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:04.420
we have Virginia,
we have Pennsylvania,
we have Delaware trying to do something,

328
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.840
centralizing about trade and Massachusetts also suggesting some pretty bold

329
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.660
reform because of problems with trade.

330
00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.460
What was still pending at this time was the meeting that had been scheduled to

331
00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:23.461
meet in Annapolis in September of 1786 now,

332
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:28.890
Madison for one was not overly optimistic about what everyone's going to happen

333
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:33.550
at Annapolis because he basically assumed he probably was smart to assume it.

334
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.930
As soon as you ask all of the states to agree to meet and decide anything,

335
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.900
it's not going to work,
right.
You're just bound to fail.

336
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.320
And indeed he gets to Annapolis and things just don't look too good.

337
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.810
As he wrote to his brother.

338
00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.800
I came to this place a day or two ago where I found two commissioners,

339
00:21:50.801 --> 00:21:53.170
only a few more have since come in.

340
00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:56.560
But the prospect that was efficient number to make the meeting respectable is

341
00:21:56.561 --> 00:21:59.170
not flattering.
And sure enough,

342
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.260
ultimately only five states sent delegates who arrived in time for the meeting.

343
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.390
Even Maryland,

344
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.910
the host state did not send delegates to the Annapolis Convention.

345
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:16.950
And that's a real snub out of fear that it transcended the power of the

346
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:18.101
Confederation Congress.

347
00:22:18.101 --> 00:22:22.480
So the host state wasn't represented at the Annapolis Maryland Convention.

348
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.590
Three other states besides Maryland also chose not to send delegates,

349
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.640
South Carolina,
Georgia and Connecticut.
Yeah,

350
00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:35.530
you can edit it all decided they would not send delegates and then delegates

351
00:22:35.531 --> 00:22:40.150
from some of the states that were at the outer edges of the Union,
Massachusetts,

352
00:22:40.151 --> 00:22:43.730
New Hampshire,
Rhode Island,
North Carolina.
Um,

353
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.880
they arrive too late to take partial,

354
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:49.690
all these people having these sort of weird administrative bad moments.

355
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.860
Sorry guys,

356
00:22:50.861 --> 00:22:54.550
you didn't take place in the historic convention in Annapolis Cause you lift

357
00:22:54.551 --> 00:22:57.400
home late or whatever it is they did.
They didn't plan well.

358
00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.780
So all of those states are not represented at the Annapolis Convention,

359
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.140
but so they had all this fanfare,
all these nationalist or like,
wow,

360
00:23:05.141 --> 00:23:07.390
we really need to meet about this.
They finally get a meeting.

361
00:23:07.391 --> 00:23:12.190
It's scheduled for Annapolis and now it seems like nobody's going to attend.

362
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.920
So it's when Delaware delegate wrote to a friend,

363
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.870
should have of the states fail to participate.
Quote,
how ridiculous.

364
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.850
We'll all this parade appear.

365
00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.900
So there they're getting ready in Annapolis to be mortified after all their

366
00:23:25.901 --> 00:23:28.660
efforts.
Big Deal.
Like nobody cares.

367
00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:33.310
Now before we see what actually transpired in the Annapolis Convention,

368
00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:36.130
I want to have a little,
a little brief James Madison moment.

369
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.080
This is kind of a James Madison lecture and he's going to shine.
Um,

370
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.060
but I want to have a little moment for him here because as you're going to see

371
00:23:43.061 --> 00:23:45.040
throughout the rest of this lecture and also on,

372
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.950
he does a number of really interesting things and ultimately some really

373
00:23:48.951 --> 00:23:49.790
important things.

374
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.350
In 1786 in 1787 all of them in one way or another,

375
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:56.030
bound up with strengthening the government.

376
00:23:56.031 --> 00:24:00.880
And I brought a very sophisticated visual aid.
There we go.

377
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.370
Okay.
So

378
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.060
this is James Madison.

379
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:13.520
I bring this James Madison because graduate student gave us to me years ago.

380
00:24:13.521 --> 00:24:15.050
And what really amuses me about this,

381
00:24:15.051 --> 00:24:18.900
I don't know if you could tell this is a GI Joe Buddy with a Madison head's

382
00:24:18.901 --> 00:24:19.734
stuck on top.

383
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.350
You can't see really because of the lace covering his hands.
His,

384
00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:26.540
he has like the Kung Fu grip thing going,
you know,

385
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.470
like he wants to be holding a gun.
So this is like buff James.

386
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.050
This is a macho Madison.

387
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:38.030
It is the weirdest looking thing with like this little tiny scholarly heads sort

388
00:24:38.031 --> 00:24:42.010
of stuck on top.
This is,
this is my,
my high tech visual aid here.

389
00:24:42.011 --> 00:24:44.420
We'll stick Madison over here.
He actually has a little stove.
What?

390
00:24:44.421 --> 00:24:48.620
He's missing a shoe.
It's a little stand.
So Madison stand,

391
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.890
poor guy.
Just no respect.
He's not even getting respect now in the class,

392
00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:56.870
during his moment he's shoeless.
Okay.
So he was given Madison some love.

393
00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:58.180
Okay.
Um,
I,

394
00:24:58.181 --> 00:25:03.181
I do want to look at what Madison was doing in the month before the Annapolis

395
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.930
Convention because it's actually really interesting.
He does his twice.

396
00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:08.840
He does this for two different summers.
Um,

397
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.910
he's thinks obviously thinking to himself,
okay,

398
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:12.140
I don't know what's coming down the road,

399
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.130
but there might be actual reform happening.
This is very exciting.

400
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:20.000
So I better prepare myself for the possibility of government reform.

401
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.030
So in this summer of 1786,

402
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.650
he basically does a little research project and he decides he's going to study

403
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:31.890
confederacy's of all time,
right?
He's going to look ancient times,

404
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.930
it's going to look modern times.

405
00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:37.931
It's going to look at every confederacy that ever existed and then list in some

406
00:25:38.181 --> 00:25:42.020
way their virtues and their vices.
So in essence,
Madison,

407
00:25:42.021 --> 00:25:46.280
he's going to look over all time and then come up with these rules of

408
00:25:46.281 --> 00:25:49.580
confederacy's,
right?
What works,
what doesn't.

409
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.600
And then hopefully once he figures that out,
somehow or other,

410
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:57.290
maybe it will help him in making suggestions to create or improve the present

411
00:25:57.291 --> 00:25:59.660
one.
Now this is real.

412
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.300
This is like age of reason thinking,

413
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.560
this idea that if you can figure out the patterns of the past,

414
00:26:06.561 --> 00:26:10.340
you can figure out the laws of nature and the way that things are supposed to

415
00:26:10.341 --> 00:26:15.130
work.
And there's a,
there's a great example.
When I was in Grad School,
I guess,
um,

416
00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.050
I read a book that at the time I thought was really fascinating,

417
00:26:18.051 --> 00:26:21.530
which I guess means I'm destined to be a professor of early American history

418
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.600
because I'm the only one who finds it fascinating.

419
00:26:23.601 --> 00:26:27.170
But I thought it was really fascinating.
Um,
it's actually by Adam Smith.

420
00:26:27.171 --> 00:26:28.940
It's called the theory of moral sentiments.

421
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:33.920
And what amazed me about it was it's Adam Smith coming up with a sort of theory

422
00:26:33.921 --> 00:26:38.390
for patterns of human emotion and morality.
So I mean,

423
00:26:38.391 --> 00:26:42.680
that's again,
like age of reason,
thinking,
thinking Adam Smith is like,
okay,

424
00:26:42.681 --> 00:26:46.950
I'm going to come up with a theory of moral sentiments and then presented to you

425
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.260
as to how morality works in human nature.

426
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.890
What I found really interesting about it was just if you're trying to figure out

427
00:26:52.891 --> 00:26:57.540
the mindset of people in the 18th late 18th century,
that book is helpful.

428
00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.960
I mean it may not present the all time tried and true theory,

429
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.690
but it is really interesting.
It says all kinds of sort of quirky,

430
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:06.810
interesting things in there that even if some people felt that way,

431
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.910
that's really interesting.
You don't really,

432
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.670
because another time period is really a different mindset.

433
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:17.270
So the Smith Book is kind of in the same spirit as Madison's efforts to study

434
00:27:17.371 --> 00:27:21.000
all confederacy's and then come up with these amazing patterns.

435
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.230
So he's reading through book after book after book,
he's keeping record,

436
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.860
keeping little notes about various confederations and what he likes and what he

437
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:31.590
doesn't like and what worked and what didn't work.
Really,

438
00:27:31.591 --> 00:27:36.330
really trying to figure out some kind of pattern that's going to help the United

439
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:36.330
States.

440
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:40.380
And supposedly he recorded his notes in a little like a little notebook that was

441
00:27:40.381 --> 00:27:45.381
about 40 pages long that maybe he intended to have with him during debate.

442
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:51.060
Maybe he intended to have it with him as a sort of writing reference.

443
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.910
I love just the whole system and operation of this.
Right.

444
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.330
I will figure it all out and then it will carry it in my pocket.

445
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.040
My knowledge about all confederacy's over time.
Little let me look in.
Yeah,

446
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.480
so this is very Madison,

447
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:07.620
very typical Madison and actually little bits of that end up appearing in the

448
00:28:07.621 --> 00:28:10.830
federalist essay.
So if he was thinking it was going to be a help in his writing,

449
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.821
he was right.

450
00:28:11.821 --> 00:28:16.800
He actually does draw on it and so he looks at all these confederacy's and so

451
00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:20.410
it's not a big surprise.
What is Madison discover?
Well,

452
00:28:20.411 --> 00:28:24.270
basically everywhere he looks,
he's fines,
jealousies,

453
00:28:24.271 --> 00:28:28.140
and animosities between member states of whatever confederacy we're talking

454
00:28:28.141 --> 00:28:31.020
about.
He sees domestic turmoil,

455
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:33.720
he sees international humiliation.

456
00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:37.830
He sees basically week unions are a problem unions.
That's,

457
00:28:37.831 --> 00:28:41.250
that's the lesson he draws from his little survey.

458
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.530
So this is on his mind,
right?

459
00:28:43.531 --> 00:28:48.090
He does this little studying project and then he heads out to Annapolis to join

460
00:28:48.091 --> 00:28:53.091
the convention in September of 1786 only five states represented New York,

461
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:59.430
New Jersey,
Pennsylvania,
Delaware,
and Virginia.
I guess I'll repeat that for you.

462
00:28:59.431 --> 00:29:03.980
In New York,
New Jersey,
Pennsylvania,
Delaware and Virginia.
Um,

463
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.820
a total of 12 delegates.

464
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.240
So we're not talking about massive numbers of people here.
Um,

465
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.200
and logically enough,

466
00:29:10.201 --> 00:29:13.680
he get the 12 guys there from the five states and the first thing they do is

467
00:29:13.681 --> 00:29:17.910
they compare what their home states told them to do.
Okay.

468
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.180
Why did your states and you here,
why did your seats,

469
00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:23.580
when you hear like is there actually anything that we have in common?

470
00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:29.150
What they discovered was it four of the five states had instructions from their

471
00:29:30.091 --> 00:29:34.710
home states confining their attention to just matters of trade.
Right.
Okay.

472
00:29:34.711 --> 00:29:37.710
Go to Annapolis and talk about trade period.

473
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.200
But we're going to have a New Jersey moment.
Is there,

474
00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:44.080
there are New Jersey people.
Oh,
we got New Jersey people.
Yes.
Okay.

475
00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:48.490
It's a New Jersey is shining New Jersey moment.
So four of the five,
it just says,

476
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:50.980
Joe's considered trade New Jersey.

477
00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:56.730
New Jersey has three magical words in their instructions from home and the New

478
00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:58.960
Jersey instructions say,
yeah,
go ahead.

479
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.760
Consider trade and quote other important matters.

480
00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:08.470
Okay.
That's the only opening they needed.
It's like,
Oh,
other important matters.

481
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.340
And that case we can think more broadly than trade,
right?

482
00:30:12.341 --> 00:30:15.970
So New Jersey has the little tiny key that lets these people meeting in

483
00:30:15.971 --> 00:30:20.350
Annapolis at least think about moving beyond just talking about trade.

484
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:25.540
They talk for three days about whether they should really proceed along any line

485
00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:28.240
because of the magical three words and then a jersey instructions.

486
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:29.920
They finally decide that yes,

487
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:34.930
they will take advantage of that little opening to talk about other important

488
00:30:34.931 --> 00:30:38.800
matters.
So they prepared and address to their own state,
to,

489
00:30:38.801 --> 00:30:42.370
to all the other states that had decided not to come or that hadn't made it on

490
00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:46.510
time,
that are rushing somewhere from North Carolina.
Um,

491
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.060
and the address was prepared by Alexander Hamilton,

492
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.630
obviously yet another one of these strong nationalists.
He's trying,

493
00:30:52.631 --> 00:30:55.930
I think as early as 1780 we needed a stronger government.

494
00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:58.030
So Hamilton's address,

495
00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:03.450
ask the states to name delegates to meet in Philadelphia the following year to

496
00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:04.391
quote,

497
00:31:04.391 --> 00:31:09.391
take into consideration the situation of the United States to device such

498
00:31:10.181 --> 00:31:15.181
further provisions as shall appear to them necessary to render the constitution

499
00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:19.720
of the federal government adequate to the exit exigencies of the Union.

500
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.920
Okay,

501
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.920
so basically we need to meet and just think more broadly about the government is

502
00:31:27.071 --> 00:31:31.060
what Hamilton's proposal says.
Now again,

503
00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:35.610
look at how almost accidental what we're looking at here is right this

504
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:40.620
significant proposal to alter the articles with only a handful of men present at

505
00:31:40.961 --> 00:31:44.800
Annapolis.
This suggestion almost is more a matter of desperation like,

506
00:31:44.801 --> 00:31:47.530
well we have to come out of this with something thanks to New Jersey,

507
00:31:47.531 --> 00:31:48.970
we can do something.

508
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.600
So here let's make the proposal and send it out and see what happens.

509
00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:58.840
And this bold move is grounded on three words in the New Jersey instructions.

510
00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:00.400
Again,

511
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:05.400
it's all of these sort of out of formal channels or informal ways in which

512
00:32:05.621 --> 00:32:09.340
people are promoting some kind of more centralizing agenda.

513
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:14.350
So once the move is taken,
they send this out,
the address is sent out.

514
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:19.440
Nationalists like Hamilton and Madison and others throughout the states take

515
00:32:20.231 --> 00:32:24.280
full advantage of it and really push so that something will come of this.

516
00:32:24.281 --> 00:32:27.250
There'll be some kind of an attempt to actually strengthen the national

517
00:32:27.251 --> 00:32:29.410
government in eight states,

518
00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:34.690
nationalists managed to get their state legislatures to pass resolutions

519
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:40.140
suggesting precisely the kind of broad agenda for a that the Annapolis people

520
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:42.530
wanted.
So eight states are like,
yeah,
okay,

521
00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.130
we could get behind a conference to reconsider the government,

522
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:51.410
which brings us to Shay's rebellion momentarily because in a really handy stroke

523
00:32:51.411 --> 00:32:52.244
of timing,

524
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:55.430
Shay's rebellion happens right in the middle of what we're talking about right

525
00:32:55.431 --> 00:32:56.630
now.
Right?
So they're like,
well,

526
00:32:56.631 --> 00:33:00.470
let's push to try and make the government stronger.
Oh,
Shay's rebellion.
Right?

527
00:33:00.471 --> 00:33:05.120
So the nationalists are like,
we hate this,
but yes,
it's like,
this is really bad.

528
00:33:05.121 --> 00:33:07.040
But wow,
is this a handy PR tool?

529
00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.710
Because now they can point to Shay's rebellion and say,
look,

530
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.370
we're collapsing into chaos.
Wow.

531
00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:16.430
Do we need a stronger national government?
So the timing of it,

532
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:19.400
if you're a guy who really wants a stronger national government in this period

533
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.530
was a good stroke of fortune.
So again,

534
00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.030
as we're looking at ultimately what's going to become the constitutional

535
00:33:29.031 --> 00:33:33.620
convention or the Federal Convention,
you can see here some of the pat,

536
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:37.610
the problems of having a central government with such diffuse powers.

537
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:41.630
Because even now someone says,
well,
let's strengthen the government.

538
00:33:41.631 --> 00:33:44.750
And then Congress takes a long time to think about the possibility of

539
00:33:44.751 --> 00:33:46.550
strengthening the government.
Surprise,
surprise.

540
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:51.790
So the committee is appointed to consider this idea in October of 1786 and in

541
00:33:53.721 --> 00:33:58.721
February of 1787 the committee finally issues a report and the report says,

542
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:04.730
wow,
revising the articles maybe,
right?
None of this.
Like let's review everything.

543
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.080
Revising the articles.
Okay,
maybe we can go along with that.

544
00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:11.960
And the states should name delegates to attend a conference,

545
00:34:11.961 --> 00:34:14.660
to just improve the articles,

546
00:34:14.661 --> 00:34:17.090
not to just evaluate the needs of the union.

547
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:23.210
So for states ultimately follow that formula,
right?

548
00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.970
They say,
okay,
only revise other states.

549
00:34:25.971 --> 00:34:28.850
Follow the Annapolis Annapolis formula and say,
well,
okay,

550
00:34:28.851 --> 00:34:33.560
let's actually reconsider the government.
So the meaning of Philadelphia,

551
00:34:33.561 --> 00:34:37.760
what ends up being in the constitutional convention starts out with a confused,

552
00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:42.710
contradictory mandate because there's no general agreement about number one,

553
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.590
what the meaning is really supposed to accomplish.
And number two,

554
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:47.810
how it's even supposed to be planned.

555
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.100
So eight states get the call from Annapolis and respond.

556
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:55.010
The other states are a number of the other states.

557
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:58.370
Wait until the confederation Congress says something and then they respond to

558
00:34:58.371 --> 00:35:00.080
the confederation Congress instead.

559
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:05.210
So I radically in a meeting that's supposed to repair shortcomings of the

560
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:05.570
Confederation Congress,

561
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:10.340
that meeting itself as being complicated by shortcomings of the Confederation

562
00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:10.851
Congress.
You can,

563
00:35:10.851 --> 00:35:15.851
you can see how it's very hard to do anything in a really national manner with

564
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:17.750
all of the states.

565
00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:22.250
So obviously the nationals are really hoping things are going to follow the

566
00:35:22.251 --> 00:35:26.030
Annapolis formula as Washington,
put it,
revising the,

567
00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:27.320
not just revising the articles,

568
00:35:27.321 --> 00:35:32.090
but probing the defects of the constitution to the bottom and providing radical

569
00:35:32.091 --> 00:35:35.550
cures.
So that's what the nationalists want.
Um,

570
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.280
as we're going to see on Thursday,

571
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:42.030
strong nationalists were really active in the months before the convention

572
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.210
planning.
And preparing to push forward their agenda.

573
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:49.360
And here we have James Madison,
James Madison,
she was James Madison,

574
00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:53.370
where to shoe go.
She loves to use that as a moment number two,
but we'll see.

575
00:35:53.371 --> 00:35:56.880
I guess it makes professors happy because he's like studying all by himself.

576
00:35:56.881 --> 00:35:58.500
Like I'll do a summer study project,

577
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:02.090
but he's a scholarly founders scholar's life,
James Madison.
Um,

578
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:04.290
so scholarly project number two,

579
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:08.700
he decides it now just like before he was looking for virtues and vices of

580
00:36:08.701 --> 00:36:10.050
confederacy's over time.

581
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.820
Now he's going to look at vices in the American confederacy and he actually

582
00:36:14.821 --> 00:36:19.170
titles this document vices of the political system of the EU states or the

583
00:36:19.171 --> 00:36:20.130
United States.

584
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.330
So he again comes up with a list of vices,

585
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:29.390
problems in the American system and he lists things like states trespassing on

586
00:36:29.941 --> 00:36:34.770
each other's rights,
like a lack of unity between states,

587
00:36:34.771 --> 00:36:37.290
even when unity is desperately required,

588
00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:43.370
like the fact that states can encroach on federal authority without any

589
00:36:43.771 --> 00:36:48.270
repercussions.
States violate treaties and again,

590
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.130
who's going to do anything about it.

591
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:54.840
So he's making a list of all these devices and some of them again ultimately

592
00:36:54.841 --> 00:36:59.250
ended up being talked about in the essays that he contributes to the federalist.

593
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:06.080
So Madison basically it has this long term study project in preparation for what

594
00:37:06.121 --> 00:37:09.120
comes to be known as the constitutional convention.

595
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.490
As we'll talk about on Thursday,

596
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:15.330
he also arrives in addition to all of us studying with a draft plan of

597
00:37:15.331 --> 00:37:15.811
government.

598
00:37:15.811 --> 00:37:19.590
So in case he hasn't done enough now I will arrive with the draft plan of

599
00:37:19.591 --> 00:37:20.940
government.
Um,

600
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:25.080
and we will talk more about what his plan suggest for an entirely new

601
00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:28.530
constitution on Thursday.
I'm in the,

602
00:37:28.531 --> 00:37:33.531
the last bit of the course of the today's class.

603
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:35.310
I want to mention one other thing.

604
00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.740
I think just cause I don't think I'm going to have time to talk about it on

605
00:37:37.741 --> 00:37:38.131
Thursday,

606
00:37:38.131 --> 00:37:41.280
but I don't want to go without mentioning it because it's yet another one of

607
00:37:41.281 --> 00:37:42.330
this sort of weird,

608
00:37:42.331 --> 00:37:45.840
interesting things at Madison does associated with the constitutional
convention.

609
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:50.930
And it'll have more meaning after Thursday's lecture.
But I'll mention it now.
Um,

610
00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:54.960
and some of you may already know this because you may have used this in papers

611
00:37:54.961 --> 00:37:59.430
or things for classes,
but Madison took notes and he didn't just take notes.

612
00:37:59.431 --> 00:38:01.020
I mean,
he really took notes.

613
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:05.100
He noted almost all of the proceedings of the convention,

614
00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:09.600
of all of the delegates.
He ended up taking the most careful,

615
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.100
the most consistent,
not quite minute by minute,
not quite comprehensive,

616
00:38:14.101 --> 00:38:18.870
but really thorough notes of what went on at that convention of what people
said,

617
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.020
of how they argued about what they argued about,
about what was done.

618
00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.120
And he has notes are really amazing.
They're published,

619
00:38:24.121 --> 00:38:26.970
they're easy to find there.
Even on the Internet.
Um,

620
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:30.360
the library of Congress has,

621
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.300
I think they're called foreigns notes of debate or something.
Um,

622
00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:37.060
but there you can see Madison's notes,
you can read Madison's notes.

623
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.010
He actually invented some kind of a little shorthand.

624
00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:41.080
So during the day with a little shorthand,

625
00:38:41.081 --> 00:38:42.730
he was copying down everything that people said.

626
00:38:42.731 --> 00:38:47.170
And then at night he was transposing that back into real writing.
And again,

627
00:38:47.171 --> 00:38:51.790
this was like his project of the constitutional convention and his notes,

628
00:38:51.791 --> 00:38:53.380
I mean they're published and they're easy to find,

629
00:38:53.381 --> 00:38:58.381
but the fact is his actual notes are at the library of Congress and you're a

630
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.930
million a million years ago.
I'm not going to say how many years ago,

631
00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.530
many years ago.
Um,
I worked at the library of Congress,
um,

632
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.630
and I worked on exhibits at the Library of Congress,
you know,

633
00:39:07.631 --> 00:39:09.490
like museum exhibits curating them.

634
00:39:09.491 --> 00:39:13.360
And the library of Congress is an amazing place to do that because you know,

635
00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.810
how much fun is it to be able to pick stuff from the library of Congress to put

636
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:19.300
in exhibits.
They have everything,
they have amazing stuff.

637
00:39:19.301 --> 00:39:23.500
They have the contents of Abraham Lincoln's pockets on the night he died,

638
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:28.060
you know,
they have like drafts of the Gettysburg address and the declaration of

639
00:39:28.061 --> 00:39:30.520
independence.
It's just amazing,
amazing stuff.

640
00:39:30.521 --> 00:39:35.170
I remember one exhibit I worked on on the bicentennial of Congress,

641
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:40.060
we have like a little room where we were stacking stuff for the exhibit and it

642
00:39:40.061 --> 00:39:44.230
was like,
Whoa,
let's a space instruments from the first voyage and just space.

643
00:39:44.231 --> 00:39:48.500
And a draft of the Gettysburg address and here's what you was like,
aw.

644
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:52.450
Like waves of history emanating out of the room.
So,

645
00:39:52.451 --> 00:39:57.451
so they have Madison's notes there and the library,

646
00:39:57.581 --> 00:39:59.620
I don't know if at the same thing exists now,

647
00:39:59.621 --> 00:40:02.840
but I know that a million years ago when I worked at the library,
um,

648
00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.330
they have like the top treasures,

649
00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:07.480
I think it was the top 12 treasures of the library of Congress and they kept

650
00:40:07.481 --> 00:40:12.250
them in a vault and it was like,
um,
like Gutenberg Bible,

651
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:17.200
um,
Madison's notes,
uh,
Jefferson's draft of the declaration.

652
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:21.810
Um,
what else?
George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights.

653
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:26.560
I'm just like,
oh,
sort of objects in this vault,

654
00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.090
in the library of Congress.

655
00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:32.050
And supposedly when these items come out of the vault,

656
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.780
they're supposed to be accompanied by an armed guard.
Okay.

657
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:39.820
Which I thought it was like a rule,
but like,
Haha,
shore,
you know,
armed guard.

658
00:40:39.821 --> 00:40:41.800
Like,
okay,
high security.
But Lo and behold,

659
00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:45.760
when I wanted to get some of George Mason's notes to put in the exhibit,

660
00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.340
there was a guy with a gun walking next to me.

661
00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:52.600
I was like George Mason Predicting George Mason from,

662
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.300
I don't know who gonna come running down the hall,
the Library of Congress.

663
00:40:55.301 --> 00:40:57.960
But anyway,
they really meant it with the armed guard.
But,

664
00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:02.020
but so far for that same exhibit,
I got to look through Madison's notes.

665
00:41:02.021 --> 00:41:05.560
I got to pick a page from Madison's notes to put in the exhibit.

666
00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:09.220
And it's just amazing to see them because,
okay,

667
00:41:09.221 --> 00:41:11.640
there are the notes from the moment.
So there's the guy,
you know,

668
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:15.730
basically recording how the constitution is being created.
And Madison,
um,

669
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:18.760
it's I to say something,
which this doesn't illustrate.

670
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:23.800
He's actually a little guy.
He's not GI Joe.

671
00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.550
Um,
he,
he's a small man,
you know,
he quiet man,

672
00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:29.170
sort of bookish kind of a guy.

673
00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:34.300
So he has this little tiny bookish,
perfect meticulous handwriting.

674
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.200
Like his handwriting looks just like you think James Madison's handwriting ought

675
00:41:37.201 --> 00:41:41.110
to be.
You know,
you look at it and you're like,
that must be James Madison.
Um,

676
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.840
and so there,

677
00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.050
there's like this box of these little slips of paper with these little

678
00:41:45.051 --> 00:41:49.550
meticulous Madison notes of what he saw at the Federal Convention for some

679
00:41:49.551 --> 00:41:50.540
magical reason.

680
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.680
I think it was long enough ago that nobody will get fired by my saying is there

681
00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:59.840
was like no guard.
They just like left me with a box.
So I was sort of like,

682
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:04.220
oh,
you know,
Madison's notes.
This is so exciting.
It's like,
yeah,

683
00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:08.240
I think it'll take me an hour to find a page so that I can weave through and see

684
00:42:08.241 --> 00:42:12.230
everything that's kind of an amazing artifact.
Um,
and the fact of matter is,

685
00:42:12.231 --> 00:42:17.120
you know,
Madison was doing that for a very specific reason.
I mean,
Madison,

686
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:20.210
this whole generation tends to think about posterity.

687
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:23.620
I'll talk about that a little bit in the last lecture as well.
But they're,

688
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:25.430
they're very posterity minded.

689
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:29.900
So part of the reason why Madison goes through all of this trouble to record

690
00:42:29.901 --> 00:42:31.460
what's going on at the convention,

691
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.590
although I think he actually doesn't record jokes.

692
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.530
I think some other people's notes now that I'm thinking about it,

693
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:39.070
some other people's notes.
Yes,
it Madison did nothing.

694
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:43.230
Constitution making was funny.
There'll be no jokes and Madison's notes,

695
00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.290
they're pretty sad jokes.
I mean,
18th century jokes often are not like,
ha ha.

696
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:51.740
You know,
it's like,
it's kind of sad.

697
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.660
There's a,
there's a,
um,

698
00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:56.960
there's a book called something like George Washington laughing,

699
00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.160
but it's George Washington laughing at other people's jokes because I guess he

700
00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:02.630
didn't tell them anyway.

701
00:43:02.631 --> 00:43:06.630
So I think Madison expunge the humor out of the whole situation,
but,

702
00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.830
but he's thinking about posterity,
not necessarily by taking out the jokes,

703
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:13.340
but he's really thinking about the fact that somewhere down the road,

704
00:43:13.341 --> 00:43:17.660
if this actually works at this constitution actually survives and actually

705
00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:19.940
functions,
it's going to be this amazing thing.

706
00:43:19.941 --> 00:43:23.270
It's going to be a room of people that like deliberated and thought about

707
00:43:23.271 --> 00:43:26.930
government and then created it based on deliberating in a really purposeful way,

708
00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:29.600
which almost never happens when you're creating a government.

709
00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.870
And then they created what Madison hoped would be a fair,

710
00:43:32.871 --> 00:43:36.650
just small r Republican government.
So He's thinking,
well,

711
00:43:36.651 --> 00:43:40.190
if I take all of these notes and I record this whole process down,

712
00:43:40.191 --> 00:43:44.030
it's almost like a little guide book to future countries that might want to make

713
00:43:44.031 --> 00:43:46.220
Republican governments.
Like,
here's how we did it.

714
00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:51.200
And that was the idea behind what he was doing was he really did want to

715
00:43:51.201 --> 00:43:55.130
preserve the process.
And that's pretty much what he did with his notes.

716
00:43:55.131 --> 00:43:58.040
So those of you who are interested,
again,
they're kind of easy to find.

717
00:43:58.041 --> 00:44:00.530
They're all over the place.
Um,
F A.
R,
r a,
n,

718
00:44:00.531 --> 00:44:03.410
d Max Faron I think is the most famous version of them,

719
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:07.410
but they're very easy to find.
Um,
I think I will end there.

720
00:44:07.411 --> 00:44:09.940
I will not move on to talk about Madison's plan.

721
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:13.130
I will talk about the plan and the constitution on Thursday.

722
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:19.010
Those of you who had not yet handed in papers should be handing in papers and I

723
00:44:19.011 --> 00:44:19.970
will see you on Thursday.
