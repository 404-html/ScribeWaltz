1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.680
I know actually want to move on to the topic of the real lecture today.

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.640
Um,
and the,
I've tied a little electric war and society.

3
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.620
Um,
and I mentioned on Tuesday's lecture at the very end of it,

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.280
I mentioned that although the treaty of Paris formerly ended the fighting of the

5
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.950
American revolution,
there were a lot of things,
obviously,

6
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:28.800
clearly undecided at that point.

7
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.220
And I mentioned two things which are very logical things to have mentioned.

8
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:33.054
I said that,

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.220
who knew what kind of a society this new nation was going to have and who knew

10
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.250
what kind of government was going to be governing over this new nation?

11
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.360
And in a way,
the remaining lectures in this course,

12
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:51.580
and it's kind of shocking that there actually aren't all that many lift.

13
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.130
I think they're all done by powder house days.
Matter of fact.
Um,

14
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.320
but in a way of the remaining,
uh,

15
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:02.130
lectures are going to be talking about society,

16
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:05.760
what kind of society would emerge from the revolution and what kind of

17
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:08.280
government would govern over that society.

18
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.090
So those two questions are actually the very two questions that are in one way

19
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:15.930
or another going to be dramatically linking together the rest of the lectures in

20
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:18.060
the course.
And in a way,

21
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.340
those two questions relate back to some of what I talked about at the very

22
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.910
beginning of this course.
Hopefully you remember,
if you don't,

23
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:28.770
I guess you can go look at the syllabus,

24
00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:32.700
but hopefully you remember I mentioned I read quotes from John Adams and from

25
00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:33.570
Benjamin Rush,

26
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.670
both of them trying to define what they thought the American Revolution was,

27
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.240
right?
Was it?
Was it the fighting,
was it before the fighting?

28
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.090
Was it after the fighting?
And in a way,

29
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.120
the next lectures today and those to come are going to address those questions

30
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.740
in a variety of ways.
So today we're going to be talking about society.

31
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.250
What kind of society was America going to have in this experimental brand new

32
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.693
nation?

33
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.340
Now there are any number of ways to discuss this question.

34
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:13.341
And the approach that I'm going to take today is to look at some specific parts

35
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:18.030
of American society and see how the revolution affected them,

36
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.110
to see how things looked for them,
these parts of the American population,

37
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.690
how things look for them in the wake of the revolution.

38
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.030
Because in one way or another,

39
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.050
these populations all had a vital impact on the fighting of the revolution.

40
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.760
And in one way or another,
they were all dispossessed of power.

41
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.460
So today we're going to look at how the revolution affected African Americans,

42
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.240
women,
and native Americans.
And in a sense,

43
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.480
looking at how these three populations fared in a revolution dedicated to

44
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:56.691
defending rights and liberties is a way of judging how radical the revolution

45
00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:01.990
was.
Now,
this is certainly what some historians have argued,

46
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:02.920
and in particular,

47
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.190
there was a really interesting debate on this topic that broke out in the wake

48
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:12.580
of the publication of Gordon Woods radicalism of the American revolution.

49
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.220
And I'm sure,
I don't think it's next week.

50
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:18.610
I think maybe it's the week after when you read the final section of wood.

51
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.950
And I'm sure that in that discussion section,

52
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.960
when you get to the final chunk of that book,

53
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.670
this conversation will probably come up based on some of what I'm talking about

54
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.310
today.
But when that book first came out,

55
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.200
a number of historians stepped forward and said,
no,

56
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.680
basically no.
The revolution was not all that radical.

57
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.310
And they argued that,
well,
okay,
professor would,

58
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:45.460
of course you consider it radical.
You don't really talk about slavery,

59
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.610
you don't talk very much about women and you really don't talk about the south

60
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:53.020
very much.
You focus largely on the north.
So these historians said,
well,
you know,

61
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:56.530
when you look at the revolution that way it looks radical,

62
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.150
but what about when you include slavery,
women and the South?

63
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.240
How does the revolution look then?
Well,

64
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.190
this debate ended up being put into print in one of the leading academic

65
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:12.070
journals of early America.
It's called the William and Mary quarterly,

66
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.050
and they actually published the whole debate.
So they publish is three,

67
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.120
three or four scholars arguing that the revolution was not radical in the way

68
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.150
that wood's book states.
And then they let would have a comeback.

69
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.380
And so they have his reply to the historians who just refuted his book.

70
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:31.840
It's a really interesting conversation

71
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.520
and the commentators brought up the issues that I've just named,
right?

72
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:40.660
What a bad slavery.
What about the role of women in society?
What about the self?

73
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.070
And here's a sample sentence from woods response.

74
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.210
He wrote that it is quote,

75
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.260
inconceivable apparently to his critics quotes that any white males in the past,

76
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:55.780
unless they were sailors or very poor,

77
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.480
could ever have been oppressed or have felt oppressed.

78
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.380
They imply that only those who are oppressed or marginalized in our own time,

79
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.080
we're capable of being oppressed.
Two centuries of go.

80
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.980
If the revolution did not totally abolished slavery and fundamental

81
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.110
fundamentally change a lot of women,

82
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.810
then it could not possibly have been radical.

83
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.620
So clearly he's refuting them saying,
well,
you know,
hey,

84
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.890
can't white males also have been oppressed and have a radical change.
Um,

85
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.230
this debate is really interesting in part because it gets very heated.

86
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.770
You can really see the passions of all the historians involved.

87
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:33.730
Professor would included.
They're very engaged in this.
They have a lot at stake.

88
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:38.710
You can kind of see how passionate historical debates and arguments can get.

89
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.240
But obviously also part of why they're get all heated,
um,

90
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.360
is because the revolution in many ways is America's defining event.

91
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.440
So it's sort of,
it matters for us to think about what it means,
what it meant,

92
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.290
what it meant to different people,
what did the revolution really mean?

93
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.560
And the debate over Wood's book touches on these kinds of questions.

94
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.360
Now,
one small part of the problem and grappling with this question is a natural

95
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:10.010
desire.
I think that many of us have,

96
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:13.040
and actually people even did this in the 18th century,

97
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.530
and that is to compare the American revolution and the French Revolution.

98
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.650
I sit,
people does that at the time.
Sometimes people do that today.

99
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.560
So if you're thinking about,
well,
was the American revolution radical?

100
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:28.820
Some people say,
well,
I mean compared with friends,
it wasn't very radical at all.

101
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:30.680
It was,
it look at what they were doing over there in France.

102
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.320
And certainly when you compare what happened here with some of the more radical,

103
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:40.160
extreme guillotine based things that were happening in France,

104
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.610
it might look less radical here and in comparison with the really deep seated

105
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:47.900
changes in French society,

106
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:52.901
like the ousting of an established aristocracy and the killing of a king and the

107
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:56.810
initiation of a new social order.
Right?
But that's big,
big,

108
00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:58.910
big change in comparison with that.

109
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:03.140
You might argue that changes in America seem tame in comparison.

110
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.250
Some might argue that the American revolution,

111
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.380
unlike it's French counterpart,

112
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.270
was essentially a political protest against a distance central government's

113
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:19.271
interference in the local affairs of a people who were long accustomed to govern

114
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.140
themselves.
Basically,
the American revolution was not a social revolution.

115
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.750
I'm not necessarily defending this argument and as you'll see,

116
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:28.550
I'm not necessarily defending any argument,

117
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.150
but I'm certainly stating here a number of different things that people have

118
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.980
argued and actually what I'm going to try to do today,

119
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:37.341
I'm going to,

120
00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:40.250
I'm going to discuss these populations that are at the heart of this debate

121
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:43.010
about the radicalism of the American revolution.

122
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.920
I'm going to talk about African Americans,

123
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.500
women and native Americans and how they fared,

124
00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:51.890
how the revolution affected them and how they experienced the revolution.

125
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.050
And part of the aim of this is going to be that learning how these populations

126
00:07:57.051 --> 00:08:01.550
fair will give us some insight into the formation of American society in

127
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:03.680
revolutionary and Post Revolutionary America.

128
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:08.360
But what I'm going to really try to do as I talk about this today is I'm going

129
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:13.361
to try really hard not to answer that question I raised about was the revolution

130
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:17.090
radical or not.
The debate that I mentioned in the way Mary quarterly,

131
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.230
I'm actually not going to weigh in on what these changes mean and I'm not going

132
00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:26.180
to do that very deliberately because section after next when you discuss this,

133
00:08:26.181 --> 00:08:29.270
I really want you to debate it.
I'm not going to tell you my opinion.

134
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.720
It might leak in.
I hope not.
I've tried really hard to like banish it.

135
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.780
I don't want you to have my opinion.
I want you to really debate this.

136
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.020
When you're reading the last chunk of wood's book and thinking back over the

137
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:43.010
course,
thinking back over lectures and readings,
think to yourselves,

138
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.980
what do you think about the radicalism of the revolution?

139
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:49.280
And so the lecture today and what I'm talking about today is going to be fodder

140
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.660
that will feed into that conversation.
Okay,

141
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:57.660
so I want to start by talking about African Americans

142
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:00.653
now.

143
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.810
Certainly the period of conflict of actual fighting during the revolution really

144
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.060
stirred things up in the realm of slavery in a number of ways.

145
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.940
For one thing on that sort of simple,
basic level of logistics,

146
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.810
the war just created confusion and disorder,

147
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.560
and because things were disordered in war time,

148
00:09:25.561 --> 00:09:28.920
it provided some opportunities for slaves to escape.

149
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.730
So just the mass confusion of war enable some slaves to flee plantations and

150
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.860
perhaps to pose as free men,
equally important,

151
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:47.090
the revolution spread its message to black Americans as well as to white

152
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.070
Americans.
The message of the revolution,

153
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:53.220
or maybe the message is plural of the revolution.

154
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.460
We're not invisible to black Americans,

155
00:09:56.461 --> 00:09:59.670
free black Americans or enslaved black Americans.

156
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.250
Regardless of whether they were free or enslaved,

157
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:04.710
people could hear these messages,

158
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.720
this rhetoric of liberty and freedom and translate it into their own lives.

159
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.820
And you can see both of these things.

160
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.430
You can see the impact of the confusion of war.

161
00:10:14.431 --> 00:10:19.350
And you can see the impact of the messages of the revolution in the actions of

162
00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:22.050
the British are actually of the Virginias colonial governor.

163
00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:25.130
But I'm calling him the British because he's loyal to the king.
Um,

164
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.620
in 1775 in Virginia.

165
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.560
And then the response of slaves in Virginia,

166
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.880
now logically enough during the war,
the British,

167
00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:40.290
among the things that they're trying to do is to create and chaos would be happy

168
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.430
for them to do.
Right.

169
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.850
That would just sort of give more of a disadvantage to the American.

170
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:49.080
So the British are trying to think of ways to make things difficult in America.

171
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.980
And certainly that's the case in Virginia.

172
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.530
And one of the ways in which they chose to do this concern,

173
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:56.820
the institution of slavery.

174
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.770
So specifically on November 7th,

175
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.100
1775 the colonial governor of Virginia,
who was I just mentioned,

176
00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:08.190
was loyal to the crown.
His name was Lord Dunmore.

177
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:14.450
He passed a proclamation calling on slaves who belonged to rebellious planters

178
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.350
and stating that any of these slaves who were willing to bear arms in the

179
00:11:19.351 --> 00:11:23.850
service of the crown should flee their masters and come to the British and

180
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:28.860
Cameron at Norfolk and fight for the British and any slave who fled from a

181
00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:32.610
rebellious master and came to fight with the British.

182
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.290
This proclamation promised that he would earn freedom at the end of the war in

183
00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:42.210
exchange for military service.
And,
and this becomes known as Lord,
done logically,

184
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.950
Lord Dunmore proclamation.
November 7th,

185
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.690
1775 now,

186
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.030
roughly 800 slaves actually did reach nor,

187
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.690
and it's probable that there would have been more.

188
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.830
But it was not necessarily an easy thing despite the disorder of war for people

189
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:01.450
to just flee from plantations.

190
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:06.451
And there probably was a good deal of vigilance on the part of plantation

191
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:09.100
holders.
So it was not necessarily easy to run to Norfolk,

192
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.640
but roughly 800 slaves did reach Norfolk.

193
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.970
And with those black volunteers Dunmore established when he called his Ethiopian

194
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:23.460
Regiment and his Ethiopian Regiment wore uniforms with a badge that declared

195
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.720
liberty to slaves.
Okay.
So the message is really clear.

196
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.993
However,

197
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:36.330
in a battle fought in Virginia on in December of 1775,

198
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:42.990
Virginia and soldiers actually overwhelmed the British and Ethiopian Regiment

199
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.650
and some white loyalists,

200
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:47.610
all of them sort of fighting together there and done more of,

201
00:12:47.611 --> 00:12:52.611
was forced to evacuate by sea and he took his black volunteers with him.

202
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.380
Now sadly in a variety of ways.
And I suppose in a way it's not unexpected.

203
00:12:59.381 --> 00:13:03.970
Dunworth proclamation ultimately contained a lot of empty promises.

204
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:09.070
Um,
sort of really amazingly sadly,

205
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.480
some British soldiers just couldn't resist the temptation to sell some of these

206
00:13:13.481 --> 00:13:16.630
black volunteers in the West indies,
which they did.

207
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.070
Some actually went aboard ship with them more.

208
00:13:21.071 --> 00:13:25.060
We're headed back to England and apparently there was a smallpox outbreak,

209
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:26.081
a board,

210
00:13:26.081 --> 00:13:31.081
some of these ships and a number of these volunteers died at sea of smallpox.

211
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:36.280
So things didn't necessarily end really well for these volunteers.

212
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.420
Now,
not necessarily these volunteers,

213
00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:45.280
but looking a little bit more broadly at what black Americans are doing during

214
00:13:45.281 --> 00:13:46.660
it.
In the wake of the revolution,

215
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:52.620
some enslaved and free black Americans who sided with the British instead of

216
00:13:52.751 --> 00:13:53.620
running to Norfolk,

217
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.260
maybe they were in a different state or in a different situation.

218
00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:01.270
Some of them actually ultimately sometimes at the end of the war made their way

219
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:04.990
to Canada.
Canada's back free Canada,
um,

220
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.250
some made their way to Canada and in particular in Nova Scotia and Quebec,

221
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.030
among other places,
historians generally speaking,

222
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.560
don't have precise numbers about the number of black Americans who went to

223
00:14:17.561 --> 00:14:21.880
Canada.
But probably we're talking in the thousands
now.

224
00:14:21.881 --> 00:14:25.180
It's important to note here that I've just been talking about people running to

225
00:14:25.181 --> 00:14:27.970
freedom and free black Americans.

226
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:33.150
I'm not meaning to suggest that Canada is like a slave free zone because it

227
00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:37.060
wasn't.
And as a matter of fact,
loyalists,

228
00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:42.061
white loyalists who went to Canada after the war and happened to be slave owners

229
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.530
brought their slaves with them.

230
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:49.510
So it's not as though Canada was the sort of happy freedom zone for some people.

231
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:53.750
As I'll mention in a minute,
it was somewhat,
but for many other people,

232
00:14:53.751 --> 00:14:57.140
they were slaves in America,
they were slaves.
In Canada,

233
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:03.580
there were a number of free black men who immigrated to Canada and once they

234
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:10.730
were there they assumed logically that they deserved the same benefits that

235
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:13.700
white loyalists were getting from the crown.

236
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:16.100
So these are free black men who sided with the British,

237
00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:18.110
they go to Canada and the crown,

238
00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:23.000
it promised white loyalists sort of any number of things including land grants

239
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:27.020
as a reward for being loyal during the revolution.
These free black men go off,

240
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.863
I'll go to Canada,

241
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.940
assuming they've been loyal and they deserve land grants in Canada.

242
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.120
And there actually were some free black men who did get land grants and Canada.

243
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.730
However,
of course this was not an entirely fair process.

244
00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:44.720
So you have white loyalists being given grants,

245
00:15:44.721 --> 00:15:47.030
have hundreds of acres of land.

246
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:52.660
You have black loyalists being given sometimes as little as one acre of land,

247
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.910
sometimes as much as 50 acres of land,

248
00:15:56.150 --> 00:16:00.320
nowhere near sort of parody.
Nothing,
nothing equal going on here.

249
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.780
And apparently also areas in which,
um,

250
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.220
black loyalists were giving land tended to be segregated off.

251
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.860
So we're not talking about equality,

252
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.710
we're not talking about a slave free zone and we're not talking about sudden

253
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:18.350
equality of status.
Now,

254
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.191
of course,

255
00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:24.191
slaves did not just serve in the British army or only ally themselves with the

256
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:29.300
British,
some joint,
the continental army,

257
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.340
as did some free black Americans though at the outset,

258
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:38.450
the continental army for bay,
the investment of African Americans.

259
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:42.170
So at the beginning of the war,
this was not something being discussed.
However,

260
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.320
after the war had been dragging on for a while,

261
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.210
certainly longer than people thought it would,

262
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.740
and the continental army and Congress really began to be desperate for manpower.

263
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.940
Suddenly it,
his issue was revisited and at least in the north,

264
00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.920
some states began to enlist black soldiers to fight in the continental army

265
00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.170
by the end of the war.
Most of the states at some of the,

266
00:17:06.171 --> 00:17:08.030
obviously southern states are holdouts here,

267
00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:11.900
but most of the states had recruited some black soldiers,

268
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:16.820
roughly 5,000 black soldier served in the continental army.

269
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.920
Logically enough,
most of them from the north,

270
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:25.250
the majority were slaves serving with their master's consent in separate black

271
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:30.230
units.
Some hoped to be fighting towards their emancipation.

272
00:17:30.231 --> 00:17:30.891
So again,

273
00:17:30.891 --> 00:17:34.190
on a really personal level did feel like they were fighting for freedom,

274
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.220
not just American freedom,
but personal freedom.

275
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.210
And an example of this,
just this,
this mentality,

276
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:47.020
you can see this in the 289 identifiably black men in the Connecticut forces of

277
00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:52.830
that,
those 289 black men,

278
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.850
five of them when asked to give their surname reported that their surname was

279
00:17:56.851 --> 00:18:00.600
liberty when they signed on 18 when they signed on,

280
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:04.200
reported that their last name was freedom or Freeman.

281
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:09.030
And I say speaking as Joanna Freeman and my eastern European ancestors had the

282
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:12.390
same impulse at Ellis island.
I think Freeman,

283
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.440
I understand.
Um,
but you can see there,

284
00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:19.870
you can get a sense they're of the mindset of what,
uh,

285
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.300
behind what people are doing.

286
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:28.100
So we've seen in a variety of ways here that the war shook up the system of

287
00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:31.260
slavery in several ways.

288
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.440
We've seen that the message of the revolution certainly had an impact on America

289
00:18:36.971 --> 00:18:38.700
slave population.

290
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:44.450
The revolution also changed the views of some white Americans regarding slavery.

291
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:47.730
Given the revolutions,

292
00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.710
message of liberty and the ways in which Americans actually did regularly use

293
00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:55.830
the rhetoric of enslavement to describe their relationship with Britain,
right?

294
00:18:55.831 --> 00:18:57.960
We are not slaves.
They are treating us like slaves.

295
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:03.530
Some white Americans were moved to take action on the issue of slavery.

296
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.070
Now of course,

297
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:10.250
some foreign observers were pretty quick to see the irony in a slave holding

298
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:15.060
society crying out for liberty and freedom.
And the most famous example of this,

299
00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:19.770
many of you may have heard this quote already,
is from Samuel Johnson who said,

300
00:19:19.771 --> 00:19:23.370
how is it that we hear the loudest Yelp's for liberty from the drivers of

301
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:26.640
Negroes?
He just pins the point right on its head.

302
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.640
But some people were actually moved to action.
For example,

303
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.500
ideas early in the war that we talked about earlier in the course about

304
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:42.240
boycotting certain items of trade,
like the Continental Association.

305
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:48.110
Those ideas inspired some Americans to seize the opportunity to prohibit trade

306
00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:52.440
in slaves as well.
And some of the more radical colonies.

307
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.790
Mike Pennsylvania,
Connecticut and Rhode Island.

308
00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.400
I want a rousing cheer of Rhode Island.
Um,

309
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:04.430
some of the more radical colonies actually past x prohibiting the slave trade

310
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:10.200
during the war.
So Pennsylvania in 1773 did that.

311
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.680
Rhode Island and Connecticut in 1774 did that between 1777 and 1784 or five

312
00:20:19.471 --> 00:20:21.480
states actually ended slavery.

313
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:24.120
And I'm going to come back to a moment as to what I mean when I say ended

314
00:20:24.121 --> 00:20:28.410
slavery,
Vermont,
Pennsylvania,
Massachusetts,

315
00:20:28.411 --> 00:20:30.760
Rhode Island and Connecticut.
Um,

316
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:35.520
though in many cases they proposed gradual emancipation.
So again,

317
00:20:35.521 --> 00:20:38.730
this is not instant end of problem.
Um,
for example,

318
00:20:38.731 --> 00:20:43.731
declaring all children born of an enslaved woman to be free after a certain

319
00:20:44.071 --> 00:20:47.620
date,
Quakers were also moved,

320
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.670
or at least some Quakers were also moved to act against slavery.
Um,

321
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.710
and certainly by the end of the war,

322
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.800
some Quaker slave owners had freed their slaves.

323
00:20:56.801 --> 00:21:00.910
I think a pretty hefty percentage of Quakers actually freed slaves.

324
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:06.310
Sometimes black Americans,
we're a spur to action.

325
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.980
So for example,
in states that considered slaves to be not only property,

326
00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:15.250
but also people before the law like Massachusetts,

327
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.910
there were actually some slaves who brought suit against their master's for

328
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:21.070
freedom.
Now,

329
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:24.340
these kinds of attempts may not have often been successful,

330
00:21:24.341 --> 00:21:29.341
but they certainly had the potential to force slave owners to grapple with the

331
00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:32.860
idea of slavery with its legality,
with its morality.

332
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.610
So as far as slavery is concerned,
in the north,

333
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.220
the revolution caused some change,

334
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.820
but there was still a general refusal to offer freed blacks,

335
00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:46.510
full membership and the political community or to raise their social status.

336
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:52.560
But in the self slavery emerged from the revolution as a firmly entrenched

337
00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:56.530
sectional institution.
Now of course,

338
00:21:56.531 --> 00:22:00.640
the south was economically dependent on the system of slavery.

339
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.231
In a way,

340
00:22:02.231 --> 00:22:07.231
the revolution only made this more obvious to southerners military occupation by

341
00:22:07.751 --> 00:22:12.751
the British British attempts says in Lord Dunmore to use slavery as a tactic to

342
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:15.310
upset the American cause.

343
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:20.560
Those sorts of things seem to really threaten the social order of the south.

344
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:26.340
And many southerners responded by deciding that the restoration and regulation

345
00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:31.591
of slavery was indispensable for the rehabilitation of the south after the war.

346
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:37.240
So the result was the further entrenchment of slavery throughout the south.

347
00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:40.570
Although I think a little less so in Maryland.
So for example,

348
00:22:40.571 --> 00:22:45.571
in some states where a large percentage of the slave population had been lost in

349
00:22:45.641 --> 00:22:46.451
various ways,

350
00:22:46.451 --> 00:22:51.220
planters began to import slaves from Africa in earnest in mass quantities.

351
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.391
So for example,

352
00:22:52.391 --> 00:22:57.391
South Carolina lost a large percentage of their slave population in one way or

353
00:22:57.401 --> 00:23:02.401
another during the war before 1800 they had imported almost 20,000 Africans to

354
00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:03.820
South Carolina.

355
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.500
And obviously is we're going to see in future lectures.

356
00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.620
Given this divide over the issue of slavery,

357
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:17.100
it became a continual deal breaker whenever any sort of national initiative was

358
00:23:17.471 --> 00:23:21.430
being discussed,
like the drafting of a new constitution.

359
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.820
Again and again over the course of the next few decades,

360
00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:29.650
the issue of slavery would be raised and then dropped sometimes immediately

361
00:23:29.651 --> 00:23:30.484
dropped,

362
00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:35.520
always being sidestepped as just being too dangerous to handle in a fragile new

363
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.670
union.
And obviously if you look far down the road,

364
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:44.620
this kind of behavior was no solution because way down the road we end up in a

365
00:23:44.621 --> 00:23:48.140
civil.
Now,
as I said at the outset,

366
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:52.220
I'm going to let you discuss for yourselves and if a couple of weeks,
um,

367
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.210
thinking back over this semester about the implications of the information that

368
00:23:56.211 --> 00:24:00.350
I just gave you about slavery and whether or not this constitutes radical
change,

369
00:24:00.351 --> 00:24:01.184
what does this mean?

370
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.430
Now I want to turn to the question of women and how the revolution affected
them.

371
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:13.090
And I've already mentioned in past lectures how women were politicized with the

372
00:24:13.671 --> 00:24:15.770
resistance effort.
Boycotting credit.

373
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.800
British goods is an act of political act and women are often the people who are

374
00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:25.901
purchasing goods that the need to spin and weave homespun cloth because British

375
00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:30.080
manufactured goods are being boycotted.
Again,
that's a really political act.

376
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:35.320
So some of the daily actions of women became politicized during the revolution.

377
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.980
And there were some women who are even more overtly political,

378
00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:42.170
drafting petitions,

379
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:47.470
participating in mass political events in North Carolina in 1774 as an example

380
00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:51.230
of some very politically activated women,

381
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:56.870
51 women wrote out a resolution declaring their allegiance to the American
cause.

382
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.560
In 1780 and Philadelphia 36 women apparently created and ran an amazingly

383
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:07.910
successful campaign to raise money to equip American troops.

384
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.070
And supposedly in a matter of weeks,

385
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:15.560
these 36 women raised roughly $300,000.
So those are sort of active,

386
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:16.910
amazingly effective women.

387
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:21.320
So there are some women that are really explicitly sort of campaigning

388
00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.213
politically,

389
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:27.220
but this doesn't mean that women were wholeheartedly welcomed into the political

390
00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:29.390
community.
Of course,

391
00:25:29.391 --> 00:25:34.370
they didn't have the franchise except briefly in New Jersey.

392
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:39.560
This is a New Jersey moment.
Anyone here from New Jersey?
Oh,

393
00:25:39.561 --> 00:25:42.440
we have many New Jersey people.
New Jersey shines right here.
Well,

394
00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:45.030
at least for a little while,
we have a shiny New Jersey moment.
Um,

395
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:49.940
believe it or not,
for a little,
little window of time in New Jersey,

396
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:53.660
women had the vote during this time period.

397
00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:59.000
And direct consequence of the principles of the revolution and the way that this

398
00:25:59.001 --> 00:26:01.460
worked is that basically as a new state,

399
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.310
New Jersey created its own constitution,

400
00:26:04.311 --> 00:26:09.311
the new constitution in 1776 and apparently that constitution had gender neutral

401
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:14.570
language in it and it referred to inhabitance voting inhabitants who could meet

402
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.240
a 50 pound property requirements.

403
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.140
So any inhabitant who had those 50 pounds could vote.

404
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.470
Now obviously that did not explicitly mention women,

405
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.080
but in 1790 state,

406
00:26:27.081 --> 00:26:30.560
legislators in New Jersey passed an electoral statute,

407
00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:35.620
explicitly affirming female suffrage and used the word he and the word she in

408
00:26:37.011 --> 00:26:41.540
discussing this.
So they were very straightforward about it.
Now,
in point of fact,

409
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:46.690
only small numbers of women voted because except for a small number of wealthy

410
00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:47.191
widows,

411
00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:50.940
there were not that many women who could satisfy the property requirement.

412
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:56.330
Still beginning roughly in 1797 small numbers of women,

413
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.340
probably a few hundred in any given election,

414
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:04.590
did vote in New Jersey in both state and national elections.

415
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:08.250
Will Happy New Jersey moment.
However,

416
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.270
in 1807 some election fraud and,

417
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.870
and I suppose lingering and persistent anxiety about exactly what female stuff,

418
00:27:17.871 --> 00:27:20.670
which meant led the New Jersey legislature,

419
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:25.620
people of all parties in the New Jersey legislature to pass a law,

420
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:27.900
explicitly prohibiting women from voting.

421
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:32.310
So literally it's like this little window a couple of years and then suffered

422
00:27:32.311 --> 00:27:34.590
just taken away.
Interestingly,

423
00:27:34.591 --> 00:27:39.590
historians have not found much protest on the part of New Jersey women in that

424
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.840
no was not actually a lot of response as to what it meant to lose the vote.

425
00:27:42.841 --> 00:27:45.570
But again,
that might be because we're talking about such small numbers.

426
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:50.460
Interestingly,
during roughly that same little window of time,

427
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:55.020
a few states experimented with black suffrage in their first state

428
00:27:55.021 --> 00:27:58.500
constitutions.
So New York,
New Jersey,

429
00:27:58.501 --> 00:28:02.790
and Pennsylvania for at least a time in their new constitutions allowed free

430
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.320
black men to vote.

431
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.980
This did not last for very long time and as a matter of fact,

432
00:28:07.981 --> 00:28:11.640
New Jersey when they took the vote away from women also took it away from free

433
00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:12.540
black men.

434
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:16.350
So there's a little window when some states are willing to experiment with this

435
00:28:16.351 --> 00:28:21.090
idea.
And then that experiment is ended at the beginning of the 19th century.

436
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:25.920
So window of opportunity,
not a longstanding change.

437
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.181
Even.

438
00:28:27.181 --> 00:28:32.181
So women post revolution did have something of a more established political role

439
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.980
in the community at large,
and it says wives and mothers,

440
00:28:37.981 --> 00:28:42.510
but it's not just go be a wife,
go be a mother.
Thank you very much.

441
00:28:42.511 --> 00:28:43.590
That's good for the polity.

442
00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:48.120
It's actually a little bit more complicated than that.
Basically,

443
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.550
as the republic got underway,

444
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:55.410
it was assumed that women would have an important political role to play.

445
00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.690
And this has to do with the nature of a republic.

446
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:03.230
A Republic is supposedly grounded on a populace that understands its liberties

447
00:29:03.571 --> 00:29:07.890
and rights,
is vigilant to protect those liberties and rights,

448
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.870
knows what it's supposed to be doing.

449
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:14.340
As citizens knows how to act as a good citizen or public is grounded on its

450
00:29:14.341 --> 00:29:19.170
citizens,
the activities and the vigilance of its citizens.

451
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.550
So in a republic,

452
00:29:20.551 --> 00:29:25.551
it's really important for people to understand what it means to be a small r

453
00:29:26.281 --> 00:29:27.114
Republican.

454
00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:32.420
So women as the people who are literally mothering new little Republicans being

455
00:29:33.451 --> 00:29:34.470
born all the time,

456
00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:38.970
we're seeing to have an important role to play as the people who were literally

457
00:29:38.971 --> 00:29:42.340
schooling their children to be good Republican citizens.

458
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:45.740
And there's a historian named Linda Kerber,
um,

459
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.070
and she's actually in your major problems,

460
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:51.130
is an excerpt of what I'm talking about here that's in your major problems

461
00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.810
textbook.
Ah,

462
00:29:52.811 --> 00:29:57.130
this historian named Linda Kerber came up with a phrase to describe this

463
00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:01.930
politicized role,
and she used the term Republican motherhood to describe it,

464
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.290
and historians really liked that phrase and they took it and they ran with it.

465
00:30:05.291 --> 00:30:07.870
So now you see Republican motherhood all over the place.

466
00:30:07.871 --> 00:30:10.840
A lot of people talk about Republican motherhood.
A few people said,

467
00:30:10.841 --> 00:30:14.140
well actually I think it's more like Republican wife,
but one way or another,

468
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.860
the idea with one that was popular with historians and they ran with it.

469
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.700
Now I mentioned Republican motherhood,

470
00:30:21.701 --> 00:30:24.580
partly because I think it's a nicely descriptive phrase.

471
00:30:24.581 --> 00:30:26.020
It kind of sums up what I just said,

472
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:29.110
partly because historically it's significant.
Historians.

473
00:30:29.111 --> 00:30:30.490
If you read about women in the revolution,

474
00:30:30.491 --> 00:30:34.330
you're going to see that phrase all over the place.
But I do want to note here,

475
00:30:34.331 --> 00:30:37.330
having just mentioned it,
it's not like people in early America,

476
00:30:37.331 --> 00:30:39.970
we're walking around claiming to be republican mothers.
That's actually,

477
00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:41.890
it's not something from the time,

478
00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:47.130
it's a modern idea that's being imposed back to explain behavior from an earlier

479
00:30:47.441 --> 00:30:47.771
time.

480
00:30:47.771 --> 00:30:51.520
So it's not like people were sort of using that phrase in the period that we're

481
00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:53.890
talking about
now.

482
00:30:53.891 --> 00:30:58.570
To be a good Republican mother,
a woman needed to be well educated,

483
00:30:58.571 --> 00:31:01.990
obviously,
so she could educate her children.
So in essence,

484
00:31:01.991 --> 00:31:05.560
if you're gonna raise solid republican citizens,

485
00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:09.640
they needed to be good,
solid republicans themselves.

486
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:11.560
So logically enough,

487
00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:16.770
female education got something of a boost after the revolution and throughout

488
00:31:17.921 --> 00:31:18.521
the country,

489
00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:23.230
there were a number of women's academies and schools formed for advanced

490
00:31:23.231 --> 00:31:26.170
learning for women that had not been there before.

491
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:29.230
There was a lot of attention being paid to female education.

492
00:31:29.231 --> 00:31:33.400
You see it in public discussions at the time.
People are actually talking about,

493
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:38.670
men are actually talking about what is the proper education for a woman to what

494
00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:43.150
should be happening,
where should things be going,
what should we be doing?

495
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:44.470
What's best for the republic.

496
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:49.630
Now I've already talked about how with the issue of slavery,

497
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:55.360
thanks to anxieties raised by the revolution and fears about social disorder,

498
00:31:55.540 --> 00:32:00.540
some southern states responded by focusing even more deeply and more deeply

499
00:32:01.061 --> 00:32:05.380
entrenching the system of slavery.
Not surprisingly,
in the case of women,

500
00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:09.700
there were some anxieties raised by the implications of the revolution regarding

501
00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:13.600
their status and their actions as well.
It can be a little harder to see,

502
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:18.670
but it is there.
And one of the interesting places where,
um,
gosh,

503
00:32:18.671 --> 00:32:19.690
it's been a number of years,

504
00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:24.340
a number of years ago I stumbled across newspaper essays and I thought they were

505
00:32:24.341 --> 00:32:25.031
really fascinating.

506
00:32:25.031 --> 00:32:29.890
And they bear right on this 18th century newspapers.
We've seen them,

507
00:32:29.891 --> 00:32:31.920
they're short.
There are a couple of pages.
Um,

508
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.890
sometimes in the newspaper we looked at,
I don't think there was one.
Um,

509
00:32:35.891 --> 00:32:39.350
but sometimes they would have like little satirical essays usually with some

510
00:32:39.351 --> 00:32:43.490
sort of political commentary or maybe social commentary attached to them.

511
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:44.960
And what I stumbled across,

512
00:32:44.961 --> 00:32:49.100
and I think both of these examples are like from 1789 or 1790.

513
00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:51.230
So the new government has just gotten underway.

514
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:56.680
I found these little satirical essays,
both of which were kind of,
um,

515
00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:01.910
showing anxieties about women having political power and making fun of women

516
00:33:01.911 --> 00:33:02.721
with political power.

517
00:33:02.721 --> 00:33:07.721
So I found one essay that pokes fun at women who are so informed politically

518
00:33:08.751 --> 00:33:11.840
that they know the identity of all the people who write with pseudonyms in the

519
00:33:11.841 --> 00:33:12.674
newspapers.

520
00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:17.780
And so it was this little sort of sarcastic as a sort of,

521
00:33:17.781 --> 00:33:18.740
you know,
well you women,

522
00:33:18.741 --> 00:33:22.700
you bad mothers who like read the paper and you know who poo bleus is,

523
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.270
but you don't know where your child is.
You know,
it's sort of a,

524
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:29.660
it was meant to be funny,
but that was the tone,
you know,
bad mother,

525
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:33.470
good politician,
bad mother,
bad,
bad,
bad for America.

526
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:39.430
And there was another one that was using satire to poke fun at the idea of women

527
00:33:39.771 --> 00:33:44.270
applying for the position of doorkeeper of Congress.
No symbolism there.

528
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.570
Um,
and it was an essay that was like,
well,
what does that mean?
You know,

529
00:33:47.571 --> 00:33:51.350
a woman applying to be the doorkeeper of Congress acting as though that had

530
00:33:51.351 --> 00:33:51.711
happened.

531
00:33:51.711 --> 00:33:55.490
And then kind of making fun of the implications of what it would mean if a woman

532
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:59.870
had sort of political role with an actual political institution.

533
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:04.150
So those,
both of those things were really interesting to me because they,

534
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.560
they're not directly saying,
wow,

535
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:09.830
we're really anxious about the implications of the revolution regarding women.

536
00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.320
So we're going to write really anxious a little essays.

537
00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.550
But that's basically what they were with was showing some anxieties,

538
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.880
showing awareness of change and not necessarily being all that happy about what

539
00:34:22.341 --> 00:34:25.370
that change might mean.
Okay.

540
00:34:25.371 --> 00:34:29.150
So we've seen some ways in which the revolution affected women.

541
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:34.550
I want to turn before I run out of time here to native Americans as a final sort

542
00:34:34.551 --> 00:34:37.610
of test case on the bounds of the American revolution.

543
00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:40.280
Now,

544
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:45.280
native Americans had a complicated experience of the American revolution and it

545
00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:49.460
was complicated in many ways.
For one thing,

546
00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:55.360
they were being courted by the British and the British had long had a presence

547
00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:58.580
in western frontier territories.

548
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.930
So they had experience dealing with native Americans,

549
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:04.671
obviously.

550
00:35:04.671 --> 00:35:09.671
Also native Americans were living on land that was constantly deeply desired by

551
00:35:10.941 --> 00:35:15.290
Americans of various sorts.
And even before the revolution,

552
00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:20.360
white American settlers didn't need much of an excuse to wage an attack on

553
00:35:20.361 --> 00:35:24.110
Indians to get land.
So that's even before the impact of the revolution,

554
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:26.450
not surprisingly,

555
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:31.690
native Americans that sided with the British really complicated their

556
00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:34.700
relationship with white Americans.

557
00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.790
Americans basically struck back.
So for example,

558
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:44.010
in 1776 and 1780 even as the revolution is still going on,

559
00:35:44.011 --> 00:35:46.620
you had Americans attacking the Cherokee Indians.

560
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:52.430
In 1779 Americans attack the air coy in 1780 and 82 they attack the Shawnee.

561
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:59.110
So even as the revolution is going on,
Americans are acknowledging that they're,

562
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:00.960
they feel threatened by native Americans.

563
00:36:00.961 --> 00:36:03.690
They understand that there's a link somehow between British and native Americans

564
00:36:03.691 --> 00:36:06.780
and they're waging attacks there as well as everywhere else.

565
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:11.130
The treaty of Paris did not help matters.

566
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.060
The treaty ceded to the United States,

567
00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:18.060
British holdings east of the Mississippi River,

568
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.790
but given that logically enough,

569
00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:25.590
they were no native American representatives at the treaty negotiations in
Paris,

570
00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.180
native Americans were stunned to discover later that their territory had just

571
00:36:30.181 --> 00:36:34.140
been signed away by the British and given to the Americans.

572
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:39.360
One member of the Iroquois told a British commander who was posted out on the

573
00:36:39.361 --> 00:36:40.950
frontier that quote,

574
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.960
if it was really true that the English had basically betrayed them by pretending

575
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:49.110
to give up their country to the Americans without their consent.

576
00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:53.010
I liked the fact that it's pretending without their consent or consulting them.

577
00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.110
It was an act of cruelty and injustice that Christians only we're capable of

578
00:36:58.111 --> 00:37:00.540
doing some really strong statement.

579
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:06.950
Even so when American commissioners went West after the treaty had gone into

580
00:37:08.161 --> 00:37:11.940
effect,
they were operating under the idea that in defeating the British,

581
00:37:11.941 --> 00:37:15.120
they hit also defeated Britain's native American allies.

582
00:37:15.121 --> 00:37:16.440
They were the conquerors.

583
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:20.160
They had been given the land and they actually assumed when they headed west,

584
00:37:20.161 --> 00:37:22.260
and we're treating with native Americans,

585
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.010
that they were being generous by giving back to the native Americans,

586
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:28.980
some of what had been there with but was no longer theirs.

587
00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.900
This was a really nice theory,
but in fact,

588
00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:37.800
as Americans would discover over the course of the 70s and 80s and even into the

589
00:37:37.801 --> 00:37:42.801
1790s as much as they could claim that they had conquered native Americans,

590
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:49.650
the new United States and Americans in the new United States had no ability to

591
00:37:49.651 --> 00:37:53.100
act like conquerors,
no physical ability to act like conquerors.

592
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.920
They just didn't have the military power.

593
00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.780
And throughout this period,
as American settlers moved west,

594
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.990
native Americans went to battle,
defended their land,

595
00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:08.991
and often American attempts to quash these attacks were disastrous for the

596
00:38:09.241 --> 00:38:12.810
Americans.
And as an example of what we're talking about here,

597
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:18.030
in 1789 the national army of the United States,
whatever was of it,

598
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:21.000
had roughly 700 men.

599
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:26.730
The Creek Indians alone had between 30 506,000 warriors.

600
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.380
Okay.
We're not really powerful as far as being a sort of national presence,

601
00:38:31.381 --> 00:38:33.630
demanding or commanding anything

602
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.730
for the native Americans.

603
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:41.731
The disastrous impact of the revolution inspired many of them to become more

604
00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:44.950
United and not just as individual tribes,

605
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:50.520
but it actually United different tribal groups together explicitly based on the

606
00:38:50.681 --> 00:38:55.210
idea that they were different from white people and needed to unite against
them.

607
00:38:55.870 --> 00:39:00.520
Tribe and tribe and tribe and tribe together needed to form unity in a way in

608
00:39:00.521 --> 00:39:05.500
which they hadn't necessarily done before.
Do Unite against white people.
Now,

609
00:39:05.501 --> 00:39:08.290
this wasn't true for all native Americans,

610
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:13.240
nor did all of them assume that their only option was war.

611
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:19.210
Some did decide to try to blend into communities,

612
00:39:19.211 --> 00:39:23.620
black communities,
white communities,
and white Americans throughout this period.

613
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.240
Some of them at least.
Um,

614
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:30.190
also we're busily trying to convince some native Americans to just take up

615
00:39:30.191 --> 00:39:31.990
agriculture and sort of blend in.

616
00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.290
If they could take a little plot of land and begin farming.

617
00:39:35.291 --> 00:39:39.210
Some Americans thought that maybe that would be an alternative to warfare that

618
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:42.550
native Americans could kind of become part of American society.

619
00:39:42.551 --> 00:39:43.930
Thomas Jefferson talks about this,

620
00:39:43.931 --> 00:39:48.580
some in notes on the state of Virginia and for many white Americans,

621
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:53.680
this was the only option that they could envision that might prevent future

622
00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:57.040
warfare and bloody nasty future warfare.

623
00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:02.140
But as you can tell by a lot of what I just said there in the end,

624
00:40:02.141 --> 00:40:03.190
generally speaking,

625
00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:08.370
the revolution brought nothing but trouble to North America's native peoples and

626
00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:11.830
that trouble would persist for decades to come.

627
00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:17.110
It's interesting.
I,
I,
I'm going to give a little shout out here.
Um,

628
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.510
I have a senior essay writer.

629
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.450
Senior assays are on my mind since all I'm doing is reading drafts of senior

630
00:40:22.451 --> 00:40:27.300
essay.
Um,
but I have a senior essay writer who is writing his essay,
um,

631
00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.400
on the fact that there's a little tiny window.

632
00:40:30.401 --> 00:40:34.120
We're talking about a lot of little tiny windows,
a little tiny window,
um,

633
00:40:34.121 --> 00:40:37.630
at the beginning of the new government under the constitution.
Um,

634
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.140
and there was a brief period in which the national government thought,
well,

635
00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:45.820
maybe we can actually have sincere diplomacy with the native Americans.

636
00:40:45.821 --> 00:40:50.530
We can sort of treat them like a foreign nation and do something that will maybe

637
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:52.750
waylay problems.

638
00:40:52.751 --> 00:40:56.530
It's not a window that lasts very long and when that window is over,

639
00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.370
there's more nasty warfare.
But that's what this senior essay is about.

640
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:01.970
That little window that,
um,
uh,

641
00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:07.320
this essay argues is often not recognized because people look to sort of Jackson

642
00:41:07.421 --> 00:41:11.500
wiping out native Americans and they just transpose that back across time and

643
00:41:11.501 --> 00:41:15.490
they don't really acknowledge that this little bit of diplomacy here was
serious.

644
00:41:15.491 --> 00:41:19.570
They'd sort of assume some historians assumed that it was just delaying measure

645
00:41:19.571 --> 00:41:23.770
while Americans built up troops.
So anyway,
in one way or another,

646
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.270
the revolution,
um,

647
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.740
brought nothing but trouble to native peoples.

648
00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:34.580
And that trouble obviously continued and in a way got worse and years to come.

649
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.811
Okay.

650
00:41:35.811 --> 00:41:40.811
So we've looked at the impact of the revolution on African Americans,

651
00:41:41.841 --> 00:41:43.790
on women,
on native Americans.

652
00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.000
We've seen their experiences of the revolution.

653
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:52.220
We've seen some of the impact of those experience experiences in the outcome.

654
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.600
We've seen some change,
some of it for the better,

655
00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:59.960
some of it longstanding,
some of it maybe not so much.

656
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:06.040
We've seen also how change doesn't happen in a predictable,

657
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:07.550
linear kind of a way.

658
00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:10.250
I think there's an assumption when you think about the history of almost

659
00:42:10.251 --> 00:42:13.280
anything,
but certainly maybe in the history of your own country.

660
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:17.330
The things are always getting better.
I think they started out sort of primitive,

661
00:42:17.331 --> 00:42:21.470
but they're always getting better and I think in particular when you look at the

662
00:42:21.471 --> 00:42:22.790
sort of subject we look at today,

663
00:42:22.791 --> 00:42:26.120
what you see is that things sort of do this or things are not always getting

664
00:42:26.121 --> 00:42:26.850
better.

665
00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:31.850
History is actually actions and reactions and sometimes the reaction is not so

666
00:42:32.181 --> 00:42:36.140
great,
so things get better,
they get worse,
they kind of stay the same.

667
00:42:36.141 --> 00:42:37.760
Maybe they're a little better,
maybe they're even better,

668
00:42:37.761 --> 00:42:38.720
and then they get worse again.

669
00:42:38.721 --> 00:42:42.680
And I think taking the long view of American history,

670
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:46.520
I think that's a more realistic way to think about how things change over time

671
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.430
than to assume that everything always gets better.

672
00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:54.230
I think these three populations show that really dramatically.
However,

673
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.710
I'm not going to tell you whether I think that means that the revolution is

674
00:42:57.711 --> 00:43:01.280
radical or not.
I think I successfully did not do that in that lecture.

675
00:43:01.281 --> 00:43:04.550
I hope I did.
Um,
and I'm going to be really interested,
uh,

676
00:43:04.551 --> 00:43:09.551
after you meet and have that discussion to hear what you discussed,

677
00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:14.750
what you think,
what your thoughts are,
how radical was the American revolution.

678
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:18.590
And I will end there and I will see you next week.
