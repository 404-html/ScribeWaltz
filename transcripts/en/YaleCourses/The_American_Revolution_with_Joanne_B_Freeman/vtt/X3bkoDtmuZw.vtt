1
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.660
So today,
uh,
as you can see on the syllabus,

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.530
the lecture is titled Organizing a war.

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.610
And on this past Thursday I talked about the opening phases of what basically

4
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:21.300
is,
I described,
it is a civil war.

5
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.520
I talked about opening hostilities including Lexington and Concord.

6
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.210
And I showed how even with these opening hostilities still we could see how long

7
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:37.320
it took before independence was actually declared.

8
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.710
Basically launching a civil war was not an easy decision or for a time at least

9
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.670
even a logical one,

10
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.160
nor was organizing and fighting a civil war easy,

11
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.840
particularly for 13 colonies that were not used to acting in unison.

12
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.630
And as we saw a really early on in the course,

13
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.850
the colonies tended to come together for purposes of self defense when
necessary.

14
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:04.410
And then when no longer necessary,

15
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:09.411
they were definitely not joined together in joint cause past that point.

16
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.320
So the colonies and then states did not naturally fall into a union of some kind

17
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.030
unless there was danger at hand and often only when danger was at hand.

18
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.900
Well today what we're going to be looking at is some of the challenges facing

19
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.950
these,

20
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.430
well now they're stays now that you've declared independence 13 states when they

21
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:37.431
came together in the opening phases of this civil war for their mutual defense

22
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.610
and as we're going to see during the lecture on the one hand,

23
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:45.540
given that togetherness was not really their natural state of being,

24
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.910
they did manage to accomplish quite a bit convened in the continental Congress.

25
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.260
But on the other hand,

26
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.620
the process of organizing award did not end up being a very efficient business

27
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.080
in many ways and that's really going to be the main subject of what I'm going to

28
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:06.081
talk about today and the experience of trying to accomplish things with only a

29
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:13.020
week continental congress acting as the central organizational body actually

30
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:18.021
ended up convincing some people down the road that I stronger government then

31
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:23.910
that one was going to be necessary when people were trying to figure out a more

32
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.590
permanent form of government for these newly independent states.

33
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.220
So one of the things I'll be showing and talking about by the end of the lecture

34
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.130
is the ways in which real life experiences were convincing.

35
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:38.220
Some people are teaching some people even a better word,
um,

36
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.930
lessons about governance in these new states and about what they thought worked

37
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:47.100
and what they thought didn't.
There was never great uniform agreement,

38
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.210
but you'll see why some people emerged from the revolutionary war effort

39
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.680
thinking that something stronger and more centralized with necessary.
Okay,

40
00:02:55.681 --> 00:03:00.681
so now let's turn to the continental Congress and how they organized a war.

41
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.321
Now,

42
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:07.321
the effort really began in earnest in May of 1775 when the second continental

43
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:12.100
congress was first sitting just after Lexington and Concord because it was in

44
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:17.101
May of 1775 that the continental congress took direction of colonial military

45
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:22.780
resistance to the British by creating the continental army.
Now,

46
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:27.781
I ended Thursday's lecture with a quote by John Adams from a letter that he

47
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:31.660
wrote to Abigail when which he was summing up some of the challenges facing

48
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:32.110
congress.

49
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.400
I'll repeat it here because it's going to outline some of the things that we

50
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:38.590
will be talking about in today's lecture.

51
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:43.330
And what Adams wrote was when 50 or 60 men have a constitution to form for a

52
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:44.260
great empire,

53
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.030
at the same time they have a country of 1500 miles extent to fortify millions to

54
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:54.031
arm and train a naval power to begin an extensive commerce to regulate numerous

55
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:58.690
tribes of Indians to negotiate with a Standing Army of 27,000 men to raise pay,

56
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:03.580
visual and officer,
I shall really pity those 50 or 60 men.
Okay,

57
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:07.060
so that's Adam's writing to Abigail,
like basically saying,
oh my God,

58
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.120
this is what we have in front of us.
This will not be easy.

59
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.840
And you can see in that quote the scope of the task that really did lie before

60
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:20.710
the continental Congress figuring out how to govern the 13 states,

61
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.350
worrying about issues having to do with commerce,

62
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.460
negotiating with native Americans and of course in war time,

63
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.380
most central of all given military hostilities that we're right in hand creating

64
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:34.060
and supplying an army.

65
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.620
And it's that latter task that I'm going to focus on at the moment.

66
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:42.190
I'm going to be looking at how the continental Congress created and supplied the

67
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:45.430
continental army because in a lot of ways,

68
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.760
when you look at all of the complications and controversies surrounding the

69
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:52.510
creation of the continental army,

70
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.020
you get a great case study of many of the problems that were at the heart of any

71
00:04:58.451 --> 00:05:02.230
effort at unity between the colonies and then the states.

72
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.390
And not surprisingly,

73
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:07.810
it's we're going to see down the road in this chorus when we talk more about the

74
00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:12.790
1718 many of these problems certainly did persist as problems,

75
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:14.050
not only through the revolution,

76
00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:18.880
but through the 1780s through the nation's first decades and in some cases long

77
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:21.070
thereafter.
So in a sense,

78
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.850
you can look at the creation of the continental army as a kind of case study and

79
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:28.000
some of the problems involved with creating an American Union.

80
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.453
Now,

81
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.720
given what I've just said about problems inherent creating a union,

82
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.700
it's not surprising that one of the first problems to present itself as far as

83
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:43.120
the continental army is concerned was regionalism.

84
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.310
I'm going to talk in a moment about localism,

85
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:48.150
but for now and then talk about regionalism.
Um,

86
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.230
you might think that in a moment of crisis,

87
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:53.710
regionalism might entirely fall by the wayside.

88
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.850
And I suppose in some ways it did,
but definitely not completely.

89
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.150
And as I'm going to talk about it in a moment,
you can see this,

90
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:06.050
particularly when you talk about the issue of who's going to command the

91
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:08.350
continental army.
Um,

92
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.470
I remember when I was first working on my book,

93
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:14.780
which is about politics and the 1790s.

94
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.820
And I thought without looking into it very much that what I was going to find

95
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:23.540
when I started looking at letters from the period was that there'd be this

96
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.140
little honeymoon nationalism moment where everyone thought,
you know,
well,

97
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:29.810
we just created a constitution and we're not sure about if it,

98
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.870
let's hang in there and be national together.

99
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.990
Let's not really focus on regionalism for just a little while.

100
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:39.140
And then maybe there'd be this little honeymoon moment and then that might sort

101
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:40.010
of wane.

102
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:43.790
And then people would get more back into their entrenched sort of regional

103
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:48.440
outlooks.
And what I found is that no,
there wasn't a honeymoon nationalism.
It,

104
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.101
it just,

105
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:53.450
it never happened that even as soon as that the national government is launched

106
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.540
in the 1790s,
even when people have decided to commit,

107
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:59.150
at least for the present to this new constitution,

108
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:02.770
they were still thinking about,
Whoa,
southerners.
I don't know if,

109
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.380
what trust the northerners,
northerners,
I don't know if I trust the southerners.

110
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.600
I remember finding a letter,
um,

111
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.840
from one southern to another southerner from like the first year or two that the

112
00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:18.290
government was in existence and the one southerner says to the other,
um,

113
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:18.831
you know,

114
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:23.831
I think we should try as hard as we can to get as many young men in clerkships

115
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.160
in this new government as possible because then they're going to gradually be

116
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:30.890
promoted into higher offices and sooner or later,

117
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.490
southern men will be in control of most of the national offices,

118
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.240
which is much better than being governed by a bunch of arrogant northerners.

119
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.421
Okay.

120
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:42.200
This is like the government hasn't even been in existence yet for two years and

121
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:45.710
already people are like,
ah,
I don't know about that other,
those northerners.

122
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:50.060
So it doesn't,
it waxes and wanes.
It doesn't go away.
Um,

123
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:55.120
and so it's not surprising given that that it pops up right at the outset of the

124
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.740
whole revolutionary enterprise,

125
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.520
particularly when people were thinking about a commander in chief of the

126
00:08:01.521 --> 00:08:04.880
continental army.
Now obviously in and of itself,

127
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:09.050
it's an important decision you where you want the right man for that job.

128
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.860
But it was complicated by regional concerns.

129
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.950
Basically many new Englanders felt that since during this early period of the

130
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:22.580
war,
most of the military action was happening in New England.

131
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.430
Basically all the hostilities we've been talking about,

132
00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:27.380
much of it certainly is going on in New England,

133
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.150
that a new Englander would be the logical choice to lead the army.

134
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.700
And some people even had the sneaking suspicion that maybe new Englanders would

135
00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:41.820
we be willing to fight under anybody else?
Um,

136
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.870
people thought about the way that the new England militia operated as units.
Um,

137
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.720
one of the striking things about the new England militia was that they actually

138
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.360
elected their officers,
right.

139
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.130
It wasn't like someone was sort of enforced upon them as an officer.

140
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.130
Militia units elected their own officers.

141
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.420
So given that the fat was given,
that kind of military culture,

142
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.540
having a southerner thrust upon them might not be welcomed with open arms by New

143
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.270
England troops on a much more minor note.

144
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:15.630
Complicating matters was that not only did some people think I know England or

145
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:16.650
made the most sense,

146
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.930
but also John Hancock and some of his friends actually thought that he was the

147
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:23.910
guy who should be commander in chief.

148
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:26.910
They had pretty much already decided John Hancock,
he's the man.

149
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.330
Just a matter of time before he gets nominated and made commander in chief of

150
00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:33.060
the army.
So for a variety of reasons,

151
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:38.061
some people thought maybe a southerner would not work as commander in chief.

152
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.360
But on the other hand,

153
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:43.710
there were other people who felt just the opposite who actually thought that

154
00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:48.630
because a lot of what had been happening so far had been going on in New England

155
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.060
and that new Englanders had been doing a lot of the fighting,

156
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:56.160
all the more reason to promote unity among the colonies by finding someone who

157
00:09:56.161 --> 00:09:57.360
wasn't a new Englander,

158
00:09:57.361 --> 00:10:01.440
by fighting a southerner to be commander in chief and suggested this was a joint

159
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.740
continental effort and not some New England war.

160
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.200
And this kind of logic,

161
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:11.190
this kind of wondering about how do you balance out positions,

162
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:14.760
officerships cabinet offices,
diplomatic posts.

163
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.940
This goes on and on and on throughout this period that people are always very

164
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:21.180
concerned whether you're talking about military positions or whether you're

165
00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:25.680
talking about civil positions.
Um,
even presidents had the same problem.

166
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.700
Washington certainly has it throughout the war as commander in chief was this

167
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:34.050
constant concern about trying to balance things out regionally.

168
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.810
Not just,
oh,
because it would seem fair,

169
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.050
but actually if you think about the fact that a union,

170
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.860
whether you're talking about the 1770s the seventies eighties or the 1790s if

171
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:46.830
you think about the fact that whatever he kind of union you have,

172
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:52.310
it's pretty weak if you actually don't think about things like balancing between

173
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:55.950
regions and in different positions of responsibility and authority.

174
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.360
The fear was that may parts of the union that didn't feel included and didn't

175
00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:01.171
feel represented.

176
00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:06.030
My actually just pull out of the union and throughout this period actually later

177
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:10.830
than one would think that was a constant threat that the sections of the of the

178
00:11:10.831 --> 00:11:14.670
union would threaten to pull out because they felt that they weren't really

179
00:11:14.671 --> 00:11:19.200
being included as important members sort of again and again at key moments.

180
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.370
There's a little sort of threat of succession that raises its head and then is

181
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.300
sort of shoved back down until finally it raises its head and it's not shoved

182
00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:30.630
back down.
But certainly that was a logical fear.

183
00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:35.160
And so wondering about balance was a problem for anyone who is in any position

184
00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:37.740
of authority or command throughout this period.

185
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.860
So in the case of the army commander in chief,

186
00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:43.770
obviously this is a big and typical kind of a decision.

187
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:49.250
So some favor Handcock others favored of Virginia named George Washington.

188
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:56.380
Um,
we've already seen Washington did have military experience as an officer

189
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.270
fighting during the French and Indian war.

190
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.570
He made a few choices that perhaps were not the best.
However,

191
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:06.571
he was someone who did have extensive military experience fighting alongside or

192
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:10.750
as part of the British army.
He also was a person,

193
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:13.630
he really did kind of have a commanding presence.

194
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:18.630
He was someone who seemed like he ought to be a military leader.

195
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:23.860
Um,
couple,
gosh,
it's probably couple of years ago.
Um,

196
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:29.170
I went,
I was giving a talk at,
at Mount Vernon and they have a new,
um,

197
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.010
like a sort of museum education center at Mount Vernon,

198
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:35.770
which is actually really big,
really impressive.
Um,

199
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.800
and one of the things that they did was they created three life scale,

200
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.590
exact models of George Washington,
that sort of key moments.

201
00:12:44.591 --> 00:12:49.060
So you have Washington as a surveyor,
Washington during the revolution,

202
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.910
Washington taking the oath of office as president and they,
I mean,

203
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:54.760
like literally like measured its skull and did whatever they had to do to make

204
00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:58.930
it like exact George Washington.
So,
you know,
I'm the historian,

205
00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:01.450
I'm giving the talk.
I'm like,
Oh,
a little bit of time for the talk.

206
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:04.780
I'll go wander around the visitor center and I see,
you know,
there's Washington,

207
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:07.590
a surveyor,
Huh.
Wow.
Who would've thought I would've seen there is,

208
00:13:07.591 --> 00:13:11.170
it's kind of realistic looking and then I wander into the revolution room and

209
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.110
okay,
it's for however long I've been studying this period.

210
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:19.740
You see a bazillion times people will say the man was an impressive figure on a

211
00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:20.471
horse.

212
00:13:20.471 --> 00:13:23.530
Like everyone finds a way of saying that he was an impressive figure on the

213
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:27.100
horse up on that white horse.
What a man,
you know,
one way or another.

214
00:13:27.101 --> 00:13:30.910
Everyone sort of,
ah,
and I thought,
yeah,
yeah,
okay.
I know this impressive,

215
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.190
whereas a finger on the heart.
So I walk into this room,

216
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.720
there's Washington on the horse,
and without even thinking,
I said,
wow,

217
00:13:37.721 --> 00:13:42.490
he's an impressive figure.
I was like,
okay,
it must be true.

218
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.240
I couldn't help myself,
like really impressive.

219
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.900
So he looked like someone who ought to be in command.

220
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.230
Um,
another useful thing about George Washington,
and you'll see it's,

221
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.630
it's a little complicated.
Um,

222
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:02.440
but he didn't seem ambitious,
but one of the,

223
00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:06.190
one of the overriding assumptions in politics at this time is if you really are

224
00:14:06.191 --> 00:14:09.400
openly power hungry,
if you really are very openly ambitious,

225
00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:11.890
you're the exact person who should not be given power.

226
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.160
Particularly if you're looking at a republic or a confederation or some kind of

227
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:20.020
a form of government that's weak or shaky or knew.

228
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.920
The thought is if you get a power hungry person and you give that person power,

229
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.980
they're very likely to become a tyrant or a desperate and then basically seize

230
00:14:27.981 --> 00:14:31.000
control of the government.
And then poof,
everything is gone.

231
00:14:31.001 --> 00:14:32.410
And now you just have a despotism.

232
00:14:32.411 --> 00:14:35.380
So you don't want to give ambitious people power.

233
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.710
And George Washington though he did have any number of talents and skills and he

234
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.430
though he was certainly ambitious,
as you'll see in a moment.

235
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.400
He wasn't the kind of guy who seemed to be pulling for power.

236
00:14:45.401 --> 00:14:47.470
He wasn't sort of guy who was campaigning for himself.

237
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.380
He wasn't the sort of guy who sort of pushing himself into situations.

238
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.410
He really had kind of a modest demeanor in,

239
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:57.350
in how he presented himself when up for some kind of an office.

240
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:01.850
And a great example of that is what happens when he shows up to the continental

241
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:05.660
congress and he's been named a delegate to the continental congress and he shows

242
00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:09.450
up and he shows up in his military uniform.
Okay,

243
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.160
he's the only guy in a military uniform,
right?
He shows up like,
hi,

244
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.130
I'm George Washington guy in a uniform,

245
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:20.270
big George think command picture.
You know,
he's not saying anything,

246
00:15:20.271 --> 00:15:23.870
he's not campaigning,
but he's definitely putting the idea out there.
Like,

247
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.270
I'm a military guy and you're looking for one right now,

248
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:30.200
and here I am in my uniform waiting for you to know how to say it was a,

249
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.060
a sort of skillful play on his part to just sort of plant the subliminal message

250
00:15:35.061 --> 00:15:35.870
in everyone's mind.

251
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.870
So surely he wanted to be commander in chief and it ends up being Adams who

252
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.870
nominates Washington for the position of commander in chief,
which really,

253
00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:52.400
really irked John Hancock,
who thought that as a Massachusetts man,

254
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:56.360
when Adam starts talking that obviously Adams must be talking about him.

255
00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.770
So before Adam says,
Washington's names that are Hancock's like,
ha,
yes,
indeed.

256
00:16:00.771 --> 00:16:04.820
That's me.
I deserve this post.
And Adams actually later recall to this,

257
00:16:04.821 --> 00:16:08.210
he says he stood up to nominate Washington.
He says that Washington,

258
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.410
who was sitting near the door of the room,
quote,

259
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.820
as soon as he heard me allude to him from his usual modesty,

260
00:16:13.821 --> 00:16:16.970
darted into the library room.
Okay.
So Adam says up and says,

261
00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:18.530
I want to talk about commander in chief.

262
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:22.790
And Washington goes boohoo out of the room.
Not that anyone will notice.

263
00:16:22.791 --> 00:16:24.290
It's like,
no,
no,
no,
I don't want to be in the room.

264
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:29.420
So Adams presents his reasons as to why he thinks this particular unnamed person

265
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:34.340
would be good for the post of commander in chief Handcock thinks clearly that

266
00:16:34.341 --> 00:16:39.080
Adams has talking about him.
Adam says,
Mr. Hancock,
who was our president,

267
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:40.970
he's presiding over the continental congress,

268
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:46.100
heard me with visible pleasure until I came to describe Washington for the

269
00:16:46.101 --> 00:16:46.934
commander.

270
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:51.260
I never remarked a more sudden and striking change of countenance,

271
00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:56.420
mortification and resentment were expressed as forcibly as his face could

272
00:16:56.421 --> 00:16:59.780
exhibit them.
Okay.
That's a really sort of Nice little moment there.

273
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.330
Hancock was not pleased.
However,

274
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:06.200
Washington was appointed commander in chief of the continental army,

275
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:11.120
June 15th,
1775.
Now,

276
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.580
he may have been a good person for this job.

277
00:17:13.581 --> 00:17:18.050
This is not to say he didn't have regional prejudices of his own.

278
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:19.910
Um,
and I think earlier in the course,

279
00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:23.660
of course I quoted him about new Englanders.
Did I do that?
Yeah.
Okay.

280
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:28.460
I thought so.
Um,
that's,
that quote actually comes from this moment in the course.

281
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.720
That quote comes from in Washington first goes up to New England to take his

282
00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:37.721
position as commander in chief and meet this New England army that has been made

283
00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:42.590
commander of,
and his response to looking at the army is what I quoted before.

284
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.980
New Englanders are an exceeding dirty and nasty people.
Okay.

285
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.890
That's George Washington,
father of our country,

286
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.620
of the continental army on the army that he is just inherited.

287
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.890
So he's not exactly thrilled.

288
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:59.760
He doesn't eat that isn't necessarily commanded men like this before.

289
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:04.620
And he's also a little,
um,
I didn't know what the right word is.

290
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.463
Befuddled.

291
00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:10.860
I'm struck by the mood or the way in which these troops conduct themselves.

292
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.870
Um,
as I mentioned before,
you know,
New England,

293
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.310
it's like a town meeting government kind of a place and they're electing their

294
00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:21.970
officers and their military units to Washington.
This,
he just cook.

295
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.480
This did not make sense electing an officer.

296
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.020
Like what kind of authority does an elected officer have?

297
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.640
He didn't like the idea was pretty foreign as far as military thinking goes to

298
00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:33.474
Washington.

299
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:38.370
And he wasn't entirely sure that he could actually tell the officer's apart from

300
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.480
the common soldiers,

301
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:42.210
which is probably true if they're electing people from their midst.

302
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:47.630
So Washington definitely saw new Englanders as unfamiliar to say the least when

303
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:51.060
he took command of the army.
Again,
regionalism,

304
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:57.030
regionalism was also apparent in just the mere appearance of the soldiers.

305
00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:02.370
They came from ultimately different parts of the confederation.

306
00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:06.660
Um,
some of the more striking looking people came from the frontier frontier

307
00:19:06.661 --> 00:19:09.860
riflemen from Virginia and I think Pennsylvania as well.
Um,

308
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.480
these were guys who are dressed in hunting shirts.

309
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.450
They didn't have formal uniforms,
they didn't carry muskets,

310
00:19:15.451 --> 00:19:18.810
but instead they carried rifles which are assumed to be sharp shooting,

311
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.530
sharper shooting,
I guess than a musket was.
Um,

312
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:27.240
some of them carried Tomahawks and they were very proud of their shooting
skills.

313
00:19:27.241 --> 00:19:31.740
They were kind of a wild bunch.
Um,
there's a,
um,

314
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:35.400
rather eccentric American general who will come up again in the course.

315
00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:37.260
His name is Charles Lee.
Um,

316
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.860
and he always referred to the riflemen quote as that damned riff Raff.

317
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.820
He just thought they were these wild and crazy guys from add on the frontier

318
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.450
armed with rifles.
So,
and Lee,
I should note,

319
00:19:48.451 --> 00:19:52.890
I'll mention Lee again later.
Um,
Lee,
he's,

320
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.980
everyone describes him as eccentric,
even lead,
describes himself as eccentric,

321
00:19:55.981 --> 00:20:00.240
but maybe one of the more eccentric things about Charles Lee was that he had a

322
00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:04.530
pack of dogs that he loved and that followed him everywhere he went.

323
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.700
I mean,
everywhere you went.
I mean,
if he went into a ladies parlour,

324
00:20:08.701 --> 00:20:13.620
he had six dogs,
you know,
if he went into a lady's private chamber,

325
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.270
apparently he had six dogs.

326
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:20.010
So it was not particularly popular with the female kind.
Um,
and he's,
uh,

327
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:24.000
he's an eccentric individual for a variety of reasons and he ends up having a

328
00:20:24.001 --> 00:20:27.890
bad,
bad moment during the revolution,
which we'll come to.
But,
um,
anyway,

329
00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:28.560
so Charles,

330
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.640
if Charles leads calling people that Damn River that actually says something.

331
00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:36.600
So anyway,
the riflemen were kind of a wild crew.

332
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.170
They saw themselves as the elite of the army because of their shooting skills.

333
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.890
Um,

334
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:45.870
they actually spent some time sort of taking pot shots at British officers on

335
00:20:45.871 --> 00:20:48.610
the line until the British officers realized that there were these kinds of

336
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.960
crazy rifle mid taking shots at them and it would be good not to be out in the

337
00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:57.220
open anymore.
Um,
they also just like shooting off their guns for fun.

338
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.580
Ammunition supplies were very low and this was not a good idea.

339
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.670
I'll come back to this in a minute,
but they were a little bit wild.
Um,

340
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.140
and they did not necessarily like to be disciplined.
So for example,

341
00:21:08.141 --> 00:21:12.340
in one instance there was one Virginia rifleman who was arrested for not

342
00:21:12.341 --> 00:21:17.170
listening to orders and other riflemen stormed the jail and freed him.
Okay,

343
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.920
wait,
this is not intense military discipline taking place here at this time.

344
00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:22.870
And of course on the other hand,

345
00:21:22.871 --> 00:21:26.200
you couldn't give all kinds of privileges to the riflemen because then all the

346
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:29.770
other troops would say,
well,
why are those guys getting treated special?
You know,

347
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:31.330
like they're better than us.
So,

348
00:21:31.331 --> 00:21:34.930
so the army's kind of clinical Hama ration of different kinds of people,

349
00:21:34.931 --> 00:21:39.250
different places,
even different uniforms that just different behavior.

350
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:45.250
So you can see just in the matter of managing an army,

351
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:49.420
regionalism can add complications and problems.

352
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.230
It's also a problem in a slightly different form,

353
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:56.020
and I'm going to call it localism cause I mean it in a slightly different way

354
00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:58.390
than I mean regionalism.
And,

355
00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:02.530
and what I mean by local ism is people often tended to think of their own

356
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:07.420
locality first and foremost rather than necessarily than of the good of the

357
00:22:07.421 --> 00:22:09.610
entire American cause.

358
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.800
So people thought about wherever they were from first and foremost and along

359
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:15.790
similar lines,

360
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:21.120
they were distrustful about surrendering local authority to any kind of a

361
00:22:21.401 --> 00:22:25.690
centralized authority.
Now in the continental army,

362
00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:31.530
obviously this is going to make it extremely complicated to gather together one

363
00:22:31.781 --> 00:22:36.220
United armed force.
Every state had its own militia.

364
00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:40.960
State legislatures want it to stay in control of their own militias.

365
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.650
Some of these militias stayed separate from the continental army.

366
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.580
They states certainly didn't want to surrender control of their own military

367
00:22:48.581 --> 00:22:52.960
defense to some kind of central organization that wouldn't necessarily put their

368
00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:54.160
interests first.

369
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:59.460
So the very idea of combining some of these militias into one big United one in

370
00:22:59.801 --> 00:23:04.720
a sense,
the continental army with controversial and at the start of the war,

371
00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:09.250
in many ways the army was kind of a collection of separate little military

372
00:23:09.251 --> 00:23:10.084
delegations,

373
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:14.050
just like the continental congress and some ways was a collection of separate,

374
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.330
separate little state delegations.

375
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:22.530
This same fear about surrendering local control and about protecting local

376
00:23:22.751 --> 00:23:27.310
interests made it extremely difficult for the continental congress to organize

377
00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.940
and orchestrate the war effort.
Because as a body,

378
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.800
the continental congress had virtually no power of enforcement.

379
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:40.060
It could advise the states,
it could ask them for things,

380
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.980
it could make recommendations,

381
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:47.160
it could not order a state to do something and then enforce that order.

382
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.730
It had no real power of enforcement.

383
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:55.360
And this came to be a particularly big problem when it came to supplying the

384
00:23:55.731 --> 00:23:56.564
army.

385
00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:02.470
Given that the states didn't rush forward to supply soldiers from other states,

386
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:07.610
supplying the continental army in any kind of a reliable way,

387
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.310
sometimes was virtually impossible.

388
00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:15.980
So whatever the congress tried to do in the way of making requests,
requests,

389
00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:19.010
or making recommendations about supplies,
like,
you know,

390
00:24:19.011 --> 00:24:24.011
we recommend that each state provide x pounds of food and x number of blankets

391
00:24:24.861 --> 00:24:28.970
for the use of the continental army.
You just absolutely couldn't tell on a,

392
00:24:28.971 --> 00:24:33.440
on the reality level what would happen as a result of that kind of an order.

393
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:39.100
And this was a big problem because there was an enormous supply shortage in the

394
00:24:39.141 --> 00:24:42.620
continental army as well as in the local militias.

395
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:48.340
The scale of supplies required by this army was huge.

396
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.640
So for example,
during three months,

397
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:57.670
December of 1777 and January and February of 1778 so during the three month

398
00:24:57.951 --> 00:25:02.240
period,
the army eight more than 2 million pounds of beef,

399
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:07.640
2 million pounds of flour and their horses,
eight 2 million tons of Hay.

400
00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:09.860
Okay?
That's a lot of supplies,

401
00:25:09.861 --> 00:25:14.330
particularly if you have no really organized way to get it.

402
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:20.150
And American started the war deficient in almost every necessity.
Guns,

403
00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:24.830
ammunition,
Flint,
artillery,
steel for bayonets,

404
00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.620
clothing,
tents,
blankets.

405
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:33.170
The solution obviously would be for the continental Congress to organize some

406
00:25:33.171 --> 00:25:37.070
kind of a central supply system,
which they tried to do.
But again,

407
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:38.810
without being able to enforce things,

408
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.840
that was not a very effective way to proceed.

409
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.940
This wasn't all congress' fault.
Congress wasn't very good at the implementation.

410
00:25:46.941 --> 00:25:50.750
The actual shortage of supplies,
ironically enough in part,

411
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.050
was caused by the fact that British imports,

412
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.680
we're no longer being taken right in the colonies and the states,

413
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.860
so that the states have been so busy like saying,
no,

414
00:26:00.861 --> 00:26:05.150
we do not want those evil British imported goods.
Now they're like,
oh,

415
00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:10.520
we kind of might have been able to use some of that stuff now that we're

416
00:26:10.521 --> 00:26:15.020
actually fighting the British.
Um,
so in time they,
when the,

417
00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:18.170
the states began to encourage other countries to bring imported goods,

418
00:26:18.171 --> 00:26:21.110
this became a little bit less extreme.
But that is sort of a weird,

419
00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:25.970
ironic problem that arose when the war broke out.
In the meantime,

420
00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.980
there were some American soldiers fighting with spears,
fighting with Tomahawks.

421
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.520
Benjamin Franklin apparently thought that bows and arrows might be a really good

422
00:26:34.521 --> 00:26:38.960
idea.
Um,
and he was serious and he calculated,
okay,

423
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.310
it's a calculating guy.
You remember?

424
00:26:40.311 --> 00:26:43.290
He's the guy who backed away from George Whitefield to see how far,
okay,

425
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.430
so he's calculating again,
and he calculated this time that you could,

426
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:52.770
single soldier could shoot off four arrows in the time that it took him to load

427
00:26:52.771 --> 00:26:56.670
and fire his gun so that maybe it's even a great idea to have the soldiers

428
00:26:56.671 --> 00:26:59.520
fighting with bows and arrows that didn't necessarily go very far,

429
00:26:59.521 --> 00:27:00.870
but he was thinking about it

430
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.350
as long as the states were so wary about surrendering control to Congress

431
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.130
supplies really where a seemingly insurmountable problem,

432
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:16.290
and there are actually stories of Washington's aids literally going farmhouse to

433
00:27:16.291 --> 00:27:21.291
farmhouse and knocking on doors to ask people for blankets and supplies and

434
00:27:21.541 --> 00:27:23.010
wagons and whatever they could get.
I mean,

435
00:27:23.011 --> 00:27:26.070
literally the army sometimes was reduced to that level.

436
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.520
Given that kind of problem.

437
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:34.910
It makes sense that the experience of fighting the war convinced many people

438
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.940
that there did need to be something stronger,

439
00:27:38.941 --> 00:27:43.941
something more centralized at the center of whatever kind of confederation was

440
00:27:44.611 --> 00:27:45.970
forming.
Um,

441
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.530
and particularly people who were at military headquarters with Washington,

442
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:54.180
which includes Alexander Hamilton since they were the guys who were seeing

443
00:27:54.181 --> 00:27:58.440
problems with supplies and how Congress couldn't seem to do anything forcefully

444
00:27:58.441 --> 00:27:59.274
and efficiently.

445
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.550
It's not surprising that many of those people ended up being really strong

446
00:28:02.551 --> 00:28:06.630
nationalists who really wanted a stronger centralized government,

447
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.840
Hamilton frustrated at headquarters.

448
00:28:09.841 --> 00:28:12.720
Just seeing what he saw as this sort of amazing,

449
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:17.900
potentially deadly inefficiency of the continental Congress really early in the

450
00:28:18.421 --> 00:28:22.590
war.
He's already coming forward and saying we need a stronger centralized power.

451
00:28:22.591 --> 00:28:26.400
We need a stronger centralized power even before anyone is really tough thinking

452
00:28:26.401 --> 00:28:29.390
about,
hmm,
what kind of government comes later,
you know,

453
00:28:29.391 --> 00:28:31.620
how has and sort of already out there pounding away.

454
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.800
And it's partly based on his real life experience of what it's like to try and

455
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:42.090
be governed by the continental army while being in the army during a time of

456
00:28:42.091 --> 00:28:46.500
war.
So this is basically an interesting and important point.

457
00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:49.050
It'll come up again towards the end of the course,

458
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:54.410
but basically they were real life experiences behind people's theoretical ideas

459
00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.060
about what kind of government would be desirable for the new American nation.

460
00:29:00.061 --> 00:29:03.490
When we get to the part of the course where we're talking about,
um,

461
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.890
the constitution and different ideas and sort of what led up to it and why

462
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:09.720
people thought one thing or thought another thing.

463
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:14.840
Some of those ideas are not sort of high falutin sort of detached thoughts about

464
00:29:15.631 --> 00:29:16.231
federalism,

465
00:29:16.231 --> 00:29:20.640
but they're actually based on real life experiences and real lessons and people

466
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.540
looking at what has been happening and then drawing conclusions and coming to

467
00:29:24.541 --> 00:29:25.440
different conclusions,

468
00:29:25.441 --> 00:29:30.240
but still drawing conclusions based on what they've just experienced about what

469
00:29:30.241 --> 00:29:33.180
should be happening next.
Okay.

470
00:29:33.181 --> 00:29:35.730
So basically centralized coordination,

471
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.340
scary thing for the states.

472
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:42.130
Not good news for organizing a continental army.

473
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:48.210
Neither was the complete lack of a precedent for what the congress was doing in

474
00:29:48.851 --> 00:29:52.540
organizing this war.
If you think about Great Britain,

475
00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:57.150
think about all of the sophisticated administrative machinery that they would

476
00:29:57.151 --> 00:29:58.930
have had there for conducting a war.

477
00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:03.340
And then think about the American states that have really nothing in place.

478
00:30:03.341 --> 00:30:05.590
They're really starting from scratch.

479
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.720
And the people in Congress who are responsible for organizing the army,

480
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:15.870
we're not men with vast military experience of the roughly 65 congressmen that

481
00:30:18.071 --> 00:30:23.071
were in attendance in 1775 and 1776 only five had served with the British during

482
00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:26.230
the French and Indian war.

483
00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.790
Only one of these five had real experience in supplies.

484
00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:36.090
And that experience tainted back to 1759 none really had experience with medical

485
00:30:36.851 --> 00:30:38.830
matters in a time of war.

486
00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:43.840
Only two had any medical training and they were not on the medical committee.

487
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.420
So bureaucracy,
even at an early point,

488
00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.620
let's take the two medical guys and put them on the Green Committee.
I know.

489
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:57.550
So basically you have a bunch of people here who are trying to figure out from

490
00:30:57.551 --> 00:31:00.250
scratch how to create a coordinated army effort.

491
00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.650
By 1778,

492
00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:07.420
Congress began to try to improve its administrative structure and it did begin

493
00:31:07.421 --> 00:31:11.140
to create boards of war and boards of Admiralty.
Um,

494
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.860
but even once they started to have an organized administrative force,

495
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.670
habits of individual congressmen were unpredictable.

496
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.800
There wasn't even a way to enforce attendance to the continental Congress.

497
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:24.581
And again,

498
00:31:24.581 --> 00:31:28.180
sometimes continental congressmen thought that what was happening at home

499
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:33.070
demanded their attention more than whatever was going on with the continental

500
00:31:33.071 --> 00:31:33.461
congress.

501
00:31:33.461 --> 00:31:38.461
So they just didn't show up to the point that in April of 1778,

502
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:43.750
Congress actually circulated a written statement that was titled Engagement of

503
00:31:43.751 --> 00:31:46.490
members to meet punctually.
Okay.
The Gut,

504
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:49.760
they actually published a little reminder saying,
uh,

505
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:54.280
we really need you guys to come to the congress.
I mean,

506
00:31:54.281 --> 00:31:56.980
we're kind of having a war and bad things are happening.
We really,

507
00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:59.560
we'd like you to be here so you can actually do things.

508
00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:02.770
Even just attendance sometimes could be a problem.

509
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:07.240
And that really didn't accomplish very much.
As one historian wrote,

510
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:11.620
Congress was too inefficient to correct its own inefficiency.

511
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:16.510
That's not good.
Okay.
So obviously things are,

512
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.370
are somewhat unpredictable.

513
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:23.110
Occasionally random and this made congressional control and organization a

514
00:32:23.111 --> 00:32:25.270
problem throughout the war

515
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:31.480
and it wasn't just congressmen who are inexperienced with this kind of issue and

516
00:32:31.481 --> 00:32:34.720
we're having problems with the whole question of supplies.

517
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:38.650
Supply issues were complicated by the behavior of soldiers,

518
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.710
many of whom for the most part had not ever been soldiers before.

519
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.020
So they're also not following any precedent.

520
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.210
It's not like they're a trained military force.

521
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:51.860
And many of them were often far more interested in protecting their locality

522
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:56.420
than in anything else and their behavior in battles when far from home with

523
00:32:56.421 --> 00:32:58.520
sometimes not ideal.

524
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.600
Also because they were not always sure what they were doing.

525
00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:06.170
They were not very careful with the supplies that they were given.

526
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:11.270
Like the riflemen,
they fired off their guns for fun.
Um,
they sold,

527
00:33:11.271 --> 00:33:15.080
sometimes they're closing ammunition if they needed cash.
Um,

528
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.960
when they were beating a hasty retreat,

529
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:22.220
they tended to just throw anything that was heavy and getting in their way on

530
00:33:22.221 --> 00:33:27.221
the ground as they ran one soldier who returned to a place where the army,

531
00:33:28.251 --> 00:33:29.870
the continental army had just retreated,

532
00:33:29.871 --> 00:33:33.650
said the ground was literally covered with arms,

533
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:38.090
knapsacks staves,
coats,
hats,
and old oil flask.
I mean,
these people,

534
00:33:38.091 --> 00:33:42.290
they just dropped things and ran and left them on the field.

535
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:44.120
So there's,

536
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:47.150
there's no precedent in so many levels for what we're talking about here.

537
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.780
There was no precedent for an organized continental army.

538
00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:54.920
There was no precedent for an organized continental army administration.

539
00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.220
So troops had to learn how to behave like an army while already fighting a war,

540
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:05.510
which leads to another problem at the start of the war.

541
00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:10.160
And that is the problem of what certainly one or two European visitors saw as

542
00:34:10.161 --> 00:34:13.700
the attitude of the American troops.

543
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:16.430
In part,
as I just suggested,

544
00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:20.630
many soldiers were just ignorant about military operations,

545
00:34:20.631 --> 00:34:23.990
about how an army was supposed to be organized.
They hadn't been soldiers.

546
00:34:23.991 --> 00:34:26.120
They didn't know how an army was supposed to work.

547
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:30.050
They had to be trained from scratch.
Now,

548
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:35.080
Baron von Steuben was a foreign volunteer that arrived in the states in 1777.

549
00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:41.960
Specifically,
he was given the task of training the continental army.

550
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:45.830
He was someone who had experience with European armies.

551
00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:49.350
He was given the task of training the American troops,
um,

552
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:52.010
and didn't speak a lot of English when he first came here.

553
00:34:52.011 --> 00:34:54.200
He actually was much better in French and German.

554
00:34:54.201 --> 00:34:58.220
And so according to people at the time when he was training the troops,
he,

555
00:34:58.221 --> 00:35:02.540
Kristin three different languages at the same time,
English,
French,
German,

556
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:03.890
and I guess he cursed a lot.

557
00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:08.890
I think he was probably a little surprised by what the troops could not do.
Um,

558
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:12.950
supposedly a store had been and others who are trying to train the troops

559
00:35:12.951 --> 00:35:15.100
discovered among other things that,
um,

560
00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.160
it was very hard to teach them people to March because they didn't always

561
00:35:19.161 --> 00:35:21.560
consistently no left foot and right foot.
Right.

562
00:35:21.561 --> 00:35:23.000
If that's something you hadn't thought about before,

563
00:35:23.001 --> 00:35:25.580
I suppose you're not thinking about it as you're walking.
So,

564
00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.670
and I'm such a city slicker here that I don't know the difference.
And I always,

565
00:35:28.671 --> 00:35:31.400
every,
every year when I say was like count on someone in the class,

566
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.060
you think one of you will know to sort of interpret this for me?
Um,

567
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.050
supposedly or at least anecdotally.
Um,

568
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.700
one of the things that they did to train these troops was they tied.
Hey,

569
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:46.260
on one foot and Straw on the other foot.
I said,
hey foot straw foot,

570
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.890
hey foot,
Straw foot.
And that was the way that people were initially taught.

571
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.260
Demarche.
Now of course city slicker me.

572
00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:57.180
What is the difference between Hay and Straw?
I would be bad.

573
00:35:57.181 --> 00:35:58.410
I would be even worse.

574
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:01.410
I would be not knowing how to march in the continental army cause I wouldn't

575
00:36:01.411 --> 00:36:02.490
know which was my hey foot.

576
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.940
Does anybody here know the difference between Hay and Straw?
Oh yes.

577
00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:13.730
<v 1>It's pretty much just like the stem of the week.
It's all</v>

578
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.050
grass and I'll be like,
we're animals in it.

579
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:26.360
<v 0>Okay.
So Straw is the,
just the stem of the wheat and Hay.</v>

580
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:31.880
Hey has actual food mixed in?
Thank you very much.

581
00:36:31.881 --> 00:36:35.270
I know there had to be someone who knows something about a farm.

582
00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.580
Thank you very much.
I greatly appreciate that.
Okay,

583
00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.630
I'm writing it down for next time.
We're talking about this.
Okay.

584
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:45.860
I have it written down now.
I might,
my fact for the day that I learned.

585
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:49.610
Thank you very much.
Um,
now it's one story.

586
00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:53.750
It's one of the people who looked at the continental soldiers and commented on

587
00:36:53.751 --> 00:36:57.170
what he took to be a particularly American attitude.

588
00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:02.120
Supposedly what story been said was in the Prussian army officers said to a

589
00:37:02.121 --> 00:37:04.640
soldier,
do this and he does it,

590
00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:09.140
but I am obliged to say this is the reason why you want to do that.

591
00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:10.750
And then he does it.

592
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.140
The Americans are operating in a slightly different way from,

593
00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:18.290
from what he considers a traditional European armies behavior.
Basically,

594
00:37:18.291 --> 00:37:20.900
Americans didn't always respond well to orders.

595
00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.150
They wanted to take part in decisions.

596
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:25.460
They wanted their opinions to be represented.

597
00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:29.060
Obviously this kind of political sensibility could present problems if you're

598
00:37:29.061 --> 00:37:31.280
trying to command men in an army.

599
00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:35.780
It also created problems with terms of enlistment.

600
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:41.240
Soldiers tended to sign on for one year at a time and when the year was over,

601
00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.130
they just often went home.

602
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:47.960
They were in the army by choice and they felt that they basically had no need to

603
00:37:47.961 --> 00:37:51.200
listen to any kind of higher command telling them to stay.

604
00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.630
We'll see you a little bit later in a future lecture.

605
00:37:53.631 --> 00:37:57.290
Washington literally pleading with the man,
please don't go home.

606
00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:59.960
I know you can go home.
Please don't go home.

607
00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:04.130
Please stay just a little bit longer.
So for example,

608
00:38:04.131 --> 00:38:08.900
at the end of 1775,
a big chunk of the army just packed up and went home.

609
00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:14.350
So America essentially changed armies at the beginning of 1776 found new men and

610
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.400
listed them for another one year term and it was assumed that at the end of

611
00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.810
another year the same thing would happen again.

612
00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:25.670
It took a while before Congress agreed to try and regulate and linkedin terms of

613
00:38:25.671 --> 00:38:26.504
enlistment.

614
00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:32.630
There was a similar problem involved with social rank and military rank.
Um,

615
00:38:32.631 --> 00:38:37.480
I've already mentioned very early in the course that social rank hierarchy in

616
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:40.540
the colonies was a little bit more slippery than in England.

617
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.650
So that while there certainly was an elite in the colonies and the states,

618
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:49.651
there was a disorder of entrenched to the manor born aristocratic class as there

619
00:38:50.051 --> 00:38:51.340
would have been in England.

620
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:55.390
And the difference between a gentleman and a more common man could sometimes be

621
00:38:55.391 --> 00:38:57.370
hard to tell.
Well,

622
00:38:57.371 --> 00:39:02.080
Washington wanted gentlemen to serve as commanding officers.

623
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:07.230
Basically he wanted to use social rank to enforce military rank thinking that if

624
00:39:08.171 --> 00:39:10.630
you respected someone as your social superior,

625
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.720
you'd probably respect him as your military superior as Washington put it.

626
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:20.350
The true criteria of judgment about who should be an officer when past services

627
00:39:20.351 --> 00:39:24.820
do not enter into the competition is whether the candidate for office has adjust

628
00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.860
pretension to the character of a gentlemen,

629
00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:31.250
a proper sense of honor and some reputation to lose,
right?

630
00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.580
Vsm reputation to lose,
he's going to worry about losing it.

631
00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:37.480
So there's a logic for having an officer.
Now,

632
00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:41.650
this may sound logical by 18th century terms is kind of logic,

633
00:39:41.651 --> 00:39:45.370
but it often presented a problem because sometimes there really wasn't all that

634
00:39:45.371 --> 00:39:49.000
much separating socially as far as rank is concerned,

635
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.550
officers from non officers and again,

636
00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:55.000
think about the new Englanders promoting people from within their own.

637
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:59.170
Sometimes there wasn't really much of a social rank differentiating officers at

638
00:39:59.171 --> 00:40:02.160
all.
There's one historian who argues that,
um,

639
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:06.670
one of the reason why there was dueling prevalent among some of the younger

640
00:40:06.671 --> 00:40:09.820
officers and the continental army was because they were actually dueling to

641
00:40:09.821 --> 00:40:10.900
prove that they could do it,

642
00:40:10.901 --> 00:40:13.780
which meant that they were actually gentlemen or of the gentleman class,

643
00:40:13.781 --> 00:40:17.590
which meant they were actually better than some of the men they were commanding

644
00:40:17.591 --> 00:40:19.210
who were pretty much,
they're equal.
So,

645
00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:22.240
so dueling was away for these young officers to sort of prove that they deserved

646
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:23.380
to be elite.

647
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:28.150
So we're talking about kind of a fuzzy line here that was not helpful for

648
00:40:28.151 --> 00:40:32.290
Washington and trying to figure out how to get disciplined in order in the army.

649
00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.760
This is certainly not something that you would have found in the British or

650
00:40:36.761 --> 00:40:41.761
French army where social rank and military rank was much more defined and

651
00:40:42.461 --> 00:40:43.121
established.

652
00:40:43.121 --> 00:40:48.121
And it's one of the reason why Europeans came to America to fight during the

653
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:51.910
American revolution.
Some of them came because they were inspired by the cause.

654
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:55.840
Some of them came because they would not have been able to promote themselves in

655
00:40:55.841 --> 00:40:59.230
the British or French army or some other army.

656
00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:03.160
But in the continental army they were Europeans.
They seem sophisticated.

657
00:41:03.161 --> 00:41:05.650
They seem to have experienced,
they could go to the continental army,

658
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.130
say that they would fight for the cause if they were given a commission as an

659
00:41:09.131 --> 00:41:10.720
officer and they'd be given one.

660
00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:15.970
And this was enormously demoralizing for some of the continental army officers

661
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.500
who are not being promoted.

662
00:41:17.501 --> 00:41:20.620
They watch these people come in from other countries and be promoted above them.

663
00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:24.960
Um,
Alexander Hamilton said it gave him pygmy feelings this,

664
00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:27.550
this idea that these foreigners could come in because they were supposedly

665
00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:29.950
better than us and then get promoted over us.

666
00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:34.460
And we were just a bunch of rustic boobs and we didn't get as quickly as they

667
00:41:34.461 --> 00:41:37.070
did.
So some people from foreign countries,

668
00:41:37.071 --> 00:41:41.540
we're actually taking advantage of the sort of ambiguity in the states at the

669
00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:46.460
time.
Okay.
So looking at the process of organizing a war,

670
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:51.020
we've seen regionalism and localism and action working against centralized

671
00:41:51.021 --> 00:41:53.090
control and organization.

672
00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:58.480
We've seen complications of social rack and the sort of individualism of the

673
00:41:58.521 --> 00:42:02.170
troops and making it hard again to organize and command.
Um,

674
00:42:02.171 --> 00:42:04.520
and overall we've seen a congress that all in all,

675
00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:09.590
it doesn't have that much power really struggling to exert some kind of

676
00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:13.700
centralized control over a continental war effort.

677
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:18.410
So in essence the things that were complicating unity between the colonies and

678
00:42:18.411 --> 00:42:23.060
then the states are the same things logically that are going to complicate and

679
00:42:23.061 --> 00:42:27.350
confuse efforts to create some kind of continental war effort.

680
00:42:27.351 --> 00:42:31.880
We'll see this continuing in a different way in the seventies and eighties.

681
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:34.850
Now we've been looking at,
I want to just take a few minutes here.

682
00:42:34.851 --> 00:42:37.790
We've been looking at some of the realities of the continental army.

683
00:42:37.791 --> 00:42:40.220
I brought in a handout.
Um,

684
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:43.550
partly because I'm very low tech and so I didn't bring a computer,

685
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:47.630
but partly because I actually really wanted you to hold this in your hands.
Um,

686
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.730
and while it's being passed out,

687
00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:51.980
I'll talk about what it is before you get your hands on it.

688
00:42:51.981 --> 00:42:56.660
It's actually a newspaper,
a Connecticut newspaper from July eight,

689
00:42:56.661 --> 00:43:00.230
1776.
It's the entire newspaper,
as you will see.

690
00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.870
It's a little bit smaller than it would have been,

691
00:43:02.871 --> 00:43:07.160
but not tremendously smaller than it would have been.
Um,
but as you'll see,

692
00:43:07.161 --> 00:43:11.850
it's it,
it's called the weekly,
you know,
so it came out once a week.
Um,

693
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:16.840
it is four pages long.
I'll wait as it sort of gets passed out here.
Um,
it,

694
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.330
this particular one is the Connecticut current.

695
00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:24.410
It was printed in Hartford.
Um,
and as I mentioned the date,

696
00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:29.270
July 8th,
1776.
Um,
so as you're getting it,

697
00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:33.650
you'll notice you look at the,
um,
front page and me get my coffee here.

698
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:39.250
Um,
you can see that it contains the freshest advices,

699
00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:43.310
both foreign and domestic.
Okay.
News,
fresh news.

700
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:47.180
And one of the first things that you'll see on the front page and the left hand

701
00:43:47.181 --> 00:43:51.860
column is persons that are being held up to public view as enemies to their

702
00:43:51.861 --> 00:43:53.930
country.
Like right off the cuff,

703
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:58.190
these are probably people who may be were treating with loyalists.

704
00:43:58.191 --> 00:44:03.191
They're supplying the enemy army are denouncing the glocal congress who knows

705
00:44:03.771 --> 00:44:06.290
what they were doing,
but whatever they were doing,
it was bad.

706
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:10.070
And they're being publicly shamed on the front page of this newspaper.

707
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:13.160
And it suggests,
it says confession $1,

708
00:44:13.161 --> 00:44:17.660
which suggest that you could step forward and confess and apologize and pay a

709
00:44:17.661 --> 00:44:20.960
dollar sort of,
okay.
You know,
I won't do it again.

710
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.620
I can't say I've seen any concession,
but certainly many,

711
00:44:24.621 --> 00:44:28.070
many issues of this paper when I was looking through them contain that column

712
00:44:28.071 --> 00:44:32.750
with more people being publicly shamed.
Okay.
So,
um,

713
00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.580
if you look at the paper,
you could see right off the cuff,

714
00:44:35.581 --> 00:44:39.880
you have something being reprinted from a Pennsylvania newspaper.
Um,

715
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:45.140
it actually is a declaration that someone's ranting about the British and then

716
00:44:45.301 --> 00:44:46.140
goes on to say,
you know,

717
00:44:46.141 --> 00:44:50.370
why doesn't the continental Congress reward any British officer who deserves the

718
00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:54.630
British army by giving him land here?
Yeah,
what a great idea.

719
00:44:54.631 --> 00:44:57.210
We'll get them to dessert by promising them land and then they'll come over to

720
00:44:57.211 --> 00:45:00.390
our side and you can see they have different amounts of acres that they're

721
00:45:00.391 --> 00:45:03.510
proposing.
Um,
so it's like a little plan.
I can't say it goes anywhere,

722
00:45:03.511 --> 00:45:05.550
but it's an interesting little plan.
Um,

723
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.390
you could see next if there's news from London dated March 21st.
Okay.

724
00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:10.350
We're July 8th.

725
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:14.820
So there are several things in this paper that are a reminder of how slow news

726
00:45:14.821 --> 00:45:15.411
traveled,

727
00:45:15.411 --> 00:45:19.980
particularly from overseas back to the states and the colonies.

728
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:25.190
This is actually a debate in parliament about the death of an American general,

729
00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:30.030
uh,
General Montgomery,
which moves into being a debate about the rebels.

730
00:45:30.031 --> 00:45:32.070
And you can see capital letters,
rebel,

731
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:35.490
rebel rebellions sort of throughout that column.

732
00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:40.650
Then we've got news from Williamsburg on the bottom there on the third column,

733
00:45:40.651 --> 00:45:42.360
we've got a couple little advertisements.

734
00:45:42.361 --> 00:45:46.050
For a political pamphlet and cash needed for old cloths basically.

735
00:45:46.051 --> 00:45:50.230
So the printing press folk and clean off the presses.
Um,

736
00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.340
one of the things you notice is it,
it's sort of random news,

737
00:45:53.341 --> 00:45:57.340
often printed from other newspapers.
Um,

738
00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.790
they're on the top of the second page from North Carolina.

739
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:04.620
You actually could see that North Carolina is instructing its delegates in the

740
00:46:04.621 --> 00:46:07.320
continental Congress,
um,
that they should,

741
00:46:07.321 --> 00:46:10.020
that they would be able to declare independence.

742
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:13.470
There's kind of a major statement boom right there,
sort of by itself.

743
00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:18.210
No commentary.
Um,
you can see one thing,
actually we're running out of time,

744
00:46:18.211 --> 00:46:20.370
but one of the things you will not see July eight,

745
00:46:20.371 --> 00:46:22.950
1776 is the declaration of independence.

746
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:27.630
It has not gotten here yet in time to be printed and it's actually not till the

747
00:46:27.631 --> 00:46:32.540
next edition on the 15th of July that you see the declaration of independence

748
00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:34.860
actually get printed in this newspaper.
No commentary.

749
00:46:34.861 --> 00:46:38.160
Just sort of like that little North Carolina Declaration,
just boom.

750
00:46:38.161 --> 00:46:42.930
They just sort of printed,
it takes up about two columns and that's it.
Um,

751
00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:47.100
this paper is typical of many and that it would start out having typically,

752
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.840
I suppose this,
this one hasn't mixed,

753
00:46:48.841 --> 00:46:52.440
but sometimes you'd have international news and then national news and then

754
00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:55.830
local news.
And then on the back you'd had that have advertisements.

755
00:46:55.831 --> 00:47:00.090
And in a general way,
this paper's kind of following that trend.

756
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.570
Um,
let's see if there's anything else I want to point out.

757
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.530
You'll see on the third page we've got news from Hartford,

758
00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:10.800
so it's become local by the third page.
Um,

759
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:16.560
you'll see on the third column there deserted Colonel From Colonel John Wards,

760
00:47:16.561 --> 00:47:21.150
regiment one Tilson mills.
It looks like Miller.
I'm sorry,
a drummer.

761
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.970
He's about 30 years old,
five foot six inches high.

762
00:47:23.971 --> 00:47:28.770
It has a peak to Chin and something of a guilty look.
I love that.

763
00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:33.040
You'll see that throughout this column.
And the last page,

764
00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:37.900
there are a couple listings about deserters people looking for deserters.
Um,

765
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.590
you'll see someone,
where is he?

766
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:46.360
He's on the third page.
Um,
Roger on the,

767
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:48.400
on the third column on the third page,

768
00:47:48.401 --> 00:47:53.401
Roger March of Litchfield opposed and spoke against the measures of Congress.

769
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:57.310
He's probably going to be enemy to our country and the first column of the first

770
00:47:57.311 --> 00:48:01.410
page in the next edition of this newspaper.
So basically I,
um,

771
00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:05.530
I've handed this to you just so that you could get a sense of what a typical

772
00:48:05.531 --> 00:48:10.510
newspaper would have looked like.
What you would've seen if you were in Hartford,

773
00:48:10.511 --> 00:48:12.730
Connecticut on July 8th,
1776.

774
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:16.270
This would have been what was at your disposal for whatever was happening in

775
00:48:16.271 --> 00:48:19.450
Connecticut for whatever was happening throughout the states for whatever was

776
00:48:19.451 --> 00:48:23.140
happening overseas.
Some of that overseas news goes back to March,

777
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:28.320
but this is how people are learning about whatever is happening in that entire

778
00:48:28.421 --> 00:48:32.200
war effort.
It's haphazard.
It's kind of random.
It's slow,

779
00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:34.870
and it's often unreliable.
So again,

780
00:48:34.871 --> 00:48:39.340
it's kind of a dramatic reminder about some of the realities of engaging in a

781
00:48:39.341 --> 00:48:44.341
war in a period when even communication is complicated and difficult.

782
00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.870
I will stop there because we are out of time.

783
00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:51.400
On Thursday will be the midterm here.

784
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:55.960
Blue books will be here and ready for you and all will be okay.

785
00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:59.320
I'm saying calming midterm things.
It will all be good.
