1
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.730
Now I want to turn to the lecture and I'm going to start the lecture with,

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.850
with my true confession of the day.
Okay.

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.620
I did something a little insane and I'm not entirely sure how this was going to

4
00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:15.690
work out.
Um,
I did it for you.
Um,

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.350
I basically on the syllabus it says that the title of this lecture is

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.080
citizenship and leadership or leadership and citizenship.

7
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:24.660
I don't even remember which one I put first.
Um,

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.690
and initially my idea had been when I wrote the syllabus for this course before

9
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.730
the semester even started.
Um,

10
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.630
well this is going to be a lecture that has something to do with new ways of,

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.710
of like how the revolution changed people's sense of themselves as citizens,

12
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:44.670
how people were behaving differently because of the approach of revolution.

13
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:46.380
And then because of the fighting of revolution.

14
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:50.310
And I was going to talk a little bit about crowd actions and about how the

15
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:53.970
revolution itself wouldn't really have been possible without crowd actions.

16
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.331
I've talked,

17
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:57.510
I know a little bit about mob actions and we've seen some inaction action.
Um,

18
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.160
so I was basically going to talk about how the revolution politicized people,

19
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.250
how it,
um,

20
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.220
on a mass scale for many different kinds of Americans brought them into the

21
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:09.060
public sphere,

22
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.110
made them think and act politically in a way that perhaps they hadn't before.

23
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.820
And then I was going to accompany that with a brief discussion about the elite

24
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.120
in this environment being on the one hand,

25
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.190
appreciative of the sort of mass popular involvement because there would be no

26
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:29.670
revolution without it.
That is the revolution.
But on the other hand,

27
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
they're elite folks,
so they're all,

28
00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:35.220
some of them at least are a little nervous about all of this sort of popular

29
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:39.240
sentiment and crowd action.
And I even had find my favorite,
arrogant,

30
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:44.130
aristocratic quote.
Okay.
So I even found random arrogant,
uh,
elite guy coach.

31
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.520
I'm in 1774 who observed with true disdain the mob begin to think and reason.

32
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.200
This is Gouverneur Morris,
who actually has a really great sense of humor,

33
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:58.950
but also he's really kind of the aristocratically disdainful.

34
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.220
And he says he believes with fear and trembling that if the disputes with Great

35
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.063
Britain continue,

36
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.760
we shall be under the worst of all possible Dominion's we shall be under the

37
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:11.940
domination of a riotous mob.
Okay.

38
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:16.941
So Gouverneur Morris is an extreme example of some sort of elite concern about

39
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:20.190
what the revolution means.
What does it mean that people are rising up?

40
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:23.550
So that was,
that was going to be today's lecture.
That was my plan.

41
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.510
But when I started thinking about the lecture and thinking about just preparing

42
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:34.170
it and tweaking it,
and again,
I had last thought about it back in December.

43
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:38.190
And you know,
when you make a syllabus for a course,
you think about the course.

44
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.800
Yeah.
Outline it.
You think it's all going to go well,

45
00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:43.920
and then you get halfway through the course and sometimes different things seem

46
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:47.760
exciting to you.
Um,
or you suddenly get a gut feeling that,
wow,

47
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.110
I was going to have a really abstract discussion today and I don't want to have

48
00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:56.530
an abstract.
Gotcha.
I want us to be grounded in the actual revolution.
Um,

49
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.220
all of those things that happened to me when I was thinking about today's

50
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.620
lecture.
Um,
and I decided at the absolute last minute,

51
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.660
I wasn't going to give that lecture at literally the absolute last minute today,

52
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.680
this morning for me it was like a reality show called the lecture and I was like

53
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.980
Freeman three hours research and write a new lecturer.

54
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:16.900
So I was sort of frantically at my desk.

55
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.230
I'm so not only did I research and write a new lecture,

56
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.980
but it's based entirely on primary research.
So I mean I really researched,

57
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.620
you'll hear,
um,
and I'm going to explain it in one,

58
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:28.180
but what I'm actually going to be lecturing long,

59
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:30.490
which is related to what I'm supposed to be lecturing on.

60
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.420
But basically I just came up with something that to me felt more interesting,

61
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:38.110
more immediate is going to show some of the same things I would have been

62
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:39.910
talking about in my big,
broad,

63
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:42.700
general way with my leadership and citizenship lecture.

64
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:47.330
But instead I'm actually going to base it on real people in a real place put of

65
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.930
really showing you as the is unfolding.

66
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.080
What happens to people in this place and how do events in ideas affect them.

67
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.130
So I,
when I said,

68
00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:00.700
I hope I have a minute or two at the end given that I like literally was

69
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:04.090
printing this out as I was grabbing my coat to run here.
Um,

70
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.080
hopefully this is all going to work and electrical goes swimming lead.

71
00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:09.850
This is true confessions,
right?
I should never get up in front of you and say,

72
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.010
maybe my lecture will die,
die.
Um,
but,

73
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:19.480
but I'm going to,
I'm going to aim for a grand slam and we'll try.

74
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.070
Um,
but one way or another,

75
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.420
what I am going to do today is get across some of the ideas in a concrete way

76
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:28.870
that I had been thinking I was going to approach it in an abstract way and that

77
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:33.100
just didn't get me excited this morning.
So,
um,
it's a little experiment for me.

78
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.990
Um,
and what I'm going to do,

79
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.250
my little experimental thing is I'm actually going to be talking about

80
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.230
citizenship and leadership and the American revolution by focusing on Yale and

81
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:47.610
new haven.
This was my brilliant thought for the morning.
Ah,

82
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.950
I can focus right here like I can talk about us here now and look at throughout

83
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:57.430
the 17th seventies some of the ways in which people were actually experiencing

84
00:04:57.431 --> 00:04:58.330
the revolution,

85
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.660
some of the ways in which the revolution was getting them to take action,

86
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:04.810
what it is they were doing,
why they were doing it,
who was doing it,

87
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.490
who was taking action.
So again,

88
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:09.460
we're not just going to be looking at three elite guys in a room sort of writing

89
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:10.210
proclamation,

90
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.540
but we're actually going to be talking about students and the people of new

91
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:17.920
haven.
So that's my,
my experimental lecture for this morning.

92
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.570
And as you're going to see average new haven residents took strong action at an

93
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:29.080
early point in the growing conflict between the colonies and Great Britain.

94
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.800
So really in a main and a sort of major way,

95
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:35.200
what we're going to be looking at is their story today.

96
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.430
The story of average people in new haven mean students are kind of above average

97
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:41.770
because they would have been for more elevated families.

98
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:43.210
We're going to be looking at students too,

99
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.720
but we're going to be looking at a lot of what's happening just in the town of

100
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:50.080
new haven,
which in a way is the best way to look at the revolution,

101
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:54.190
which is really how it's unfolding on the ground.
Plus,

102
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:56.500
this means I get to talk about the British invasion of new haven,

103
00:05:56.501 --> 00:05:58.010
which I've been waiting for my moment.

104
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.280
I've never actually talked about it in this class before I discovered it when I

105
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:04.880
was writing the introductory lecture.
And then having discovered it,
it was like,

106
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:07.910
okay,
well now I have to find a way to talk about the innovation of new haven.

107
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:12.000
So after I had my brilliant idea,
I realized
he's,

108
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.860
I get to talk about the check on new haven in today's lecture.

109
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:19.520
So that will be there today too.
Okay.
So,
um,

110
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.720
let's actually turn now to Yale in new haven,
um,

111
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.920
at the opening of the revolution.

112
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.930
And most of the lecture today is gonna focus on the 1770s.

113
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.090
Um,
but I will mention in starting that Yale students were certainly caught up in

114
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:38.120
all of the fervor that I've been talking about in past lectures.

115
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.040
And I know I mentioned once before,
um,
that Gail students decided,
uh,

116
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:46.820
in protests at one point to give up importing fine wines,

117
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.630
the sacrifice on the part of Yale students.
Um,

118
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.460
in the 1760s ELL students,

119
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:56.840
like many other people throughout the colonies were engaged in acts of sort of

120
00:06:56.841 --> 00:06:59.570
personal protests like that,
you know,
giving something up.
Okay.

121
00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:03.390
Maybe on the part of the El students it was just fine wines,
but still,
um,

122
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.820
or on another occasion,
um,
in 1769,
um,

123
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:12.020
in response to the Townson acts and then the idea of non importation,

124
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.520
the senior class of Yale came up with the following proclamation,

125
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:20.270
which they made publicly,
the senior class of Yale College.

126
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.920
Have you Nanimo Asley agreed to make their appearance at the next public

127
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:27.920
commencement when they are to take their first degree,

128
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.790
holy dressed in the manufacturers of our own country and desire.

129
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:36.320
This public notice may be given of their resolution so their parents and friends

130
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:39.410
may have sufficient time to be providing homespun clothes for them.

131
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.780
It's like we're making a proclamation,
mom,
send me some clothes,

132
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.300
but the,
you know,
the,
the feeling was there

133
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:52.723
and even better,

134
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.120
they want their parents to provide homespun clothes that none of them may be

135
00:07:56.121 --> 00:07:56.721
obliged to.

136
00:07:56.721 --> 00:08:01.190
The hard necessity of unfashionable singularity by wearing important cloth.
Okay,

137
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.050
mom,
if you don't send me clothes,

138
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.750
I'm going to have to wear in Puerto clothes and I'm going to be really unpopular

139
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.260
guilting the parents.
Okay.
But anyway,

140
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:14.261
that's Yale students with the 1760s actually making acts of protest,

141
00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:18.320
organizing themselves into active protest.
Now,

142
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.600
Yale isn't unique in this way.

143
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:25.190
Actually throughout the period colonial colleges in a variety of different

144
00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:30.191
places were places that tended to brew sentiment,

145
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.550
political sentiment that was rebellious or outrage at some of the acts being

146
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:36.290
imposed by the British government.

147
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.460
Actually Yale and Harvard and the College of New Jersey,
which is now Princeton,

148
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:43.310
tended to be particularly well known as,

149
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:45.710
as sort of seed beds of unrest,

150
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.000
like particularly angry students who had strong political feelings.
Um,

151
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.580
but there were other colleges as well,
um,

152
00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:57.581
where the students really were provoked to acts of protest in a variety of

153
00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:02.550
different ways.
I mean,
and I,
I this morning in researching for this lecture,

154
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:07.551
I found a bunch of Princeton College of New Jersey students who decided that no

155
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:10.710
one in Princeton should be drinking tea.

156
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.250
So they went out into the town and just personally like forced their way into

157
00:09:14.251 --> 00:09:16.950
people's houses and when they found tea,
they burned it.

158
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.930
That would be really popular.
Right.

159
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:21.720
And then one of them said something like that was a real frolic.

160
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.790
The child must have been very pleased.
Um,
I think,
uh,

161
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.110
in another college,
the commencement exercises,
you know,

162
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:34.210
the speeches at the students gave at a commencement exercise,
um,

163
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.390
at a pretty early point,
actually,

164
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.770
they debated one for one and against the possibility of independence.

165
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:44.970
I think that was like in 1769 you had students at one college who decided that

166
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:47.790
would be what would be happening as their commencement ceremony is they would

167
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:51.900
have that debate.
It's a really early point and again,
pretty,
pretty radical.

168
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.370
So we're kind of looking at a longstanding pattern of college students being

169
00:09:56.371 --> 00:10:01.200
bold and radical during times of political controversy and political unrest.

170
00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.530
Um,
and this is happening throughout the colonies in this period.

171
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.630
And it kind of makes sense.

172
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:09.330
You have a cluster of people together and you have a variety of different

173
00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:13.710
avenues,
ways for students to make their thoughts known.
Um,

174
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.940
so colleges,
and as I said,

175
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:19.820
particularly Yale became known as the sort of seed bed of sedition as one

176
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.500
loyalist said of Yale and the 17th seventies.

177
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.590
The college is no longer remarkable for its scholarship,

178
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:29.760
but instead for it's persecuting spirit,
it's Republican principles,

179
00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:34.020
it's intolerance in religion.
But this is a person of loyalists,
sympathies.

180
00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.260
It says,
you know,
he used to be great.
It's all downhill now.

181
00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:39.810
They have those crazy,
wild radical students.
Um,

182
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:44.900
or as a British officer put it in 1779 he happens to be the British officer who

183
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:48.840
invaded new haven.
Um,
quote that place.

184
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.270
New Haven is a spacious and very considerable town.

185
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.410
It has the largest university in America and Mike with propriety be styled the

186
00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:56.820
parent and nurse of rebellion.

187
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.610
We are the parent understand rebellion like Yale.
Hey Gail.
Okay.

188
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.810
Um,
but this is not to say that colleges in this period,

189
00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:10.830
our little isolated seed beds of rebellion and everybody else's sort of sitting

190
00:11:10.831 --> 00:11:13.290
around widdling pieces of wood thinking,
oh,

191
00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:15.480
I wonder what the British are doing today.
Right.
It's not as,

192
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:18.870
so the colleges are isolated from the communities or that the college is only

193
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:22.290
noticed the communities when they're going to go out and burn random citizens t

194
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.690
as they did in New Jersey.
Um,
there were,

195
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:27.720
obviously there were connections between whatever was going on in these colleges

196
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.490
and whatever was going on in these towns.

197
00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:33.300
And we're going to see that play out a couple of times,
uh,
in this lecture today.

198
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:38.540
Sometimes things that went on in the town spread their way onto the Gail campus.

199
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.410
I'm an example of this is in the late 1760s when there was a rally on the new

200
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:46.740
haven town green against British policy,

201
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.460
and the Yale students apparently attended that rally and got very stirred up by

202
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:54.620
the rally and decided to continue it on the Yale campus.
Um,

203
00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.540
at which point a big group of students decided it would be a really great idea

204
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.310
to declare their political sentiments by toasting English radical John Wilkes.

205
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.500
And they decided not,
and I don't know where this number came from,
God,

206
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.760
I didn't have time to research where the number came from,

207
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:11.200
but you'll hear why I questioned it.

208
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.850
They decided that they would toast John Wilkes 45 times.

209
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.090
Okay,
that's 45 drinks.

210
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.680
So I'm one observer who I gather from my research this morning,

211
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:24.910
had loyalists sympathies,

212
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.830
said that instead of drinking 45 glasses and honor of Wilkes and liberty,

213
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.630
the Yale students drank themselves 45 degrees in extreme oh drunk.

214
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.370
So we got plastered Yale students like,
yeah,
liberty.

215
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.210
But that's,
you know,
the towns spreading into the realm of the gown.

216
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.460
Now in the 1660s,

217
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.900
we're seeing these sort of public demonstrations,
new haven,

218
00:12:55.901 --> 00:13:00.520
Yale campus protesting policies,
but not anything that dramatic happening,

219
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.880
but things become worse as relations between England and its colonies became

220
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.620
worse.
And as,
um,
actions became more aggressive on both sides.

221
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:12.821
People in new haven,

222
00:13:12.821 --> 00:13:16.660
as in a lot of other places became more aggressive in their politics and became

223
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.810
stronger in their actions.
They made bolder decisions.

224
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.370
And a great example of that is again,
here in new haven,
1774,

225
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.330
a group of about 60 men from new haven,
normal townspeople.

226
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.540
And then to talk about them in a moment,
um,

227
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:36.570
decided that they were going to hire someone to teach them military exercises so

228
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:40.390
that hopefully they would learn something and it's somewhere down the road if

229
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:40.961
they had to be,

230
00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:45.190
they could organize themselves into a military unit and protect the town of new

231
00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:49.840
haven.
Okay.
So here's 60 random people in new haven who hire someone.

232
00:13:49.841 --> 00:13:50.790
I think they paid him like,
you know,

233
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:55.850
$3 a lesson or something to teach them how to drill and what to do with guns and

234
00:13:55.991 --> 00:13:59.620
had him walk in formation and basic military thing so that they would know what

235
00:13:59.621 --> 00:14:03.580
to do in case they ever actually had to fight again.
That's kind of a,

236
00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.910
that's going to have a dramatic action.
I mean that's a big step to take.
Okay,

237
00:14:06.911 --> 00:14:10.540
now I need to be militarily drilling in case I need to defend my family,

238
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:11.860
my property and my town.

239
00:14:11.861 --> 00:14:15.550
So that certainly gives you a sense of what it felt like.

240
00:14:15.551 --> 00:14:18.130
What was sort of floating in the air at this time for people in new haven to

241
00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:22.870
take that kind of an action.
In early 1775,

242
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.740
they met as a group and they decided that they would really organize themselves

243
00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:31.300
into a real military unit as opposed to you guys taking lessons on how to drill.

244
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.630
Um,
so they met,
they voted on uniforms,

245
00:14:34.631 --> 00:14:38.350
they figured out the best way to obtain arms so that they'd know where they'd be

246
00:14:38.351 --> 00:14:39.220
getting them from.

247
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:42.490
And then not long after that they actually wrote to the Connecticut state

248
00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:47.491
assembly and said that they quote anxious for the safety of our country and

249
00:14:48.071 --> 00:14:51.980
desirous of contributing all in their power to the support of our just rights

250
00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:56.540
and liberties have formed themselves into a military company and then added that

251
00:14:56.541 --> 00:15:00.350
they wanted the Connecticut state assembly to officially make them sort of

252
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:01.940
district military units.

253
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:05.540
So they wanted official recognition from the Connecticut state assembly.
Again,

254
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:10.370
really interesting random 60 guys like maybe we better know something military.

255
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.700
Then after that they decide,
okay,
well maybe we actually had better.

256
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.820
We can organize ourselves so that this will actually be real.
Hey,

257
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:19.910
now that we've organized ourselves,
we can actually get like state recognition.

258
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.650
So that will be on call and armed and ready in case something bad happens.
Again,

259
00:15:24.651 --> 00:15:26.780
kind of an interesting chain of events,

260
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.530
series of personal decisions on the part of those random 60 men.

261
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.620
Now let's look for a minute at who they are.

262
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.610
One of them apparently owned a hat store on Chapel Street.

263
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:42.890
One of them was a barber who is described quote as a rather eccentric person.

264
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.480
I don't know what that means,

265
00:15:44.481 --> 00:15:47.470
although I was dying to have the time to figure out why the barber was rather

266
00:15:47.471 --> 00:15:50.060
eccentric.
But we have an eccentric Barbara who is one of those 60,

267
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.790
I'm a chair maker,
a few sailors,

268
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.410
someone who was just described as a man of leisure.
Um,

269
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:01.340
it's an interesting to ponder what that means.
I'm a lawyer,
a few grocers.

270
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:04.940
There was a grocer who lived on state street and a grocer who lived on the

271
00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:08.150
corner of Chapel and church.
And of course for me researching this this morning,

272
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.990
it's really fascinating to be finding people living in places that of course we

273
00:16:11.991 --> 00:16:15.560
all know,
you know,
I mean that's always cause exactly.
Picked your,
oh,

274
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:19.430
the corner of chapel in church.
I know exactly where that person lived.
Um,

275
00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:22.960
one person worked in the new haven bank,
um,

276
00:16:22.961 --> 00:16:26.630
and decided that he wasn't really very skilled at horsemanship and in case that

277
00:16:26.631 --> 00:16:27.321
they were going to fight,

278
00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:30.620
he probably would need to know how to be really good on horseback.

279
00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:34.760
So apparently he regularly took his horse into his yard and practice on the

280
00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:36.170
horse and private and took it into his yard.

281
00:16:36.171 --> 00:16:39.500
So no one would see that he was the guy who had to practice horsemanship,

282
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:43.580
but he was sort of there doing his own little private drilling so that he'd be

283
00:16:43.581 --> 00:16:46.520
prepared in case there was actual fighting.
Okay.

284
00:16:46.521 --> 00:16:51.050
So there you see a group of people,
all different levels of society,

285
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:55.880
lawyers,
man of leisure,
eccentric barber's chair makers,

286
00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:56.630
groceries,

287
00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:01.160
all different levels of society who have all come together for this one purpose

288
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.960
and have gone over a series of months here to increasingly become more and more

289
00:17:05.961 --> 00:17:08.090
serious about what it is that they're doing.

290
00:17:08.091 --> 00:17:13.091
So it certainly tells you something about the mindset in new haven in early 1775

291
00:17:14.361 --> 00:17:17.570
and not only in new haven as we've already heard in the course,

292
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:23.710
things became more dramatic on April 21st,

293
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.380
1775 when news of the battle of Lexington arrived in new haven.

294
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:31.220
And what was interesting to me this morning was when I was reading accounts of

295
00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:35.900
people in new haven reporting when they heard this news.
Um,

296
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.350
several of them literally stayed at the precise time of day,

297
00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:43.460
like at noon on the 21st someone told me,
I mean,

298
00:17:43.461 --> 00:17:46.880
they actually had it down to the hour and the minute when they heard about the

299
00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:47.810
events at Lexington,

300
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.320
which to me was really telling because it's what you do afterwards when

301
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:56.220
something really momentous or tragic or notable or historic happens,
you think,

302
00:17:56.221 --> 00:17:58.830
you know,
where was I when that happened?
You know,
where it was.
Like,

303
00:17:58.831 --> 00:18:02.040
where was I when the challenger blew up?
You know,
I was,

304
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.820
I was a receptionist at an advertising agency sitting at my desk.
Um,
but,

305
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:06.510
but you know,

306
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.420
I remembered that because I remember everyone around me getting upset and it was

307
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:13.110
a big deal.
And,
and so here are these people kind of doing the same thing,

308
00:18:13.111 --> 00:18:15.210
remembering after the fact.
I remember where I was,

309
00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:19.530
it was noon on the 21st when we heard in new haven that the British had actually

310
00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:24.531
fired on colonists in Lexington in new haven.

311
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.170
A Yale student wrote in his diary today,

312
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.120
tidings of the battle of Lexington,

313
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.140
which is the first engagement with the British troops arrived at new haven.

314
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:39.030
This fill the country with alarm and rendered it impossible for us to pursue our

315
00:18:39.031 --> 00:18:40.800
studies to any profit.

316
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.900
And this is the moment I mentioned on Tuesday's lecture when Benedict Arnold,

317
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.650
who's one of the men in that group of 60 guys who decided they'd better arm and

318
00:18:49.651 --> 00:18:49.920
drill.

319
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.550
He's one of those men when he decides that they need arms and they're going to

320
00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:57.150
march to Massachusetts and he sorta fights the new haven town committee to get

321
00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.530
the key so that he can grab arms and go march with his men up to Massachusetts

322
00:19:01.531 --> 00:19:05.800
on linking today's lecture with Tuesday's lecture.
Very proud.
Um,

323
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.220
and actually he and his men,

324
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.460
as they were preparing to leave town and sort of go off to fight,

325
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.230
they drew up an agreement,

326
00:19:13.231 --> 00:19:16.540
which they all signed a sort of pledge to each other and a,

327
00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.530
and a public statement as to what they were doing and why they were doing it,

328
00:19:19.531 --> 00:19:22.260
which is worth quoting because you'll hear in the middle of,

329
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:26.010
it's something you might not expect to see in a statement being drawn up by a

330
00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:29.910
bunch of guys who've just by force armed themselves and are going to go march to

331
00:19:29.911 --> 00:19:33.930
Massachusetts to fight the British.
So this is the beginning of their statement,

332
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.420
be it known that we,

333
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.650
the subscribers having taken up arms for the relief of our brethren and defense

334
00:19:40.651 --> 00:19:45.600
of theirs as well as our just rights and privileges declare to the world that

335
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:45.781
we,

336
00:19:45.781 --> 00:19:50.670
from our hearts disavow every thought of rebellion to His Majesty as Supreme

337
00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:53.760
Head of the British Empire.
Okay.
They've taken up arms,

338
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.080
they're marching to fight the British.

339
00:19:55.081 --> 00:19:57.630
And the first thing they say in the first sentence of their proclamation is

340
00:19:57.631 --> 00:20:02.160
we're not rebelling against the king.
That when I read this I thought,
wow,

341
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.500
that's,
and I've been saying over and over again in class,
it's,
it's,

342
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.730
all of these things are mixed in together.
People who are upset,

343
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.960
they're angry at what's going on,

344
00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:13.050
they're angry British policy and they're loyal to the king and they're thinking

345
00:20:13.051 --> 00:20:13.801
about independence,

346
00:20:13.801 --> 00:20:16.290
but they're unsure about independence and they're still linked to England.

347
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.710
And in a way that statement is a great example of that.

348
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.060
Guys who were holding guns and about to march to fight are being sure to state

349
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.700
that they are not rebelling against His Majesty,

350
00:20:26.701 --> 00:20:29.820
His supreme head of the British empire or up there.

351
00:20:29.821 --> 00:20:33.390
They don't want to be accused of opposition to his legal authority and shall on

352
00:20:33.391 --> 00:20:36.840
every occasion manifest to the world by our conduct this to be our fixed

353
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.660
principle so they're not rebelling against the king.

354
00:20:39.661 --> 00:20:44.490
Instead they said that they were quote driven to the last necessity and obliged

355
00:20:44.491 --> 00:20:47.280
to have recourse to arms in defense of our lives and liberties.

356
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:51.100
So they're saying we're not like rebels who are out to rebel against the king.

357
00:20:51.101 --> 00:20:51.790
We're actually,

358
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.150
we've been driven to this by what's going on in Massachusetts and we're

359
00:20:55.151 --> 00:20:59.290
protecting ourselves,
but this is a defensive act and not an aggressive act.

360
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.600
And then when you read a little further on in the statement after all of this

361
00:21:03.601 --> 00:21:04.960
sort of noble,
lofty sentiment,

362
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.530
they then promise each other they're not going to get drunk or gamble or swear.

363
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.250
It's like down to practicalities now that we've declared our purpose of the

364
00:21:12.251 --> 00:21:16.660
world,
no heavy drinking.
Okay.
The next day,

365
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.120
April 22nd,

366
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.140
1775 classes at Yale were suspended and a lot of students went home.

367
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.750
Some a few actually went off to fight.

368
00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:31.030
So you can kind of see the way that the wind is blowing in new haven.

369
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:36.160
You can imagine given these sorts of events potentially how much fun it would

370
00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:41.140
have been to be a college student with loyalist leanings at this particular

371
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:41.141
moment.

372
00:21:41.141 --> 00:21:45.790
It would not have been very fun and sure enough in 1775 there was that student.

373
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.880
I discovered that student this morning.
There was a,

374
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.130
I don't know if he's the only one,
but he's the guy who got in trouble.

375
00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:56.340
There was one college student here at Yale who was a declared loyalist 1775 he

376
00:21:57.941 --> 00:22:00.250
did not make other Yale students very happy.

377
00:22:00.251 --> 00:22:02.260
He must've been loud about being a loyalist,
otherwise,

378
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.860
don't know how it would have been so obvious to everyone that he was a loyalist,

379
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:06.700
but the,

380
00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:11.820
the large chunk of the Gail student body decided to have a meeting to debate

381
00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:14.500
what should be done about this student.

382
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.110
Obviously things are not going to go well for the student.

383
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.780
What should we do about this student?

384
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:24.310
They decide that they are going to formerly denounce him as publicly as quote an

385
00:22:24.311 --> 00:22:28.960
enemy to his country and that no one will be allowed to socialize with his

386
00:22:28.961 --> 00:22:33.460
student ever again.
Okay.
They've just ostracizes,
can you imagine?
Sorry,

387
00:22:33.461 --> 00:22:36.580
you've just been entirely ostracized from every other person at Yale University

388
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.850
because we don't like your politics.

389
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.500
So when I first found this this morning,
I was like,
oh,
you know,
poor guy.

390
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:44.800
Like what?

391
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.560
And I couldn't figure out what happened next and I just felt sorry for him.

392
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.580
But then like found a little bit more about him and I felt a little less sorry

393
00:22:51.581 --> 00:22:54.400
for him cause he took action.
Apparently he was from new haven.

394
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.720
This particularly loyal a student.

395
00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.010
So learning that he had been ostracized by all of the Yale student buddy,

396
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.330
he went home and got sent up some of his townie friends to go back to Yale and

397
00:23:04.331 --> 00:23:08.970
beat up some Yale students,
which they did.
Uh,

398
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.140
and then the Yale students got really mad at this,

399
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:14.380
apparently an armed themselves with clubs and we're going to go attack these

400
00:23:14.381 --> 00:23:19.150
townies.
Um,
when the Yale President Neftali Daggett intervened,

401
00:23:19.151 --> 00:23:23.020
it was like,
okay,
we're done with the war now.
Like nice idea,

402
00:23:23.021 --> 00:23:25.570
done with the worth of the fighting stop.
And at eventually,

403
00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:28.750
I don't know when the loyalist withdrew from Yale though.

404
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.480
You can't blame him at this point.
Okay.

405
00:23:31.481 --> 00:23:35.890
So we have people in new haven forming military units and marching off to fight.

406
00:23:35.891 --> 00:23:38.290
We have students ostracizing,

407
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:42.400
met one loan loyalist student not long after this,

408
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.640
Yale students organize their own military and actually began training.

409
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.930
And not long after that,
the new haven town meeting voted.

410
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.170
And here's what they declared,

411
00:23:53.171 --> 00:23:58.171
quote that the governor be desired to permit 100 stands of arms to be lodged in

412
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:02.840
the library for the use of a company in Yale College that should accompany in

413
00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:07.040
college,
be formed and accoutered.
They draw half a pound of powder to each man.

414
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.530
Okay.
Yeah,
I'll,

415
00:24:08.531 --> 00:24:11.870
students have just started militarily drilling and the new haven town meeting

416
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:17.050
has voted to store arms in the Yale Library in case the students actually get it

417
00:24:18.021 --> 00:24:19.880
together and form an organizing unit.

418
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:24.410
They'll have arms stored in the Yale Library ready in case fighting has to

419
00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:29.390
happen,
which again,
is really dramatic kind of a decision to make.
It's,

420
00:24:29.391 --> 00:24:32.240
it's stated in a very plain way and the documents that I found,

421
00:24:32.241 --> 00:24:36.410
but that's a dramatic kind of a decision.
So again,

422
00:24:36.411 --> 00:24:41.411
you can see even just in that example how some of these really general ideas

423
00:24:41.901 --> 00:24:45.020
I've been talking about over the course of many,
many lectures,

424
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:49.700
building resentments,
shared fears,
continued loyalty to the king,

425
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:54.800
are playing out here on a small scale in new haven in real life.

426
00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:55.881
Now,

427
00:24:55.881 --> 00:25:00.050
the Yale military unit apparently had its main moment of glory that same year in

428
00:25:00.051 --> 00:25:02.750
1775 when George Washington,

429
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:06.140
who was the now the newly named commander and chief of the continental army,

430
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:10.910
actually pass through new haven on his way to join the continental army outside

431
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:13.920
of Boston.
And I'll be talking about George Washington in the next lecture.

432
00:25:13.921 --> 00:25:15.920
So I'm feeling very fancy once again,

433
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.790
that I have magically somehow seemed as though this lecture was really planned

434
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:24.080
all along.
Um,
but apparently Connecticut newspapers noted that,
you know,

435
00:25:24.081 --> 00:25:25.220
people from new haven went out.

436
00:25:25.221 --> 00:25:28.230
They wanted to see Washington and they wanted to see what was going on.
Um,

437
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:30.830
they wanted to watch the Yale students do a drill,

438
00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:34.190
which they did apparently a formal drill in front of Washington and his escort.

439
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.240
Um,

440
00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:39.710
Noah Webster dictionary Webster was a Yale freshmen that year.

441
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.030
And in later years he told people that he remembered that event.

442
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:49.130
He remembered Washington watching the drilling students.
He remembered that the,

443
00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:53.990
that the body of the military body of students escorted Washington out of town

444
00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.680
and Webster said that he himself played some kind of music to accompany the

445
00:25:57.681 --> 00:26:00.680
marching of the Yale students with Washington out of town.

446
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.960
So he remembered that a long time later.

447
00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:05.240
It's sort of a memorable moment from the war

448
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.180
now in the interest of time,

449
00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:13.270
I'm going to leap to 1777 because in 1777 warfare now is unfolding throughout

450
00:26:15.801 --> 00:26:16.760
the northern states.

451
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:21.110
And some people then began to conclude that actually staying in new haven and

452
00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:26.000
studying at Yale might be just too dangerous for Yale students because new haven

453
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:28.910
wasn't exposed port,
which we're going to see in about five minutes.

454
00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.050
It isn't exposed port.

455
00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.280
So the Yale authorities sent students out to different towns.

456
00:26:34.281 --> 00:26:36.020
They didn't close the,
they just said,
okay,

457
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.110
we're going to send students to random places in Connecticut where they will be

458
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:42.980
safer than they are in new haven.
So freshmen went to Farmington,

459
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.650
sophomores and juniors went to Glastonbury and seniors went to Weathersfield.

460
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.550
I cannot tell you why those particular places seemed like a logical places,

461
00:26:50.551 --> 00:26:55.370
but you and your class were sent to random place to continue your studies.
Um,

462
00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.610
on their way out.

463
00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.660
Gail officials asked the town to please protect the abandoned college buildings

464
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:03.000
from troops,
American or British troops,

465
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:08.070
and some library books were moved inland to protect them in case troops came to

466
00:27:08.071 --> 00:27:11.250
new haven.
So again,
people are feeling there's a potential real threat here.

467
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.990
Gail eventually did come back into session in new haven,

468
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.600
not without serious problems.
And again,

469
00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:21.780
you're going to see the playing out here of something I've talked about before.

470
00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:24.270
I've talked before about the problems of supplying the army.

471
00:27:24.271 --> 00:27:25.380
It was hard to get food.

472
00:27:25.381 --> 00:27:28.740
People weren't sort of giving up food and supplies to the army.

473
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:33.690
Apparently they was really hard for people to get food and supplies into Yale

474
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.080
too,
that people just weren't who,

475
00:27:36.081 --> 00:27:39.450
whatever sources of supplies had been serving Gail in the past.

476
00:27:39.451 --> 00:27:43.590
We're no longer doing that in a time of war.
So in 1778,

477
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:47.100
Yale sent out the following notice to parents of Yale students.

478
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.760
September 30 1778 the steward of Yale College hereby requests the parents and

479
00:27:52.861 --> 00:27:57.210
guardians of the students to assist in furnishing a supply of provisions.
Okay.

480
00:27:57.211 --> 00:28:01.410
Parents,
would you please send food?
We don't have a lot.

481
00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.510
We really need it.
Um,

482
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.950
without which it would be very difficult if not impracticable for him to subsist

483
00:28:07.951 --> 00:28:09.540
the scholars,
the ensuing winter,

484
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.010
a generous and full price shall be allowed and paid either in money or their

485
00:28:14.011 --> 00:28:17.460
sons.
Quarter bills,
I'll shall be most agreeable.
Okay.
Please send us food.

486
00:28:17.461 --> 00:28:18.840
We don't have any.
And if you do,

487
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:22.530
we'll either pay you or we won't charge you tuition for your steel,
your sons.

488
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.600
So please give us food.
Which again,

489
00:28:24.601 --> 00:28:26.880
can you imagine being the parent who gets the,
sorry.

490
00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:28.470
There was no food for your son

491
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:34.410
since some net while you're sending the homespun clothes,
send the food to.

492
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:39.570
Okay,
so the war is a real presence even on the college campus drilling students

493
00:28:39.571 --> 00:28:42.120
fighting men gun stored in the Yale Library,

494
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.610
people having a hard time getting food and supplies.

495
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:49.790
1779 is when things become much worse because that is the peak year of violence

496
00:28:49.891 --> 00:28:53.940
in new haven.
That is the year when the British invaded you haven.

497
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.900
And as her styles,
who's president of Yale at the time,

498
00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:02.250
noted in his diary the events as they unfolded.
And it again,

499
00:29:02.251 --> 00:29:05.670
it's really interesting to see his diary entries.

500
00:29:05.671 --> 00:29:08.370
He later wrote another account that had full sentences,

501
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:09.960
but to me what was more interesting,

502
00:29:09.961 --> 00:29:12.390
and I'll read some of them here where some of his diary entries,

503
00:29:12.391 --> 00:29:14.220
because they're really immediate and he's,

504
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.130
he's kind of recording his reaction to events as they're happening.

505
00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:21.450
So on July 4th,
1779 he says,

506
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:25.500
he heard news that there was a British fleet of ships that had been seen,

507
00:29:25.501 --> 00:29:30.150
your Bridgeport and supposedly rumor said it was heading to new haven.

508
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.230
So again,
being responsible president of Yale,
he,

509
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.780
he asks for militia to be sent in case this is actually true.

510
00:29:36.781 --> 00:29:40.170
They're going to need some real soldiers.
But he writes in his diary,

511
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.020
not believe the enemy intended landing.
Okay?

512
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:45.640
He hears the rumor and he takes action,

513
00:29:45.641 --> 00:29:49.480
but he actually literally cannot believe that the British are actually going to

514
00:29:49.481 --> 00:29:53.470
get off the shifts and a tap.
I can't be real,
can't be really happening.

515
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:54.611
The next day,

516
00:29:54.611 --> 00:29:59.611
July 5th styles using a telescope says that he saw the ships distinctly from the

517
00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:03.910
steeple of college chapel and he continues,

518
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
began to remove all property militia meeting Tory's calm with telescope from the

519
00:30:10.031 --> 00:30:11.080
tower or steeple,

520
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:15.400
clearly saw the boats putting off from the ship and landing a little after

521
00:30:15.401 --> 00:30:15.851
sunrise.

522
00:30:15.851 --> 00:30:20.470
He sees that the smaller boats going off of these ships with soldiers to land on

523
00:30:20.471 --> 00:30:21.304
the shore.

524
00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:25.750
Immediately I sent off college records and papers and a bag of my own things,

525
00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.330
sent his family away the next day,

526
00:30:28.331 --> 00:30:33.331
July six styles rights enemy paraded sailors came on shore and took their turn

527
00:30:33.341 --> 00:30:34.174
at plunder.

528
00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.700
I'm going to continue a couple of days here and then go back to the actual

529
00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:37.390
invasion.

530
00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:41.020
Just cause the series of things he writes here are interesting and then they

531
00:30:41.021 --> 00:30:42.070
become weirdly personal,

532
00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:45.940
which again reminds you that this is a real person's experience.
He says,

533
00:30:45.941 --> 00:30:49.510
July 7th 11:00 PM enemy landed and burnt Fairfield,

534
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:54.520
July 8th removing my furniture.
He's now moving this furniture out of Yale,

535
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:57.460
removing my furniture,
broke my Fahrenheit thermometer,

536
00:30:57.461 --> 00:31:02.110
which I've had since 1762 I was like,
oh,
okay,
you'll sorry,

537
00:31:02.111 --> 00:31:04.030
you're moving your furniture right now.
He's broke his thermometer.

538
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.830
July 12th the whole town moving and then July 23rd this little tiny reminder

539
00:31:08.831 --> 00:31:11.020
that Yale is still an institution that exists.

540
00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:16.140
July 23rd style spent the day writing diplomas onto parchment like,

541
00:31:16.691 --> 00:31:18.220
yeah,
I know this,
this whole attack thing.

542
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:20.560
I've still got students and they still have to graduate,

543
00:31:20.561 --> 00:31:21.910
so I'm going to write off their diplomas,

544
00:31:21.911 --> 00:31:24.370
which I think is really kind of striking.
Okay.

545
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:27.760
Let's turn back for a minute to look at precisely what happened.

546
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.590
As the British invaded new haven.

547
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:35.430
Apparently they decided to attack the Connecticut shore to draw some of

548
00:31:35.591 --> 00:31:39.670
Washington's troops away from white plains,
New York,
where I guess they were.

549
00:31:39.671 --> 00:31:42.490
And that was,
I guess,
a strong position to hold.
So the British thought,
well,

550
00:31:42.491 --> 00:31:43.870
if they attack the Connecticut shore,

551
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:47.290
they'll entice Washington to send some of his troops to Connecticut.

552
00:31:47.291 --> 00:31:50.620
And that way maybe they can defeat them on both fronts.

553
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.550
And New haven ends up being the first target in this plan.

554
00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.300
So on July 5th,
the British debark in new haven harbor,

555
00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.660
they had about 2000 soldiers.
Um,

556
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.600
one part of the troops was going to enter new haven from east haven,

557
00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:08.770
and the other part was going to enter from west haven styles wrote in his diary,

558
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:13.390
perhaps one third of the adult male inhabitants flew to arms and went out to

559
00:32:13.391 --> 00:32:16.810
meet them a quarter removed out of town doing nothing.

560
00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:21.640
The rest remained unmoved,
partly Tory's,
partly timid wigs.

561
00:32:21.641 --> 00:32:24.700
And then he adds that some of the Tories armed themselves and then went out to

562
00:32:24.701 --> 00:32:26.230
fight with the British.

563
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:31.750
That's a great example of how you know,
our,
our think,
our impulse is to say,

564
00:32:31.751 --> 00:32:35.620
Whoa,
the people where you're noted and unity against the British,
it's like,
well,

565
00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.470
no,
the entire town wasn't big lump,
a big lump of rebels.

566
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:43.400
It was people with different ideas and you just styles and that one little

567
00:32:43.401 --> 00:32:46.850
sentence he has people going to fight with the British people are going to fight

568
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:47.631
against the British.

569
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:50.690
He has people sort of not knowing what to do and kind of just staying in town

570
00:32:50.691 --> 00:32:52.100
and then people not wanting to do anything,

571
00:32:52.101 --> 00:32:55.130
just wanting to get themselves out of there.
All sort of happening.

572
00:32:55.131 --> 00:32:58.460
At the same time,
people are making decisions,

573
00:32:58.461 --> 00:33:01.100
some pretty dramatic decisions and they're having to make them spur of the

574
00:33:01.101 --> 00:33:05.330
moment and you can see them and a lot of cases here taking a side,

575
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.200
taking a formal side in a way that could have pretty dire consequences.

576
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:14.840
Gail immediately was dismissed and some students immediately ran for home.

577
00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.020
Um,
supposedly according to a diary,
one student,

578
00:33:18.021 --> 00:33:20.180
a sophomore instead of going home,

579
00:33:20.181 --> 00:33:23.540
decided to go to a nearby town and read Blackstone's commentaries.

580
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:26.990
Why that made sense?
I don't know.
What are the British are coming?

581
00:33:26.991 --> 00:33:31.440
I think I'll go to Fairfield and read Blackstone.
No.
Um,

582
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:35.960
and in later years he said he so enjoyed himself reading Blackstone during that

583
00:33:35.961 --> 00:33:38.680
period that he decided to become a lawyer right there and then.
Okay.

584
00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.920
It's like this one lone little reading comp student in the midst of not a lot of

585
00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:44.960
other reading come students from what I could tell,

586
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:48.830
unlike that little Blackstone student,
um,

587
00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.460
a volunteer company of about 70 Yale students,

588
00:33:52.461 --> 00:33:56.630
which is roughly half of the student body at that point formed to fight.

589
00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:01.380
They were led by Captain James Hillhouse.
He is indeed you haven hill house.
Um,

590
00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.040
he was a Yale graduate of a few years before,

591
00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:07.280
so he's not that much older than these men.
Um,
and again,

592
00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:11.720
senior who ends up being one of these fighting Gail students offers an account

593
00:34:11.721 --> 00:34:15.130
of what happened at this point.
He says,
um,
he,

594
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:19.550
he knows that troops landed in the south part of West haven about five miles

595
00:34:19.551 --> 00:34:20.720
from the center of the town.

596
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:24.380
College was of course broken up and the students with many of the inhabitants

597
00:34:24.381 --> 00:34:28.430
prepared to flee on the morrow into the neighboring country to give more time

598
00:34:28.431 --> 00:34:30.980
for preparation.
And especially for the removal of goods.

599
00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:34.100
A volunteer company of about a hundred young men was formed,

600
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:37.760
not with the expectation of making any serious stand against such a force,

601
00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:41.050
but simply of retarding are diverting.
It's march.
So the students form,

602
00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.680
they don't think they're going to like beat the British,

603
00:34:42.681 --> 00:34:46.970
but maybe they can delay them a little bit in common with others of the
students.

604
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.880
I was one of the number,
and I will remember the surprise.

605
00:34:49.881 --> 00:34:50.870
We felt the next morning,

606
00:34:50.871 --> 00:34:55.460
July 5th as we were marching over westbridge towards the enemy to see doctor

607
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:58.640
Daggett,
who's the former president of Yale,
Neftali Daggett,

608
00:34:58.641 --> 00:35:01.700
who's now a professor of divinity.
So he's a Yale professor,

609
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:06.350
has surprised me where the next morning to see doctor Daggett writing furiously

610
00:35:06.351 --> 00:35:10.130
by us on his old black mirror with his long fowling piece in his hand,

611
00:35:10.131 --> 00:35:11.000
ready for action.

612
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:15.800
We knew the old gentleman had studied the matter thoroughly and satisfied his

613
00:35:15.801 --> 00:35:18.500
own mind is to the right and propriety of fighting it out.

614
00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.930
But we were not quite prepared to see him come forth.

615
00:35:20.931 --> 00:35:23.900
It's so gallon to style to carry its principles into practice.

616
00:35:23.901 --> 00:35:27.230
So they see that this professor like a riding off with his gun,

617
00:35:27.231 --> 00:35:31.190
like go on a flight.
The British like wow,
that's pretty impressive.

618
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.460
And I think in the first lecture I mentioned this instead,

619
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.830
it was the president of Yale writing out Daggett had retired as president.

620
00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:39.330
So for the sake of accuracy,
he's now not president,

621
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.970
but it professor writing off to fight the British with his gun.

622
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:45.840
So now the student goes on giving him a hardy cheer.
As he passed,

623
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:50.220
we turned down towards West haven at the foot of the Milford Mills while he

624
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:50.791
Daggett uh,

625
00:35:50.791 --> 00:35:54.360
send it a little to the west and took his station in a copes of wood where he

626
00:35:54.361 --> 00:35:55.950
seemed to be Rican ordering the enemy,

627
00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:00.360
like one who was determined to bide his time.
As we passed on towards the south,

628
00:36:00.361 --> 00:36:02.340
we met and advanced guard of the British.

629
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.350
And taking our stand at a line of fence.

630
00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:08.670
We fired upon them several times and then chase them the length of three or four

631
00:36:08.671 --> 00:36:12.030
fields as they retreated until we suddenly found ourselves involved with the

632
00:36:12.031 --> 00:36:16.740
main body.
Okay.
So there's like a couple of soldiers or like get them.

633
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.550
Oh and endanger of being surrounded.

634
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:25.670
It was now our turn to run and we did for our lives passing by Dr Daggers in his

635
00:36:29.131 --> 00:36:32.070
station on the hill.
We were treated rapidly across Westbridge,

636
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.400
which was instantly taken down by persons who stood ready for the purpose to

637
00:36:35.401 --> 00:36:38.190
prevent the enemy from entering the town by that road.
Okay,

638
00:36:38.191 --> 00:36:39.510
so that's where his account ends.

639
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.600
Now we're going to pick it up with Daggett who offered his own account

640
00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:46.380
afterwards of what happens.
Okay.
On Monday morning,
the fifth instant,

641
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.580
the town of new haven was Jesse alarmed with the threatening appearance of a

642
00:36:50.581 --> 00:36:54.300
speedy invasion from the enemy.
Numbers went out arm to oppose them.

643
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.180
Having gone as far as I suppose with sufficient,

644
00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.620
I turned down the hill to gain a little covert of bushes,
which I had in my eye.

645
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:05.010
But to my great surprise,
I saw the enemy,
which nears than I expected.

646
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:07.380
They're advanced guard being a little more than 20 rods,

647
00:37:07.381 --> 00:37:11.340
distant with plain open ground between us.
They instantly fired upon me,

648
00:37:11.341 --> 00:37:14.460
which they continued till I had run a dozen rods discharging,

649
00:37:14.461 --> 00:37:18.180
not less than 15 or 20 balls at me alone.
However,

650
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.070
through the preserving providence of God,

651
00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:23.490
I escaped from them all on hurt and gained the little covert at which I aimed,

652
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.140
which concealed me from their view.

653
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.800
While I could plainly see them through the woods and bushes advancing towards me

654
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.130
within 12 yard rods,
I singled out.

655
00:37:32.131 --> 00:37:35.550
One of them took aim and fired upon him.
Okay,
so he takes one shot.

656
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.320
I loaded my musket again,
but determined not to discharge it anymore.
As I saw,

657
00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:44.670
I could not escape from them and I determined to surrender myself as a prisoner.

658
00:37:44.671 --> 00:37:47.610
So he's like charged out with his gun.
He takes one shot and he's like,

659
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:53.550
what am I doing?
I'm like a guy with a gun and the British army,

660
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.250
like,
what am I doing?
It's like,
okay,
I'll surrender myself as a prisoner.

661
00:37:56.790 --> 00:38:00.870
I begged for quarter and that they would spare my life.
They drew near to me,

662
00:38:00.871 --> 00:38:03.960
I think to only a number one on my right hand,
the other on my lift,

663
00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:06.600
the fury of infernos glowing in their faces.

664
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.230
They called me a damned old rebel and swore they would kill me instantly.

665
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:14.070
They demanded quote,
what did you fire upon us for?

666
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.670
I love the question,
why are you shooting at us?

667
00:38:17.671 --> 00:38:21.690
You've old crazy man sitting in the bushes.
I replied,

668
00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.090
because it is the exercise of war

669
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:30.360
that did not impress the British.
Um,
and apparently they actually,

670
00:38:30.361 --> 00:38:32.070
they didn't treat him very well,
so they,

671
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.010
one of them like pretended to stab at him with his band net and actually like

672
00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:39.280
stabbed him a little bit and some of them sort of get him on the head.

673
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.840
And you know,
there's a long account here,

674
00:38:40.841 --> 00:38:42.760
which I don't have time to read in which he talks about,
you know,

675
00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:46.090
this guy hit me in the head and that guy hit me in the shin.
And then,
um,

676
00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:49.150
then some guy hit me with a barrel of his gun and he actually,

677
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.320
he ends up being forced to march at the head of the British troops back to new

678
00:38:53.321 --> 00:38:56.320
haven from wherever he is.
And he says,
I think in his account,
I finally,

679
00:38:56.321 --> 00:38:59.350
I saw the new haven green and I was so happy.
I was like back in new haven,

680
00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:03.520
but I think he,
oh,
and they also,
I should say they stole his shoes,

681
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:08.440
his knee buckles,
his pocket handkerchief and a little old tobacco box.

682
00:39:08.441 --> 00:39:11.410
So they also just stripped him of whatever he had.
But he actually,

683
00:39:11.411 --> 00:39:12.730
I think was kind of badly hurt.

684
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:16.210
And he's sick for a while and then a couple of years later he dies and people

685
00:39:16.211 --> 00:39:20.830
later said that maybe he died because of injuries sustained at that moment after

686
00:39:20.831 --> 00:39:22.660
the crazy charge of one guy,
you know,

687
00:39:22.661 --> 00:39:24.640
the noble professor going off to fight the British

688
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:31.230
troops entered new haven proper a little afternoon after one last skirmish where

689
00:39:32.141 --> 00:39:34.720
Wailey and Dixwell meat was it the last little skirmish.

690
00:39:34.721 --> 00:39:35.800
And then the British entered,

691
00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.180
they entered new haven and immediately began to plunder loyalist and rebel

692
00:39:40.181 --> 00:39:41.200
houses alike,

693
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:45.790
breaking windows and doors carrying off valuables as styles described it.

694
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:50.160
Plender rape,
murder van heading in delicacies toward the sex.
Okay.

695
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.670
Women are not being treated respectfully.

696
00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:55.060
Insolence and abuse and insult or the inhabitants in general.

697
00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:59.320
One woman later recalled that a British soldier and town cut off her necklace to

698
00:39:59.321 --> 00:40:01.090
keep and stole her shoe buckles.

699
00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.110
Someone who lived on State Street said he was sitting in his door on state

700
00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:09.340
street as the British came and he saw a British officer come riding down elm

701
00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:11.920
street and turn upstate street towards grove.

702
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:15.880
And then he saw someone he knew from east haven ride over holding a musket,

703
00:40:15.881 --> 00:40:19.420
which he leveled and fired at the British officer who fell off his horse and

704
00:40:19.421 --> 00:40:21.190
sort of crawled into someone's garden.

705
00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:24.790
At which point the east haven guy grabbed the officer's horse and run away.

706
00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:29.820
So it's like I shot me someone from the British army and I got a horse to some

707
00:40:30.791 --> 00:40:31.870
people fled town.

708
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:36.760
One man who was stuck in town with his wife because she was too ill to run,

709
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:40.000
saw British officers entered town and apparently went up to one and ask for

710
00:40:40.001 --> 00:40:43.360
protection.
And the officer asked,
are you a friend to King George?

711
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:47.080
And the man said,
I am.
So his house was not attacked,

712
00:40:47.081 --> 00:40:49.900
but apparently he was not a friend of King George.
He was not a Tori.

713
00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:52.090
So for their after in town,

714
00:40:52.091 --> 00:40:55.000
he was someone who was highly unpopular because he had,
I suppose in a sense,

715
00:40:55.001 --> 00:40:57.700
sold himself out to protect his house.
Again,

716
00:40:57.701 --> 00:41:01.450
a a sort of decision of the moment that makes sense,
but then had implications.

717
00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:06.640
Some new haven loyalists actually fled with the British army,
which as I left,

718
00:41:06.641 --> 00:41:09.850
actually,
they left a lot of destruction in their wake.
Okay,

719
00:41:09.851 --> 00:41:11.890
so what have we seen today?

720
00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:17.530
We've definitely seen how ideas and events happening in places pretty far

721
00:41:17.531 --> 00:41:22.270
removed from new haven are distilling their way down right here.
Yale College,

722
00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.960
New Haven,
Connecticut,
and really driving people to take action.

723
00:41:25.961 --> 00:41:30.790
Sometimes pretty dramatic action.
We've seen average citizens,

724
00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:36.010
average people from new haven stirred to act,
merchants,
lawyers,
sailor,

725
00:41:36.011 --> 00:41:37.280
shoemakers students.

726
00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:42.200
We've seen how the coming of war reveal all kinds of divisions among local

727
00:41:42.201 --> 00:41:46.340
people as well as unity,
because people did have to make choices of all kinds.

728
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.380
So basically we've seen in this one little real life example how the coming of

729
00:41:51.381 --> 00:41:55.490
the revolution and then the carrying out of the revolution drove average people

730
00:41:55.610 --> 00:42:00.590
to become politically active and also militarily active to think through their

731
00:42:00.591 --> 00:42:03.200
options,
to decide what they really believed.

732
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.340
And then in many cases to take a stand.
So professor Daggett,
the student says,

733
00:42:07.341 --> 00:42:09.650
we know he'd been thinking about it and he'd been thinking about what he wanted

734
00:42:09.651 --> 00:42:13.190
to do.
And he had decided that if pushed,
he would fight with students.

735
00:42:13.191 --> 00:42:15.740
Kind of surprised he's actually heading out with a gun.
But again,

736
00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:19.030
the student knows that Daggett was thinking through what his actions were going

737
00:42:19.031 --> 00:42:19.551
to be.

738
00:42:19.551 --> 00:42:23.420
And then he watches him take action like the loyalists who left new haven with

739
00:42:23.421 --> 00:42:26.090
the British.
Again,
a really dramatic action.

740
00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:30.440
So it just this little sort of case study of new haven and Yale,

741
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:35.270
you can see how citizenship and leadership came to have different meanings,

742
00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.080
how people were understanding what they were supposed to be doing as citizens in

743
00:42:39.081 --> 00:42:43.610
a different way as they lived.
The experience of fighting a revolution.

744
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:47.750
Okay.
I ended that on time.
I even read my,

745
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:52.130
I'm so impressed with myself,
the instant lecture,
I'm okay.

746
00:42:52.131 --> 00:42:54.740
And I ended two minutes early.
So you have time to get your midterms.

747
00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:58.880
Have a wonderful spring break and I will see you after.
