1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.060
So today I do want to finish discussing the good old Albany Congress.

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.740
Uh,
1754.
Um,

3
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:12.510
I introduced it at the end of Thursday's lecture and then we are moving on to

4
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:13.440
the stamp act.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.970
And by the end of today's lecture we will have worked our way towards yet

6
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:20.910
another congress.
We're going to have a book end to Congress bookend lecture.

7
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:24.990
We're going to have worked our way to the Stamp Act Congress by the end of this

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.590
lecture,
which as you'll see over the course of the lecture,

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.340
ends up being a step towards colonial unity.

10
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.270
But as I did mention in Thursday's lecture,

11
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:41.271
colonial unity was definitely not a foregone conclusion in this time period.

12
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.230
And I mentioned,

13
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:46.770
I mentioned a total of three attempts of colonial unity last week.

14
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:48.660
One of them was the dominion of New England,

15
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:51.870
which was not prompted by actions at the colonists took,

16
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.930
but the other two were prompted by the colonists.

17
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:59.931
And they were both prompted by fears and a sense of a need for self defense.

18
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.780
And the first that I mentioned was the United colonies of New England,

19
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.290
which first met in 1643 and was largely centered on fears of Dutch expansion and

20
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:11.790
fears about hostile native Americans.

21
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:14.310
And then I ended by talking about the Albany Congress,

22
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.670
which meant meant in 1754 also in part because of fears about native Americans

23
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:22.230
against self defense.

24
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.760
So let's just look for a few minutes at what happened in that Albany Congress

25
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:30.390
before we move on to the events that ended up surrounding the stamp act.

26
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.440
I think I mentioned at the very end of the lecture,
um,

27
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.740
that nine colonies were invited to the Albany Congress,

28
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.020
Massachusetts,
New Hampshire,
Connecticut,
Rhode Island,
New York,

29
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.730
New Jersey,
Pennsylvania,
Maryland,
and Virginia.
I'll read that again for you guys.

30
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.690
Massachusetts,
New Hampshire,
Connecticut,
Rhode Island,
New York,
New Jersey,

31
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:52.980
Pennsylvania,
Maryland,

32
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:57.420
and Virginia colonies further to the south weren't invited because they were

33
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.480
viewed as being too far away from the probable cause of conflict to invite and

34
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:06.450
New Jersey and Virginia decided not to come because it seemed too expensive to

35
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:07.500
send delegates,

36
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:10.890
which again tells you how even at a time where people thought there was some

37
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:11.730
kind of a crisis.

38
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.380
Even that in some cases didn't inspire people to join in on this sort of joint

39
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:17.280
colonial effort.

40
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.980
Now the different delegates to the Albany Congress had different instructions

41
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:26.700
from their various colonies about what they were supposed to be doing and this

42
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:31.701
ends up being a really common problem with joint colonial meetings.

43
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:36.300
This problem of having different colonies even agree fundamentally and what's

44
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:38.490
supposed to be happening at the congresses when they meet.

45
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.790
And we're for sure going to see this happen again at the constitutional

46
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:42.624
convention.

47
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.300
Whereas we'll see you end up with a lot of different instructions about what's

48
00:02:45.301 --> 00:02:48.360
supposed to be happening there and people sort of have to figure out what

49
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:53.190
direction to go based on interpreting each different set of instructions.

50
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.510
So of the colonies that were at the Albany Congress,

51
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.200
only Massachusetts authorized it's delegates to go beyond Indian affairs and

52
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:09.991
intercolonial defense to at least discuss the possibility of entering into what

53
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:16.150
they called articles of union and confederation with the other colonies that

54
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.720
were represented for purposes as they put it.

55
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.720
This was in their instructions for the general defense of His Majesty subjects

56
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.920
and interest in North America as well.
And time of peace as of war.

57
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.750
So Massachusetts is the only colony that includes that.
Um,

58
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.310
but it's not as though that ideas at least about the possibility of a union had

59
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:42.130
never occurred to anybody before that point.

60
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.270
And particularly amongst several people,
Benjamin Franklin,

61
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.920
several years before,

62
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:52.780
actually as early as 1751 Franklin had been one of a number of people who had

63
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:56.110
thought maybe it makes sense to at least think about some way of unifying the

64
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:59.650
colonies.
And he had come up with his own plan.

65
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.490
He envisioned some kind of a governor general that would sort of preside over

66
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:10.711
this sort of layer of government that would exist over the colonies and the

67
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:13.780
governor general,
he thought it would be paid for by the crown.

68
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:18.340
And then he also saw a kind of general council that would represent all the

69
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.970
colonies and it would be,
um,

70
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.770
have delegates and it chosen by colonial assemblies.

71
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.210
So Franklin invents this thing,
1751 that he's,

72
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.870
you can see he's kind of trying to balance royal authority and colonial power.

73
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:36.160
And that's his idea.
So now a few years later,

74
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.460
1750 for the Albany Congress at least investigates the idea of some kind of a

75
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:47.161
union of colonies and they actually appointed a committee to prepare basically a

76
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:52.630
memorandum outlining what might be a proposed union.

77
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.070
And the memorandum has a really 18th century kind of title attached to it.
Um,

78
00:04:57.071 --> 00:05:01.990
the memorandum is titled Short Hints Towards a Scheme for general union,

79
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.810
the British colonies on the continent,
which isn't one of those wonderful,

80
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.890
actually that's short compare with some 18th century pamphlet titles that go on

81
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.120
when you're making footnotes.

82
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:13.030
You have these titles that go on for like five lines,

83
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.270
but we'll call it short hints,
which will be much easier.

84
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.960
So short hints is this memorandum drawn up by this committee and short

85
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.020
shorthands starts out by setting forth the basic problem of thinking about what

86
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:30.700
to do to even consider some kind of form of colonial union.

87
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.950
What they say at the beginning of this document is in such a scheme and a scheme

88
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:36.820
of colonial union,

89
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.370
the just prerogative of the crown must be preserved or it will not be approved

90
00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:47.371
and confirmed in England and the just liberties of the people must be secured or

91
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:52.870
the several colonies will disapprove of it and oppose it.
Okay.

92
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.840
It's a pretty tricky balancing act that we're talking about.

93
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.890
So to accomplish both of these things,
short hints,

94
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.310
proposed preserving individual colonial charters and sort of along the lines of

95
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:08.150
what Franklin had envisioned,

96
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.510
erecting a sort of new structure of government above the colonial charters.

97
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.420
So it does propose a grand council,

98
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.550
which would have two members from each colony and these members would be chosen

99
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:24.230
by colonial assemblies.

100
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.410
So they're basing power in the colonies and the these members of the grand

101
00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:31.640
council would serve for three years.

102
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.360
And there would be a president general that would be appointed by the crown,

103
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.350
paid for by the British government who could veto or approve acts of the grand

104
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:45.410
council and would have the duty to carry them out.

105
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.340
And the authority and power of both the president and this council would extend

106
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.420
to Indian affairs,

107
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.040
the purchase and settlement of lands that are outside the boundaries of an

108
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:01.100
existing colony and common defense.

109
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.930
And each colony would contribute to financing this new level of government based

110
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:10.370
on some kind of a quota that they would all agree on.
So basically they're,

111
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.770
the shorthands is suggesting something along the lines of what Franklin imagine

112
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.640
that's balancing royal authority.

113
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.720
And the power of the colonial legislature is trying to sort of pay homage to

114
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:25.721
both making a limited sphere in which this level of government can operate.

115
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.540
And Franklin not surprisingly,

116
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:34.541
ultimately was asked to finalize a plan of union based on what's laid out.

117
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:40.630
In short hints and the Albany Congress actually approved of this plan in July of

118
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:47.171
1754 and the congress then sent a copy to the colonial assemblies for their

119
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:52.160
consideration.
So they come up with a plan,
they pass the plan,

120
00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:55.550
and they actually pass it along to the colonies,
which is a significant step.

121
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.130
And this came to be known as the Albany Plan of union,
which makes sense.

122
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:03.890
Albany Congress,
Albany Plan of Union.

123
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.640
The Albany Plan of union was the most detailed proposal to create a union among

124
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:15.080
the American colonies ever attempted before the revolution.

125
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.710
However,
the ending of this will not be surprising.

126
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.200
Colonial legislatures were not too excited by this idea for two reasons.

127
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.500
Some colonial legislature tours denounced it as an attack on the authority of

128
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:30.434
the king.

129
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.180
Others were afraid that it would undermine colonial charters.

130
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.900
So you know,
although it tried to address both halves of this equation,

131
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.980
people protested for both reasons.
It's going to undermine the crown,

132
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.500
it's going to undermine the colonies,
the colonial legislature's.

133
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:50.710
So not surprisingly it failed and it's Benjamin Franklin put it at the time,

134
00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:53.570
he was extremely frustrated,
right?
He had the idea,

135
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.080
he actually watched the Albany Congress of move in the direction passes.

136
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.360
It goes out to the colonies.
Franklin probably thinking,
Ooh,
I had this idea.

137
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:03.660
Seemed like a good idea.
It might actually go into effect.
No.

138
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.440
So as he put it at the time,
everyone cries,

139
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.690
a union is necessary,
but when they come to the manor and form of the union,

140
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.690
they're weak.
Noodles are perfectly distracted.

141
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.030
It's very Franklin esque kind of comment.

142
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.320
Week noodles is also not a phrase you see in that mini sort of documents where

143
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:23.154
the time period,

144
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.760
so Albany Plan of Union for one reason or another fails like other attempts at

145
00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:32.070
colonial unity that sort of faded away

146
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.850
as we're going to see in lectures coming up.
And even partly in today's lecture,

147
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:44.690
it would end up taking a crisis that threatened not just colonial wellbeing,

148
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:51.270
but also what Collin is perceived to be their rights to inspire the colonist to

149
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:56.271
really band together and shared purpose as British American colonists.

150
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.630
And that brings us to the real topic of today's lecture,

151
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:05.790
which is the stamp act crisis.
Now,
as I mentioned before,

152
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:08.430
I think it's one or two lectures ago,
um,

153
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.200
before this crisis with the close of the French and Indian war,

154
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.260
colonial love and respect for things,

155
00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:20.520
English was at a real high because during that war,

156
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.050
the colonists had fought alongside English soldiers against England's longtime

157
00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:27.600
enemy,
the French,
and had one.

158
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.180
So the colonists after the French and Indian war,

159
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.160
or at a moment of high patriotism.

160
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.840
But of course what they couldn't foresee was the chain of events that we're

161
00:10:36.841 --> 00:10:40.020
going to be set off by the French and Indian war.

162
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:46.580
The crown had spent vast amounts of money on the war money that somehow is going

163
00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:50.130
to have to be regained.

164
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:55.730
And this sort of basic economic reality was going to end up launching a debate

165
00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.340
about colonial rights.

166
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.390
And privileges that obviously down the road is going to have some pretty big

167
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.380
consequences.

168
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.990
And I were going to basically look at what happens in response to this budgetary

169
00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:13.230
crisis about all the money spent in fighting the French and Indian war.

170
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:18.620
And it begins with the opening of the 1764 budget debate in the House of

171
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.280
Commons.
And so it always begins,
it begins with a budget.

172
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.340
It begins with a budget problem.
And George Grenville,

173
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.610
who's the king's prime minister is the cause.

174
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:34.910
And Grenville is given the task of figuring out how to fund this enormous war

175
00:11:35.141 --> 00:11:37.320
debt.
So first,

176
00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:40.620
before 1764 before the moment we're talking about here,

177
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:46.050
Grandville actually had taxed people in England to help pay for this enormous

178
00:11:46.051 --> 00:11:49.980
debt.
So he established new taxes on stamps,

179
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:55.330
he taxed windows.
And actually those of you who have been to England,

180
00:11:55.331 --> 00:11:59.610
and you've probably seen some buildings where the windows were bricked in,
um,

181
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.760
that was to avoid the window tax,
right?
I don't want to pay a tax on my window,

182
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:07.660
so I will eliminate my window by covering it over.
Um,

183
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.630
so Grenville established a number of taxes in England.

184
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.210
He established some duties on domestic goods and even the king reduced his

185
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:18.210
household expenses,
right?
Ah,

186
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:23.350
even the king decided not to buy the really expensive kind of whatever it is he

187
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:25.900
was buying.
I'll go down one grade.
I don't know how he much,

188
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:27.460
he reduced his expenses,
but he tried.

189
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:31.360
So the moral of this is England is taxed first,

190
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:36.490
but next logically enough,
Grandville turn to the colonies.

191
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.370
Now,
he didn't think,

192
00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:44.050
and he didn't argue that the colonies should be paying for,
generally speaking,

193
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:46.570
the English national debt.
However,

194
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:52.350
there was a standing army of 10,000 men that had been left behind in the

195
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:57.901
colonies after the war to protect the colonies from the French that were still

196
00:12:58.631 --> 00:13:00.820
there to protect them from native Americans,

197
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.680
maybe to protect them from the Spanish.

198
00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:07.210
There were also somewhere there on the continent and Grenville did feel that the

199
00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:10.960
colony should help pay for that,
for that army left behind.

200
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.970
He also thought that colonial taxes were relatively low and he knew that

201
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:23.851
smuggling with the French during the war with the French had been a little bit

202
00:13:24.581 --> 00:13:28.720
rampant in the colonies during the French and Indian war.
It's not a good thing.

203
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:33.940
So basically he put all of that together and he decided it would be both fair

204
00:13:33.941 --> 00:13:38.590
and necessary to clamp down on colonial trade.

205
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:45.450
So Grandville decided and you could see the logic behind what he's doing here,

206
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.530
that he would try to get some revenue from the colonies to support the standing

207
00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:54.040
army that's in the colonies.
And the first thing that he did,

208
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.770
sort of a logical thing to do based on what I just told you,

209
00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.070
he decided he was going to try to stamp out smuggling.

210
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.450
He was going to try and at least stop something that shouldn't be happening and

211
00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:06.820
money was leaking out through smuggling.

212
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.480
But once he began to focus on this problem,

213
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:15.910
it became easy to see why smuggling was so widespread.

214
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:21.190
Colonial customs collectors who were supposed to be in the colonies,

215
00:14:21.191 --> 00:14:22.510
attending to their duties,

216
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.900
collecting customs often left the colonies and went back to England.

217
00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:30.550
And left their deputies and charge back in the colonies.

218
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:34.120
I mentioned before that not everybody was really excited to be based in the

219
00:14:34.121 --> 00:14:37.630
colonies and so here there was some people at least who want went back to

220
00:14:37.631 --> 00:14:40.450
England and sort of left things and their deputies control.

221
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:42.970
So not surprisingly,

222
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:47.260
what this meant in part was some of the people left in charge.

223
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.710
We're probably less than focused on their duties.

224
00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:54.380
They were some of these deputies who actually collected bribes.

225
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.580
There was some of them that just allow the smuggling to happen rather than

226
00:14:58.581 --> 00:15:02.240
collecting customs fees.
So you have a leaky system.

227
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.130
So Grenville looking at what's going on here,

228
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.190
discovers the source of the smuggling problem orders the collectors to get back

229
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.590
to the colonies.
Please,
this is your job.
You must go back to the colonies.

230
00:15:15.591 --> 00:15:18.260
I'm really sorry,
but you must go back and do your job.

231
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.990
And he told colonial governors to watch over what's happening and to report to

232
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:26.780
him any smuggling that they might see

233
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.040
now clearly to the colonists,

234
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.160
the British now seem to be paying attention to colonial affairs a little bit

235
00:15:37.161 --> 00:15:42.161
more than they were used to and taking action in ways that perhaps they had not

236
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:45.680
taken action before.
Now these are pretty mild steps,
right?

237
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.730
Smuggling isn't supposed to be happening,
so I am going to act against smuggling.

238
00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:53.630
It's not an enormous strike by Grandville,
but still,

239
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:58.760
it certainly would have indicated to the colonists that this period of salutary

240
00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:03.761
neglect of colonial trade might be shifting into something else.

241
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:11.470
Customs collectors had to do their job smuggling needed to be suppressed and

242
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:17.170
people who were caught violating trade laws had to travel for their trial to a

243
00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:21.190
vice admiralty court in Halifax,
Nova Scotia.
Okay.

244
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.860
That was highly unpopular.
Not that Nova Scotia is anything wrong with her,

245
00:16:24.861 --> 00:16:25.730
with Scotia.
However,

246
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.460
if you are a person who is now being caught for doing something,

247
00:16:28.461 --> 00:16:33.461
you've always been doing smuggling a and some official decides he's going to

248
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.870
sort of come after you and make you pay for that.

249
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.960
You needed to have a trial in Nova Scotia.

250
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.500
You needed to post bond yourself for the cost of the trial and at these trials a

251
00:16:45.821 --> 00:16:49.970
vice admiralty court does not have a jury.
We're going to come back to that,

252
00:16:49.971 --> 00:16:53.510
but obviously for all of these reasons this would not be a popular thing.

253
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.760
Clearly Grandville was serious about clamping down on smuggling.

254
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:05.650
Now Grandville also established some duties on foreign goods shipped into the

255
00:17:07.191 --> 00:17:09.380
colonies like sugar,

256
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.330
foreign rum,
French wine.

257
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.080
Both were prohibited from import into the colonies.

258
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:24.490
Items like iron and animal hides were added to the general list of goods that

259
00:17:25.551 --> 00:17:26.990
had a duty attached to them.

260
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:32.150
There were new hire duties placed on coffee,

261
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.500
on indigo,
on certain kinds of wine.
All of these things,

262
00:17:36.501 --> 00:17:41.501
largely non British goods and goods that had to pass through England on their

263
00:17:42.651 --> 00:17:45.500
way to the colonies,
had their duty doubled.

264
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.740
The one little ray of sunshine here.

265
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:54.050
Amidst all of these duties is that the duty on foreign molasses was reduced by

266
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:59.271
half and molasses was really central to New England distilleries producing rum.

267
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.690
So I think Grenville probably thought,
well that might be a good thing,
right?

268
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:06.060
Yeah.
There's a lot of duties on foreign imports,
but I'm,
I'm,

269
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.230
I'm reducing the duty of Farm Alaska,

270
00:18:08.231 --> 00:18:10.200
so those new Englanders at least should be pleased.

271
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:14.970
It'll be a little cheaper for them to produce rum.
So locked together,

272
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:19.500
all of those things,
all of those duties,
all of the new duties.

273
00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.090
So the changes and the cost of imported goods and the things that no longer were

274
00:18:24.091 --> 00:18:26.220
going to be allowed to be imported into the colonies.

275
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.490
That all gets known under the sort of big name,

276
00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:34.491
the sugar act of 1764 the sugar act of 1764 in England,

277
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.530
it was also known logically enough is the American revenue act.

278
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.770
It's a good way to remember exactly what it was supposed to be doing.

279
00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.830
And as I said,
Grenville thought,

280
00:18:46.831 --> 00:18:50.130
well that home molasses thing means it's not going to be that objectionable to

281
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:52.920
the colonist because I'm actually offering them something is I'm charging them

282
00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:55.740
more on some other things.
Now the aside note here,

283
00:18:55.741 --> 00:18:59.050
we're going to see more of this later,
but I'm going to mention it here.
Um,
we're,

284
00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:03.420
what we're seeing here is a hint of a pattern that's going to reveal itself over

285
00:19:03.421 --> 00:19:07.620
the course of the semester.
Is it clearly the British,
and in this case,

286
00:19:07.621 --> 00:19:12.621
Grandville is trying to anticipate the colonial reaction to his actions to what

287
00:19:12.661 --> 00:19:15.720
he's doing to British policy.
But here,

288
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.120
as we'll see there later examples as well,

289
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.480
he's wrong about the colonial understanding of the British imperial system and

290
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.610
of the colonists understanding of their place in it.

291
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.420
So what we're going to see again and again and again in one way or another is

292
00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.980
the British assume that the colonists are going to do one particular thing or

293
00:19:34.981 --> 00:19:38.640
that they're going to think in a particular way and the colonists end up doing

294
00:19:38.641 --> 00:19:40.740
or thinking something different,

295
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.090
which in a sense makes sense because you have royal officials in England,

296
00:19:45.091 --> 00:19:46.410
they're an ocean away.

297
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.940
They don't necessarily understand the evolving colonial mindset.

298
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.410
It's not like a colonist themselves have been standing back and saying,

299
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.550
we are evolving a different mindset,
right?

300
00:19:55.551 --> 00:19:58.410
I mean things are sort of percolating along and now the events that were

301
00:19:58.411 --> 00:20:01.950
beginning to talk about today are going to begin to reveal differences in

302
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:06.420
opinions and ideas.
So an ocean away,

303
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.770
they're assuming that the Collins are going to act in a certain way.

304
00:20:10.771 --> 00:20:13.410
The colonists don't necessarily,
and it's part of the point,

305
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.060
part of the problem to the colonists.

306
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.900
These people are an ocean away and as we'll see,

307
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.890
don't necessarily understand what's going on in the colonists there certainly

308
00:20:22.891 --> 00:20:24.840
what the colonists were thinking about what's going on.

309
00:20:24.841 --> 00:20:29.680
I'm going to come back to that again in today's lecture.
So Granville thinks,
oh,

310
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.200
okay,
probably this act all in all my balance itself out.

311
00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:35.034
It won't be so bad.

312
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:41.030
But the colonists only saw that the English suddenly seemed to be putting teeth

313
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.470
into the imperial system to really enforce rules and regulations.

314
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:50.320
And in enforcing these rules and regulations,

315
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.850
they were demanding that violators travel to Nova Scotia at their own cost,

316
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.840
posting bond for their own trials,
even if they were innocent.

317
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.650
And as I mentioned before,
this vice admiralty court in Nova Scotia,

318
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:07.240
which basically is a court for crimes at sea,
did not have a jury

319
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:10.900
at about the same time.

320
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:16.950
In 1764 Grandville also decided he's going to clamp down on colonial currency

321
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.290
because during the war,
several colonies,

322
00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:28.291
and especially Virginia had issued vast amounts of paper money and Grenville.

323
00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:34.450
Basically he's trying to assert control over the monetary system too.

324
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.010
So in 1764 he passes the currency act

325
00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.560
and the currency act says the colonies can't issue money,

326
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:51.430
that any act passed by a colonial legislature that violates this act is no and

327
00:21:52.401 --> 00:21:53.234
void.

328
00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:59.170
And that any colonial governor who consented to such an act on the part of the

329
00:21:59.451 --> 00:22:01.160
colonies,
any colonial governor,
governor,

330
00:22:01.161 --> 00:22:06.161
that allows his colony to produce currency would be fined a thousand pounds,

331
00:22:07.821 --> 00:22:12.650
which is a huge amount of money at that point would be dismissed from office and

332
00:22:12.651 --> 00:22:16.190
would be ineligible from any public office in future.
Okay.

333
00:22:16.191 --> 00:22:19.040
That's obviously a serious,
like we really,
really,

334
00:22:19.041 --> 00:22:21.140
really mean this about the whole currency issue.
We're,

335
00:22:21.141 --> 00:22:24.170
we're putting some serious punishments on the line here,

336
00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.930
so taken all together Americans,
colonists,

337
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.830
drew several not so happy conclusions from all of these actions.

338
00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:35.271
So first,

339
00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:40.271
obviously they're alarmed at the sudden clamping down on what in their eyes at

340
00:22:40.851 --> 00:22:43.610
least had been a working system,
right?
Everything had been okay,

341
00:22:43.611 --> 00:22:47.720
the system's working,
we're profiting from what we're doing.
The crown,

342
00:22:47.721 --> 00:22:50.390
the empire is profiting too with working perfectly well.

343
00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.960
Now all of a sudden things are being changed and teeth are being put in where

344
00:22:53.961 --> 00:22:55.100
there weren't teeth before.

345
00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.500
Second informed that they had to go to Nova Scotia if they smuggled and that

346
00:23:00.501 --> 00:23:02.600
there'd be no jury during their trial,

347
00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:08.210
they began to feel like second class citizens being denied a basic fundamental

348
00:23:08.211 --> 00:23:10.310
British right of a trial by jury.

349
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.353
Third,

350
00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:19.520
they were alarmed at the implications of the Currency Act because the

351
00:23:19.521 --> 00:23:21.080
implications are,
if you think about it,

352
00:23:21.081 --> 00:23:26.081
Granville basically saying he can nullify an act passed by a colonial assembly

353
00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:31.250
that's in the minds of the colon is a pretty alarming precedent.

354
00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:33.831
And then finally,

355
00:23:33.831 --> 00:23:38.831
fourth colonists were also alarmed that these new duties and these new acts that

356
00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:44.051
are being enforced were largely intended to fund a standing army in the

357
00:23:44.301 --> 00:23:48.890
colonies,
a standing army that parliament saw as being protective.

358
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.610
But you can also see how the colonists might've seen this as a threat,
right?

359
00:23:52.611 --> 00:23:54.500
Well,
if we don't listen to all of this stuff,

360
00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:58.310
there's a standing army here that we're actually funding.

361
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:03.410
So the colonists could have seen that armed force as a sign of tyranny is a

362
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:08.150
threat to enforce colonial cooperation.
So for all of these reasons,

363
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.950
these acts are problematic,
threatening,
frightening,
and get people thinking.

364
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.330
As Massachusetts radical James Otis said,

365
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:23.560
the passage of the sugar act said people are thinking in six months more than

366
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:29.000
they had done in their whole lives before.
He's like,
wow,

367
00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:29.900
that was a lot.

368
00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.740
And suddenly we really are evaluating how things are working here.

369
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:38.890
And obviously what people are thinking about is their basic rights as English

370
00:24:38.991 --> 00:24:42.320
subjects.
Now logically enough,

371
00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:47.321
there was a colonial response to Greenville's actions and as we'll see and also

372
00:24:48.621 --> 00:24:52.550
a pattern.
Massachusetts led the way.
So one example,

373
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:57.820
there was a Boston town meeting that met and decided to inform the Massachusetts

374
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.580
colonial assembly that they objected to Greenville's actions and that they

375
00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:07.100
proposed United action in the colonies to protest.

376
00:25:07.101 --> 00:25:10.490
Now this is just a town meeting saying,
well we the town of whatever,

377
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.600
don't like what's going on.
And we think the colonies should unite and protest.

378
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:17.720
So it's not necessarily a proposition that's going to get acted on.

379
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:19.340
Nothing really happens to this.

380
00:25:19.341 --> 00:25:24.080
But it does represent a pretty radical suggestion.
And as I've already discussed,

381
00:25:24.081 --> 00:25:28.940
it's a radical suggestion that is being launched for what feels like reasons of

382
00:25:28.941 --> 00:25:31.610
self defense.
So,

383
00:25:31.611 --> 00:25:35.780
but even though this doesn't get past the language of this petition that comes

384
00:25:35.781 --> 00:25:40.520
from this town meeting really reveals a lot about some of the fundamental fears

385
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.250
of the colonists.
I'm going to just quote a sentence or two from it,

386
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.680
but what still heightens our apprehensions is that those unexpected proceedings

387
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.040
maybe preparatory to new tech stations upon us.

388
00:25:55.490 --> 00:26:00.140
This we apprehend annihilates our charter,
right to govern and tax ourselves.

389
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.430
It strikes at our British privileges,
which as we have never forfeited them,

390
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.990
we hold in common with our fellow subjects who are natives of Britain.

391
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.990
He has a pretty strong statement.

392
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:15.770
Clearly the main problem here isn't just financial.

393
00:26:15.771 --> 00:26:18.740
We don't have a lot of people who were just irked that they have to pay more

394
00:26:18.741 --> 00:26:21.020
money,
more important.

395
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.680
It's the meaning of what's going on that's upsetting the colonists.

396
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.130
It's the ways in which their rights as that petition put it.

397
00:26:28.131 --> 00:26:33.131
As natives of Britain seemingly are being violated as well as the sense on the

398
00:26:34.671 --> 00:26:39.230
part of these colonists that they can't figure out yet quite how to voice their

399
00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:43.040
grievances.
They don't have a direct representative in parliament.
They're upset,

400
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.400
they're trying to figure out what to do about it.

401
00:26:44.401 --> 00:26:47.760
But I think that little hole in the system was also revealing itself at this

402
00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:48.594
point.

403
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:54.780
Now the British government didn't really listen to colonial protest as it was.

404
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.720
They didn't really sort of pick up on the tone of things going on in the

405
00:26:57.721 --> 00:26:58.554
colonies.

406
00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:03.590
And in fact Grenville continued along with his revenue plan and it march,

407
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.060
uh,
1765,

408
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.590
he proposed and parliament passed the stamp act.

409
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:17.240
The stamp back said that stamped paper had to be used for all kinds of

410
00:27:18.781 --> 00:27:22.530
documents,
for legal documents,
for college diplomas,

411
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.390
for land deeds,
for contracts,
for bills of sale,
for liquor licenses,

412
00:27:27.391 --> 00:27:31.760
for playing cards,
pamphlets,
newspapers,
almanacs,
broadsides,

413
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.920
all kinds of paper products now needed to be using this special stamped paper

414
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.260
and the special stamped paper costs more.

415
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:45.410
So basically the stamp act is placing a tax on all of these items by making

416
00:27:46.921 --> 00:27:51.900
people buy stamped paper for them.
And stamped paper is more expensive.

417
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.710
So what's significant about the stamp act?

418
00:27:56.070 --> 00:28:01.070
It's the first direct tax levied by parliament directly upon the colonists.

419
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.140
It's not a duty on shipping.

420
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:08.970
It's a tax levied by parliament directly upon the colonists and what they're

421
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:14.010
purchasing in the colonies.
So basically if you needed a legal document,

422
00:28:14.011 --> 00:28:15.540
if you are printing newspapers,

423
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:21.020
you had to buy stamps paper from special stamp agents who were appointed by the

424
00:28:21.691 --> 00:28:26.300
crown.
I can't resist adding here only because,
um,

425
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.710
I probably mentioned something like this before.
As a,

426
00:28:28.711 --> 00:28:30.240
as an early American historian,

427
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:33.510
you don't get to sort of live your history that often,
right?

428
00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:36.150
It's pretty far away.
I looked for opportunities to live my history,

429
00:28:36.151 --> 00:28:39.000
but it doesn't happen that often.
I've actually shut off at dueling pistol.

430
00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:43.090
I tried to learn to ride.
I tried.

431
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.290
I've had basically to be an 18th century gentleman.
Like I took fencing lessons,

432
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:47.610
I took riding lessons,

433
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.090
I shut off dueling pistols and I determined that I would have died a thousand

434
00:28:51.091 --> 00:28:55.530
times and the age is just bad on all counts.

435
00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.770
Um,
but in this case,
I wasn't trying to be an 18th century gentleman.

436
00:28:58.771 --> 00:29:02.310
I actually was doing research and I went down to the island of nervous in the

437
00:29:02.311 --> 00:29:05.730
Caribbean,
um,
which is where Alexander Hamilton is from.

438
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.590
It was doing research on Hamilton and I wanted to get into this courthouse on

439
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:11.041
the island,

440
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:15.330
which is where they had the papers that related to the history of the island.

441
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:17.850
And I was told when I went to do this,

442
00:29:17.851 --> 00:29:19.770
I showed up at the court house and they said,
well,

443
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:24.240
you need to go see the stamp man before you could come here because you need to

444
00:29:24.241 --> 00:29:27.450
buy a stamp and then you need to put it in the book and you need to swear an

445
00:29:27.451 --> 00:29:29.130
oath.
And there was like a whole bunch of stuff I needed to do.

446
00:29:29.131 --> 00:29:33.420
Any of us used to be a British island,
so,
so I needed to find a stamp man.
Okay.

447
00:29:33.421 --> 00:29:34.710
But,
and,
and oddly enough,

448
00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:37.620
I didn't get connect with what I was going to be experiencing here.

449
00:29:37.621 --> 00:29:42.250
I'm just like most fun stamp men.
So the up man,
I was told,

450
00:29:42.251 --> 00:29:45.700
I think it was in the,
not logically enough in the post office,
however,

451
00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:49.780
the stamp man hours were unclear to me.
I couldn't figure out when he was there.

452
00:29:49.781 --> 00:29:53.050
It took me a long time to find the stamp man and to buy the stamp.

453
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.080
And then I had to go back to the courthouse and I did after like paste it in the

454
00:29:56.081 --> 00:29:57.760
book and I had to swear an oath of some kind.

455
00:29:57.761 --> 00:30:01.900
And he was like this whole sort of colonial experience I was having.

456
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:02.800
But in the middle of this,

457
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:06.250
when I couldn't find the stamp man and I was dying to do this research,

458
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.230
it was not until I actually said out loud,
curse that stamp Matt.
I was like,

459
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.020
okay,
I'm living the revolution.

460
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:16.730
Hate that stamp Jack.

461
00:30:16.731 --> 00:30:19.510
So it took me a long time to realize I was having my own little personal

462
00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:23.590
revolutionary moment and I should say that,
um,
I don't want to of us to live bed.

463
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:23.801
Actually,

464
00:30:23.801 --> 00:30:26.920
it was wonderful place to visit and the people were wonderful on that island.

465
00:30:26.921 --> 00:30:29.230
To me it was just,
I couldn't find the stamp man and it,

466
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:33.790
I just had a revolution flashback and ultimately did the whole ritual and got

467
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:35.110
D's The records and they were great.

468
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.720
But I had my own little personal stamp tax moment,

469
00:30:37.721 --> 00:30:40.420
which kind of blew my mind at the time.
That's not,

470
00:30:40.421 --> 00:30:44.500
would not be the first thing I think I would get to experience here in I guess

471
00:30:44.501 --> 00:30:47.650
at the dawn of the 20th century.
Okay.
So Stamp Act,

472
00:30:47.651 --> 00:30:49.390
I understood the rage of the stamp back.

473
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.820
Now back to the Grenville Mr Stamp Act.
Um,

474
00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:59.170
clearly all these things I'm talking to you about,
he's passing multiple acts,

475
00:30:59.171 --> 00:31:04.000
trying to get some control over colonial finance.
And from his point of view,

476
00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:08.770
he's doing this to pay for the protection of the colonies themselves.

477
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:13.810
So the money being raised from all of these things actually would've gone into a

478
00:31:13.811 --> 00:31:16.180
fund for Defense of the colonies.

479
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:20.590
And even when you take all of these fundraising activities together,

480
00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:24.760
all of the money from all of these duties and taxes added up to only about a

481
00:31:24.761 --> 00:31:29.761
third of the cost of maintaining that colonial military establishment,

482
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:33.400
but to the colonists,

483
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.950
they were being taxed without their consent and their rights to some basic

484
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.670
fundamental British rights were being abridged,

485
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:45.670
their basic rights as English subjects were being attacked.

486
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.170
And this is important to note because I think we all have no taxation without

487
00:31:50.171 --> 00:31:52.090
representation sort of running through her head,
right?

488
00:31:52.091 --> 00:31:55.240
That's what the revolution is about as though the revolution is all about people

489
00:31:55.241 --> 00:31:59.320
who are angry about paying taxes.
But obviously it's about much more than that.

490
00:31:59.321 --> 00:32:02.830
We're talking about fundamental rights being violated,

491
00:32:02.831 --> 00:32:05.980
people feeling that there's something more than just,
I don't like paying taxes,

492
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.480
but it's what that means.

493
00:32:07.481 --> 00:32:12.280
What this whole way of operating suggests and implies about fundamental rights,

494
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.600
about the position of the colonists within the empire.
Now,

495
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:22.110
the British response to colonial grumbling about these measures was to argue the

496
00:32:23.211 --> 00:32:28.211
colonists were virtually represented in parliament virtual representation that

497
00:32:29.591 --> 00:32:32.950
in parliament there were members who represented the entire British realm.

498
00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:35.140
And so the colonists were virtually represented.

499
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:41.270
And the argument would have been they were also people in proper who did not get

500
00:32:41.361 --> 00:32:44.060
to directly vote for their own representatives in parliament.

501
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.390
So colonial rights of representation aren't under attack.

502
00:32:47.391 --> 00:32:48.470
What's happening in the colonies.

503
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.860
Isn't that different from what happens to some people who would have been in

504
00:32:51.861 --> 00:32:56.861
England proper but in the colonies were colonial representatives often got

505
00:32:57.921 --> 00:33:00.920
direct instructions from town meetings.
I mean,

506
00:33:00.921 --> 00:33:03.470
where you're really seeing some really direct representation.

507
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.760
Virtual representation was not always a convincing argument.

508
00:33:07.761 --> 00:33:11.360
And actually as one Maryland petition at the time put it virtual representation

509
00:33:11.361 --> 00:33:16.310
is quote,
fantastical and frivolous.
That I love the alliteration there.

510
00:33:16.311 --> 00:33:19.550
Fantastical and for list,
um,
this whole virtual representation thing,

511
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:24.910
they weren't necessarily buying as someone argued at the time in England.

512
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:30.440
Such an assertion about virtual representation might be true because a member of

513
00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:35.120
parliament probably had similar interests to other inhabitants of England.

514
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:40.040
But what would a member of parliament,
no of colonial interests.
And even worse,

515
00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:41.330
it's some Collin,
it's reasoned,

516
00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:47.000
maybe members of parliament might actually have interests that were opposed to

517
00:33:47.001 --> 00:33:47.600
the colonist.

518
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.710
I mean maybe that actually want to tax the colonies more so that they themselves

519
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.300
would have to pay less.

520
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:59.150
So basically at the heart of these colonial grievances were assumptions about

521
00:33:59.151 --> 00:34:02.360
British rights and British liberties.

522
00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:07.610
Liberties were rooted in property at the time.

523
00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:11.900
A slave would have been defined as someone who depended entirely on the will of

524
00:34:11.901 --> 00:34:14.900
others.
So it'd be free.
And to be independent,

525
00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:19.220
you need it to be in control of your own property directly.

526
00:34:19.221 --> 00:34:23.930
Taxing without consent seem to threaten colonial property rights and again,

527
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:29.150
to fundamentally attack basic English liberties.
Okay,

528
00:34:29.151 --> 00:34:33.560
so now we have a whole list of grievances here bundled up under the idea of

529
00:34:33.561 --> 00:34:35.840
threatened liberties and rights,
right?

530
00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:41.020
We have the first direct tax from parliament on colonists and it might be the

531
00:34:42.021 --> 00:34:43.760
precedent for more such things.

532
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:47.750
We have violation of colonial rights to a trial by jury.

533
00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.520
We have a seeming attack on the colonial economy,
right?

534
00:34:51.521 --> 00:34:54.620
Things are suddenly being regulated in some way that they haven't seemed to be

535
00:34:54.621 --> 00:34:55.454
before.

536
00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:01.360
We have the threat of directly overriding colonial legislation and legislatures.

537
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.700
So you can see why all of these things would have been pretty alarming.

538
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:10.280
But there were also two important unintended outcomes of the stamp act.

539
00:35:10.281 --> 00:35:13.160
In addition to all of those raised fears,

540
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:16.040
unintended outcome number one,

541
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.670
because the stamp act attacked all of the colonies equally,

542
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:24.980
it actually helped to join them together and shared cause.

543
00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:29.360
And second unintended outcome.
Number two,

544
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:34.250
by attacking people who used paper particularly right lawyers using legal

545
00:35:34.251 --> 00:35:36.530
documents,
newspaper writers,

546
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.340
and merchant's ship owners.

547
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:44.630
The act also attacked specifically the most vocal and prestigious colonists in

548
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:45.990
addition to everybody else.

549
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:50.730
So it was attacking people who had the means to protest,

550
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.930
to say what they were upset about legally and writing.

551
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.830
So it was easy for people.
They were,

552
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.680
they were logically the people who would make the loudest protest.

553
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.920
So now in this climate of increasing anxiety on the part of the colonists,

554
00:36:05.921 --> 00:36:10.500
we arrive at a revolutionary war moment that most Americans know.

555
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:15.150
Patrick Henry Patrick Henry's dramatic declarations in the Virginia House of

556
00:36:15.151 --> 00:36:19.320
Burgesses on May 30th and 31st of 1765.

557
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.740
And what he's doing at the time,
we all know you'll give me liberty,

558
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:23.221
give me death,

559
00:36:23.221 --> 00:36:27.090
but we don't really focus on why he says that he actually was protesting against

560
00:36:27.091 --> 00:36:28.680
the implications of the Stamp Act.

561
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.250
Now I'm sure we all have pictures in our head,
images in our head there.

562
00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:36.480
There are a lot of bad revolutionary war movies,

563
00:36:36.481 --> 00:36:39.840
but probably even some of the bad revolutionary war movies have scenes of

564
00:36:39.841 --> 00:36:42.510
Patrick Henry.
Well,
it's another one of the founders doing this.
You know,

565
00:36:42.511 --> 00:36:46.030
Patrick Henry,
that's what he does.
Give me liberty or give me death.
Um,

566
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.690
so we have a lot of images in our head about what happened there.

567
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:51.220
And then of course we have people crying,
treason,

568
00:36:51.221 --> 00:36:54.190
the treason and Henry doing a variety of brave things and saying,

569
00:36:54.191 --> 00:36:56.910
you've already brave things as he makes this bold statement.

570
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:01.650
Now it's true that actually Henry was a dramatic speaker.

571
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.230
He actually was even Thomas Jefferson thought.

572
00:37:04.231 --> 00:37:07.020
So when Thomas Jefferson did not like bedroom Henry,
um,

573
00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:11.160
he thought Henry was lazy.
He didn't think Henry was interested in reading books,

574
00:37:11.161 --> 00:37:12.900
which to Jefferson would be a very bad sin.

575
00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.610
He thought Henry was a little reckless and,

576
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:18.240
and Harry was a little bit of a sort of rough and ready character.

577
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:23.630
But even Jefferson had to admit that Henry had a huge impact on his audience.

578
00:37:24.211 --> 00:37:27.630
That he really,
when he spoke,
he swayed people's emotions.

579
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:33.330
And Jefferson also,
it must be said,
it was a notoriously bad public speaker,

580
00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:37.110
right?
You had this quiet voice.
He mumbled,
he was nervous.

581
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:39.150
He hated speaking in front of groups.

582
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.120
So probably he was also a little bit jealous of Henry that didn't help him in

583
00:37:42.121 --> 00:37:45.720
his attitude towards Patrick Henry.
So Henry was actually a great speaker,

584
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.140
but rather than stick with legend and the great orator with the finger in the

585
00:37:49.141 --> 00:37:53.670
air,
I'm going to offer you here in eye witness account of Henry speech from an

586
00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:57.840
unnamed French traveler who actually was standing in the lobby of the Virginia

587
00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.200
House of burgesses.
And Jefferson was there too,
watching the proceedings.

588
00:38:01.201 --> 00:38:06.201
So this is how this French traveler describes what he saw arrived at

589
00:38:06.421 --> 00:38:11.220
Williamsburg at 12 where I saw three negros hanging at the gallows for having

590
00:38:11.221 --> 00:38:13.590
robbed Mr Waldo of 300 pounds sterling.

591
00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:17.310
So that's the first sight that greets him.
I went immediately to the assembly,

592
00:38:17.311 --> 00:38:21.720
which was seating where I was entertained with very strong debates concerning

593
00:38:21.721 --> 00:38:24.750
duties that the parliament wants to lay on the American colonies,

594
00:38:24.751 --> 00:38:28.950
which they call a style stamp duties.
Shortly after I came in,

595
00:38:28.951 --> 00:38:32.910
one of the members stood up and said he had read that in former times Tarquin

596
00:38:32.911 --> 00:38:36.640
and Juliet's had their Brutus.
Charles had his crime well and he did not doubt,

597
00:38:36.641 --> 00:38:39.130
but some good American would stand up in favor of his country,

598
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.880
but says he and a more moderate manner and was going to continue.

599
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:46.280
When the speaker of the house rose and said,
the last that stood up hits,

600
00:38:46.281 --> 00:38:49.900
spoke treason and he was sorry to see that not one of the members of the house

601
00:38:49.901 --> 00:38:52.360
was loyal enough to stop him before he had gone.

602
00:38:52.361 --> 00:38:56.650
So far upon which the same members stood up again and it says in parentheses,

603
00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.270
I think his name is Henry,
and said that if he had a fronted,

604
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.560
the speaker of the house,
he was ready to ask pardon,

605
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.500
and he would show his loyalty to His Majesty,
King George,

606
00:39:05.501 --> 00:39:08.230
the third at the expense of the last drop of his blood.

607
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:12.820
But what he had said must be attributed to the interest of his country's dying

608
00:39:12.821 --> 00:39:14.920
liberty,
which he had at heart.

609
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:19.210
And the heat of passion might've led him to say something more than he intended.

610
00:39:19.211 --> 00:39:21.250
But again,
if he said anything wrong,

611
00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:25.030
he begged the speaker and the house is pardoned and some other members stood up

612
00:39:25.031 --> 00:39:27.550
and backed him on which the affair was dropped.
Okay.

613
00:39:27.551 --> 00:39:30.970
So that's the eyewitness account,
which is not quite like the legend,

614
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:32.050
but the fact that he's actually,

615
00:39:32.051 --> 00:39:37.051
Henry did speak pretty boldly and he did talk about his country's dying liberty,

616
00:39:37.361 --> 00:39:40.120
which says a lot about what we're talking about right now,

617
00:39:40.121 --> 00:39:44.560
that the colonial perception of lost English liberties.

618
00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:49.000
And ultimately in May of 1765,

619
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:54.340
the Virginia House of Burgesses did end up passing some resolutions.

620
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.400
They're ultimately known as the Virginia resolutions.

621
00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:03.460
And the Virginia resolution said that the colonists had come to Virginia with

622
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:08.490
equal rights to all British subjects and that they still retain them,

623
00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:15.420
that Virginians alone had the right to directly tax Virginians and that only

624
00:40:15.821 --> 00:40:19.810
those who would be affected by taxes had the right to pass them.

625
00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:23.710
I'll repeat that one more time.
Virginia resolutions.
May,
1765,

626
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.700
the colonist had come to Virginia with equal rights to all British subjects.

627
00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:29.050
They still retaining them.

628
00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:34.150
Virginians alone had the right to directly tax Virginians and only those who

629
00:40:34.151 --> 00:40:38.670
would be affected by taxes had the right to pass them.
Um,

630
00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.700
I will stop there.
Um,
we will go on.
We are just,

631
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.880
I keep saying we're going to get to the Stamp Act Congress.
We're so close.

632
00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:48.130
We will begin with the Stamp Act Congress,

633
00:40:48.131 --> 00:40:50.890
which will lead logically into the topic of the next lecture,

634
00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:55.560
which is what's going on in Boston,
and then continued buildup.

635
00:40:55.570 --> 00:41:00.010
We'll see how the Virginia resolutions spread to other colonies and how

636
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:05.050
resistance begins to build because of the stamp act and how events continue to

637
00:41:05.051 --> 00:41:08.500
unfold.
After that,
I will see you all on Thursday.
