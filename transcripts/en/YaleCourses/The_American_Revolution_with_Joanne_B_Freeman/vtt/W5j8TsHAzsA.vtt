1
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.620
Um,
today we're going to be talking about loyalists.

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.460
And in doing so we're going to be talking about the range of responses to the

3
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:14.460
building crisis in British America.

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.390
So basically over the course of the first few lectures here,

5
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.230
we've looked at the logic behind some British policy.

6
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.710
We've looked at the logic of resistance.

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.640
Now we're seeing a little momentum of resistance building up.

8
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:34.500
So now also we need to look at people who maybe are not as eager to resist

9
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.700
against the British government.
And these are the loyalist.
Um,

10
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.550
and it's going to seem sort of opposite as to what I ought to be doing at this

11
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:44.040
moment.
But before we launch into looking at the loyalists,

12
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:48.570
I actually want to go back for a moment to the first continental congress.

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.870
Partly because,
as you'll hear when I'm talking about it,

14
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.080
it's actually the debates and proceedings and an outcome of this first

15
00:00:57.271 --> 00:01:01.050
continental congress that really helps crystallize matters.

16
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.230
Because as we'll see,
it really is 1774,

17
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:08.460
1775 where you begin to have people who kind of identify themselves as

18
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:12.000
loyalists.
And partly because,
as you'll see,

19
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.390
even in the first continental congress itself,

20
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.640
there actually were a range of opinions.

21
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:22.560
Not Everybody in the congress agreed on the level of what needed to be done.

22
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:27.561
So it's not as though in 1774 you had a blob of patriot and a blob of loyalists.

23
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:32.220
You had a spectrum of opinions throughout society.

24
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.350
So let's look first at the first continental congress in a little bit more

25
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:40.190
detail here just at the start of electric.

26
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.130
And as I mentioned when I last discussed the congress,

27
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.930
it wasn't only composed of radicals though,

28
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.220
as I'll discuss in a moment,

29
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:54.270
just the simple fact that this congress was called was a pretty bold action.

30
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.490
But even so,
there was a range of opinions represented in the Congress.

31
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.910
So there were some more radical types present.

32
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.570
So you did have people like Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry there,

33
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.540
and already these people are radical in their thoughts.

34
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:11.540
They're already pondering the possibility of worry.

35
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.260
You'll hear from Patrick Henry in a moment,

36
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.830
but there were also moderates there who were more in favor of reconciliation or

37
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:24.300
reform and who hoped that the meeting of the congress would maybe show

38
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:29.070
parliament that the colonies were United and determined and that maybe the

39
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:34.071
simple fact that it met would inspire parliament to modify some of its policies.

40
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.050
And as we'll see,

41
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.430
it ends up being that those who were more radical in their leanings ultimately

42
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:44.520
have a slight majority in this continental congress.

43
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:47.460
And so in the end they actually win the day.

44
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.310
But it isn't obvious that that's going to be the case at the outset.

45
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.550
Now that the delegates to this congress met in Philadelphia in the beginning of

46
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.550
September in 1774 there were 50 men present and as I mentioned before,

47
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:06.130
most of them had some kind of experience with politics in their individual

48
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:11.110
colonies.
Now if you do think about the fact that this congress existed,

49
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.880
just calling it into existence was something of a radical act.

50
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:19.660
Because if you think about it,
this is a colonial congress,

51
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.960
a self appointed Congress that granted itself power of some kind over all of the

52
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:26.764
colonies.

53
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.960
And even as we're about to see past something that was in the equivalent of

54
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:35.230
legislation that applied to all of the colonies.

55
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.560
So in a sense that's a pretty radical gesture.

56
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.190
And I found actually a satire written in 1774 that does a good job,

57
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:50.050
I think of showing how the congress did seem radical to some and,

58
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.630
and how to sum it,
did not represent happy,

59
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:53.980
good things that we're about to happen,

60
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:56.470
but actually represented something frightening and out of control.

61
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.780
And it's actually,
it's a broad side.
So it was a single sheet.
Um,

62
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.290
and this is a satire.

63
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.370
So it was meant to be making fun of people who were just elected to the

64
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:08.470
continental cron.
Congress is actually from New York.

65
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.790
And it came out just after New York had decided who was going to go to the

66
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:14.020
continental Congress from New York.

67
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:17.080
So these were people who were just making fun of the whole idea of having a

68
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:20.950
continental congress.
So it's a broad side and it's,

69
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:25.510
it's made to look like a very formal series of resolutions and actually it's

70
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:29.820
titled a meeting of the true sons of liberty.
Um,

71
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.860
and I met after class,
I'll post a link to it.

72
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:36.430
It's actually as is everything these days digitized so that you can actually see

73
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.690
what it looks like.
So the broad side series of resolutions,

74
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:45.580
it reads number one,
resolved that in this general time of resolving,

75
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:48.790
we have as good a right to resolve is the most resolute.
Okay.

76
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.710
This is not a serious series of resolutions.
Number two,

77
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.190
resolved that we have the whole sense of the city,
county,

78
00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:01.510
province and all the colonies concentrated in our own persons.
Again,

79
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.080
something that's not really the people writing these resolutions.
Number three,

80
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.330
resolved that these resolves and any we may afterwards see fit to promulgate

81
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.620
shall be approved by all sensible and Goodman and our parent country and that

82
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:19.330
they shall even make that ungracious Barlett Lord North Violet is one of those

83
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:20.950
words you don't get to save very often.

84
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.980
It made me really happy to type it today that ungracious Barlett Lord North.

85
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.300
It will make him shake in his shoes when he sees them and split his breeches.

86
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.193
Okay.

87
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.200
The eternal joke of people splitting your pants like that dates back to 1774 and

88
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:41.290
practically earlier,
I would assume it goes earlier than that,
the eternal joke.

89
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.920
So Lord North's,
we'll shake it,
his shoes,

90
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:49.720
it will make him split his breeches resolved number for that any act or acts of

91
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:53.200
parliament would prevent the colonies from triumphing over the liberties

92
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.160
sporting with the goods or at will claiming the properties of the British

93
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.800
ministry is a cruel oppression in which all the colonies are intimately

94
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:01.634
concerned.

95
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.130
Resolved that the nonpayment of debt contracted with England is the only way to

96
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:11.000
save the credit of those who have no money to pay their debts with.
Okay.

97
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:14.330
So that's attacking the logic of people who don't want to pay taxes,

98
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.540
but they just don't have money and they don't feel like pain resolved.

99
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.740
That the best way of approved,

100
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.770
of approving our loyalty is to spit in the king's face as the means of opening

101
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:26.960
his eyes.
Okay.
And then finally,

102
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.900
lastly resolved that every man,
woman,

103
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:33.470
or child who does not agree with our sentiments,
whether he,

104
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:38.471
she or they understand them or not is an enemy to his country where soever he

105
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:43.400
was born,
whatever he may think of it and that he ought at least to be tarred and

106
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:47.090
feathered if not hanged,
drawn and quartered.
All statutes,

107
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:50.660
laws and ordinances whatsoever to the contrary,
not withstanding.
Okay.

108
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.820
So that's,

109
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:57.821
that tire clearly throws within it a slew of accusations against this pending

110
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:03.980
continental congress.
You can see that it's being accused of being arbitrary,

111
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.930
of promoting lawlessness,

112
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.770
of having a lack of tolerance for anybody who feels any differently,

113
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.850
that it's being accused of displaying a lack of respect or gratitude towards the

114
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:16.430
mother country,
maybe even vindictiveness.

115
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.810
And as it was clear in that first we resolve to be resolving in this time of

116
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:21.800
resolving their,

117
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:24.950
also accusing it of having like a stupid amount of self importance,
right?

118
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.390
Continental Congress harrumph sure.
Go have your little continental congress.

119
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.310
So any of these reasons would have been part of the reasoning why someone might

120
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:38.030
have felt that this continental congress was not only not a good idea,

121
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:42.050
but potentially a dangerous idea.
So for one reason or another,

122
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.140
people clearly found the calling of the continental congress.

123
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.170
Somewhat remarkable.
So the congress is,

124
00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:53.171
first meeting was on September 5th and one of the first things that they had to

125
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:58.640
debate logically enough is how the congress is going to vote on issues.

126
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.150
Should voting be based on the population of each colony,

127
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.290
which obviously gives bigger colonies an advantage or should each county have

128
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:07.880
one vote?
The eternal question,

129
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.930
obviously this is going to come back and hit us with a vengeance at the

130
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:15.980
constitutional convention.
How they,
oh,

131
00:08:15.981 --> 00:08:20.720
that's one of those question and a question of questions that I have not gone to

132
00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:23.660
look at the record to see formerly how they voted on the voting.

133
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.730
I would assume they voted by person,

134
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.380
but I will have to actually look that up to tell you how they voted.

135
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.570
The question was how do you vote on how you're going to vote?

136
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.910
That's a really good question.
I will,
I will come in next time.
Um,

137
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.850
and tell you the answer to that question.
I had not considered that before.
Okay.

138
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:46.060
How do you vote on voting?
Um,
okay.
So however you vote on voting,
um,

139
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.950
that was one of the first things that they had to debate was how voting was

140
00:08:48.951 --> 00:08:50.360
going to work.
And as I said,

141
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:54.140
it's going to come back and smack us again in the constitutional convention.

142
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.830
Now,
this whole debate voting on voting,
um,

143
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.670
tried the patience of Patrick Henry.
Okay.
Patrick Henry,

144
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:06.120
obviously one of the more radical members of this first continental congress,

145
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.360
really impatient at the idea that they're dilly dallying about voting and how to

146
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.650
calculate population of different colonies.

147
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:16.920
So this is what Henry said in a burst of frustration.

148
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.740
Government is dissolved.
We are in a state of nature,
sir.

149
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.870
The distinctions between Virginians,

150
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.740
Pennsylvania New Yorkers and new Englanders are no more.

151
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.320
I am not a Virginian but an American.

152
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.230
Clearly he has a real talent for the bold statement,

153
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.910
the memorable bold statement.

154
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.360
I am not a Virginia and button America and kind of not as famous as the liberty

155
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:42.570
or death thing,
but still clearly really bold.

156
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:46.500
Also clearly referring to the logic John Locke social contract.

157
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:48.360
He's by saying that we're in a state of nature,

158
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.770
Henry's basically saying that the social contract between the colonies and the

159
00:09:52.771 --> 00:09:57.600
crown has been broken.
Clearly he's one of the more radical members of Congress.

160
00:09:57.601 --> 00:10:00.840
So everybody didn't hear what he said and stand up and applaud in lineup.
Yes,

161
00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:04.260
we're in a state of nature go.
He's an extreme.

162
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.890
But in fact you can see throughout the continental congress tension between a

163
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:12.480
real spectrum of opinions.

164
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.780
There were militant members really promoting resistance,

165
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:19.710
even already kind of thinking maybe wars on the horizon and then they were more

166
00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:24.711
moderate members promoting reconciliation or maybe reform of some kind.

167
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.560
And you can see the push of the more militant members and the sort of debate

168
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:35.310
between the different kinds of opinions almost immediately within the first few

169
00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:40.311
weeks of meeting with the arrival of what came to be called the Suffolk Resolves

170
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.420
Suffolk,
Massachusetts,
Su.
F.
F.
O.
L.
K.
Um,

171
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.760
and again,
obviously Suffolk,
Massachusetts,
not surprisingly,

172
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.570
these what you will see as being very bold resolutions originate in

173
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:52.740
Massachusetts,

174
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.000
but they were not introduced by Massachusetts delegates.

175
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.100
This is something John Adams does later too.

176
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.430
Like because Massachusetts is such a radical colony,

177
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.480
people delegates from Massachusetts know that they had better not be the ones to

178
00:11:06.481 --> 00:11:07.590
promote anything.

179
00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:10.920
That sounds radical because everybody will immediately dismiss it.

180
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.590
So in this case,
the Massachusetts delegates,
no,

181
00:11:13.591 --> 00:11:16.310
if they come forward and say we brought these resolved,

182
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.340
you want you to consider them,

183
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.580
people would probably assume that they were too extreme.

184
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.850
But if they appear to come from Massachusetts to the continental congress,

185
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.600
well then that becomes something that people will be more open to considering.

186
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:33.060
So this set of resolves was sent to the Congress,

187
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:36.990
supposedly from Suffolk County,
Massachusetts,
which is I Guess Boston's county.

188
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.630
And they became known as the Suffolk resolves.

189
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:44.520
So here's a list of some of the things that these declared,
okay.
Number one,

190
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.080
they declared the intolerable acts or the coercive acts,

191
00:11:49.081 --> 00:11:53.250
however you want to refer to them as being unconstitutional and not to be
obeyed.

192
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.270
Number two,
they said that Massachusetts,

193
00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.790
which you remember that their government had been dissolved,

194
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:04.030
things had been changed because of all everything that's been going on in
Boston.

195
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:08.770
Massachusetts should create a new assembly for itself to collect all colonial

196
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:13.771
taxes and withhold them from the crown until the Massachusetts government had

197
00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:16.870
been restored to its constitutional foundation.

198
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.290
Number three,

199
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.150
the resolves advise people to arm themselves and formed their own militia in

200
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:29.050
preparation for resisting the possibility of British attack.

201
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.540
Number four,

202
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:36.460
they propose that the jailing of any Patriot leader gave people the right to

203
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:38.410
jail British officials,

204
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:44.440
and then finally they recommended stringent economic sanctions against Britain.

205
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.030
Okay.
Clearly those are really radical resolutions on a bunch of levels.

206
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.030
Now,
they were proposed,
they were red.

207
00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:57.010
They were presented some in the continental Congress applauded them,

208
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.020
but they were not initially acted on for obvious reasons because they made a lot

209
00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:05.350
of delegates,
extremely nervous as delegate.

210
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:10.350
Joseph Galloway of Pennsylvania said the Suffolk resolves quote contained a

211
00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:15.250
complete declaration of war against Great Britain.
Okay.
They seem pretty extreme.

212
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:21.540
Galloway was typical of many who felt that just failing to recognize,

213
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.860
recognize parliaments,
right to regulate trade,
didn't accomplish anything.

214
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.550
And as a matter of fact,
he wasn't even sure that that was right in theory.

215
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:36.310
So Galloway at this moment came up with his own suggestion about the best course

216
00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:41.200
of action.
And although in comparison with the really radical Suffolk results,

217
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:44.110
his suggestions are going to sound conservative.

218
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.280
He actually are promoting ideas that in and of themselves,

219
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.990
as you'll hear our radical.

220
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:56.040
So basically Galloway tries to come up with a way to change the basis of the

221
00:13:56.141 --> 00:14:00.640
relationship between the American colonies and the mother country.

222
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:01.920
And so he suggest,

223
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:06.190
suggest a new plan of union that he thinks are going to,

224
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.990
it's going to settle the whole matter.

225
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:14.460
So Galloways plan of union suggested forming a separate American legislature,

226
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.550
he called it,
I think the grand council,

227
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:24.390
and it would be elected by colonial assemblies and individual colonies would

228
00:14:24.701 --> 00:14:29.701
continue to govern their own internal affairs and the grand counsel would

229
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:31.690
regulate commercial,

230
00:14:31.691 --> 00:14:36.640
civil and criminal matters that affected the colonies generally as a whole.

231
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.420
Now according to Galloways plan,

232
00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:44.020
this grand council could veto parliamentary legislation.

233
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.150
Clearly that's a pretty bold gesture,

234
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.390
but still it would be inferior to parliament,

235
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.450
which could still initiate legislation relevant to the colonies.

236
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.213
In essence,

237
00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:00.560
the grand council would be kind of an inferior branch of the British parliament.

238
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.780
And the great principle behind Galloways plan was quote,

239
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.380
that no law should bind America without her consent.

240
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.090
So that's really what he's trying to do here is devise a way for the colonists

241
00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:18.500
to consent to what's being passed in parliament.

242
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.510
Now,
interestingly,

243
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.530
the vote over Galloways plan of union was close,

244
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.050
but it was ultimately defeated.

245
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.710
And I suppose looking back in the long view of time,

246
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.850
it probably wasn't likely that the British government would have approved of the

247
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:38.510
creation of a kind of second colonial parliament.

248
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.120
And as we'll see,
that's unlikely,

249
00:15:41.121 --> 00:15:44.300
particularly when you look later at how parliament responded to these

250
00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:45.590
continental congresses.

251
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.540
And in a sense you could say the continental congress was a sort of temporary

252
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:52.130
version of a grand council.

253
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.980
So the fact that parliament wasn't too keen on that would suggest they wouldn't

254
00:15:54.981 --> 00:15:59.510
be very excited about a little baby colonial parliament branch of parliament

255
00:15:59.511 --> 00:16:00.350
being established.

256
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:06.580
Even so Galloway later declared that his plan lost due to what he called the

257
00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:11.771
violent party and he felt the violent party was in control of the continental

258
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:12.974
congress,

259
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.210
and in a sense he was right because the more radical members did have a very

260
00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:22.211
slight majority and the defeat of Galloways plan actually ended up mobilizing

261
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:31.370
these more radical members because it suggested that the moderates didn't have

262
00:16:31.371 --> 00:16:34.010
the power to accomplish their goals.

263
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:39.650
So with this new burst of confidence in their strength with the defeat of

264
00:16:39.651 --> 00:16:40.700
Galloways plan,

265
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.880
these radicals proposed and passed the Suffolk resolves on October 8th,

266
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.580
1774 so they actually pass them
to many in Congress.

267
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:57.610
This seemed like an incredibly bold act of unity among the colonies and even

268
00:16:57.711 --> 00:17:01.550
though the individual resolves we're radical,
too many,

269
00:17:01.551 --> 00:17:04.600
what they noticed most of all was that it appeared to be an active unity.

270
00:17:04.601 --> 00:17:09.601
In a sense it was responding to Massachusetts and to Massachusetts plight with

271
00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:12.560
an action that would affect all of the colonies.

272
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.780
As John Adams put it this day,

273
00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:19.130
convinced me that America will support Massachusetts or perish with her,

274
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.780
so he took it like many others as a really interesting sign of colonial unity.

275
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:24.711
Now,

276
00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:28.730
of course not everybody has such a thrilled reaction to the Suffolk resolves.

277
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.650
One completely baffled.

278
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:35.180
Loyalist Observer said that he could only explain the acceptance of the Suffolk

279
00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:39.500
resolves by assuming that the delegates quote came into this vote immediately

280
00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:42.890
after drinking 32 bumpers of the Best Madeira.
Okay.

281
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:47.440
They just must have been drunk.
There's no other explanation.

282
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:52.050
This makes no sense.
Eternal explanation for all of history.

283
00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:56.820
I guess they must've been drunk,
drunk or crazy.
Okay,
so clearly.

284
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.320
Sure.
Sign here that the colonies are not just going to be backing down

285
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:08.330
six days later on October 14th Congress approved the declaration and resolves

286
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.210
and they had agonized over that for a month,
so they didn't just pass it.

287
00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:16.890
They actually had been pondering it all along

288
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.230
and the declaration and resolves actually represented.

289
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:27.231
One of the goals of this continental congress to write a clear statement of

290
00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:30.930
colonial rights.
However,

291
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:36.840
this was not as easy as it might sound because America was pretty much following

292
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:38.340
an uncharted path,

293
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:43.410
never before in western history had colonies dare to rebel against the mother

294
00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:45.090
country in quite this way,

295
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.990
so now they had to somehow put on paper a way to justify it.

296
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:53.070
Why were they doing this and as important actually in a sense,

297
00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:53.940
maybe more important,

298
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:59.040
could all of the colonies agree on the specifics of colonial rights?

299
00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:02.970
Could they actually even sit down and make a statement that everybody agreed on

300
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.610
and the difficulties that the delegates had in writing this draft really

301
00:19:08.611 --> 00:19:09.990
demonstrates,
once again,

302
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:15.230
how really difficult it was to define the precise terms of the colonies problem

303
00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:17.940
with the mother country,

304
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:23.300
the precise terms for the proper relationship between the colonies and the

305
00:19:24.061 --> 00:19:27.580
mother country.
Even when they sat down to do it.
Okay,
you're real.

306
00:19:27.581 --> 00:19:28.940
Or the committee and the con con,

307
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.380
the first continental Congress and we're going to form the declaration and

308
00:19:31.381 --> 00:19:35.010
resolved and write down the reasons for our actions.

309
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.000
Even with such deliberate desire on their part,

310
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.640
it was difficult for them to commit this to writing.

311
00:19:41.641 --> 00:19:44.010
It was difficult for them to find the right words and to agree

312
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.110
and the declaration and resolves was drafted by a committee.

313
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.730
John Adams was on the committee,

314
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.720
which is good because then he gets to tell us afterwards about the creation of

315
00:19:54.721 --> 00:19:59.400
the declaration and resolves cause he always likes to explain his role and every

316
00:19:59.401 --> 00:20:03.870
important moment of the American revolution.
So he was there.
Um,
and this,

317
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.900
the committee ended up basically stating in their draft that the declaration and

318
00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:12.150
resolves we're going to be based on three things.

319
00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.530
Their explanation before with what was going on in the colonies,

320
00:20:14.531 --> 00:20:17.880
it was going to be based on three things.
Number one,
the laws of nature.

321
00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:23.460
Number two,
the principles of the English constitution.
And number three,

322
00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:28.410
the charters of the colonies.
So all of those things,

323
00:20:28.411 --> 00:20:31.050
the laws of nature of the principles of the English constitution,

324
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.520
the charters of the colonies,

325
00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:36.420
all of those things were cited as justification for what was going on,

326
00:20:36.421 --> 00:20:37.320
but in a sense,

327
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:42.420
the real basis of what was coming out here in the declaration and resolves and

328
00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:46.890
so in a sense what they were really most grounded on was going to be their sense

329
00:20:46.891 --> 00:20:50.050
of rights as English subjects,
the power of parliament.

330
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:54.010
It was really going to be their understanding of the English constitution and

331
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:57.700
you can hear how important this particular fact was to them.

332
00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:02.230
Just in looking at the list of colonial rights that they included in this

333
00:21:02.231 --> 00:21:04.850
declaration as being violated.
So they,

334
00:21:04.851 --> 00:21:09.430
they listed that the right of assembly was being violated,
the right of petition,

335
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.070
the right to be tried by a jury of their peers,

336
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.380
the right to be free of a standing army,

337
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.600
the right to choose their own assemblies.

338
00:21:16.601 --> 00:21:20.460
All of these things are really basic English constitutional rights that all

339
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.020
these colonists were stating.
They feel they've been violated.

340
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.470
As John Adams later explained,

341
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:31.680
the biggest challenge in drafting the declaration was in describing what he

342
00:21:32.681 --> 00:21:36.280
called quote the authority of Parliament.
What he said was,
um,

343
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.520
the authority of parliament was indeed the essence of the whole controversy.

344
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.820
Some or for a flat denial of all authority,

345
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.000
others for denying the power of taxation.

346
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.980
Only some for denying internal but admitting external taxation.

347
00:21:50.981 --> 00:21:54.220
So even within this little committee,
there's only a few people on the committee.

348
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.263
Even there,

349
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:58.570
there are all these opinions on exactly what's supposed to be happening in the

350
00:21:58.571 --> 00:22:00.640
relationship with the mother country and is,

351
00:22:00.641 --> 00:22:05.200
Adam's puts it after a multitude of motions have been made,
discussed negative.

352
00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.620
It seemed as if we should never agree upon anything.
So they,

353
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.250
they just can't stay with their results are.
However,

354
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:16.960
ultimately they managed to do it.
John Adams did a lot towards contributing,

355
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.680
um,

356
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.680
one particular article in this document that said parliament could not tax them,

357
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:28.260
but the colonies would cheerfully submit to bonafide regulation of external

358
00:22:28.421 --> 00:22:32.470
commerce.
So we have two things,
right?

359
00:22:32.471 --> 00:22:35.320
We have a self folk results,
we have the declaration and resolves.

360
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:40.830
Cottonelle congress also drafted a petition to the king and it was a restrained.

361
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.490
It was a respectful petition,

362
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:48.150
basically trying to inform the king of the evil plot hatching in parliament to

363
00:22:48.971 --> 00:22:51.040
rob the colonies of their rights.

364
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:57.150
The petition warn the king that there were quote designing and dangerous men in

365
00:22:57.311 --> 00:23:01.390
parliament and that they were trying to intervene between the king and his

366
00:23:01.391 --> 00:23:02.800
faithful subjects.

367
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:08.980
Now clearly you can hear at this point the focus here is on parliament by

368
00:23:08.981 --> 00:23:10.390
petitioning the king.

369
00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.470
This congress is suggesting that the king is really still a figure who can be

370
00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:17.620
reasoned with that the king is someone who they're appealing to in person to

371
00:23:17.621 --> 00:23:21.040
help with a problem with parliament.
Okay.

372
00:23:21.041 --> 00:23:24.760
Suffolk Resolves Declaration and resolves petitioned to the king.

373
00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:30.660
The final thing that the congress did was agree on a way to secure the repeal of

374
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:38.970
all offensive parliamentary legislation and they decided to do this in the way

375
00:23:39.911 --> 00:23:43.030
that they had always protested British attacks on their rights.
Surprise,

376
00:23:43.031 --> 00:23:47.030
surprise,
non importation,
right?
They think that that always works on importation.

377
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.920
We're going back to non importation,

378
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:54.020
but this time they decided to really form a network of local non importation

379
00:23:54.021 --> 00:23:58.700
committees and towns throughout the colonies to actually enforce non

380
00:23:58.701 --> 00:24:02.930
importation.
They called their plan the continental association.

381
00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.210
So clearly this is more ambitious,

382
00:24:05.211 --> 00:24:10.211
at least in in the what they're suggesting it is and their desire for what they

383
00:24:10.821 --> 00:24:14.870
want it to be
and as it happened before,

384
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:20.140
they included in their plan localized committees of inspection that would watch

385
00:24:20.811 --> 00:24:24.290
to see who's violating the boycott,
who's drinking tea,

386
00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:25.940
who's buying luxuries.

387
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:32.620
Now the creation of the continental association didn't just encourage,

388
00:24:33.711 --> 00:24:34.510
not importation,

389
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:39.110
it actually had a number of other impacts on the colonies as a whole and I'm

390
00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:43.340
sort of what's developing in the colonies first,

391
00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.590
by creating the continental association and ensuring that it was going to have a

392
00:24:48.591 --> 00:24:52.010
really widespread localized influence,

393
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:56.840
the continental Congress essentially created a localized government structure

394
00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:01.700
that down the road would be vital in organizing the war effort and maintaining

395
00:25:01.701 --> 00:25:02.780
order throughout the war.

396
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:07.490
So they're creating kind of a network just by declaring that this exists that

397
00:25:07.491 --> 00:25:11.030
goes throughout the colonies.
Second.

398
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:13.460
In the process of doing that,

399
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.820
the association brought literally thousands of people into the war effort as

400
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:22.580
committee members.
Third,

401
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:27.530
although the continental congress was an unofficial congress that didn't have

402
00:25:27.531 --> 00:25:32.390
any real authority by creating the continental association,

403
00:25:32.391 --> 00:25:37.391
it basically passed a piece of legislation that applied throughout the colonies.

404
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.600
Committees of inspection considered themselves the enforcement agencies of the

405
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:44.330
Continental Congress,

406
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:49.330
not enforcement agencies have their local colonial legislature and in some

407
00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:53.180
colonies committees actually created,
I'm sorry,

408
00:25:53.181 --> 00:25:58.181
communities actually created committees of inspection on their own without even

409
00:25:58.221 --> 00:26:02.240
waiting for their own colonial legislature to ask them or even for it to meet.

410
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.930
They just knew that this was happening and communities in and of themselves

411
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:11.150
created their own committees of inspection and then forth.

412
00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.940
Over time as the colonies moved into war and as colonial governments really

413
00:26:16.941 --> 00:26:21.380
began to falter and run into complications is the crisis really magnified.

414
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.300
These committees of inspection,

415
00:26:23.301 --> 00:26:27.440
we're able to step into the void and assert some kind of centralized,

416
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.790
organized,
hopefully authority.
Okay.

417
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:36.791
So the continental association went into effect and this time more than any of

418
00:26:37.431 --> 00:26:39.380
the previous attempts at non importation,

419
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.190
people really are beginning to realize that there's a crisis at hand.

420
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:48.210
So more people complied with non importation now than ever before and at times

421
00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:49.800
before it had been successful.

422
00:26:49.801 --> 00:26:54.600
But now we actually reach a new high of people complying with this.

423
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.250
And just one example of this,

424
00:26:56.251 --> 00:27:01.251
in 1774 New York imported roughly 437,000 pounds.

425
00:27:03.181 --> 00:27:07.800
Sterling worth of British goods.
Okay.
437 pounds sterling.
One year later,

426
00:27:07.801 --> 00:27:09.600
1775 in New York,

427
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:13.800
this number had dropped to roughly a thousand pounds sterling.
Yeah,

428
00:27:13.801 --> 00:27:18.540
that's huge,
right?
That's real compliance with non importation

429
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:20.791
and the Congress,

430
00:27:20.791 --> 00:27:25.791
his final act was to agree to meet the following spring in May of 1775 if their

431
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:31.620
grievances had not been addressed by that time.

432
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.240
So basically they conclude by saying,
okay,

433
00:27:33.241 --> 00:27:37.620
we're going to now give Britain time to hear what we've said the several months

434
00:27:37.621 --> 00:27:39.660
it's going to take it to get across the ocean to England.

435
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:42.900
They can respond and take several months to communicate back with us and we'll

436
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:45.300
see what happens and if we haven't been addressed,

437
00:27:45.301 --> 00:27:48.900
we will have another continental congress may of 1775

438
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.320
now,
as you can imagine,

439
00:27:52.321 --> 00:27:56.310
the adjournment of the first Continental Congress left relations between the

440
00:27:56.311 --> 00:28:00.270
colonies and the mother countries and it kind of a precarious state.

441
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.370
The congress and its activities also made it increasingly obvious that there

442
00:28:05.371 --> 00:28:10.371
were two sides forming on the question of the Po proper workings of the imperial

443
00:28:10.861 --> 00:28:14.610
system and how best to respond to the ongoing problems.

444
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:21.170
Now all along there had been people who had more sympathy towards the crown than

445
00:28:22.741 --> 00:28:26.720
others.
People like Massachusetts,
governor Thomas Hutchinson,

446
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:31.730
he's now governor or like the people throughout the colonies who accepted the

447
00:28:32.251 --> 00:28:34.410
position of stamp distributor.
For example,

448
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:40.850
by late 1774 and 1775 as people really began to take sides and warfare began to

449
00:28:43.171 --> 00:28:45.690
seem at least possible to some people.

450
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.250
The people who were sympathetic to the British administration began to face some

451
00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:55.251
difficult choices known at this point as the king's friends or the friends of

452
00:28:56.131 --> 00:29:00.480
government,
they began to find it more and more difficult,

453
00:29:00.481 --> 00:29:02.790
if not impossible to remain neutral.

454
00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:07.890
Thousands of people were becoming involved in the war effort troops,

455
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.140
which of course in Boston they called quote military executioners cause they

456
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:16.110
have a real flair for propaganda in Boston.
Um,
troops,

457
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.270
whether you call them military executioners or not,

458
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:21.510
we're being sent to America in increasing numbers.

459
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:26.490
So people were beginning to take sides and those who felt loyal to the British

460
00:29:26.491 --> 00:29:31.440
government had to decide on a course of action because to not declare your

461
00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:36.441
loyalty to the protest in colonists was often as good as declaring your enmity

462
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.553
to them.

463
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:42.550
Many loyalists would soon declare with some justification that by forcing people

464
00:29:42.551 --> 00:29:47.551
to sign olds like that were loyal to the Patriot cause by inspecting people's

465
00:29:47.741 --> 00:29:51.760
purchases to see if they were complying with non importation that the

466
00:29:51.761 --> 00:29:56.761
continental association was supposedly fighting for American liberty by curving

467
00:29:56.951 --> 00:30:00.970
individual liberties.
As one loyalists wrote,

468
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.530
the only liberty that the Patriots wanted was the liberty quote of knocking out

469
00:30:05.531 --> 00:30:09.190
any man's brains that dares presume to speak his mind freely upon the present

470
00:30:09.191 --> 00:30:10.240
contest.
Okay.

471
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.990
These are people who are beginning to feel irked that there seems to be a

472
00:30:13.991 --> 00:30:15.820
majority building in some way.

473
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:20.410
Certainly a loud group of people expressing anger and resentment and resistance,

474
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:24.490
and if you don't agree,
people are beginning to feel somewhat threatened.

475
00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.430
Now,
traditionally,

476
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:32.660
these loyalists have often been depicted as timid or conservative men who maybe

477
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.990
were too afraid to side with the rebels,

478
00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:40.030
maybe were afraid to fight the system or we're afraid of losing their wealth or

479
00:30:40.031 --> 00:30:43.420
status.
But obviously the truth is more complex than that.

480
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:49.170
Choosing to remain loyal to the crown in the midst of a building resistant

481
00:30:49.271 --> 00:30:51.580
movement was not an easy choice,

482
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.090
and ultimately it really required,
in some cases,

483
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:59.530
some degree of bravery because it really did put your livelihood,

484
00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:00.580
your property,

485
00:31:00.581 --> 00:31:05.230
and even sometimes your physical safety at risk because it potentially forced

486
00:31:05.231 --> 00:31:09.040
you to put yourself on the opposing side from your friends.

487
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:13.540
Sometimes even your family.
Actually couple of,

488
00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:15.850
actually a good number of years ago.
Um,

489
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:20.650
I had someone write a senior essay with me and he found a diary,

490
00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:21.670
um,

491
00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:26.670
from roughly this period of a person whose family he was from New England.

492
00:31:26.831 --> 00:31:28.590
I don't remember where he was from.
Uh,

493
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:33.630
his family divided over what to do and half of the family felt like they wanted

494
00:31:34.361 --> 00:31:37.660
to remain loyal to the crown and half didn't.
And the diaries really fascinating.

495
00:31:37.661 --> 00:31:40.600
It's just shows this person trying to figure out what to do and no matter what

496
00:31:40.601 --> 00:31:43.720
he does,
actually members of his family are going to cut him off.

497
00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.540
And it really is a good senior essay if I do say so myself.
Um,

498
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:52.000
but it also was really a fascinating diary because it just really showed one

499
00:31:52.001 --> 00:31:56.500
family being just torn apart by increasingly,
um,

500
00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:57.880
passionate political ideas.

501
00:31:57.881 --> 00:32:01.780
But equally important by just having to take a stand in a community that's

502
00:32:01.781 --> 00:32:03.100
swaying one way or another.

503
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.300
And you can see what I'm talking about.

504
00:32:07.301 --> 00:32:09.760
Actually it's another diary in this one I have a quote from as opposed to the

505
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:12.120
random senior essay I'm remembering from years past.

506
00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.870
There's a diary of a fellow named Samuel Kerwin.
Um,
he,

507
00:32:16.871 --> 00:32:19.010
he did not describe himself as a loyalist.
He does.

508
00:32:19.011 --> 00:32:21.460
Stripe described himself as a quote moderate man,

509
00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:22.750
and I'm going to come back to that,

510
00:32:22.751 --> 00:32:25.450
to that loyalists and moderate are not always the same thing,

511
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.720
but he described himself as a moderate man and he said that until 1775 he lived

512
00:32:30.821 --> 00:32:35.680
in Massachusetts,
obviously by 70,
75,
it would be difficult to be in moderate man.

513
00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:41.150
Uh,
and in 1775,
after Lexington and Concord,

514
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:45.770
Kerwin became actually fearful for his life and that radical colony.

515
00:32:45.771 --> 00:32:50.600
So as he put it,
I left my late peaceful home in my 60th year.

516
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:55.040
So He's been living there for 60 years in search of personal security and those

517
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:59.240
rights,
which by the laws of God,
I ought to have enjoyed undisturbed there.

518
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.500
So he's a moderate,

519
00:33:00.501 --> 00:33:05.300
he feels actually threatened in Massachusetts and he decides he needs to move.

520
00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.990
So he heads to Philadelphia hoping as he put it,

521
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.810
defined an asylum amongst Quakers and Dutchman.

522
00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:15.920
So he's actually seeking out a population of people who maybe aren't going to be

523
00:33:15.921 --> 00:33:18.020
as radical as the people he's coming from.

524
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.710
And he says in his diary that when he arrived in Philadelphia,

525
00:33:21.711 --> 00:33:26.600
a friend came to meet his boat at the dock and this friend's opening opening

526
00:33:26.601 --> 00:33:28.940
remarks.
So the first thing that the friend said to him was,

527
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.040
we will protect you though you're a Tori.

528
00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.800
And this guy said it embarrassed me.
Not a little.
Okay.
So he,

529
00:33:35.801 --> 00:33:38.060
he basically feels like,
and he says this at one point,

530
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.030
he feels like he has the mark of chain no matter where he goes,

531
00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.030
people are sort of like,
oh,
you're a Tory,
are you?
Well,
we'll,

532
00:33:44.031 --> 00:33:47.030
we'll protect you because we like you.
And he said,

533
00:33:47.031 --> 00:33:49.370
he found it very difficult to find a place to stay,

534
00:33:49.371 --> 00:33:52.880
to find a boarding house in Philadelphia because people just refuse to take him

535
00:33:52.881 --> 00:33:54.710
in as he put it.

536
00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:58.640
So many refused as made it fearful whether like Cain,

537
00:33:58.641 --> 00:34:03.390
I had not a discouraging mark upon me or a strong feature of Toryism like some,

538
00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:06.080
somehow people were looking at me and saying,
I look like a Tori.

539
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.720
Like how was it that they weren't giving me any place to stay?

540
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.780
So that's one person's diary,
but again,

541
00:34:11.781 --> 00:34:14.450
it shows you how this person felt threatened.

542
00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.410
And then this person even having moved to feel safer,

543
00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:22.640
ends up in Philadelphia and still feels as though he certainly outside of the

544
00:34:22.641 --> 00:34:25.460
majority and not having an easy time of it,
even among his friends.

545
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:32.200
So clearly choosing to remain loyal to the crown or even like Kerwin,

546
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:37.220
just choosing to be moderate in your principles could be a really difficult

547
00:34:37.221 --> 00:34:40.880
choice with some pretty serious consequences.
Now,

548
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.610
there were many reasons why one might choose to remain loyal to the crown or to

549
00:34:46.611 --> 00:34:47.444
be moderate.

550
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:52.100
And in a way just sort of using the term loyalist and throwing it around doesn't

551
00:34:52.101 --> 00:34:57.101
do the complexity of this justice because there were any number of reasons why

552
00:34:57.201 --> 00:35:00.170
you might not want to go along with colonial resistance.

553
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.040
Some people maybe were really aggressively loyal to the crown.

554
00:35:04.041 --> 00:35:06.920
Maybe that was where their actions were coming from.

555
00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:12.380
Maybe some people just were not excited about the idea of independence and war

556
00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.540
and maybe that would have been their breaking point.

557
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:20.290
Some like the Quakers may have been just trying to remain neutral or pacifist,

558
00:35:20.331 --> 00:35:22.730
which as you've just heard,
it could be a difficult thing to do.

559
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:28.660
And some probably like this Kerwin might've just wanted to be aloof from the

560
00:35:29.361 --> 00:35:30.710
whole matter and again,

561
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.760
did not find that very easy to do after the war.

562
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:39.630
Dr. Benjamin Rush,
who as you'll hear in this little quote,

563
00:35:39.631 --> 00:35:41.910
was obviously supportive of colonial resistance,

564
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:46.860
explained that to him there had been four different kinds of Tories during the

565
00:35:46.861 --> 00:35:51.000
revolution.
Okay.
This is Russia's category of Tories quote.

566
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:56.030
There were furious Tories who had recourse to violence and even to arms there

567
00:35:56.101 --> 00:35:57.720
were writing and talking Tory's,

568
00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:02.700
which I always think it's opposed to the illiterate mute Tories

569
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:07.800
and obviously he's saying the ones who are really loud.
Okay.
But still,
so there,

570
00:36:07.801 --> 00:36:11.970
there are furious stories.
Writing and talking Tory's silent,

571
00:36:11.971 --> 00:36:16.530
but busy Tories who are disseminating Tory pamphlets and newspapers and

572
00:36:16.531 --> 00:36:19.290
circulating intelligence.
And then number four,

573
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.730
peaceable unconscientious Tories who patiently submitted to the measures of the

574
00:36:23.731 --> 00:36:28.170
governing powers and who showed nearly equal kindness to the distress of both

575
00:36:28.171 --> 00:36:29.400
parties during the war.

576
00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:33.630
This Russia's way of looking at things and clearly that's his own little

577
00:36:33.631 --> 00:36:37.800
eccentric point of view.
But let's talk for a minute here,
but what,

578
00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:41.580
what we're talking about in the way of numbers as far as how many loyalists are

579
00:36:41.581 --> 00:36:44.700
there,
what are we talking about roughly percentage wise?

580
00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:50.420
Historians estimate that roughly 15 to 20% of white males were loyalists by the

581
00:36:52.861 --> 00:36:56.310
wars.
And,
and in this sense,
when I'm using the word loyalist here,

582
00:36:56.311 --> 00:37:01.311
I'm actually meaning people who did something overt to support the crown during

583
00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:04.740
the revolution,
like signing the dresses,

584
00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:07.950
bearing arms against the continental troops,

585
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:12.600
doing business with the British army seeking military protection from the

586
00:37:12.601 --> 00:37:17.520
British army or going into exile.
So just people who are doing those activities,

587
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.010
15 to 20% of white males.

588
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.950
When you add to that percentage,

589
00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:27.810
those who just wanted to avoid involving themselves in the struggle,

590
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:32.960
you end up with roughly half of the white male colonists not falling into the

591
00:37:33.211 --> 00:37:38.010
category of Patriot or if you use a term that the loyalist would have used

592
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.410
rebel.
So all in all,

593
00:37:40.411 --> 00:37:45.411
only about half of the white male population actively supported colonial

594
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.990
resistance.
And at different times of the war,

595
00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:53.160
depending on the immediate circumstances,
obviously people changed their views.

596
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:59.160
Now there were any number of reasons to stay loyal to the crown.

597
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.640
And I'm guessing certainly if I hadn't studied this time period,

598
00:38:05.131 --> 00:38:09.810
I would assume that that there's like the stereotypical image of the Tori who

599
00:38:09.811 --> 00:38:14.190
one would assume is the sort of aristocratic person that's really rich person

600
00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:18.930
and very fancy wig with very fancy clothes taking snuff and doing a variety of

601
00:38:18.931 --> 00:38:21.840
other aristocratic 18th century gentry kind of things.

602
00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:24.030
Who sort of sneering at the rebels?
I think.

603
00:38:24.031 --> 00:38:27.360
I think there's sort of some stereotype we have in our brain about who Tories

604
00:38:27.361 --> 00:38:30.720
are.
Um,
but as a matter of fact,
they were,

605
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:34.740
the sun Doerries fit into that category.
But certainly not all.
Um,

606
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:36.250
wealth and poverty,

607
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:41.550
high status and low every kind of ethnicity could be found on both sides of the

608
00:38:42.161 --> 00:38:45.190
crisis and from colony to colony.

609
00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:50.110
Different kinds of people chose different sides depending on regional

610
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.370
circumstances.
So for example,
in New York,

611
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.870
a lot of the landed gentry tended to be loyalist in Virginia,

612
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:03.520
the landed gentry tended to not be loyalist in Massachusetts,

613
00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:08.590
small farmers tended to be patriots.
In New York and North Carolina,

614
00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:10.510
the,
or at least the upcountry of North Carolina,

615
00:39:10.511 --> 00:39:14.300
small farmers did not necessarily tend to be patriot.

616
00:39:14.301 --> 00:39:19.120
So it obviously varies region by reading region depending on local
circumstances.

617
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.350
In general terms.
In very general terms,

618
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:28.470
you could say that loyalism was stronger in the middle states than in New

619
00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:33.550
England and stronger in the lower south than in the upper south.

620
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.280
And very strong,
particularly in New York,

621
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:41.350
which the British ended up holding throughout most of the war and weakest in

622
00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:46.270
Massachusetts,
Virginia and Connecticut,
Connecticut stood up.

623
00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:46.990
Um,

624
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:51.990
but there's a reason for that because those are among the oldest colonies with a

625
00:39:52.001 --> 00:39:55.810
very long tradition of self government,
of aggressive self-government

626
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.300
scholars who have studied loyalists have noted that there seem to be several

627
00:40:01.301 --> 00:40:05.110
types of people who ended up being more likely to become loyalists.

628
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.070
One likely loyalists,
and this won't be surprising,

629
00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:12.580
would have been people who were connected with the British government by some

630
00:40:12.581 --> 00:40:17.581
kind of an official appointment or were related to somebody who had an official

631
00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:20.560
royal appointment for these people.

632
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:24.790
Remaining loyal was not necessarily due to self interested reasons,

633
00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:26.950
although certainly self-interest could have played a part,

634
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:32.650
but as important loyal office holders are people related to them had closer

635
00:40:32.651 --> 00:40:36.970
contact with the British government than most others and that they were better

636
00:40:36.971 --> 00:40:40.090
able to see the logic of politics in England.

637
00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:45.210
So they had more reason to be skeptical of claims about a conspiracy afoot in

638
00:40:45.941 --> 00:40:50.860
England to destroy colonial rights.
For example,

639
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:55.090
Thomas Hutchinson up in Massachusetts was honestly baffled by the accusation

640
00:40:55.091 --> 00:40:58.480
that there was a plot against colonial liberties and that somehow he was part of

641
00:40:58.481 --> 00:41:02.240
it.
He knew that he personally wasn't conspiring against the colonies,

642
00:41:02.241 --> 00:41:04.240
so he wasn't quite sure what people are talking about.

643
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:08.440
And because of that he had good reason to doubt the enterprise of what was going

644
00:41:08.441 --> 00:41:11.740
on.
So that's one potential loyalist.

645
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:16.870
A second kind of person who tended to become a loyalist was again,

646
00:41:16.871 --> 00:41:21.871
logically enough people who were in a religious or cultural minority and who

647
00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:26.710
thus already felt a little defensive and not necessarily trusting in the whim of

648
00:41:26.711 --> 00:41:30.610
the majority or the whim of angry resistant majority.

649
00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:35.000
And I'm going to go into this more detail in a future lecture,

650
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.710
but for logical reasons,

651
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:41.890
a good many African American slaves ended up becoming loyalist for good reason,

652
00:41:41.991 --> 00:41:44.720
having to do with the chance of earning their freedom.

653
00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:47.620
So that's a second kind.

654
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:52.100
A third kind of loyalist consisted of people who lived out in the hinterlands,

655
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:55.520
in the back country,
away from the eastern seaboard.

656
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:58.460
And this is for a couple of reasons,

657
00:41:58.461 --> 00:42:00.830
but one of the main ones is if you think about it,

658
00:42:00.831 --> 00:42:04.820
the main vehicle or one of the main vehicles for radical ideas would have been

659
00:42:04.821 --> 00:42:09.821
newspapers and newspapers largely circulated in large port cities.

660
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:13.280
And I've quoted already a number of times from the Boston cause that which would

661
00:42:13.281 --> 00:42:16.500
have been hard to get out in the hinterlands somewhere.
Um,

662
00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.610
Tory's called the Boston cause that that's where Samuel Adams wrote a lot of his

663
00:42:19.611 --> 00:42:23.360
things is called the Boston Gazette,
the weekly Dung barge.

664
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.410
I think everybody just winds here and the propaganda game,

665
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:30.170
like equally impressive on all sides and the Prophet Gad,
again,

666
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.240
people out in the frontier in Virginia or the Carolinas who didn't have a lot of

667
00:42:35.241 --> 00:42:39.260
access to newspapers might have been harder to convince of a great plot against

668
00:42:39.261 --> 00:42:43.700
their liberties.
As one historian wrote,
not having been exposed to the disease,

669
00:42:43.701 --> 00:42:44.690
how could they catch it?

670
00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.220
None of these people had a particular reason to be swept up in the resistance

671
00:42:49.221 --> 00:42:54.221
movement and they had reasons to resist it by 1774.

672
00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:58.850
All of these people,
royal office holders,
cultural or religious minorities,

673
00:42:58.851 --> 00:43:02.240
people living out on the frontier,
we're conscious minorities,

674
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.610
people who felt either weak or threatened,

675
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:08.810
particularly considering raging events in cities along the seaboard.

676
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:13.340
So in a way you could say that many loyalists were simply more afraid of the

677
00:43:13.341 --> 00:43:15.680
rebelling colonies than they were of the crown.

678
00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:20.540
Almost all of them had interests that they felt needed protection from a raging

679
00:43:20.541 --> 00:43:21.980
American majority.

680
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:27.680
Now these loyalists did not necessarily have vast ideological differences from

681
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.520
people who came to be known as the American patriots,
but they might have.

682
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:32.623
And in fact,

683
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:37.870
some loyalists actually believed precisely what the rebels believed in reverse.

684
00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:41.390
So in the same way that the colonists thought there was this plot forming and

685
00:43:41.391 --> 00:43:43.760
parliament to curb colonial liberties,

686
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
some loyalists saw a plot forming among radical colonists who were falsely

687
00:43:49.851 --> 00:43:52.550
claiming to represent the people.
Right.
That makes perfect sense.

688
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:57.680
Many of these loyalists did not part with the colonial majority until well into

689
00:43:57.681 --> 00:44:00.230
the imperial crisis.
And for many as we'll see,

690
00:44:00.231 --> 00:44:04.970
it's not until independence becomes probable and when real actual separation

691
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:09.410
from the mother country is at hand that they felt compelled to declare their

692
00:44:09.411 --> 00:44:12.470
loyalty to the crown and actually break away.

693
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.310
This was actually part of the agony of the revolution.

694
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:19.280
The fact that many people just weren't sure what they should do.

695
00:44:19.281 --> 00:44:21.230
They weren't sure how they felt about the crisis.

696
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:23.120
They weren't sure what side to take.

697
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:25.340
They weren't sure that they wanted to take a side.

698
00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:28.910
They weren't sure what would happen if they did and on all sides.

699
00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:30.920
People still cared about the,

700
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:36.390
they just had different visions about the right course of action and people had

701
00:44:36.391 --> 00:44:40.350
to just make these sorts of decisions about their loyalties on an individual

702
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:45.351
level and obviously there were many different levels of loyalty to the British

703
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:49.590
government.
So I suppose what I'm saying here,
I'll wrap it up here.
In a sense,

704
00:44:49.591 --> 00:44:54.591
it's really easy to analyze and pass judgment on the decision to become a

705
00:44:55.171 --> 00:44:55.651
loyalist,

706
00:44:55.651 --> 00:44:59.370
but I think it's just as easy to analyze and pass judgment on the decision to

707
00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:00.630
resist the crown.

708
00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:04.890
I think one way or another people were evaluating what was happening.

709
00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:08.670
People were thinking about what they thought the proper course of action should

710
00:45:08.671 --> 00:45:13.230
be,
and then making individual choices for any number of reasons.

711
00:45:13.231 --> 00:45:16.590
Some of them ideological,
some of them personal having to do with your family,

712
00:45:16.591 --> 00:45:19.860
having to do with your livelihood,
having to do with your safety and security.

713
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.590
So one way or another,

714
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:27.570
making this decision was kind of an extreme act.

715
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.670
And the period that we're now at in this course,

716
00:45:29.671 --> 00:45:34.671
1774 70 75 is precisely when those sorts of decisions have to be made.

717
00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:37.440
We'll be talking about common sense on Thursday,

718
00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:41.610
which does a lot towards pushing some people into making a pretty radical

719
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:44.640
decision.
I will see you on Thursday.

720
00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:49.410
Those of you who did not turn in your papers turned that into your up.
