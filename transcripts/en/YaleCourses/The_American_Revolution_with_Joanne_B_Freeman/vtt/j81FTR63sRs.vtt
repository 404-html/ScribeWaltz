1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.440
So on Tuesday I talked about George Washington and some of the reasons why he

2
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.050
proved so invaluable during and after the revolution.

3
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:20.640
And among other things I talked about the ways in which he proved time and again

4
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.770
that he could be trusted with power.

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Well today and on Tuesday we're going to be looking at Washington empower,

6
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.990
commanding the continental army as we sketch out the chain of events on the

7
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:38.970
battlefield that ultimately resulted in American military victory.

8
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.820
Now in a sense,
today's lecture and Tuesday's lecture,

9
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:45.540
it's sort of one big lecture that I've arbitrarily divided in half cause I can't

10
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:47.550
fit it all into one lecture.
Um,

11
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:50.430
so we're going to get part of the fighting today and part of the fighting on

12
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:54.510
Tuesday and the dividing line will basically be however much I finished talking

13
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:59.280
about today is today's lecture.
And I'll pick up after that on Tuesday.

14
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.870
Um,
as your,
you'll see,
and I'll come to that in a few minutes.
Um,

15
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.460
I basically divided the fighting of the revolution into four phases.

16
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.540
Um,

17
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.540
and I'll explain in just a little bit why four phases and what that means and

18
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:15.690
why they make sense,

19
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:19.560
and then I'll sort of proceed through them as we unfold what's happening during

20
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:23.450
the actual fighting of the war and during both of electrodes.

21
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.440
During today's lectures and during Tuesday's lecture,

22
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.580
I'm going to be looking at the unfolding events from two vantage points,

23
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.780
so I'm not just going to be looking at how Americans view what's happening.

24
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:38.160
I'm going to try to get at both the British logic and the American logic as to

25
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.430
why they're doing what they're doing,
why they're strategy,

26
00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:43.290
why their actions actually make sense,

27
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:46.590
because to really understand what's happening and why,

28
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.530
what ultimately did happen,
did it happen?

29
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.370
You really do need to understand the logic of both sides in this conflict.

30
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.711
Now,
in a sense,

31
00:01:55.711 --> 00:02:00.711
the underlying question of both of these two lectures is how did America,

32
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:04.830
when I,
that's the real question.
How in the world in America,

33
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.590
when even to people at the time,

34
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.930
this hardly seems like the most probable outcome of this conflict when it was

35
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:17.931
undertaken and what we're going to be seeing today and on Tuesday is that

36
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.980
America's victory in the end was the result of a combination of factors.

37
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.680
I'm going to talk about a number of them at the beginning of the lecture and

38
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:30.681
then head off into battles now that we have sort of gotten an understanding of

39
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:35.310
some of the major complications and factors really complicating things for the

40
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:36.480
British more than anything else,

41
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:39.630
but I'll start out here just by listing some of the things I'm going to be

42
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:41.820
talking about briefly here at the outset of the lecture.

43
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.170
So combination of factors that help decide the outcome of the war.

44
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.670
One of them is as we'll see in just a moment,
British logistical disadvantages,

45
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.230
British assumptions about the logic of warfare and as we'll see,

46
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:59.680
some of these assumptions did not really apply well to the situation in North

47
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:00.514
America.

48
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.030
George Washington's strategy and the ways in which it's sometimes differed from

49
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:09.670
more conventional old world methods of fighting.

50
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.800
The different definitions of victory for the British and the Americans.

51
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:18.010
It's like again,
we'll see in a few minutes.
It meant something very different.

52
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:20.110
The British had to accomplish one thing where victory,

53
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.600
the Americans had to accomplish something different than in the end,

54
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.230
but the British had to accomplish as much more difficult than what the Americans

55
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:28.270
had to accomplish.
And I'll explain that momentarily.

56
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.790
So British logistical disadvantages,

57
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:33.010
British assumptions about the logic of warfare,

58
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.870
George Washington strategy and the different definitions of victory for the

59
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:41.950
British and the Americans are some of the factors that help decide the outcome

60
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:45.340
of the war in favor of the Americans.
Now,
what I'm not going to go into here,

61
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:47.480
and I will go into it on Tuesday,
um,

62
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.850
which is another major factor that helped the Americans when the war.

63
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.021
That's the French,

64
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:56.710
that's actually the French joining the war on the side of the Americans.

65
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.040
That has a huge impact for a whole bunch of reasons.

66
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.540
As I'll talk about next week.
I'm not going to go into that into detail now,

67
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.820
but I will say that it's hard to imagine the Americans really winning the war

68
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.720
without the assistance of the French and we'll see that play out on Tuesday.

69
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.480
Now before we start talking about the unfolding of the war,
um,

70
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.980
I do want to look for just a few minutes on some of these challenges

71
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.750
particularly that faced the British at the opening of the fighting of the

72
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:32.320
revolution and how circumstances in the American revolution.

73
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.790
We're different than circumstances in some of the previous wars that the British

74
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.260
had fought.
And in a way,

75
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:41.530
this leads us to the first of that chain of things I just mentioned a minute
ago.

76
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.020
British logistical disadvantages.
In a sense,

77
00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:46.150
that's what I'm going to be talking about right now.

78
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.620
The ways in which the war and the American colonies presented some logistical

79
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:54.510
complications that the British hadn't necessarily faced in this same way and

80
00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:59.290
with the same combination of factors before.
For one thing,
in a way,

81
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:03.520
the most fundamental thing of all was just the simple question of supplies.

82
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.540
The most basic,
basic,
logistical concern of them all.

83
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.810
Because more commonly in the past when the British had fought wars in distant

84
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:15.220
territory's,
often they're colonists,

85
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:19.360
had provided supplies and even men to the British army,

86
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.910
we'll obviously now the colonists are the enemy.

87
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.060
So that's not going to be happening in this particular war.

88
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.890
So instead of a [inaudible] stream of local supplies and local forces,

89
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.520
British supplies and men had to be shipped over 3000 miles of ocean and then

90
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:40.801
lugged around the entire eastern seaboard trailing after the British army and

91
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:45.490
countryside that often was not really friendly to lugging around vast amounts of

92
00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:48.820
supplies following an army.
And as we'll be seeing shortly,

93
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.590
two of the most significant battles of the war ended up being lost by the

94
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:58.580
British in part because of problems with the simple matter of supplies.

95
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.490
So that's one logistical problem.

96
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.450
A second logistical problem for the British involved,

97
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.490
the huge expanse of land that constituted the colonies.

98
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.090
Basically the battlefield of this war.
It's pretty extensive.

99
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:18.980
It's an enormous stretch of land stretching from what would one day be,
Florida,

100
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.420
um,
all the way up to Canada.

101
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:24.260
And for a little while into Canada and from the Atlantic coast to the

102
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:27.980
Mississippi.
Unlike more traditional wars,

103
00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:30.740
more conventional wars wars have a thought that Britain would have been more

104
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:31.574
used to fighting.

105
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.830
There wasn't one central target to attack that could turn the tide of war.

106
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:36.951
And,

107
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:39.230
and the British don't necessarily know this and we're going to see them actually

108
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:44.090
try to play out the strategy more than once during the war.
But in fact,

109
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:48.650
there was not one central target that they could have grabbed and turned the

110
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:49.490
tide of war.

111
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.700
Usually a really good military strategy was to capture a nation's capitol or the

112
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:55.820
center of government.

113
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.390
And sometimes that really would help push a war to its conclusion.

114
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:03.380
You capture the Capitol symbolically and also as a source of power and

115
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:06.650
leadership.
And sometimes that really does push a war to its conclusion.

116
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.700
But in the American colonies,
and then after 1776 states,

117
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.800
there wasn't any one city that represented America,
center of government.

118
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:20.000
There was one no one single real American capital,

119
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.910
no one core of American strength.

120
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.790
And so as we'll see shortly throughout the war,

121
00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:30.791
the British struggle to determine which major cities capture might defeat the

122
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:34.880
American cause and bring victory to Britain and obviously in the end,

123
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.490
this is not a strategy that worked in the Americans

124
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.433
<v 1>states.</v>

125
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.480
<v 0>A third logistical problem had less to do with America and more to do with</v>

126
00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:49.990
Britain and that is that the British found it extremely difficult to raise

127
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:53.400
troops to fight this war.
First of all,

128
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.760
just fighting in a far away overseas war would not have been popular in and of

129
00:07:57.761 --> 00:08:00.010
itself.
Add to this,

130
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:03.160
the fact that there were some potential soldiers who would not have been that

131
00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:08.161
enthusiastic about attacking British colonists and you end up with a serious

132
00:08:08.531 --> 00:08:12.250
problem in lifting men and raising a large enough forth for this war.

133
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.440
As a result of the British ended up hiring a large number of German mercenary

134
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.150
troops from a number of different independent German states and they ended up

135
00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:23.830
getting lumped under the heading Hessian.

136
00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:28.510
That's sort of how we know them as Hessians and this practice in and of itself

137
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.540
in raged Americans all the more because it suggested to them that the British

138
00:08:33.821 --> 00:08:37.630
were hiring what they would have considered to be foreign assassins to kill

139
00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:38.770
their own colonists.

140
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.740
Fourth and related to everything that I've just said,

141
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:45.750
and as I said at the outset,

142
00:08:45.751 --> 00:08:50.751
the British and the Americans had different definitions of victory for the

143
00:08:51.241 --> 00:08:52.860
British to win the war,

144
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:58.340
they had to stamp out a widespread rebellion unfolding under a vast expanse of

145
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:01.044
land.

146
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.250
They had to destroy the American cause to emerge victorious from this war.

147
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.680
The Americans did not have to defeat the British to win the war.

148
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.890
They just had to keep fighting long enough to exhaust British funding and

149
00:09:15.891 --> 00:09:19.490
supplies and energy.
So for the Americans,

150
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:24.050
the ultimate goal was just to keep fighting,
to keep the war going,

151
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.790
to force the British to expend as much money and as much manpower and as much

152
00:09:28.791 --> 00:09:32.240
energy as possible.
And as we'll see in today's lecture,

153
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.220
Washington took full advantage of this fact and fought the war with a strategy

154
00:09:37.221 --> 00:09:40.910
that maybe wasn't always really inspiring for onlookers,

155
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.870
but was highly effective in exhausting the British forces.

156
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.720
And then finally fifth,

157
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.190
a fifth logistical problem for the British actually wasn't so much about the

158
00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:56.120
American colonies or the British as it was about the British longtime enemy,

159
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.163
the French,

160
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.180
the British could not just turn their back on the rest of the world to entirely

161
00:10:02.181 --> 00:10:06.380
dedicate all of their time and efforts to this colonial revolt.

162
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.820
They had to keep their eye on their longtime enemy,
the French,

163
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.380
particularly after 1778 when the French joined the war on the side of the

164
00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:18.680
American colonists.
As I said,
I'll talk about that and more detailed Tuesday,

165
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.780
but once the French are in the war,

166
00:10:20.781 --> 00:10:25.100
suddenly now the British and in particular the British navy after really be

167
00:10:25.101 --> 00:10:27.350
worrying about what the French are doing,
like what?

168
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.720
What are they doing down there in the West indies,
those French?

169
00:10:29.721 --> 00:10:32.660
Do we need to send ships to the West indies and defend some of our properties

170
00:10:32.661 --> 00:10:35.930
there?
That really further complicates things for the British,

171
00:10:35.931 --> 00:10:39.590
so they can't just focus on what's going on in these North American colonies.

172
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:40.701
Okay.

173
00:10:40.701 --> 00:10:44.720
So they are always seen a couple of different logistical complications for the

174
00:10:44.721 --> 00:10:47.390
British supplies,
problems with supplies.

175
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:52.630
The problem with figuring out where is the best place to stage and attack the

176
00:10:52.761 --> 00:10:54.290
problem of raising troops.

177
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.010
The fact that victory meant something different for the British than it did for

178
00:10:58.011 --> 00:11:01.760
the Americans.
And then the complications introduced by the French.

179
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.010
In addition to all of these logistical problems,
there was the simple problem,

180
00:11:07.011 --> 00:11:12.011
or at least certainly the unique challenges that faced the British and staging a

181
00:11:12.021 --> 00:11:14.000
war fought by a citizen army.

182
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.750
The British army was an impressive force,

183
00:11:17.751 --> 00:11:22.751
but it more typically fought conventional European wars tended to be fought on

184
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:28.100
open plains and open country where lines of troops advanced on each other until

185
00:11:28.101 --> 00:11:31.490
one line or the other weekend from casualties and retreated.

186
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:32.710
And that's like a warm,

187
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.350
which you have men who are disciplined and trained to stay in rank and file as

188
00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:40.820
this battle rages until finally the tide turns in one side or the other wins or

189
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:41.654
loses.

190
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.890
This is not the way that the American war unfolded.

191
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.150
Although it is worth saying,

192
00:11:47.151 --> 00:11:50.360
I think a lot of Americans have this image in their head that the Americans were

193
00:11:50.361 --> 00:11:52.550
these sort of guerrilla combat full,

194
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.540
he knows sort of around hiding behind trees and the sort of befuddled British

195
00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:59.320
are marching and they're bright red coats getting shot down in massive numbers.

196
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.850
And the fact of the matter is the British were not oblivious to the situation,

197
00:12:03.851 --> 00:12:04.750
the military situation,

198
00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:07.870
and they didn't sort of March single file and getting mowed down by people

199
00:12:07.871 --> 00:12:10.780
hiding behind trees.
The factories that the British did,

200
00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:15.781
among other things make pretty skillful use of native Americans in staging their

201
00:12:15.911 --> 00:12:17.500
own version of guerrilla warfare.

202
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:21.460
So they're not sort of just hanging on to old world methods of fighting and

203
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:25.180
ignoring what's going on here in the new world.
But even so,

204
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.830
there were a lot of challenges that they faced and fighting against a citizen

205
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:31.690
army.
For one thing,

206
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.770
a citizen army is just not going to be as predictable as a professionally

207
00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:37.270
trained force.

208
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.560
Sometimes the continental army abided by predictable military conventions,

209
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.710
sometimes they didn't.
And we'll hear a little bit of this today.

210
00:12:44.711 --> 00:12:46.330
I've talked about it a little bit before.

211
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.000
The continental army people who were always leaving the continental army when

212
00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:51.460
their term was up in new people came.
And so in a sense,

213
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.330
you kept having untrained people joining the continental army again and again

214
00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:55.660
and again.

215
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.950
So it's not even as though necessarily after a while these men were sort of all

216
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.280
longterm soldiers and knew what they were doing.
That was never entirely true.

217
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:08.440
So a citizen army is unpredictable also.

218
00:13:08.441 --> 00:13:13.210
It's not just an army that the British are facing.
Americans,

219
00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:17.710
generally speaking,
we're prepared to fight if necessary,
not just soldiers,

220
00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:21.160
but farmers.
If the British attacked a locality,

221
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.870
the people there were prepared to defend themselves and their land and their

222
00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:29.590
property.
We've already seen that just in the talk that I gave about new haven,

223
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.700
where you'd have professor Daggett sort of writing out and that the eal students

224
00:13:33.701 --> 00:13:35.530
writing out to sort of fend off the British.

225
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.860
So in addition to whatever actual organized army you have,

226
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.120
you've just got local citizens who are getting involved in whatever's happening

227
00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:47.200
as events and battles come into their own backyard.

228
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.820
So the British face,
not only an army but armed citizens as well.

229
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:58.340
A third challenging aspect of a citizen army was yet again something that wasn't

230
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.500
necessarily a common aspect of wars fought by the British army in the past and

231
00:14:03.631 --> 00:14:07.620
that is Americans are not just fighting for defense of a realm or defense of a

232
00:14:07.621 --> 00:14:12.240
monarch intellectually they were fighting for political liberties and ultimately

233
00:14:12.241 --> 00:14:13.380
for independence,

234
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:18.510
which would have felt like a more inspiring because too many people a personal

235
00:14:18.511 --> 00:14:18.841
cause.

236
00:14:18.841 --> 00:14:21.840
It would have been something that people had a personal connection with and

237
00:14:21.841 --> 00:14:25.830
certainly gave Americans some staying power and endurance during the war.

238
00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:29.460
So that the cause again persisted.
We'll see even today one or two low points,

239
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.000
at which point you would think things might have just faded and they don't.

240
00:14:33.001 --> 00:14:36.900
And part of it has to do with the personal implications in the personal meaning

241
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.100
of the war to the people who were fighting it in the American states.

242
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:43.901
Plus personally,

243
00:14:43.901 --> 00:14:47.380
many Americans were fighting for their own property and their own land.
Right.

244
00:14:47.381 --> 00:14:49.690
Even more personal,
as I just mentioned a moment ago,
if the,

245
00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:52.820
if there's an army advancing on your town,

246
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.120
that's about as personal award as it can be and again,

247
00:14:56.121 --> 00:15:00.530
it's going to bring people out in numbers and with a kind of determination and

248
00:15:00.531 --> 00:15:03.470
enthusiasm that they might not have in a different kind of a war.

249
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.580
So having a citizen army,
the kind of citizen army,

250
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:10.310
the kind of warfare is going to be taking place in the colonies.

251
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.960
Also all by itself presented some pretty interesting challenges to the British

252
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:19.550
army.
Okay.
So we've seen a host of logistical challenges,

253
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.430
some complications I'm going to throw into this mix.

254
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.560
Three bad assumptions on the part of the British that did not help their cause.

255
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.650
Okay.
Bad assumption number one,

256
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.520
they continue to underestimate the Americans.

257
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:38.450
They continue to underestimate the persistence of the Americans,

258
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.190
the abilities of the Americans,

259
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:44.360
the impact of whatever the Americans were doing and right alongside with that,

260
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:49.900
they overestimated their popularity among American loyalists and the power that

261
00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:54.650
they had among American loyalists.
Now,

262
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:59.980
probably part of that overestimating loyalist support was born from reports of

263
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:05.000
overly optimistic royal officials and governors who reported back to London that

264
00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:08.900
yes,
there's plenty of loyalists here and there on hand to defend the cause.

265
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.620
And when things get underway,
the loyalist will rise up and be on our side.

266
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.480
And there were some loyalists there,

267
00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:17.690
a good number of loyalists who actually did join and fight with the British.

268
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.780
Again,
when I was talking about the invasion of new haven,

269
00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:22.850
we saw just here in the town of new haven,

270
00:16:22.851 --> 00:16:25.370
how some people chose to help the British,
others,

271
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.650
their neighbors chose to fight against them.

272
00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:32.180
So there were a loyalist who chose at any given moment to join and support

273
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:36.560
British troops as opposed to the continental army or American troops.

274
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.850
But even so,

275
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:42.020
discussion of really widespread loyalist support was exaggerated.

276
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:47.090
And because of these sort of rosier than they should've been reports,

277
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.660
British officials in England,
far from the American scene,

278
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:55.490
assumed that many colonies were basically loyalist.
And all in all,

279
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.090
you just needed a little bit of a shove and things would be brought right.

280
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.630
They assume that probably there's a small band of radicals that are making

281
00:17:02.631 --> 00:17:04.280
trouble.
You hear this again and again and again.

282
00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:06.770
When you read British commentary on what's happening,

283
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.830
there's a band of radicals who are poisoning the public mind,

284
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:14.120
but that there are also loyalists who will rise up and help the British cost.

285
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:19.121
So it won't take very much for this to be pushed into some kind of a conclusion

286
00:17:19.161 --> 00:17:20.930
that certainly towards the beginning of the war,

287
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:25.970
something that the British assume the British army didn't help matters as far as

288
00:17:25.971 --> 00:17:28.910
the loyalists are concerned with their behavior.
In some of the colonies,

289
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.570
particularly in the south,
the British army looted farms,

290
00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:37.070
trampled fields paraded their superiority and so there are places in the south

291
00:17:37.071 --> 00:17:40.850
where the British army was a little patriot creating machine where you had

292
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:42.500
people who might've been loyalists leaning,

293
00:17:42.501 --> 00:17:46.010
but they did not like the way that they were treated by the British army and so

294
00:17:46.011 --> 00:17:50.760
pulled back from supporting the British when they might have started out leaning

295
00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:55.140
in that direction.
Okay,
so we have underestimating Americans,

296
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.510
overestimating support of the loyalists.

297
00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:02.870
The third bad assumption at the outset of the war is that the British navy would

298
00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:06.360
accomplish most of the damage and largely when the war,

299
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.140
because Britain did have this colossal impressive navy,

300
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.590
it was really what Britain was famous for militarily was its navy,

301
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.170
but England hadn't thought a long sustained land campaign for quite some time.

302
00:18:19.171 --> 00:18:22.320
And when it had fought long land campaigns in the past,

303
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:27.620
often they haven't fought with allies who supplied land power to complement

304
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.490
Britain's naval forces.

305
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.350
So as we're about to see all of these bad assumptions joined with all of those

306
00:18:34.351 --> 00:18:36.840
logistical things that I mentioned at the outset of the elector,

307
00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:41.850
all of these together are not helping the British as the war unfolds and they

308
00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:45.960
all play a role in the outcome of the war.
Okay,

309
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:50.140
let's now turn to the actual war to the actual battles.
Um,

310
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.220
as I suggested at the outcome,
the opening of the lecture,

311
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.940
I divided the war into four phases.
As we'll see,

312
00:18:56.941 --> 00:19:01.200
each of these phases is initiated by a sort of major decision of,

313
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:04.920
of strategy or policy on the part of the British.
Um,

314
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.270
often it's a strategy that's initiated by an assumption that makes perfect sense

315
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.580
to the British,
but that does not end up being,

316
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:16.581
this is really a good strategy given the situation at the time and again and

317
00:19:16.951 --> 00:19:18.540
again is these phases unfold.

318
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.480
You'll see the British make what to them seems like a logical decision and then

319
00:19:21.481 --> 00:19:23.400
you'll see it not play out particularly well.

320
00:19:23.401 --> 00:19:27.210
It's certainly not in the way that the British really wanted this to play out.

321
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:31.170
So let's turn to the first phase of the war.

322
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.520
And we've already seen a little bit of this first phase earlier on when I talked

323
00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:37.740
about Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill,

324
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:42.450
this early phase of the war was guided by the main assumption on the part of the

325
00:19:42.451 --> 00:19:46.260
British that all the Americans needed was a little display of force,

326
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.940
a little bit of military coercion and the war would come to a quick close.

327
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:55.230
So basically just sort of impress upon them the stupidity of what they are doing

328
00:19:55.231 --> 00:19:59.010
right.
Rear the British army,
we will come in and remind them what they are doing.

329
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.300
They will be reminded that they're behaving illogically and one way or another,

330
00:20:03.301 --> 00:20:05.340
this will end maybe a little reconciliation,

331
00:20:05.341 --> 00:20:08.670
a little friendly sort of gesture on our part towards the colonists.

332
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.740
And we can bring this whole thing to a close.

333
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:15.090
And Lexington and Concord are part of that strategy,
right?
Just a little display,

334
00:20:15.091 --> 00:20:17.010
a force,
and everything's going to be settled.

335
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:21.270
Of course the outcome is not what they would expect.
It's just the opposite.

336
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.040
And the British movements,

337
00:20:23.041 --> 00:20:27.450
the British troop movements call forth an outpouring of American enthusiasm and

338
00:20:27.451 --> 00:20:28.740
enlistments and alarm,

339
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.690
which was further bolstered by America's victories or I guess you could call

340
00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:35.910
them sort of semi victories.
I don't know what to call Bunker Hill.

341
00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:37.710
It's sort of a victory,
but it's sort of isn't.

342
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.810
But certainly some Americans at the time,

343
00:20:39.811 --> 00:20:41.670
I suppose because they weren't crushed to death,

344
00:20:41.671 --> 00:20:44.330
would have seen bunker hill as a victory.
Um,

345
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:47.620
but so the fact that things were sort of persisting and they were standing up to

346
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:52.621
the British at bunker hill in June of 1775 and at Fort Ticonderoga in May of

347
00:20:53.321 --> 00:20:57.340
1775,
that sort of helps to bolster American spirits.

348
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.720
Now I have discussed a little bit the battle of Bunker Hill and you might

349
00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:05.080
remember that that's the battle in which the British held the ground at the end

350
00:21:05.081 --> 00:21:07.900
of the day.
But at the cost of so many men,

351
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:11.560
almost half of the men that were fighting there that day that their victory,

352
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.450
it didn't really seem to be much of a victory at all,

353
00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:17.870
which is why you can sort of call it a semi victory on both sides.
Um,

354
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.100
and I mentioned in Tuesday's lecture that New York Times article that I had

355
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:25.270
stumbled across that morning about that bundle of letters that were going to be

356
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:29.010
sold at Southerby's,
them that it can t had all of these letters between,
um,

357
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.830
British generals and diplomats who were in America writing to each other,

358
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.580
not back to London,
but to each other about what they were really thinking about.

359
00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.600
What was unfolding,
and there's a letter from General John.

360
00:21:40.601 --> 00:21:44.170
We're going British General John for going after the battle of Bunker Hill.

361
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:46.810
He's one of the leading generals in the colonies at that point,

362
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:51.850
and he says in this letter to someone else in America that after that battle he

363
00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:56.560
believes that British military prospects in America seem to use his word gloomy,

364
00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:01.510
such a pittance of troops as Great Britain and Ireland can supply,

365
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.940
will only serve to protract the war,

366
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.720
to incur fruitless expense and ensure disappointment.

367
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.860
Our victory has been bought by an uncommon loss of officers.

368
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.790
Some of them are reparable and I fear the consequence will not answer the

369
00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:18.820
expectations that will be raised in England,
I guess.
So there's,

370
00:22:18.821 --> 00:22:23.410
we're going saying,
okay,
you know,
we won the battle of Bunker Hill.

371
00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.940
This just doesn't look good to me.

372
00:22:24.941 --> 00:22:27.400
He even says in that same letter or something along the lines of,

373
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.780
when I think back into my history books and my sort of military history past,

374
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.890
I can't seem to come up with a situation that quite looks like this one.

375
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.230
This is just weird.
I don't know what to have in a year,

376
00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:41.080
but it doesn't look good to me.
It looks gloomy and I,

377
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:45.010
victory was actually pretty distressing and it's not going to look particularly

378
00:22:45.011 --> 00:22:46.750
wonderful to people in England when they see,

379
00:22:46.751 --> 00:22:50.320
it's certainly not what they're gonna be expecting from us at the outset of

380
00:22:50.321 --> 00:22:55.150
fighting here in the colonies.
So there's bunker hill.
I've mentioned that before.

381
00:22:55.151 --> 00:22:57.760
I don't know if I mentioned Fort Ticonderoga before.

382
00:22:57.761 --> 00:23:01.390
I'll reiterate it here if I have,
and if not,
you'll get it for the first time.
Um,

383
00:23:01.391 --> 00:23:05.320
it was an important battle for the American war effort as well as just for

384
00:23:05.321 --> 00:23:07.450
American morale.
Um,

385
00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.710
Fort Ticonderoga is a strategic fort in upstate New York that was held by the

386
00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:16.711
British and in May of 1775 American troops led by Ethan Allen and Benedict

387
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.990
Arnold.
We're going to have a lot of benedict Arnold today.

388
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:21.640
You can see why he's like this big hero.

389
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.480
And that's why it was so shocking that he did what he did ultimately and

390
00:23:25.481 --> 00:23:29.260
deserted.
He's a hero through all of today's lecture here.
He's starting out.

391
00:23:29.261 --> 00:23:32.860
His heroic acts at the battle of Fort Ticonderoga,

392
00:23:32.861 --> 00:23:34.720
Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold are leading.

393
00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:39.310
They actually surprise the British garrison and they won control of the fort

394
00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.610
declaring their victory as Ethan Allen put it very dramatically.

395
00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.650
And the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress.

396
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.830
I take Fort Ticonderoga,
it's guys,
no drama.

397
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.250
TheU s suffered one wounded soldier.

398
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.590
The British had 48 men captured plus cannons,
mortars,

399
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.690
Musket,
Flint ammunition,

400
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:04.310
and these kinds of supplies were really invaluable for the American cause

401
00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:05.144
generally,

402
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.690
and specifically at this moment they were really useful because the Americans

403
00:24:08.691 --> 00:24:10.310
take the supplies,

404
00:24:10.311 --> 00:24:14.240
particularly these cannons that they win at Fort Ticonderoga and they loved them

405
00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:18.980
to Boston and they positioned them looking down on the city of Boston and not

406
00:24:18.981 --> 00:24:21.950
that long after the British evacuated Boston.
Right.

407
00:24:21.951 --> 00:24:26.510
Which is what they would've wanted.
So Marcia 1776 the British say,
okay,

408
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.300
we lost I kind of Yoga and there's canyon looking down on us.

409
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.110
I think it's time to leave Boston now.

410
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.700
As long as I'm in upstate New York,

411
00:24:34.701 --> 00:24:38.750
I'm going to mention some bad assumptions on the part of Americans as well.

412
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:39.703
At this point,

413
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.000
there was always the feeling in America and particularly during the very

414
00:24:44.001 --> 00:24:49.001
beginning of the war that Canada was just waiting to be liberated from England,

415
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.630
right?
That Quebec is just waiting to be the 48th state,

416
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:56.900
so after winning Ticonderoga,

417
00:24:56.901 --> 00:25:01.760
part of the American army actually went north to attack Quebec and free it,

418
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.010
right?
This idea like free Canada,
Canada doesn't want to be freed.

419
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.320
It's just these Americans that are like,
yeah,

420
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:10.820
they're just waiting for us to come.

421
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.760
So they staged this attack on Quebec to free it.
It's this,

422
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.430
as you'll see today on Tuesday,

423
00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:19.010
this is pretty much a defensive war on the part of the Americans.

424
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.670
This is the one little moment or one of very few little moments that's really

425
00:25:22.671 --> 00:25:27.671
just an offensive invasion on the part of the Americans once again and addict

426
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:31.160
darnel there he is being heroic during the attack.

427
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:36.230
So as the young Aaron Burr who fought in this battle and supposedly pulled the

428
00:25:36.231 --> 00:25:40.550
body of his General Richard Montgomery off of the battlefield under heavy fire.

429
00:25:40.551 --> 00:25:43.430
And since I think Montgomery was a big person and Aaron Burr was a very small

430
00:25:43.431 --> 00:25:45.770
person,
I think this is a hard thing to do.

431
00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:50.360
And he became sort of a hero afterwards for being the guy who saved his generals

432
00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:54.440
body under heavy fire during battle.
Ultimately,

433
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:56.480
the Americans did not liberate Canada.

434
00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.220
The Canadians just were not interested in joining the American war effort.

435
00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:05.780
Not even when a delegation from the continental Congress arrived in Canada,

436
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.980
led by Benjamin Franklin to negotiate with the Canadians about joining the

437
00:26:09.981 --> 00:26:12.200
revolts.
So the Americans are serious about this.

438
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:17.540
The effort to free Canada ended without effect.
And ultimately during this war,

439
00:26:17.541 --> 00:26:20.900
at least the Americans abandoned the idea about liberating Canada.

440
00:26:20.901 --> 00:26:24.980
And I say during this war at least because during the war of 1812 and once
again,

441
00:26:24.981 --> 00:26:29.780
we're fighting the British.
The Americans are right back there.
It's like,

442
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:34.580
no.
Number two,
you know,
go away.
But they're back.

443
00:26:34.581 --> 00:26:37.100
They're persistent.
Now,

444
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:42.160
the main part of the American army at this point in 1776 after the evacuation of

445
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.380
Boston by the British is not in Canada.

446
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.930
After the British evacuated Boston,

447
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:53.400
Washington and the main body of American troops went to New York City,

448
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.130
convinced that after evacuating Boston,

449
00:26:56.131 --> 00:26:59.250
that's likely to be where the British head to New York City.
And sure enough,

450
00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:01.050
that's exactly what the British do.

451
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:07.080
Thomas Gauge commander of the British forces had been recalled by this time and

452
00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:12.030
he'd been replaced by Sir William Howe who arrives in New York City in July of

453
00:27:12.031 --> 00:27:14.820
1776 okay,

454
00:27:14.821 --> 00:27:19.080
so here we see another British assumption that does not play out the way in

455
00:27:19.081 --> 00:27:20.640
which clearly the British hope it would.

456
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.000
I said a few minutes ago they assumed a little show of force,

457
00:27:24.001 --> 00:27:26.890
a little show of reconciliation and this will end and we've seen a little show

458
00:27:26.891 --> 00:27:30.600
of force here.
We see an attempt at reconciliation.

459
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.500
The idea of being maybe if we sort of extend a hand in some way,
this will end.

460
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.630
So newly installed general,

461
00:27:36.631 --> 00:27:40.710
how invited and American Commission to hold a peace conference with him.

462
00:27:40.711 --> 00:27:42.870
On a boat in New York harbor.

463
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.950
This ends up being known as the Staten Island Peace Conference and somehow it's

464
00:27:46.951 --> 00:27:49.260
just have no issue with Staten Island,

465
00:27:49.261 --> 00:27:51.630
but I just don't expect that all those words to go together.

466
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.880
You stop in island piece governance,
um,

467
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.120
which is held September 11th,
1776

468
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:02.880
at the conference.
How tells the American Commissioners Benjamin Franklin,

469
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:07.860
John Adams making a little appearance and south Carolinian,
Edward Rutledge,

470
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:08.491
all of them,

471
00:28:08.491 --> 00:28:13.080
they're from the continental congress that he would hate to be forced to destroy

472
00:28:13.081 --> 00:28:14.670
his brothers.
The Americans.

473
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.140
He's wishing that he there was something they could do so that he can be spared

474
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:24.440
the horror of having to kill his brethren at which point France and supposedly

475
00:28:24.511 --> 00:28:28.380
responded by saying,
we will try our best to spare you the trouble.

476
00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.110
Thank you Benjamin Franklin.
Okay.

477
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.380
That conference did not accomplish what the British wanted it to accomplish.

478
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:37.410
Nothing happens as a result of the Staten Island peace conference.

479
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:43.520
How also wrote to George Washington to see if he could get Washington to come to

480
00:28:44.791 --> 00:28:48.270
terms with the British.
Right.
Maybe.
Maybe if I just deal with him personally.

481
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:53.190
He'll see that I'm being reasonable and work towards ending this before it

482
00:28:53.191 --> 00:28:54.900
really begins.
Unfortunately.

483
00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:59.430
This is the letter that I mentioned yes on a Tuesday addressed to Mr. Washington

484
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:03.180
that he did not want to accept because it wasn't addressed to General
Washington,

485
00:29:03.181 --> 00:29:04.560
the etc,
etc. Letter.

486
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:09.180
So basically how refuses to address Washington with his military title and

487
00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:12.840
Washington refuses to accept the letter.
So this does not go well either.

488
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.910
That's just like oops.

489
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.780
Oh well that's an attempt to just stall it before it even gets underway.

490
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:23.640
So there we have basically the first phase of the war.

491
00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:28.200
This idea that a little push,
a little shove,
a little display of force,

492
00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:30.930
a little reconciliation and things will end.

493
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.920
The second phase begins with a switch in strategy on the part of the British,

494
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:39.720
a new strategy.
But again,

495
00:29:39.721 --> 00:29:43.960
one that's still grounded in traditional assumptions about warfare.

496
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.130
And this new strategy is accompanied by another assumption that does not play

497
00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:51.190
out well.
Little shove strategy doesn't work.

498
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.820
So now basically we'll up the stakes is what the British were thinking.

499
00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:56.620
We'll see as a major city.

500
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.840
Basically the British assumed that if they seized New York,

501
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:07.500
they would split the colonies in half along the Hudson Valley and end the war to

502
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:11.470
them.
It seemed pretty simple and easy to divide the colonies into two halves.

503
00:30:11.471 --> 00:30:15.220
And particularly since at this point they still think that the center of all the

504
00:30:15.221 --> 00:30:16.750
trouble is New England,

505
00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.480
that there were these sort of crazy radical people in New England.

506
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.680
So if they can see as New York and divide the colonies in half an isolate New

507
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.380
England,
then maybe things will actually end quickly.

508
00:30:26.381 --> 00:30:31.030
So that's the strategy here as we move into phase number two of the fighting.

509
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.960
So the British descended on New York with an armada bearing 32,000 troops.

510
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.450
Okay,
that's just awe inspiring numbers of men,

511
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.390
Washington dug in on Brooklyn Heights,

512
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:47.860
hoping that the British would attack him frontally and that there'd be another

513
00:30:47.861 --> 00:30:50.920
kind of bunker hill sort of battle.
But instead,

514
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:53.530
how carried out some kind of a flanking maneuver,

515
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.420
which resulted in American losses of nearly 1500 men compared with British

516
00:30:58.421 --> 00:31:02.260
losses of less than 400 men.
However,
at this point,

517
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:07.500
how made a mistake of a sort that he made repeatedly again and again throughout

518
00:31:07.961 --> 00:31:08.794
the war.

519
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:14.160
He's so competent victory that he decides he won't deliver the final death blow

520
00:31:14.171 --> 00:31:16.270
until the next day.
Right?
Oh,

521
00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:19.570
what the night pass tomorrow morning we'll get up and crush them.
Okay.

522
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.080
Washington is the expert of retreat overnight.

523
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:27.310
Washington removes his troops under cover of darkness from Brooklyn Heights and

524
00:31:27.311 --> 00:31:30.520
brings them into New York and we'll see.

525
00:31:30.521 --> 00:31:33.100
I think even in the course of today's lecture,
how does this,
again,

526
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.320
that he does well in a battle,

527
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.620
he assumes that things are going so swimmingly that okay,

528
00:31:38.621 --> 00:31:42.340
tomorrow we'll finish things off and Washington manages to make a hasty retreat

529
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.050
and things continue.

530
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.730
So Washington removes his troops under cover of darkness to New York City and

531
00:31:48.731 --> 00:31:50.560
basically for the next two months there,

532
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:55.120
there's a series of minor battles in New York.
There's one in Harlem Heights,

533
00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:56.800
there's one in white plains.

534
00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:01.690
How keeps trying to circle the continental army and Washington keeps retreating

535
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:06.490
one way or another pretty skillfully helped always and his retreating by the

536
00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:11.410
fact that how it's so slow to just advance and conquer.
Ultimately,

537
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:16.411
Washington fled across New Jersey over the Delaware River while Howe,

538
00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:20.580
who now is in possession of New York,
also sees is Newport,

539
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:23.770
Rhode Island and establishes outposts in New Jersey.

540
00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.860
So things are not looking wonderful for the Americans at this point and the

541
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:28.180
British seem to be doing quite well.

542
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:34.470
But here we do see one of Washington's most characteristic warm maneuvers

543
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:38.860
because rather than just sort of standing there and engaging with the British,

544
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.850
he withdraws and he withdraws and he withdraws again and again and again

545
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:45.740
throughout the entire war.

546
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:50.300
He continually maneuvered his army so that at the circumstances didn't seem

547
00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.750
overwhelmingly favorable for the American army.

548
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.810
He could just retreat to a more secure spot.

549
00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:01.460
Now obviously the strategy of retreat would not have been necessarily

550
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:04.340
overwhelmingly inspiring to Americans at the time.

551
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.840
It did not also necessarily strike fear into the hearts of the British.
At first,

552
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.130
Washington's The guy who retreats this sump had some people feeling a little bit

553
00:33:13.131 --> 00:33:16.310
gloomy and not always hopeful.
He's the army that disappears.

554
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:21.740
But now in 1776 Washington uses this typical strategy.

555
00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:23.810
He doesn't want to get pinned into New York City.

556
00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:26.900
He retreats across New Jersey retreats across the Delaware,

557
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:31.970
goes into Pennsylvania.
The British had after him as far as Trenton,
New Jersey,

558
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:37.490
led by British General Lord Cornwallis and there they go into winter quarters.

559
00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:41.480
And Lord Cornwallis had arrived in America in 1776 and he brought with him even

560
00:33:41.481 --> 00:33:42.890
more British troops.

561
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.620
And here we have yet another letter from that collection I mentioned being sold

562
00:33:48.621 --> 00:33:52.430
at Southerby's.
And this one's from an observer who's on a ship,

563
00:33:52.431 --> 00:33:54.050
a British ship in New York harbor.

564
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.320
As he's watching the Americans leave New York and he's riding again to somebody

565
00:33:59.481 --> 00:34:00.410
else.
He's a diplomat.

566
00:34:00.411 --> 00:34:03.550
He's writing to someone else in the colonies and he says that he's,

567
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.830
he watched the colonists abandoned their homes,

568
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:11.840
quote to follow the standard of rebellion at the hazard of all their worth

569
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.510
rather than acknowledged George for their king.

570
00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.450
The infatuation is inscrutable.

571
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:22.310
I have read somewhere and I began to think it possible that a whole country as

572
00:34:22.311 --> 00:34:24.890
well as an individual maybe struck with lunacy.

573
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:26.750
He can't believe what he's seeing,
right?

574
00:34:26.751 --> 00:34:31.751
He's watching Washington's army run and he watches some colonists,

575
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:36.770
basically follow,
abandoned what they own and follow as he puts it.

576
00:34:36.771 --> 00:34:38.930
Rather than acknowledged George for their king,

577
00:34:38.931 --> 00:34:42.980
he can't quite believe what he's seeing now by this point.

578
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:47.980
This is December of 1776 Washington had roughly 3000 men fit for duty in the

579
00:34:49.611 --> 00:34:53.000
army.
It was a sad point for Washington to the army.

580
00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.450
It's at this point that Thomas Paine makes another appearance,

581
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:57.980
comes to the fore again.

582
00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:02.570
He writes a series of pamphlets published under the title of the crisis,

583
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:07.640
and the first one appears in December of 1776 actually,

584
00:35:07.641 --> 00:35:10.910
I think December 19th,
1776 by this point,

585
00:35:10.911 --> 00:35:12.920
pain had actually joined the American army.

586
00:35:12.921 --> 00:35:17.840
So he's in the army and he wrote these crisis essays while he was in the army

587
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:21.980
and Washington had them read to the troops to boost their morale.

588
00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.810
And as with common sense,

589
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:28.790
these crisis essays include some of the most famous pros of the revolutionary

590
00:35:28.791 --> 00:35:30.680
era.
And I'll just read the most obvious lines,

591
00:35:30.681 --> 00:35:32.870
which some of you probably already know.

592
00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.720
These are the times that try men's souls.

593
00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:39.630
The summer soldier and the sunshine Patriot will in this crisis,

594
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.790
shrink from the service of their country,

595
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:47.100
but he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman

596
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.640
tyranny like hell is not easily conquered.

597
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.510
Yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict,

598
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:59.910
the more glorious the triumph.
He's good at coming forward at tough moments.

599
00:35:59.911 --> 00:36:02.190
And then having these sort of inspiring words again,

600
00:36:02.191 --> 00:36:04.320
which is why Washington's having them read to the troops.

601
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:09.720
Paine's words were really needed in December of 1776 because it's a real low

602
00:36:09.721 --> 00:36:14.721
point for Washington and the army failure literally seem to be just on the

603
00:36:15.001 --> 00:36:19.290
horizon.
In less than three months,
the British had captured New York City,

604
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:24.830
they had captured part of New Jersey food supplies and pay in the American army

605
00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:30.141
were at an all time low and almost worst of all enlistments of soldiers in the

606
00:36:30.961 --> 00:36:35.280
continental army ended at the end of the year.
It's a Washington.

607
00:36:35.281 --> 00:36:38.730
There he is and he knows that the people in the continental army,

608
00:36:38.731 --> 00:36:41.160
their formal enlistments and at the end of December,

609
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.900
and they could all just walk away and say,
well I,
my enlistments done.
Thanks sir.

610
00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.000
Nice fighting with you.
Goodbye.

611
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.430
And Washington could literally be left without an army.

612
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:56.240
So he ha he does one last desperate measure literally to prevent the army from

613
00:36:56.281 --> 00:36:57.540
entirely disappearing.

614
00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:01.800
He uses the only thing that's available to him at this moment and that is his

615
00:37:01.801 --> 00:37:03.000
personal influence.

616
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:08.340
He makes a personal plea to the army to please stay with him for just six more

617
00:37:08.341 --> 00:37:10.830
weeks.
As a personal favor to him.

618
00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.580
I please don't leave just for me,
for your commander.

619
00:37:14.581 --> 00:37:19.050
Just give me six more weeks and then you can go as a personal favor to me.

620
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:23.940
Who you respect.
Give me just six more weeks.
Most of the soldiers agreed.

621
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:29.370
And with that Washington made one last desperate attempt to attack the British

622
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:34.260
at Trenton,
New Jersey and Washington strategy is good in this case.

623
00:37:34.261 --> 00:37:36.060
He basically waits until Christmas,

624
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.480
really banking on the element of surprise.

625
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:43.890
And then he launches a surprise attack against an encampment of Hessians at

626
00:37:43.891 --> 00:37:48.891
Trenton and he wins the day with a loss of only for men and he gains roughly 900

627
00:37:49.591 --> 00:37:50.730
prisoners.
This is the,

628
00:37:50.731 --> 00:37:54.780
this is great for Washington and says such such a low moment and he really does

629
00:37:54.781 --> 00:37:55.980
get the element of surprise.

630
00:37:55.981 --> 00:37:59.340
The Hessians are just sort of stunned and at first apparently think that there's

631
00:37:59.341 --> 00:38:03.840
like a little sort of advanced guard of Americans who are attacking them and

632
00:38:03.841 --> 00:38:07.980
they suddenly realized their horror.
Like,
no,
this would be the American army.

633
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.090
We're in trouble and they fight and there was a battle,
but again,

634
00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.190
they really lose the day.

635
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:19.260
The British learning of the attack are somewhat distressed.
However,

636
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:23.160
they think they assume at this point that they have the American army cornered

637
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:28.340
at Trenton and thus may decide the next day they will attack the continental

638
00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:33.360
army.
Okay.
So once again,
they're not good at the element of surprise.
The British,

639
00:38:33.361 --> 00:38:35.860
they keep sort of taking their time,

640
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.980
taking your time with not good at this point of the word.

641
00:38:38.981 --> 00:38:42.250
It's not a strategy that is working for the British.
So sure enough,

642
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:45.040
Washington does what Washington does so well.

643
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:50.080
He retreats under cover of night and in this case,
rather than just retreating,

644
00:38:50.081 --> 00:38:53.050
he actually leaves campfires burning in their camp.

645
00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:57.790
So it looks as though the army is still there and then leaving what looks like

646
00:38:57.791 --> 00:38:59.890
the encampment there under complete darkness.

647
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:05.100
He moves his troops away directly into enemy lines in Princeton,

648
00:39:05.261 --> 00:39:09.640
New Jersey,
which she also captured again,
he did two unexpected things.

649
00:39:09.641 --> 00:39:13.150
He manages to retreat.
He pretends as though he's not retreating.

650
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.900
And then he moves his troops into enemy lines and Princeton and captures it.

651
00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.360
Now during the battle,

652
00:39:19.361 --> 00:39:22.570
supposedly there was a cannon ball that was shot through Nassau Hall,
you know,

653
00:39:22.571 --> 00:39:25.420
the big main hall of Prince and the College of New Jersey.

654
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.280
And there's a story that goes along with that.

655
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:29.470
There's no actual evidence to support the story,

656
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.020
but I'll offer it cause people tell it over and over and over again.

657
00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:34.750
So clearly someone somewhere believes it and even though it might not be true,

658
00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.940
I'll give it to you anyway.
Um,
the,

659
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:41.110
the story is basically that Alexander Hamilton is the guy who shot the cannon or

660
00:39:41.111 --> 00:39:44.890
had the Canon shot that went through Nassau Hall at the College of New Jersey.

661
00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.540
The theory behind that being,

662
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.390
he actually really wanted to go to the College of New Jersey.
He's fighting,

663
00:39:49.391 --> 00:39:52.120
he is fighting at the battle of Princeton and he wants to go.

664
00:39:52.121 --> 00:39:55.540
That's his first choice college.
Like,
where do I want to go?
Oh,

665
00:39:55.541 --> 00:39:58.210
the College of New Jersey.
But he's in such a hurry.

666
00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:02.470
He wants to advance through the program at Princeton as fast as he can.

667
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:05.020
So basically I don't want to have to wait for everyone else,

668
00:40:05.021 --> 00:40:08.380
like if I finish a course and a month,
then I want to move onto the next one.

669
00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.440
This is a little bit of a radical proposal and the people with Princeton at the

670
00:40:11.441 --> 00:40:13.570
College of New Jersey say,
um,
no.

671
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:17.440
So he ends up going to King's College to Columbia instead,

672
00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.140
he is fighting at the battle of Princeton.
He is in command.

673
00:40:20.141 --> 00:40:23.890
It was small artillery group,
which is firing cannon.

674
00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:25.460
So the story is,
you know,

675
00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:29.920
he was rather pleased to see a cannon ball go firing into Nassau Hall since they

676
00:40:29.921 --> 00:40:34.420
had rejected him.
Basically they didn't take him for college one way or another.

677
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:35.950
Washington wins at Trenton,

678
00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:41.110
Washington wins at Princeton and then he settles into winter quarters at

679
00:40:41.111 --> 00:40:44.800
Morristown New Jersey for the winter of 1776.

680
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:51.480
So basically in nine days in the dead of winter and really in the dead of winter

681
00:40:51.941 --> 00:40:56.260
when gentlemen do not normally stage military campaigns in a traditional war,

682
00:40:56.770 --> 00:41:01.770
the American army pushed the British back 60 miles from their ultimate goal,

683
00:41:01.781 --> 00:41:04.540
which was Philadelphia.
And as important,

684
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:09.520
the battles of Trenton and Princeton were vital to American morale,

685
00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.400
to civilian morale and military morale alike.

686
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.810
As an Englishman said at the time a few days ago,

687
00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.650
he's American's had given up the costs for lust.
They're late,

688
00:41:20.651 --> 00:41:24.640
successes have turned to the scale,
and now they're all liberty.
Matt again,

689
00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:28.270
they have recovered from their panic and it will not be an easy matter to throw

690
00:41:28.271 --> 00:41:29.950
them into that confusion again.

691
00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:36.210
So here ends the second phase of the war with the eastern seaboard.

692
00:41:36.291 --> 00:41:41.240
Definitely not cut in half.
The Americans definitely not defeated.

693
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:47.860
The third phase of the war begins in 1777 largely,

694
00:41:48.441 --> 00:41:53.390
it consisted of the British attempting to subdue the middle colonies.
Once again,

695
00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.360
proceeding under the assumption that if they get the right city,

696
00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:00.620
it will cause things to end.
In this case,
they think,
okay,
we,
we,
we did New York,

697
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.000
we're heading for Philadelphia,

698
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.760
yet another major city and the governments in Philadelphia.

699
00:42:04.761 --> 00:42:08.300
So maybe if we managed to get that city as well,

700
00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:10.250
things will turn our way.

701
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.350
That's how things happen in a conventional war.
Capture a key city,

702
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:18.770
things turn your way often and again in America,

703
00:42:18.771 --> 00:42:22.910
this is not a strategy that works well at Cornwallis put it at the time.

704
00:42:22.911 --> 00:42:26.540
In the end he decides that the only way to really defeat the Americans would be

705
00:42:26.541 --> 00:42:31.541
to catch George Washington or as Cornwallis bullet put it to bag the Fox.

706
00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.200
Right.
That's though he sounded like a traditional Fox side.

707
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.320
We have to bad but thoughts and then it will be over.

708
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.960
I Dunno if Philadelphia is going to do it,
but at any rate,

709
00:42:38.961 --> 00:42:41.180
the British do head off for Philadelphia,

710
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:44.510
1777 the third phase of the war.

711
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:49.840
This is how his plan and at first the British do well in Pennsylvania there are

712
00:42:49.911 --> 00:42:54.911
actually a couple of clashes in Pennsylvania at Brandywine and at Germantown and

713
00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.810
both times continental army units crumbled and how it was ultimately able to

714
00:42:59.811 --> 00:43:03.770
enter Philadelphia and in these skirmishes one after another,

715
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:08.120
nearly 20% of the continental troops were either killed,
wounded,
or captured.

716
00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.040
So the British are doing pretty well at first,

717
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.360
I'm not helping matters as far as American morale goes is the fact that when

718
00:43:14.361 --> 00:43:18.410
Congress hears that the British are headed for Philadelphia,

719
00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:23.510
they run in mass panic like
British are coming,

720
00:43:23.511 --> 00:43:27.290
which does not really make the continental army feel like they have much faith

721
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.900
in them to protect them.
Right.
They literally like lead down.

722
00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.710
There's actually a really amusing letter,
I think by this point.

723
00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:35.680
Alexander Hamilton is an aid to George Washington.

724
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.390
He sends a letter to the continental congress basically saying,

725
00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:45.650
so the sell Condo,
he flees to another city in Pennsylvania.

726
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.740
So things are looking good for the British in Pennsylvania.
However,

727
00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:49.911
further north,

728
00:43:49.911 --> 00:43:54.050
something else is happening to the wing of the British army that had been in

729
00:43:54.051 --> 00:43:58.340
Canada and now is headed south,
led by British General John.

730
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:03.530
We're going in a battle at Saratoga,
New York with Burger joints,

731
00:44:03.531 --> 00:44:06.290
troops suffering from some supply problems.

732
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:09.470
So here we have a battle where supplies are major problem.

733
00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:15.520
We're going ends up at the battle of Saratoga surrendering almost 6,000 men to

734
00:44:16.581 --> 00:44:21.581
American forces led by general ratio gates and aided by Benedict Arnold,

735
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:27.470
the man who appears to be everywhere in this phase of the war for the Americans.

736
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:30.110
This feels like a real turning point.
I mean,

737
00:44:30.111 --> 00:44:31.950
it's a stunning victory for the Americans,

738
00:44:31.951 --> 00:44:36.810
really unexpected and it's just a stunning,
a defeat for the British.

739
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:42.450
And there's actually a journal entry by one of Brian's lieutenants describing

740
00:44:42.451 --> 00:44:45.090
the events with the British commander,

741
00:44:45.091 --> 00:44:47.220
with Burgoyne and with the troops and the surrender.

742
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:51.390
He describes what he sees and he writes in his journal General,

743
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:55.620
we're going desired a meeting of all the officer's early that morning at which

744
00:44:55.621 --> 00:44:59.400
he entered into a detail of his manner of acting since he had the honor of

745
00:44:59.401 --> 00:45:00.270
commanding the army.

746
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:04.110
So basically we're going to cause all of his officers and he's trying to explain

747
00:45:04.111 --> 00:45:07.590
to them how they ended up in the situation that they're in,
how,

748
00:45:07.591 --> 00:45:10.800
what logic did he follow so that they're where they are now.

749
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:15.920
And the lieutenant continues in his diary that per going with quote too full to

750
00:45:15.931 --> 00:45:16.764
speak,

751
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:22.040
heaven only could tell his feelings at this time about 10 o'clock we marched out

752
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:26.100
according to treaty,
marched out to surrender with drums beating,

753
00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:30.420
but the drum seemed to have lost their former inspiriting sounds and seemed as

754
00:45:30.421 --> 00:45:35.421
if almost ashamed to be heard on such an occasion as to my own feelings.

755
00:45:35.461 --> 00:45:40.461
I can not express them tears though unmanly forced their way and if alone,

756
00:45:41.611 --> 00:45:43.770
I could have burst to give myself vent.

757
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:48.660
I never shall forget the appearance of the American troops are marching past

758
00:45:48.661 --> 00:45:49.494
them.

759
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:54.000
A dead silence universally range through their numerous columns and even they

760
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:57.450
seem struck with our situation and Derris they're scarce.

761
00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:01.230
Lift up their eyes to view British troops in such a situation,

762
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.550
I must say they're decent behavior during the time to us,
so greatly fallen,

763
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.040
merited,
the utmost approbation and praise.

764
00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:11.760
So he's actually describing this shocking moment where the British can't believe

765
00:46:11.761 --> 00:46:15.420
they're surrendering that number of men to the American forces.

766
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.730
And the Americans are so stunned that this is happening,

767
00:46:17.731 --> 00:46:20.250
that they're actually just silently watching it.
They can't,

768
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:25.350
no one can quite believe what's happening at Saratoga.
It's a huge victory.

769
00:46:25.351 --> 00:46:29.730
It has important consequences that I'll talk about more next Tuesday as we head

770
00:46:29.731 --> 00:46:31.950
into the last phase of the war,

771
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:36.930
which largely takes place in the south and see its repercussions and its

772
00:46:36.931 --> 00:46:39.630
implications.
Um,
have a great weekend.

773
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.970
I think lurking somewhere is that sheet of paper.

774
00:46:41.971 --> 00:46:43.980
I assume it made its way somewhere.

775
00:46:43.981 --> 00:46:46.740
Whoever has that magical sheet of paper up there.
It is.

776
00:46:46.741 --> 00:46:48.540
Okay to bring it up when you're done.
Have a great weekend.
