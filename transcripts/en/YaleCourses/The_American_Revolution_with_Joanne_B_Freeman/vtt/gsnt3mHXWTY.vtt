1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.740
Onto the topic of today's lecture.
Um,

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.920
and today's lecture is the importance of George Washington.

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.450
We're going to be talking about George Washington today.
And in a sense,

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.570
what I'm going to be talking about is exactly what it sounds like I'm going to

5
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:18.090
be talking about,
which is looking at what,

6
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.020
in a sense you could call the phenomenon of George Washington,
right?
His,

7
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:26.880
his reputation is exalted reputation and importance during his lifetime.

8
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.990
And some of the reasons why both of those things were true.

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.020
What is it that he was doing or what was it about him that made him stand out in

10
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.180
the way that he did then?
And actually in a sense forever after,

11
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:41.520
but we're going to be looking really during his lifetime.

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.080
What was it about Washington that made him stand out?
And in a sense,

13
00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:50.820
this lecture sort of represents a little bit of a turn in this course as a

14
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:51.930
whole.
Um,

15
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.980
because you'll be getting a sense of Washington today and that will be important

16
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:59.700
to have sort of under our belts for the next two lectures after this because

17
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:03.090
then we will actually be looking at fighting like battles and such.

18
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:06.420
We will actually be looking at how the war was fought in a really literal way.

19
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.680
So obviously I want us all to have a sense of George before we venture off and

20
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:13.780
watched to see what George is doing as the war gets underway.

21
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.110
So I've divided that into two lectures.

22
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:20.460
It's Thursday and Tuesday is when we'll be talking about how the war was fought

23
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:23.070
and then in the end really how the war was won.

24
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.670
And today is kind of the segue lecture.
Um,

25
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.700
I also want to mention something because by dumb luck,

26
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.150
it was in the New York Times this morning and I was reading it and it's hardly

27
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:34.740
ever do I read the New York Times and say,
oh,

28
00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:38.280
I must mention that in my American revolution course.
But it happened today.

29
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.120
I'm in the art section.
I guess there's an article on a collection did,

30
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.590
if you see this,
did any of you happen to look at the New York time?
New Buddy?

31
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.610
Wow.
I feel so informed.
Um,
there was an article in the arts section on um,

32
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.780
a collection of letters between British military figures and sort of end

33
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.800
officials to each other,
not back to the officials in London,
but,

34
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:02.670
but the newspaper,

35
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:06.120
The Times calls them sort of back channel letters from throughout the

36
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:08.820
revolutionary war.
And what's interesting about the letters,

37
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:12.120
it's not new information,
but it's sort of wonderfully ground level information.

38
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.030
It's all of these people were writing to each other from throughout the war in

39
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:19.320
one way or another saying,
oh,
we're in big trouble.
I mean,

40
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.100
the British from very early on in the ward saying,
I don't know.
I mean,

41
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.560
so at the same time that they're writing back to London and reporting,

42
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.540
our military forces are strong and we are supreme and we will of course win this

43
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:32.460
war for the greater glory of Britain.

44
00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:34.500
And the colonies will be back to where they should be.

45
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:37.110
They're writing to each other and saying,
I don't know,

46
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:38.100
what do you think about this?

47
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:41.430
Because this is really tricky and I don't know if we're going to be able to do

48
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:42.930
it.
I don't know if we can get enough men here.

49
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:46.380
The logistically this is a disaster.
They hate us.
It's hard to be hated.

50
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.570
And there's all these really interesting letters.
Um,

51
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.070
I'm sure you can go find it online,
but,

52
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.180
and I'll mention it more when I'm actually talking about the war and why the

53
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:57.510
bridge doing what they're doing and the logic behind what the Americans are

54
00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:01.450
doing.
But I thought it actually really interesting that by just dumb luck that

55
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:04.880
appeared today.
Um,
and again,
it's something that,
um,

56
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.730
it's not a new realization,

57
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:10.900
but it's an interesting thing to be reminded of that as powerful as the British

58
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.720
army is.
And as much as you would assume at the time,

59
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:16.990
they would assume things are going to go swimmingly and we're going to just

60
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.910
sweep this up in no time.

61
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.810
There are all these sort of back channel letters of people on the ground who are

62
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:25.480
actually in a sense being very realistic about it and saying,

63
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.840
this is really hard.
This is really tricky.

64
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.020
I don't know if this is going to work throughout the war and and really

65
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:35.440
sometimes sort of bemused and sometimes really depressed tones.
But anyway,

66
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.790
more on that to come for now,
I want us to turn to George Washington.

67
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.510
Now as a historian,

68
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.710
I have to admit that this kind of lecture sometimes might make me nervous

69
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.300
because as a historian it makes me nervous to declare that one person was

70
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:55.750
crucial.
Like that's the kind of declaration historians don't like to make.

71
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:58.660
They like to say,
Oh,
well history is complicated.
Events are complicated.

72
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:03.370
They unfold and complicated ways.
Um,
and all of that is true.
That said,

73
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.800
in many ways Washington actually was crucial,

74
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.320
not just to the revolutionary war efforts,

75
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.430
but equally if not more important as we're going to see later in the course to

76
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:14.980
the launching of the new government under the constitution.

77
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:19.660
I'll talk a little bit more about that in the last lectures of this course.
Um,

78
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.130
but in one way or another,

79
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.520
Washington ends up being really crucial in this period.

80
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:28.300
And one of the central reasons why that's true and it's a theme I'm going to

81
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:32.110
come back to at a few different points that a few different ways in the lecture

82
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:35.890
today.
It's because people trusted him with power.

83
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.130
We're going to look today partly at why they trust him with power,

84
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.160
but in one way or another throughout this period,

85
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:47.161
people trusted him with power and in an age and among the people who were really

86
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.070
wary about power,
about Tierney,

87
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.320
about where power was being placed,

88
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.390
this is a very big deal to be the person that people trust with power in matters

89
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.040
a lot.
Um,
and in a sense,
the deployment of power,

90
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:05.530
the holding of power being entrusted with power,

91
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:09.220
it's sort of the central crucial issue with Washington's importance.

92
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:09.971
I think again,

93
00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:13.780
the revolution and the presidency that sort of this key thing about him that

94
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.660
makes him different really he is in many ways,

95
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:19.540
particularly when he becomes the first president.

96
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.830
The only person people could think of trusting in that role of having extreme

97
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:26.500
power.
And part of what I'm going to be talking about today is why?

98
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.530
Why is that true?
Why is he such a trusted character?

99
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:31.660
What did he do to be so trusted?

100
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.460
And it's something he's particularly skilled at is not just holding positions of

101
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:36.851
power,

102
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:41.260
but managing to have power while also calming people's fears about what that

103
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:45.460
power might mean.
Okay.
Now in a sense,

104
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.220
when we think about Washington,
Washington,

105
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.850
I always feel he gets sort of gypped in the long realm of history.

106
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.570
Not because we don't remember him or not because we don't honor George

107
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.571
Washington,

108
00:05:55.571 --> 00:06:00.020
but because he sort of a nonperson he sorta this block of marble who sort of,

109
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:03.110
you know,
glides through history like,
well yeah,
I fought a war.

110
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.760
It became the president went home and died.
George Washington,
the guy,
you know,

111
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.200
he doesn't get to be a real person.
He's just sort of almost a symbol to us.

112
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:13.670
And and I suppose that even at the time,

113
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:15.500
in some ways it's we're going to hear in the end of the lecture.

114
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.060
Even then he's a little bit of a symbol,

115
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:22.061
but we don't think of him very often as a person with insecurities and ambitions

116
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.380
as a person with political savvy,

117
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:29.381
he actually was very politically savvy as a person with specific political ideas

118
00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:33.020
and ideals and we don't tend to even attribute many ideas to him at all.

119
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.390
He just think of him as capital l leader,

120
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.210
but in fact he's all of these things.

121
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:42.800
I mean he is a person and all that that entails.
That said,

122
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.900
even during his lifetime,

123
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.770
he was already being shaped into a legend at the title.

124
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:53.771
Father of his country is a title that was given to him even before the country

125
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:55.641
finally existed.

126
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:59.000
The revolution is not over yet and some people are calling him father of his

127
00:06:59.001 --> 00:06:59.750
country.

128
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.770
So this happens pretty at a pretty early point to Washington that he ascends

129
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:06.560
into this position.
Now,

130
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.780
as I'm sure you've gathered by this time in the course,

131
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.790
John Adams is a little jealous of other people who appear to be getting the

132
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.360
glory,
credit and fame that he thinks he deserves.

133
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.950
And not surprisingly,

134
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:23.951
he's a little irked at Washington's incredible sort of renowned and status and

135
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:29.900
fame and how beloved he is as it developed between the revolution in the 1790s

136
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.190
to Adams.
Washington is just like so revered.

137
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.870
And he writes this letter,
I'm going to read a piece of it here.
Once again,

138
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:42.470
Benjamin Rush,
who keeps appearing and disappearing in this course,
he and an end,

139
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:46.250
a Adams,
right?
These amazing,
just in the same way that Jefferson and Adams rite,

140
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:49.820
amazing letters in their old age,
Adams and rush to do the same thing.

141
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:51.500
They write these really great letters to each other.

142
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:54.980
They're published in a book called the spur of fame,
I think is the name of it.

143
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.740
Um,
they're,
they're really fascinating and really interesting.

144
00:07:57.741 --> 00:08:01.220
And this is one of them.
Um,
and Adams writes it in 1807,

145
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:03.900
so it's a few years after Washington died.

146
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.840
He died in 1799 and they're talking about Washington clearly in an exchange of

147
00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:09.674
letters here.

148
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.030
And Adam's clearly one of the things that irks him is that Washington wasn't as

149
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:17.660
book learned as Adam's,
and many of their contemporaries were,
right?

150
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.460
He's someone who doesn't have a formal education.

151
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.980
He's not thinking about Aristotle.

152
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.830
He's not thinking about the things that Adams thinks people should be thinking

153
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:27.560
about if they're a great statesman.
So here in this letter,

154
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:32.561
he tries to come up with the top 10 talents that Washington had that made him

155
00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:37.040
great.
None of them having anything to do with book learning,
right?
It's like,

156
00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:39.950
okay,
so if he doesn't have book learning,
what are the top 10 talents?

157
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.870
David Letterman is the top 10 talents of George Washington wa that made him so

158
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:49.130
great.
So this is Adam's description.
Talents.

159
00:08:49.131 --> 00:08:53.360
You will say what talents?
I answer number one,

160
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.010
a handsome face.

161
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.450
But this is a talent I can prove by the authority of a thousand instances and

162
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:02.310
all ages.
Number two,

163
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.970
a tall stature like the Hebrew sovereign chosen because he was taller by the

164
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:11.550
head than the other Jews.
Number three and elegant form.

165
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.190
You can see where this is going.
Number four,
graceful attitudes and movements.

166
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:18.841
Number five,

167
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:23.160
a large imposing fortune consisting of a great landed estate left him by his

168
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:26.850
father and brother and in addition to this immense tracks of land of his own

169
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:27.684
acquisition,

170
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:32.490
there was nothing except bloody battles and splendid victories to which mankind

171
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:36.750
bowed down with more reverence than to great fortune.
Number six,

172
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.040
Washington was a Virginia.
This is equivalent to five talents.

173
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.810
Virginia and geese are all swans.

174
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.540
Not a barren in Scotland is more national,

175
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.890
not elad upon the highlands is more clannish than every Virginia and I have ever

176
00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:55.110
known.
Number seven,

177
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.290
Washington was proceeded by favorable anecdotes.

178
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.090
The English had used him ill in the expedition of Bradick during the French and

179
00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:06.510
Indian war.
They had not done justice to his bravery and good counsel.

180
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:08.880
They had exaggerated and misrepresented his defeat,

181
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.110
which interested the pride as well as compassion of Americans in his favor.

182
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.980
Number eight,
he possessed the gift of silence.

183
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.680
This I esteem is one of the most precious talents.

184
00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:22.830
I think that's partly because Adams does not possess the gift of silence.

185
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.760
Number nine,
he had great self command.

186
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.020
It cost him a great exertion sometimes and a constant constraint,

187
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.070
but to preserve so much equanimity as he did required a great capacity.

188
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.460
Number 10,
whenever he lost his temper,

189
00:10:38.461 --> 00:10:41.910
as he did sometimes either love or fear in those about him,

190
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.610
induced them to conceal his weakness from the world.

191
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.810
Here you see I've made out 10 talents without saying a word about reading,

192
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:53.580
thinking,
or writing.
Thank you John.
Adam.
Okay.

193
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:56.340
So he's being a little bit snarky in that letter.
Um,

194
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.590
saying that Washington looked like and behaved like a great leader and,

195
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:04.060
and who's from Virginia.
Um,
and so he was treated like a great leader.
Um,

196
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.420
there was actually some truth to what he's saying.

197
00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:11.130
I'm going to talk a little bit about that today.
Um,
and as Adam suggests,

198
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.150
it's true that Washington didn't have the same sort of formal education that

199
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:19.350
someone like Jefferson or Madison or even Adams had,

200
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.910
but he was more than a man who just looked the part.
Now,

201
00:11:23.911 --> 00:11:28.911
it is true that in some ways Washington was sort of like any other Virginia

202
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:33.630
gentlemen.
As Adam says,
he's a large land owner.

203
00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:37.140
He had inherited his estate,
Mount Vernon from his father,

204
00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:41.490
and then enlarged at himself like a lot of other Virginia gentleman.

205
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:46.470
He was a skilled horsemen,
which was very prized skill in Virginia.
Um,

206
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.550
you'll probably remember,

207
00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:50.840
or maybe might remember earlier in the course I talked about William Maclay

208
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.530
sitting next to a Virginia and at a dinner party and saying all they talked

209
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:57.970
about was cockfighting and horses and alcohol courses are in there in the top

210
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:02.710
three.
Um,
so horse being a,
a good horseman was very valued and Washington,

211
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:05.110
some called him like the finest horseman in the country.

212
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:08.980
So he was impressive as on the,
I think I'm going to mention,

213
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:12.550
I did mention last night at Mt.
Vernon when I saw him on that horse and said bye,

214
00:12:12.551 --> 00:12:13.480
he's impressive on the horse.

215
00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:16.140
And then basically repeated what I'd read a thousand times and everyone else has

216
00:12:16.141 --> 00:12:20.620
led is he really looked impressive on the words he did.
I can vouch,
um,

217
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.840
somewhat less impressed the expected one.
Um,
Washington was a good dancer.
Okay.

218
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.690
Things you never knew about George Washington.
He was a good dancer,

219
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.420
which sounds seemingly trivial,
but again,

220
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:36.280
as a gentleman generally and as a Virginian specifically being a good dancer is

221
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:40.810
a way,
another way sort of publicly displaying your superior breeding.

222
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.730
Adam's mentioned some grace,
dignity,

223
00:12:42.731 --> 00:12:46.660
all of these things that would make a gentleman noticeable and someone who would

224
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:48.460
seem to be superior.

225
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.550
Pantsing is one of them and luckily he's a good dancer and he liked dancing,

226
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:56.020
not the image we have of George also,
like other gentlemen of the time,

227
00:12:56.021 --> 00:12:57.100
Virginia and otherwise,

228
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.090
Washington was ambitious and this is going to come up again.

229
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.300
He doesn't necessarily always look ambitious,
but he was ambitious.

230
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.910
He did want to earn status and reputation.

231
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:11.140
He was ambitious to better himself during the French and Indian war.

232
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.820
He struggled to raise himself within the ranks of the army and for the entirety

233
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:20.410
of his life.
He was very focused on protecting and preserving his reputation.

234
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:24.310
He talks about it a lot when he makes a big decision about should I do this or

235
00:13:24.311 --> 00:13:25.121
should I not do this?

236
00:13:25.121 --> 00:13:29.680
It's clearly part of that decision is what will this do to my reputation?

237
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:34.690
And Alexander Hamilton who served in one way or another at Washington's side for

238
00:13:34.691 --> 00:13:39.130
many years versus an aid during the war and then as Washington's first secretary

239
00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:39.964
of the treasury,

240
00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.330
how has it is someone who really knew that if you want it to get Washington to

241
00:13:43.331 --> 00:13:46.780
do something,
you played the reputation card,
right?
Well,

242
00:13:46.781 --> 00:13:50.890
if you don't do this or it may affect your reputation,

243
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.900
say one way or another,
if it's might affect his reputation,

244
00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:58.700
Washington's going to take it very seriously.
So,
um,

245
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.770
he very much thought about what anything that he did would do to his reputation.

246
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:06.940
And what that actually means is when he does take these positions of great power

247
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:10.390
and responsibility,
he's earning reputation.
He's also risking reputation.

248
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:15.220
And I think he realizes both things,
but I'll come back to that momentarily.
Okay.

249
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:19.270
So a large landowner,
skilled horsemen,
the dancer,
ambitious,

250
00:14:19.271 --> 00:14:20.680
protective of his reputation.

251
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.370
All of these things would have been true of many gentlemen from throughout this

252
00:14:24.371 --> 00:14:25.204
period.

253
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.410
And plus of course this is obvious but worth stating because we forget it when

254
00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:32.380
we talk about Washington,
like any other gentleman of the period,

255
00:14:32.381 --> 00:14:37.330
Washington was human,
right?
He could be self interested,
he could be gloomy,

256
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.790
he could get excited.
Uh,

257
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.590
he was all of these things at various points during the war.
And after,
um,

258
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.510
he sometimes doubted himself.
He got bored,

259
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.920
he got tired of all the pomp and ceremony that basically surrounded him for the

260
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.100
last 25 years of his life.
Um,
there's a story of him as president.

261
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.550
He really didn't like all the pumps running and was president.

262
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.280
And there's several stories actually more than once.

263
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.370
He was seeing giving like a ceremonial dinner as president,

264
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.820
sitting at the head of the table at this formal dinner,

265
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.560
staring into space instead of banging a piece of silverware on the table.
Like,

266
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.100
like,
so not wanting to be there.
We so uninterested,

267
00:15:18.101 --> 00:15:20.270
interested in what was going on.
Um,
again,

268
00:15:20.271 --> 00:15:25.271
he's all of these things including human as other gentlemen all were.

269
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.660
But there is something about Washington that was different and in a sense there

270
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:34.661
had to be something different to put him in the exalted position of being quite

271
00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:38.780
literally as one of his friends said at his death,
first in war,

272
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.810
first in peace,
and first in the hearts of his countrymen.

273
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:47.540
So how can we explain the phenomenon of George Washington and what I'm going to

274
00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:51.080
talk about here?
And the answer basically is it is an answer with three parts.

275
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:57.350
The first part as we're about to see has to do with Washington personally.

276
00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:03.220
He's a man who was extremely skilled at shaping his public image at controlling

277
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:08.900
himself and presenting to the world what he wanted them to see related to that.

278
00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:10.250
So part of that same thing,

279
00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:14.960
he was very skilled at sizing up a situation and figuring out just what sort of

280
00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:17.090
statement or action it required.

281
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.980
He was often a really brilliant political strategist and a lot of people during

282
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.980
his lifetime and after praised his good judgment he had,

283
00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.320
that's always the word they use.
He had good judgment.

284
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.580
He was someone who could survey the opinions of lots of people,

285
00:16:31.581 --> 00:16:35.420
ask all of his advisors for advice.
They often more than often than not,

286
00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:38.060
had conflicting advice.
He would take it under advisement.

287
00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:39.350
He considered things for himself.

288
00:16:39.351 --> 00:16:42.770
He'd come to a conclusion and he'd act on it in a way that everyone always

289
00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:47.030
thought was calm,
considered thoughtful.

290
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:51.020
He was someone who had good judgment and didn't act impulsively.

291
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.250
So one reason for the phenomenon of Washington,

292
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.470
as I'll talk about in a moment here,

293
00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:02.240
has to do with his self presentation and concrete skills and presenting himself

294
00:17:02.241 --> 00:17:03.074
as a leader.

295
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:08.630
The second way in which he earned his reputation has to do really with the

296
00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:13.190
simple fact that he's the right person with the right talents,
the right place,

297
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.650
the right time.
You know,

298
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.770
people often when they look at this time period and one way or another,

299
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.660
they asked the question,
well why in this period where there's so many great men?

300
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.720
Like what was it about this period that you have Washington,
Jefferson,
Adams,

301
00:17:26.721 --> 00:17:28.280
Madison?
Why all then,

302
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.990
and I think part of the answer has to do with the right people in the right

303
00:17:32.991 --> 00:17:33.950
place at the right time.

304
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.580
I've talked earlier in the course about how as young men,

305
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.610
this is a generation of people who were trained by reading things like

306
00:17:40.611 --> 00:17:41.660
Plutarch's lives.

307
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.890
To think that one of the sort of Nobelists in grant is things you could ever do

308
00:17:45.891 --> 00:17:48.440
is to be the founder of a nation to be a great statesman.

309
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.440
So you'd have a generation of young men who are trained to think that that's

310
00:17:52.441 --> 00:17:57.030
true.
And then that generation happens to be there when there's a nation being

311
00:17:57.031 --> 00:18:00.450
founded,
right?
That's sort of a great for them,
it's great and they see that,

312
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:02.520
they understand,
my gosh,

313
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.830
this is the greatest thing I can do and I can do it.
Whew.

314
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.950
So you have these people who had somewhat limited horizons.
You know,

315
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.480
maybe they were going to be a lawyer or they would serve in public service in

316
00:18:15.481 --> 00:18:19.470
their own colony and suddenly the horizon opens and they're able to be nation

317
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.390
founders and they know it and they rise to the occasion to promote themselves.

318
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.480
And to do public good,
to do both things at the same time,

319
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.540
take advantage of the opportunity and act.

320
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.370
And so it's partly why so many great men.
It's,

321
00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.600
it's partly you have people who understand the significance of what's happening

322
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.900
and act in that capacity to do what they've been trained to think is good to do,

323
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:45.270
which is you.
You do great acts of service for your state,

324
00:18:45.271 --> 00:18:47.670
you become a great statesman,
any earn a mortal same.

325
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.490
So you do great things for your country and you get to be famous.

326
00:18:50.491 --> 00:18:51.990
They both happen sort of at the same time.

327
00:18:51.991 --> 00:18:55.140
So it's sort of selfless and self interested at the same time.

328
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.530
So Washington also,

329
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.610
like many people in this era is the right person with the right talent at the

330
00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:03.121
right time,

331
00:19:03.121 --> 00:19:07.290
but he has very specific talents that are really well suited to this moment in

332
00:19:07.291 --> 00:19:09.180
time.
And then finally,

333
00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:13.200
the third reason for the Washington phenomenon is kind of a combination of the

334
00:19:13.201 --> 00:19:14.040
previous two.

335
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.760
And that's basically the idea that during the prime years of Washington's life,

336
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:25.370
America's lost a king and needed some other figure of central importance to fill

337
00:19:27.031 --> 00:19:29.160
this vacuum of national leadership.

338
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.630
Some other leader who they could honor as sort of the symbolic core of their new

339
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:38.430
nation and Washington because of who he was because of who he presented himself

340
00:19:38.431 --> 00:19:40.530
as being because of what he did,

341
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:45.210
because of the ways in which he tried deliberately to conform with prevailing

342
00:19:45.211 --> 00:19:48.540
feelings about leadership and about doing things like leading armies.

343
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.200
He really ends up being the right man for that job.

344
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.570
So for all of those reasons,

345
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.640
Washington ends up being the father of his country even before the country is

346
00:19:59.641 --> 00:20:01.980
officially a country when it's still fighting it's war.

347
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.210
So let's turn out of those three reasons.
Let's start with reason number one,

348
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:11.240
which is Washington and self presentation.
And in a way this is along.

349
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.650
This is similar,
not only what Adam said,

350
00:20:13.651 --> 00:20:17.760
but you'll hear Adam's echoed in some of what I'm going to be talking about
here.

351
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.000
Now in a general way,

352
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:26.630
this is true that the Washington presented himself well as a leader and in a

353
00:20:27.121 --> 00:20:29.010
general way.
By that I mean in a very specific way.

354
00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:32.340
He just looked and acted like a commander in chief.

355
00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.930
He was a very tall and imposing physical presence.
He's a big man,

356
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.620
tall for the time,
also just apparently big bone.

357
00:20:40.621 --> 00:20:43.200
Then he just a big imposing figure,

358
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.800
very powerful looking who also managed to be graceful his movements,

359
00:20:47.801 --> 00:20:49.960
his Adam said.
So he's someone who's strong,
big,

360
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:54.310
powerful and also seems in command of himself physically.

361
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:58.780
So he was just imposing to look at,
that's a natural gift.

362
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:03.490
But Washington had other much more deliberate self conscious aspects.

363
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:08.490
If it's self presentation as a leader that really served him well and as Adam

364
00:21:08.531 --> 00:21:11.740
sort of hints,
one of them is his self control,

365
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:17.790
which was remarkable and he really was controlling his passions for most of the

366
00:21:19.301 --> 00:21:20.134
time.

367
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.550
Now I will say that any gentlemen of the period would have been expected to

368
00:21:24.551 --> 00:21:29.170
display like self command or self control as a sign of his superior character.

369
00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:31.810
And the ultimate example of that of course is dueling,

370
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.620
right gentlemen are the ones supposedly who do well in this time period and part

371
00:21:35.621 --> 00:21:38.470
of what you're doing when you do all is you're showing that you're willing to

372
00:21:38.471 --> 00:21:42.850
risk your life to defend your honor by standing on the field of honor against

373
00:21:42.851 --> 00:21:46.150
someone who is going to be shooting at you and you need to have complete self

374
00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:50.230
command and mastery of your passions and stand there just passionately allowing

375
00:21:50.231 --> 00:21:52.070
this other person to shoot at you.
Right?

376
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.670
That's the ultimate example of what they would have considered in this period to

377
00:21:54.671 --> 00:21:59.671
be gentlemanly self command or self control for Washington self command was

378
00:22:01.121 --> 00:22:03.460
particularly important because as Adam suggested,

379
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.250
he really did have a pretty impressive temper.

380
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:08.770
He kept it under control most of the time,

381
00:22:08.771 --> 00:22:12.250
but he did lose his temper on a number of occasions and the reason why we know

382
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:16.510
that is people who were there and saw it were very impressed and they usually

383
00:22:16.511 --> 00:22:18.370
wrote it down,
Ooh,

384
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.640
guess what happened today though?

385
00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:24.310
People tend to take note because it was impressive and scary.

386
00:22:24.311 --> 00:22:27.760
He's this big guy and he would just,
when he lost his temper,

387
00:22:27.761 --> 00:22:31.120
he really lost his temper.
Um,
a great example of it.

388
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.880
It happens a number of times through the revolution.

389
00:22:33.881 --> 00:22:37.840
And I actually went off looking to see if I could find a very specific example,

390
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:42.280
um,
couldn't find one that,
that I had enough specific information on to,
to offer.

391
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.340
So I'm going to offer this other one only because I have a quote associated with

392
00:22:45.341 --> 00:22:47.590
it and it's a story that always makes me happy.

393
00:22:47.591 --> 00:22:51.580
So even though it's from his presidency,
it's the same George.
Um,

394
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.280
there's an instance of Washington really,

395
00:22:54.281 --> 00:22:59.281
really just losing it during a cabinet meeting in which one of his cabinet

396
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.070
members came in with a cartoon from a newspaper making fun of Washington and

397
00:23:03.071 --> 00:23:06.220
Washington just lost it.
You know,
just,
he didn't like being president.

398
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:07.420
Everyone was making fun of him.

399
00:23:07.421 --> 00:23:10.450
He just lost control and literally like went into a screaming rent.

400
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.030
I never wanted this job.
I never wanted this job in a moment.

401
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.590
I took this job and I've never worn it.
Did any moments since,
I mean,

402
00:23:16.591 --> 00:23:19.530
just like screaming,
ranting.
We know this of course,

403
00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:23.040
because Thomas Jefferson took notes on it,
right?
Like you won't believe,

404
00:23:23.041 --> 00:23:24.600
and this is personal notes,
but he took,

405
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.760
he wrote down his version of what he heard.

406
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.300
But my favorite part is apparently this was a really impressive rent.

407
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.300
And in Jefferson's notes,
he,
he just,

408
00:23:33.301 --> 00:23:37.560
he describes the rand and then at the end of the rat he writes in his notes an

409
00:23:37.561 --> 00:23:39.060
awkward silence ensued

410
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.120
and then had some difficulty resuming our conversation.

411
00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:49.520
You could just here,
you can just,
you just sound like you're in the room.
Like,

412
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:53.480
okay,
now what do we do?
Can we go home?

413
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.990
You're scary,
George.
You scared us.
Okay.

414
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.960
So mastering your passions is vital for anyone to be a trusted and admired

415
00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:06.440
leader for Washington.
Get considering his temper.
It's very important.

416
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:10.340
And he did master his feelings,
his temper most of the time,

417
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.310
but he did more than just try not to display his temper.

418
00:24:13.311 --> 00:24:17.420
He actually tried to suppress any sign of his feelings.

419
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:21.590
He didn't want people to be able to read him.
He actually wanted to appear,
um,

420
00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:25.310
sort of dispassionate someone that you couldn't tell what he was thinking.

421
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.640
And he apparently did that reasonably well.

422
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.620
But also it's clear that he did it really,

423
00:24:30.621 --> 00:24:35.030
really deliberately because there's an account of someone who went to visit him

424
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.890
towards the end of his presidency and supposedly commented to Washington,
my sir,

425
00:24:39.891 --> 00:24:43.790
you look eager to get back to mount Vernon and Washington replied,
no,

426
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:48.290
my countenance never yet betrayed my feelings.
Right.
You don't know.

427
00:24:48.291 --> 00:24:50.210
I'm looking forward to getting back to mount Vernon.

428
00:24:50.211 --> 00:24:54.610
You can't tell what I'm feeling on my face.
Okay?
Yes sir.

429
00:24:55.790 --> 00:25:00.680
But clearly he's,
he's trying to present a version of himself probably,

430
00:25:00.681 --> 00:25:02.520
maybe successfully or not successfully,
but,

431
00:25:02.521 --> 00:25:06.050
but largely some of the times successfully as this sort of dispassionate in

432
00:25:06.051 --> 00:25:07.880
command and control kind of a leader.

433
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.110
He knew how to present and preserve his dignity.

434
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.980
And when you join that with his very imposing appearance,

435
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:20.990
his self command made him a rather intimidating figure.
He's someone who many,

436
00:25:20.991 --> 00:25:25.640
many people felt intimidated by great story that I have to tell.

437
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.790
I can't resist a good story.
Basically as I'm writing these lectures,
I'm like,
oh,

438
00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:33.090
this means I can tell this story.
And then I write it right into the lecture.
Um,

439
00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:37.370
this is just a famous example,
which will,
or a pseudo example,

440
00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:39.950
it may have happened.
It may not have happened,
but it's a famous story,

441
00:25:39.951 --> 00:25:42.890
which I'll tell anyway with the sort of provide though that maybe it didn't

442
00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:47.050
happen,
but maybe it did.
And it's when he's first president.

443
00:25:47.051 --> 00:25:50.450
It's just a great example of how everyone perceived him to be this imposing

444
00:25:50.451 --> 00:25:51.960
scary character.
Um,

445
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.680
there's some kind of a reception really early on when the government first gets

446
00:25:54.681 --> 00:25:58.730
underway and Washington's there and Alexander Hamilton is there and one of

447
00:25:58.731 --> 00:26:01.220
Hamilton's friends named Gouverneur Morris is there.

448
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.430
And Maurice and Hamilton always get each other into trouble because they have

449
00:26:04.431 --> 00:26:06.950
the same sense of humor and they're kind of practical jokers.

450
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:10.340
And it's just a bad thing if the two of them are together,
bad things happen.

451
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.220
So this is a great occasion of that in which Hamilton says,
Tamara's,

452
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:15.830
I'll bet you a dinner.

453
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:21.470
You don't dare go up to Washington and slap him on the back and say,

454
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:26.510
damn good to see you,
sir.
You don't dare touch him.
Right.

455
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.110
You go touch it off,
but you had dinner.
You don't dare.
Right.
Ridiculous.

456
00:26:30.111 --> 00:26:34.430
But as apparently takes up,
the bet goes up to Washington,

457
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.960
passed them on the back.
Yeah.

458
00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:40.961
I'm good to see you general and later reports the look that he got from

459
00:26:41.031 --> 00:26:43.380
Washington at imposing in way.

460
00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:47.380
He said he just wanted the floor to open up so he could just go through like,

461
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.330
and he is supposedly went back to Hamilton and said,
yeah,
I won the bet.

462
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.690
Not Worth it.
Really not worth it.

463
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.300
He's just this imposing figure.

464
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.350
During the war on many occasions,

465
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.500
he actually really had to be an imposing figure,

466
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:09.450
not just for reasons of concrete military success,
which is true.

467
00:27:09.451 --> 00:27:10.590
He did for that reason,

468
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:15.860
but also because he individually personified the revolutionary cause in many

469
00:27:16.111 --> 00:27:20.670
ways,
including to the British,
not just his own men,

470
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.400
but to the British as well,
to British military authorities.

471
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:28.320
He had to be imposing enough to command respect from people who are not

472
00:27:28.321 --> 00:27:32.700
necessarily prepared to see him as the commanding general of a real army.

473
00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.710
And as an example of this,

474
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.910
one of the sort of war games that the British occasionally deployed against

475
00:27:38.911 --> 00:27:43.911
Washington was to address things to him in writing by an a civilian title to

476
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.450
George Washington Esquire rather than General George Washington.
Right.

477
00:27:48.451 --> 00:27:50.490
Doing that really deliberately.
Yeah.
Okay.

478
00:27:50.491 --> 00:27:52.320
We're going to be respectful of George Washington,
Esquire,

479
00:27:52.321 --> 00:27:55.440
but you're not really a general,
and that's not a real army is the implication.

480
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:59.670
So on one occasion,
British General Howe addresses a letter to Washington,

481
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.670
George Washington,
Esquire,
Washington sees this,

482
00:28:02.671 --> 00:28:06.360
gets the letter and refuses to accept it and sends it back not addressed to me.

483
00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:11.070
Okay,
so then how readdress it and this time he says to George Washington,

484
00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.810
Escoffier,
et Cetera,
et Cetera,

485
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:19.080
this gets sent along with an aide back to Washington and Washington ashore,

486
00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.380
the aid of shores,
Washington,
that quote,
the etc. Etc.

487
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:25.230
Implied everything that ought to follow.
Right.

488
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:29.130
He may not have said General Washington,
but he etc means he was thinking it.

489
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.970
That's pretty feeble.
Washington says it's true that etc,

490
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:38.040
etc. And fly to everything and they also implied anything and he refuses to

491
00:28:38.041 --> 00:28:41.550
accept it.
Again,
like this is not addressed to me.
And He sends it back,

492
00:28:41.551 --> 00:28:46.320
which takes some fortitude to be sort of standing there handing back this piece

493
00:28:46.321 --> 00:28:50.700
of paper multiple times to this person.
I'm this age,
June general.

494
00:28:50.701 --> 00:28:52.490
How um,

495
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:57.530
supposedly someone who was there said that the aide had quote a pleasing

496
00:28:57.661 --> 00:28:59.400
confusion on him the whole time.
Right?

497
00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:03.120
He just didn't know what to do because he just didn't expect to confront this

498
00:29:03.121 --> 00:29:06.570
figure who would just stand there and say,
no,
you don't respect me.

499
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.000
I don't accept it.
Now what are you going to do?

500
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.720
So completely put him on the defensive,
this,
this poor British aid.

501
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:16.410
And he had to sort of go back and sort of figure out what to do so that they

502
00:29:16.411 --> 00:29:18.930
could address him in some way that he would actually read the letter.

503
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:23.220
He had to be someone who could maintain his dignity and maintain his position,

504
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:27.960
not just to command an army,
but also to command the respect of the enemy.

505
00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.650
So clearly he's an imposing figure and he had to be.

506
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.380
But there's an important point to make here.

507
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:39.360
And that is Washington combined that imposing demeanor with something that was

508
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:39.811
equally,

509
00:29:39.811 --> 00:29:44.811
if not more important for him to display as a leader in the new nation.

510
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:47.890
And it's particularly a military leader in the new nation.

511
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.940
And that is that he had a modest demeanor.
He was imposing,

512
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.750
but he did not look like someone who was grasping for power.

513
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.600
He knew how to display himself to his best advantage,

514
00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:03.610
but he wasn't all pomp and show and display.
He was the opposite.
He was modest,

515
00:30:03.611 --> 00:30:05.290
he was cool,
he was reserved.

516
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:10.090
And this was really important in the new American nation for some very good

517
00:30:10.091 --> 00:30:10.481
reasons,

518
00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:15.481
which had to do with distrust of power in many ways as we've seen in this course

519
00:30:16.511 --> 00:30:17.344
so far,

520
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:21.910
the events leading up to the revolution had confirmed Americans worst fears

521
00:30:21.911 --> 00:30:25.810
about tyranny and power to Americans.
First Parliament.

522
00:30:25.811 --> 00:30:30.670
And then the king had become tyrannical and had used their power to destroy the

523
00:30:30.671 --> 00:30:35.350
liberties of American colonists.
So now enter George Washington,

524
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.150
who was given command of the American army.

525
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.390
And as you've already seen and discussed in the course,

526
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.130
one of the most obvious and deadly tools of tyranny is a standing army.

527
00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:49.450
And history had plenty of Zap of examples of what happens when the wrong man

528
00:30:49.451 --> 00:30:51.070
gets control of an army.

529
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.710
And of course the most famous example would be Julius Caesar.

530
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:58.750
And in Caesar you have this brilliant warrior who's army was loyal to him and

531
00:30:58.751 --> 00:31:01.810
not to the Roman state.
And eventually Caesar took his army,

532
00:31:01.811 --> 00:31:03.670
marched on Rome seized power,

533
00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.240
basically destroyed the Roman republic and installed himself as emperor.

534
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:12.070
That's not ancient history to Americans or to anyone in the period.

535
00:31:12.071 --> 00:31:13.510
That's a lesson.
That's a warning.

536
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:17.590
Look at what happens when ambitious men get military power.

537
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.810
You get dictatorship,
you get tyranny,

538
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:24.550
you get all of the things that Americans certainly are afraid might happen and

539
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.560
things are in flux,
they might happen.

540
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:32.210
So here we have Washington taking command of an organized,

541
00:31:32.211 --> 00:31:34.720
or I suppose you could say semi organized army,

542
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:38.650
frightening concept and certainly a really tricky situation for the person

543
00:31:38.651 --> 00:31:41.890
taking command of an army in that kind of an atmosphere.

544
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:47.080
So creating a small r Republican Army is a tricky thing.

545
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:50.470
That kind of an army.
It certainly,
it has to be disciplined,

546
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.150
but it can't seem like this polished professional fighting force because that

547
00:31:55.151 --> 00:31:58.330
moves off into the territory of wait a minute,
is it detached from the state?

548
00:31:58.331 --> 00:32:02.560
I mean what is this?
Is this some private Washington and army?

549
00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:08.010
It has to seem able to be sort of submissive to the state and yet able to fight

550
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.273
and defend.

551
00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:14.340
It has to be really careful balance between having power but not having too much

552
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:15.011
power,

553
00:32:15.011 --> 00:32:17.830
being able to do what it's supposed to do but not being able to seemingly to do

554
00:32:17.831 --> 00:32:20.290
it without any other authority of any kind.

555
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:24.190
And this is Washington's task he has to create.

556
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:29.020
It's really difficult to define thing a Republican Army and we've already seen

557
00:32:29.021 --> 00:32:32.590
how hard it would have been just generally to create an army out of people from

558
00:32:32.591 --> 00:32:33.820
all of these different colonies.

559
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:36.910
And then finally all of these different states who don't necessarily see eye to

560
00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:39.290
eye and they haven't worked together before and they care more about their

561
00:32:39.291 --> 00:32:40.760
locality then about anywhere else.

562
00:32:40.761 --> 00:32:43.820
So there are all these basic logistical problems with the army.

563
00:32:43.821 --> 00:32:46.220
Now add this one into the mix,
right,

564
00:32:46.221 --> 00:32:48.440
which is an army is something people are very,

565
00:32:48.441 --> 00:32:52.490
very nervous about and now he's going to be the guy who's taking command of it.

566
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:58.520
Now,
Washington was really aware of all of these prevailing fears about power,

567
00:32:58.521 --> 00:33:00.260
hungry tyrants and armies.

568
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:05.620
So he did literally everything that he could do to prove to Americans inside the

569
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:09.200
continental Congress and outside of the continental congress that he was not

570
00:33:09.201 --> 00:33:13.910
seeking power.
Rather he was accepting power.
It was being given to him,

571
00:33:13.911 --> 00:33:17.610
but he was not seeking it.
And here you can see his,

572
00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:21.470
his good judgment as well as his skillful self presentation in play.

573
00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:26.450
He's really sensitive to these prevailing fears and he's really skilled at

574
00:33:26.451 --> 00:33:28.370
appeasing them.
So for example,

575
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:32.300
listen to what he says in his address to the continental Congress after he's

576
00:33:32.301 --> 00:33:35.750
nominated as commander in chief of the continental army.
Okay,
this is,

577
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:37.250
this is his address.
He makes it very brief,

578
00:33:37.251 --> 00:33:39.020
addressed a statement to the congress.

579
00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:43.430
Though I am truly sensible of the high honor done me in this appointment.

580
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:47.660
Yet I feel great distress from a consciousness that my abilities and military

581
00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:51.590
experience may not be equal to the extensive and important trust.
However,

582
00:33:51.591 --> 00:33:52.850
as the congress desire it,

583
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:57.650
I will enter upon the momentous duty and exert every power I possess and the

584
00:33:57.651 --> 00:33:59.870
service and for support of the glorious cause.

585
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.030
I bet they will accept my most cordial.

586
00:34:02.031 --> 00:34:04.790
Thanks for this distinguished testimony of their approbation,

587
00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.820
but less some unlucky event should happen.

588
00:34:07.821 --> 00:34:10.400
Unfavorable to my reputation I bake.

589
00:34:10.401 --> 00:34:14.390
It may be remembered by every gentleman in the room that I this day declare with

590
00:34:14.391 --> 00:34:15.530
the utmost sincerity.

591
00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:19.670
I do not think myself equal to the command I am honored with.
Okay.

592
00:34:19.671 --> 00:34:22.340
He's just been given the command of the army and he says,
I'm going to do it.

593
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.820
I'm going to try my hardest.
I don't think I'm up to the task.

594
00:34:25.821 --> 00:34:30.770
I don't think I'm good enough for this,
but I'm going to try my hardest.
Now,

595
00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:34.370
given that I've already described how he showed up to the congress in a military

596
00:34:34.371 --> 00:34:37.610
uniform,
basically saying,
hi,
I want this position.

597
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:42.080
Certainly he's not,
he was,
he was not someone who was going to look away.

598
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:46.330
He wanted this position of being commander in chief of the army,
um,

599
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:49.490
and even stands up and announced is,
I don't think I'm good enough for this,

600
00:34:49.491 --> 00:34:53.240
which might lead you to assume that it's an empty platitude,
but it really isn't.

601
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:57.050
It's the absolute perfect thing for someone in that position to say at that

602
00:34:57.051 --> 00:35:00.530
moment because it reassured people this is very explicitly what he was doing.

603
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:05.720
He's not an ambitious tyrant in the making and it did contain some truth because

604
00:35:05.721 --> 00:35:09.320
the fact of the matter is he wanted the position and he was honestly fearful.

605
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:12.620
You heard him say that if some bad thing happens to my reputation,

606
00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:17.480
his reputation,
he does truly fear that maybe he isn't up to the test.

607
00:35:17.481 --> 00:35:20.390
It seems pretty enormous and who knows what's going to happen.

608
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:24.530
So he had his also expressing a sincere concern is sincere fear.

609
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:29.630
In that same statement to Congress,
he goes on to do brilliant thing number two.

610
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.240
Again,
another example of his good judgment.

611
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:37.260
He announces that he will serve without pay as proof that he does not want to

612
00:35:37.261 --> 00:35:40.100
make any kind of profit from his service,
that he,

613
00:35:40.101 --> 00:35:44.370
he wants no financial benefit for what he's doing for his country.
Again,

614
00:35:44.371 --> 00:35:45.690
really brilliant thing to do.

615
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:50.490
Now of course he also says he's going to keep an exact account of his expenses,

616
00:35:50.491 --> 00:35:51.750
right?
He doesn't want to get a salary,

617
00:35:51.751 --> 00:35:54.510
but he will charge congress for his expenses.

618
00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:00.140
And there's an amazing book titled George Washington's Expense Account by Marvin

619
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.150
Kidman that looks at what Washington was actually charging the congress for.

620
00:36:03.151 --> 00:36:07.830
So it's not as though he was spending a lot out of pocket.
He,
he,

621
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.150
he did keep a careful account of all of his expenses as commander in chief.

622
00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:16.170
But again,
that's a pretty significant statement to make.

623
00:36:16.171 --> 00:36:20.790
People noticed it at the time and commented on it and slot the symbolism in it

624
00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:24.540
and the meaning of it and commented just in the way that he would've hoped

625
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.100
people would have done.
I mean,

626
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:29.730
he really wanted to make a certain impact and he did.
So,
for example,

627
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:33.660
here is John Adams at the time,
not afterwards with his 10 talents,

628
00:36:33.661 --> 00:36:38.040
but at the time he says there's something charming to me in the conduct of

629
00:36:38.041 --> 00:36:41.970
Washington,
a gentleman of one of the first fortunes upon the continent,

630
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:46.500
leaving his delicious retirement has family and friends sacrificing his ease and

631
00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:50.460
hazarding all in the cause of his country.
His views are noble and disinterested.

632
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:53.820
He declared when he accepted the mighty trust that he would lay before us an

633
00:36:53.821 --> 00:36:58.500
exact account of his expenses and not accept a shilling for pay or as another

634
00:36:58.501 --> 00:36:59.370
congressman put it,

635
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:03.900
let our youth look up to this man as a pattern to for themselves by who unites

636
00:37:03.901 --> 00:37:08.160
the bravery of the soldier with the most consummate modesty and virtue.
Yeah,

637
00:37:08.161 --> 00:37:11.010
that's exactly the point that he's trying to make,
right?

638
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.520
That I'm going to take this,
this large command that I,

639
00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:17.010
I'm not looking personally to profit by it and there we have witnesses that are

640
00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:20.760
exactly getting that message.
Shortly thereafter,

641
00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:23.940
he made yet another symbolic gesture and another example of the way in which

642
00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:26.580
he's so good at appeasing people's fears.

643
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:30.510
He gets a letter from the New York provincial congress when they're a little

644
00:37:30.511 --> 00:37:34.350
nervous passage in it,
reminding him that when the war ends,

645
00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:38.280
he's expected to resign his position and return to civilian life.
Okay.

646
00:37:38.281 --> 00:37:40.400
So this is a little nervous letter from New York saying,
um,

647
00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.410
please don't be a military dictator after the war.

648
00:37:43.411 --> 00:37:45.540
Sincerely the or provincial congress.
It's like,

649
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.450
I dunno know what they thought they would accomplish with that letter.
Um,

650
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.720
but it's a valid fear.
It's one that many people had.
And again,

651
00:37:51.721 --> 00:37:55.500
Washington responds with a sort of model reply.
He says,

652
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:56.730
when we assume the soldier,

653
00:37:56.731 --> 00:38:00.330
we did not lay aside the citizen and we shall most sincerely rejoice with you.

654
00:38:00.331 --> 00:38:03.780
And that happy hour when the establishment of American liberty shell enabled us

655
00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:06.480
to return to our private stations and the bosom of a free,

656
00:38:06.481 --> 00:38:07.740
peaceful and happy country,

657
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:11.730
exactly what people would have wanted and military leader to say,

658
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:15.390
I look forward to the end of the war were I and everyone else can all go home

659
00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.850
and have army and of power.

660
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:22.650
And that letter and the New York letter that called it forth are both published

661
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.760
in newspapers around the colonies in both of these actions,

662
00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:31.761
Washington is styling himself after the sort of Republican ideal of a leader,

663
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.650
right?
Someone who's public minded,
he's self sacrificing,
he's virtuous,

664
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:40.690
he's devoted to his country.
Um,
there is a play at the time,
um,

665
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.450
by British writer Joseph Addison titled Cato,

666
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.760
which is based on the life of Cato,

667
00:38:45.761 --> 00:38:49.570
the younger who defended room and Roman virtues against the tyrant Caesar.

668
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.560
And that was highly popular in America at this time.
And not surprisingly,

669
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:57.160
it's Washington's favorite play.
Washington has it performed for the troops.

670
00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:00.760
It's reprinted again and again and again in Revolutionary America.

671
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:03.850
And Nathan Hale's famous last words I regret that I have,

672
00:39:03.851 --> 00:39:07.510
but one life to live for my country are adapted from that play.

673
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.020
That's the sort of ideal that Washington's trying to live up to.

674
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.240
And any wise man,

675
00:39:13.241 --> 00:39:16.800
assuming a position of leadership and particularly military leadership would

676
00:39:16.801 --> 00:39:21.640
have done the same thing.
Modesty,
self sacrifice,
not lusting for power.

677
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:27.090
The best way to be trusted and beloved as a leader was to modestly surrender

678
00:39:27.701 --> 00:39:30.820
power again and again and people would then be sure to come back and offer you

679
00:39:30.821 --> 00:39:32.500
more.
Now,

680
00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:35.860
it's worth mentioning at this point that maybe the most famous thing that

681
00:39:35.861 --> 00:39:38.770
Washington ever did is right along these lines.

682
00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:43.120
The most famous thing that he did at the time is at the close of the war,

683
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:44.890
the war is over.
He has one,

684
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:48.580
he has an army at his command and what does he do?

685
00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:52.060
He resigned his commission and goes home,
period.

686
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.330
That was literally world shaking in its impact.

687
00:39:55.331 --> 00:39:58.450
It is not what people thought would happen.
At the end of the war.

688
00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:03.560
You have a victorious general and an army.
People assume what happens now.

689
00:40:03.561 --> 00:40:06.070
It was at that victorious general,
General takes power.

690
00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.230
Washington literally just said,

691
00:40:08.231 --> 00:40:11.110
thank you very much and went back to mount Vernon.
End of story.

692
00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:15.490
It was noticed the world over it was had such an impact.

693
00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:20.520
It literally insured that Washington would be the one man most trusted with

694
00:40:20.801 --> 00:40:25.630
power forever after because he had given that supreme example of giving it up.

695
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:29.920
He had said at the moment where everyone expected him to keep it.
No,

696
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.510
I'm giving it right back.

697
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:34.720
That's why he ends up being the one guy who could have been president because he

698
00:40:34.721 --> 00:40:38.260
proved in two Americans at the time,
the ultimate way possible.

699
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:40.300
He was not hungry for power.

700
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:45.310
Supposedly at the time when King George heard that this is what was going to

701
00:40:45.311 --> 00:40:47.500
happen,
that Washington was just going to resign and go home.

702
00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.040
It's supposedly his response was that if Washington did do that quote,

703
00:40:51.041 --> 00:40:52.960
he would be the greatest man in the world.

704
00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:58.270
That's the king saying the impact of that will be enormous.

705
00:40:58.271 --> 00:40:59.380
If he's actually going to do that,

706
00:40:59.381 --> 00:41:04.150
the king doesn't even really believe he will if he actually does that,
that's,

707
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:07.750
that's an incredible act.
He will be the greatest man in the world.

708
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:13.240
So one historian has said basically George Washington was a virtuoso of

709
00:41:13.241 --> 00:41:17.470
resignations.
He perfected the art of getting power by giving it away.

710
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.980
In a sense.
That's true.
It's not that he's being devious.

711
00:41:20.981 --> 00:41:24.130
It's not that he sort of pretending to be modest because he wants power.

712
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:27.370
It's that he understands people's fears.

713
00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:30.040
It's that he's serving in positions that he wants to serve,

714
00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:34.220
and he then also understands that his job after serving in them is to step away

715
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:38.060
and allow future responsibility to be given to him.
Again,

716
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:43.010
he maintains this sort of ideal balance between ambition and modesty and it's

717
00:41:43.011 --> 00:41:47.810
this ideal and sort of really necessary balance in America at the time where

718
00:41:47.811 --> 00:41:52.280
people were so scared of power standing armies,
monarchs,

719
00:41:52.281 --> 00:41:53.450
tyrants,
dictators,

720
00:41:53.451 --> 00:41:56.690
all of these things sort of looming in Washington ends up in one way or another,

721
00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:00.110
proving again and again that he isn't any of those things.

722
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:04.250
And as for all of these reasons why,
when King George,

723
00:42:04.251 --> 00:42:06.020
the third finally is let go of,
right?

724
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.080
I've talked in the past about how Americans first or upset with parliament and

725
00:42:09.081 --> 00:42:12.440
then finally they're upset with the king and it's a slow process of American

726
00:42:12.441 --> 00:42:16.310
sort of divorcing themselves from their love and loyalty for England when they

727
00:42:16.311 --> 00:42:20.030
finally let go of the king.
It makes sense given everything that I've just said,

728
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:24.590
that Washington is the logical person who fills that vacuum of the sort of

729
00:42:24.591 --> 00:42:28.070
symbolic leader who's going to represent America,

730
00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:31.610
who's going to be the sort of core symbolic leader of America.

731
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:34.520
Very early on in the war,

732
00:42:34.521 --> 00:42:38.210
people begin to substitute George Washington for King George and ceremonies and

733
00:42:38.211 --> 00:42:43.100
rituals as early as 1778 Washington.
It's called the father of his country,

734
00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:44.720
Washington's birthday.

735
00:42:44.721 --> 00:42:49.721
And not the king's is celebrated as early as 1779 so literally he's just paying,

736
00:42:51.171 --> 00:42:53.990
substituted right in.
It's like,
well,
we lost that symbolic figure.

737
00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.100
Here's a new George,
we'll just put him right in.

738
00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:01.520
We have a new leader and he's virtuous and he's not ambitious and he's a good

739
00:43:01.521 --> 00:43:02.370
Republican leaders,

740
00:43:02.371 --> 00:43:06.650
so we can actually celebrate him and we want him to be a sort of symbolic center

741
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:11.000
of the American cause.
Okay.
So I have two minutes to conclude here.

742
00:43:11.001 --> 00:43:12.860
What have we seen today?
Um,

743
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:16.460
we've certainly seen how Washington looked and acted the part of the ideal

744
00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:17.450
Republican leader.

745
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:21.710
We've seen how and why this was so important to Americans and revolutionary and

746
00:43:21.711 --> 00:43:25.700
early National America.
They have really good reasons to be scared,

747
00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:30.560
suspicious about power and who had it.
And Washington proved again and again,

748
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:35.660
he was the ideal person to trust with power.
He understood prevailing fears.

749
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.240
He addressed himself to calming those fears,

750
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:43.220
insincere ways in his manner and his actions and his self presentation.

751
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:48.110
Yet also managing to remain an imposing leader throughout.

752
00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:52.160
It was a really difficult balance I think for anyone to maintain.

753
00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:56.210
And in many ways it's why he really is the right man with the right skills and

754
00:43:56.211 --> 00:43:57.620
the right place at the right time.

755
00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:02.780
He's a guy who manages to maintain that difficult balance,
to command an army,

756
00:44:02.781 --> 00:44:05.300
to sort of be a symbolic center of a new nation,

757
00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.170
to allow for the fact that he's ambitious,
but to not seem too ambitious,

758
00:44:09.171 --> 00:44:14.090
to not seem desirous of power.
It's a really,
really tricky thing to carry off.

759
00:44:14.091 --> 00:44:16.260
And Washington actually did.
Um,

760
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.370
which is kind of remarkable and granted there moments probably what he did it

761
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.380
better than others,
but in the end,

762
00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:24.950
it's his ability to maintain that kind of balance that made him the perfect

763
00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.120
figure for that moment in time and for serving the role that he served in the

764
00:44:29.121 --> 00:44:31.880
revolution.
Okay.
On that,
I will conclude,

765
00:44:31.881 --> 00:44:35.120
we will move on on Thursday to watching Washington in action.

766
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:39.050
As we begin to look at how the war is unfolding on the field of battle.
