1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.880
So we are now post mid term.

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.420
You've gotten past the midterm.
This is excellent.
Um,

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.980
and what I wanted that the lecture I'm going to give today is actually titled

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.050
Heroes and villains.

5
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.750
And I'm going to explain what that means in just a few minutes.

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:22.800
I'm going to segue from just touching on one or two of the things that I talked

7
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:27.450
about at the end of the last lecture.
Segwaying right into this lecture.

8
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.480
Um,
and hopefully you remember that right before the midterm,

9
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:32.400
the last lecture I gave,
um,

10
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.420
I was talking about the process of organizing a war and I talked about some of

11
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:41.910
the problems that the continental congress had in dealing with the continental

12
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:42.744
army.

13
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.930
And I at least referred to some of the ways in which these problems can't do

14
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:49.141
that.

15
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:54.141
Larger problems with unity between the newly created American States.

16
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.951
So for example,

17
00:00:55.951 --> 00:01:00.060
I talked about regionalism and I talked about some of the ways in which

18
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:04.170
regionalism complicated the task of organizing the continental army.

19
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.611
For example,

20
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:10.440
things like considering how to balance positions as military command between

21
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:15.441
northerners and southerners or getting units from one region of the country to

22
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.820
deal with units from another region of the country are getting soldiers from

23
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:25.821
different regions as well as individual soldiers to agree to sacrifice for the

24
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:30.120
common good throughout the entire confederation of states instead of thinking

25
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:34.920
about their own state or their own locality above all else.

26
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.410
And I also talked about a related problem and I called that the problem with

27
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:45.411
localism and I talked about how a localized view of the world or certainly a

28
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:51.210
localized view of the new states worked against centralized control.

29
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:56.211
So localities of all sorts had difficulty surrendering local control to some

30
00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:02.190
kind of a central organization like the Continental Congress,

31
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.470
which obviously had to equip the army.

32
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.070
And thus that raised all kinds of other complications and problems.

33
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.210
Each state wanted to maintain control,
for example,
of its own militia.

34
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.730
And then finally at the very end of the lecture I mentioned that many people who

35
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:22.731
would end up being strong nationalists in the seventies eighties and in the 1719

36
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.710
people who were going to end up being at the forefront of the movement to

37
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:31.410
strengthen the articles of confederation.

38
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.870
Many of these people gained their political beliefs in the need for some kind of

39
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:41.871
a stronger centralized national government from their experiences during the

40
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:43.261
revolution,

41
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:47.640
from their experiences with what often felt like what Alexander Hamilton called

42
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.460
an imbecilic centralized government.

43
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.090
That was his word that he applied to the continental Congress imbecilic.

44
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.290
So basically looking at the army and then looking at Congress,

45
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.830
we see regionalism and localism both working against centralized control and

46
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:04.840
coordination.

47
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.200
We see a lack of precedent for centralized governance of this kind,

48
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.100
which led to some confusion.

49
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.050
And certainly it made it possible for any important decision that had to do with

50
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:18.190
centralized power,

51
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.930
having seemingly enough importance to make it earth shaking.

52
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:26.650
And this seemingly trivial things ended up seeming to have huge importance

53
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:29.620
because they might set a precedent again,

54
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:32.710
all of this working against effectiveness.

55
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.310
So all of these things complicated the creation,

56
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.760
not just of a continental army but also a first colonial unity and then American

57
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:47.671
unity and this we're going to see in weeks to come ultimately constitutional

58
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.930
unity.
We're going to see this,

59
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.900
this sort of concern and confusion and these complications of centralized power

60
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.390
coming up again and again this semester,

61
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:02.410
particularly at the beginning of April when we begin to talk about the articles

62
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:07.240
of confederation and people really debating about what's the best form of

63
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:10.240
government for these new states to unite under,

64
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.120
so these ideas,

65
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:17.590
things like regionalism and things like localism and how they complicated the

66
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.600
army and also centralized power.

67
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.920
Those things are actually gonna come up in today's lecture,
which as I said,

68
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:27.690
I titled Heroes and Villains and when I'm really going to be doing it.

69
00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:28.241
Today's lecture,

70
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:31.270
it's a different kind of lecture from ones that I've given before.

71
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.711
Happily for you,

72
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:35.770
it's a lecture that will probably require you to take less notes.

73
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.520
Then you typically take an electric for this course because what I'm going to
do,

74
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:44.521
it's kind of use a case study to look up close at just a handful of people and a

75
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:50.461
series of events as a way of exploring some of the ideas that we've been talking

76
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:53.320
about.
Generally ideas about the congress,

77
00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:58.321
ideas about the army and how they actually played out in a few individual lives.

78
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.350
So what we're going to see in the course of today's lecture,

79
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:04.450
which in a way is one big story,

80
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.930
is some of the complications inherent and how the continental Congress handled

81
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.810
the continental army.
We're going to see a very specific example of that.

82
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.640
We're going to see regionalism making trouble in the continental army.

83
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.210
We're going to see how serving in the army affected,

84
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.520
in the case of today's lecture,
several people's lives in a really direct way.

85
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.210
And then on a broader scale by looking at this one story which is intertwined

86
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:37.900
with the actions of the continental army and what it meant to this handful of

87
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:38.620
lives,

88
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.620
we're also going to see some broader truths about American society at the time.

89
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:45.790
So we're going to see,
for example,

90
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:49.060
how the army was an outlet for personal ambitions,

91
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.610
how people maybe tried to use service in the army as a way to promote themselves

92
00:05:53.611 --> 00:05:54.970
and things that I've mentioned before.

93
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.800
We're going to see how living at a time war,

94
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.420
open paths for people that might not otherwise have existed.

95
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.110
We're going to see the sometimes slippery status of women during a time of war

96
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.290
and we're going to see how many Americans still revered some British cultural

97
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:18.800
ideals even in the midst of a war against Britain.

98
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.960
And the story that I'm going to use today,

99
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:24.590
this sort of case study that's going to help us delve into all of these things

100
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.360
is the story of Benedict Arnold,
Peggy Shippen,
Arnold and John Andre.

101
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.680
All of these people,
all three of these people in one way or another,

102
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.370
attempted to use the war and its armies to make,

103
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.550
or I guess maybe more accurately to unmake themselves and their reputations and

104
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:45.260
one way or another,
all of them.

105
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:49.190
We're trying to better themselves through the opportunities of warfare.

106
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.640
Now before we launch into that case study,

107
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.970
I just want to talk for a moment about why warfare created such opportunities

108
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.210
for potentially raising a person's social status and thus why some people were

109
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:07.880
actually eager for wars.
Now,

110
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.060
in some of the early lectures for this course,

111
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.280
I discussed social status in the colonies and I talked a little bit about how

112
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.990
society and the colonies,

113
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:22.991
while it certainly did have an elite sort of gentlemanly rank of people,

114
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.570
that overall American society tended to be more middling than English society,

115
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:33.911
which did have an entrenched aristocratic class in America.

116
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.590
If you wanted to have gentlemanly status,

117
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.250
and in a sense it was more difficult to be born into it and the way that you

118
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.780
could have in a European nation,

119
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.940
there were actually a limited number of pathways that were open to you to

120
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:48.740
achieve that kind of a status.
Basically,

121
00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:52.490
there were a handful of professions that were assumed in this period to be

122
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:57.020
gentlemanly.
These included medicine,
the law,

123
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.470
the ministry,
the church,
um,

124
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.070
perhaps being a merchant that was wealthy enough that you didn't seem to be

125
00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:04.910
grubbing for money,

126
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:08.460
that you seem to be living happily off your vast sums of money.
Um,

127
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:13.510
maybe someone who owned a really sizable plantation or serving as an officer in

128
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:20.140
an army and I was sort of unsure what to do with college professors near and

129
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:23.900
dear to my heart.
I decided I would not officially put them on the list,

130
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:27.290
although many college professors in this period would have been in the clergy.

131
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.940
Certainly some of them would have been lawyers.

132
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:32.180
So I think they would have generally fallen into the gentlemanly rank.
But I'm,

133
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.460
I'm,
I'm being unbiased here,
so I'm,

134
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:37.460
I'm leaving college professors over here somewhere.
Okay.

135
00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:41.790
So of all of those positions that I've just named being a military officer,

136
00:08:41.791 --> 00:08:45.800
serving as an officer in an army,
but particularly during a time of war,

137
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.570
offered the greatest chance for instant glory,
instant status,

138
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.550
instant rank through bravery,

139
00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:57.551
and displays a valor on the battlefield for the very ambitious or for people who

140
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:02.820
had a problematic social rank for one reason or another,

141
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:08.010
a war could be a great opportunity for you to improve your place in the world,

142
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.740
particularly in a place like America.

143
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.390
And one extreme example of this is actually Alexander Hamilton,

144
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.720
who was born illegitimate in the West indies.

145
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.070
And it's really clear from the absolute first letter of his that we know of,

146
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:25.200
which was written when he was 14 years old,

147
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.540
that he absolutely thought that his only ticket off of the island of Saint Croix

148
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.690
was through military glory in a war.

149
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.900
That was really the way that he saw that he was going to make something of

150
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:41.550
himself,
get himself off of Saint Croix,
earn a name,
get status,
get reputation,

151
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.700
and start the process of making something of himself in the world.

152
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:49.080
So as he says in this letter and it's written when he's 14 my ambition is

153
00:09:49.081 --> 00:09:53.400
prevalent.
I wish there was a war.
Okay.
As a historian,

154
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:55.320
you're still happy.
Again,
I said this before.

155
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:57.510
When your historical subject say the thing,

156
00:09:57.511 --> 00:10:00.780
you want them to say that you could then quote forever after,
hi,

157
00:10:00.781 --> 00:10:03.930
I am ambitious and I wanted a war so I can promote myself.
Thank you.

158
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.190
Alexander Hamilton very much.
Okay.
Now innocence.

159
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.030
Hamilton was extreme cause he was very underprivileged.

160
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:15.600
He was extremely ambitious and very determined,

161
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.560
but in a sense his entire generation of young men saw the revolution as a chance

162
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.670
for glory,
status,
rank,
self promotion.

163
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:32.190
And I talked about a similar idea last week when I mentioned that there were a

164
00:10:32.191 --> 00:10:37.191
number of Europeans who came to America during the revolution sometimes because

165
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:41.640
they figured that they could probably impress.
Americans are certainly impressed.

166
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:46.641
The continental Congress with their experience in formal European warfare and

167
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:50.280
then they could get a position as an officer easier than they might've been able

168
00:10:50.281 --> 00:10:52.590
to obtain it or purchase it back home.

169
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.940
And so that there were a number of Europeans coming to this country for that

170
00:10:56.941 --> 00:10:57.630
purpose.

171
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.650
And I mentioned at the time that actually Hamilton trying to do something really

172
00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:02.484
similar,

173
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:07.200
said that watching these Europeans come and get promoted by the congress above

174
00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:11.880
his head gave him what he called pygmy feelings,
made him feel like really puny,

175
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:15.600
really small in comparison with these sort of grungy Europeans coming and sort

176
00:11:15.601 --> 00:11:16.860
of getting everything that he wanted.

177
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.680
And he wasn't getting it cause he was just a puny little American.

178
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.930
So in a sense,

179
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:26.100
in a world where there were a limited number of pathways,

180
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:31.320
the gentlemanly status serving as an officer during a time of war could be kind

181
00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:36.321
of an escalator of rank offering the chance to get ahead at a rapid pace.

182
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.090
So being an officer in the continental army could have seen particularly

183
00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:46.830
attractive to highly ambitious men who are looking for some kind of a big
chance.

184
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.310
And Benedict Arnold was one of those men.

185
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.080
Now I think when most Americans think about the American revolution,

186
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:59.110
and I remember I started out this course sort of talking about the same idea.

187
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.840
I assume that maybe people know like Washington,

188
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.440
the army that Paul revere rode around on a horse saying something about the

189
00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:09.280
British that Jefferson had something to do with the declaration of independence

190
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:13.240
and I'll add to that list.
Most people,
no,
benedict Arnold was a trader.

191
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:14.680
They don't know why.
They don't know how,

192
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:19.030
but you assume the name Benedict Arnold goes along with the word trader.

193
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:25.210
John Adams was pretty much right on the money when he predicted how future

194
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:29.080
generations we're going to see the American revolution and it's right in line

195
00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:33.460
with what I just said and he actually wrote in 1790 to Benjamin Rush.

196
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.310
The history of our revolution will be one continued lie from one end to the

197
00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:40.144
other.

198
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:45.090
The essence of the whole will be that doctor Franklins electrical Rudd smoked

199
00:12:45.091 --> 00:12:47.770
the earth and out sprung general Washington

200
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.900
that Franklin electrified him with his rod and then so forth.

201
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.570
These two conducted all the policy negotiations,
the legislatures in war.
Okay,

202
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.750
so Adams is actually probably coming pretty close to reality.

203
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.850
People are going to look back in a good say.
Yeah,
yeah.

204
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:07.960
Franklin Washington in the war.
That was the revolution.
Now,
I always,

205
00:13:07.961 --> 00:13:10.300
I knew that quote,
I've known it for a long time.
I love that quote,

206
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:13.390
which is why I found a reason to wind it into today's lecture.

207
00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.540
But when I went back to look it up today for the first time,

208
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:18.370
I actually read the whole letter that it comes from,

209
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.730
and I found another sentence,
which I actually hadn't focused on before,

210
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.310
and it made me so happy that I offer it to you,

211
00:13:24.311 --> 00:13:26.500
even though it isn't directly related to the point I'm making,

212
00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:28.240
but I kind of couldn't believe he wrote it in this letter.

213
00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:33.241
So he offers that quote and then he adds and says if this letter should be

214
00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:36.370
preserved and read a hundred years,
hence.
Okay.
First of all,

215
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.550
I love the fact that that comes up in his mind.
Well,
a hundred years from now,

216
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.930
when people are reading my letter,

217
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.290
it's this letter should be preserved and read a hundred years.
Hence,

218
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:46.900
the reader will say,
the envy of this,

219
00:13:46.901 --> 00:13:50.050
John Adams could not bear to think of the truth.
So in other words,

220
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:53.110
a hundred years from now,
people read this letter.
They're going to say,
yeah,

221
00:13:53.111 --> 00:13:55.330
well the fact is Adam's knew he wouldn't be remembered.

222
00:13:55.331 --> 00:13:57.310
He doesn't deserve to be remembered anyway.

223
00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.220
So it's like first there's the letter where he's like,
oh,

224
00:14:00.221 --> 00:14:03.760
no one's going to know the truth about the revolution and you're never going to

225
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:04.810
give me any credit.

226
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.430
I love like the weird self awareness of John Adams.

227
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:12.820
I guess I couldn't believe that he added that into the letter.
So anyway,

228
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.610
I think he certainly knew what he was talking about when you talked about the

229
00:14:15.611 --> 00:14:19.870
weird general sort of hero way in which people were going to be thinking about

230
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.350
the American revolution.
So many Americans know,

231
00:14:23.351 --> 00:14:25.360
certainly benedict Arnold equals trader.

232
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.750
Obviously it's going to be talking about today.

233
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:33.220
His story is a lot more complex than that and it's mixed in with these other two

234
00:14:33.221 --> 00:14:38.221
stories that have Peggy Shippen who eventually becomes his wife and John Andre,

235
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.720
who was a young British officer.

236
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.710
Now Arnold started out life in many ways,

237
00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:49.150
a sort of typical member of a modest respectable family.

238
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.410
And at the opening of the American revolution,

239
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.590
he was a bookseller and a pharmacist or what they would have called a druggist

240
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:59.300
in new haven,
Connecticut.
So he's a local boy than a dick.
Gardell.
Um,

241
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.310
he was struggling to better himself.

242
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.310
How many of you knew actually the benedict Arnold was like local guy?

243
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.400
A couple of people did.
That was another one of those things that I never knew.

244
00:15:07.401 --> 00:15:08.960
When I say something about new haven,
is it like,

245
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.610
we all know this about new haven.
Professor Freeman,
you are the clueless person.

246
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.990
So anyway,
he was a local boy.
I'm so bookseller.

247
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.130
Druggist new haven,
local boy struggling to better himself.

248
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.150
And part of the way in which he's struggling to better himself is to certainly

249
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.240
display himself to the world as someone who's really up and coming.

250
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:31.310
So among the things that he was doing was,

251
00:15:31.311 --> 00:15:34.580
he apparently was building an enormous mansion for himself on water street,

252
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.980
wearing very expensive clothing,

253
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.000
taking big risks in business to try and get himself ahead quickly.

254
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.980
He was also a captain and the local new haven militia.

255
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.120
And so he was really active drilling at the opening of the war.

256
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.840
Now when gunplay broke out at Lexington and Concord,

257
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.890
the new haven town meeting apparently decided that they wanted to maintain

258
00:15:57.891 --> 00:16:01.160
neutrality,
which in and of itself was kind of interesting.
Oh,

259
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.390
something bad's happening.

260
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.270
I think for now we want to be neutral because Connecticut is always a very

261
00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:06.110
conservative place.

262
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.200
So this is yet another conservative moment in Connecticut's history.

263
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.790
So they form a committee,

264
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:14.120
the town meeting forms of committee to preserve neutrality in new haven.

265
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.200
Arnold was not really excited about this concept of neutrality.

266
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.920
So apparently he stormed into this neutrality committee,

267
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.860
demanded the keys to the ammunition shed.

268
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:29.060
And when his superior in the Connecticut militia told him the town had legally

269
00:16:29.061 --> 00:16:30.320
voted for neutrality,

270
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.340
Arnold threatened to break down the ammunition shed door with his men if they

271
00:16:34.341 --> 00:16:38.270
didn't hand over the keys so he could get ammunition and take his men and do

272
00:16:38.271 --> 00:16:39.080
something.

273
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.760
And the committee released the keys and Arnold took them and armed his men.

274
00:16:43.761 --> 00:16:48.530
And ultimately he and his militia unit joined the continental army in

275
00:16:48.531 --> 00:16:52.640
Massachusetts.
So this is someone who clearly is eager to fight,
right?

276
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.110
He was sort of forced his way in.

277
00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.770
So he ends up in Massachusetts with his men.

278
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:03.280
He soon promoted to be a criminal by the Massachusetts Committee of safety,

279
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.860
which assigned him to be part of a group that was going to go help capture Fort

280
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:13.530
Ticonderoga.
And he was,
Arnold was part of that successful effort,
um,

281
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:17.690
in May of 1775 and by October of 1776,

282
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.680
he was a brigadier general.
Now at this point,

283
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:27.250
the very hierarchical system of military rank that Arnold was using to try and

284
00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:32.531
raise himself in the world began to work against him because a number of his

285
00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:34.880
equals were promoted to major general,

286
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.390
but Arnold wasn't and isn't going to explain in a moment.

287
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:42.950
The reason why he didn't get a promotion has more to do with things like

288
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:47.300
regionalism and fear of Centralized Authority than it actually does have

289
00:17:47.301 --> 00:17:49.980
anything to do with Arnold specifically.

290
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:55.290
So basically many of the more radical members of the continental congress at

291
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:56.100
this time,

292
00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.360
we're afraid that if everyone was promoted in the continental army,

293
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.640
just according to seniority of rank,

294
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.110
that the army would get detached from the legislature and that it would be

295
00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:11.520
seniority and not congress that would be determining promotions.

296
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.420
So Congress would might end up being powerless over the army.

297
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:20.010
And so the result that they feared would be maybe a military dictatorship and

298
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:23.160
aristocracy based on high military rank that somehow or other,

299
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.940
if the army had control of promotion,

300
00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:28.080
everything was going to spin out of control and congress would have no power.

301
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:33.680
So afraid of this congress debated and ultimately decided that officers should

302
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:37.020
be appointed,
not just according to seniority,

303
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:42.380
but almost more important on the basis of balancing out the numbers of officers

304
00:18:42.391 --> 00:18:46.020
from different states.
Okay.
So they figure we're going to have regional balance,

305
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.710
we're going to maintain control of the promotion process and maintain regional

306
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:52.110
balance and the numbers of officers.

307
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:58.100
So essentially in the interest of preserving a national confederation of some,

308
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:03.770
some kind regional balance in the military was given priority as Washington.

309
00:19:06.331 --> 00:19:11.331
George Washington explained to Arnold when Arnold was denied his promotion as

310
00:19:11.731 --> 00:19:16.020
Connecticut had already do major generals.
It was their full share.
Okay,

311
00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:19.650
that's gotta be really sour grapes.
Like what?
Connecticut,

312
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.590
it doesn't deserve any more major general,
so I don't get a promotion.

313
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.740
I confess this is a strange motive reasoning,

314
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.640
but it may serve to show you that the promotion that was due to your seniority

315
00:19:29.641 --> 00:19:32.340
was not overlooked for want of merit in you.

316
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.560
So he's trying to make Arnold feel better.
Well you actually,

317
00:19:34.561 --> 00:19:35.490
I know you deserved it,

318
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.990
but I'm sorry you really can't have it because Connecticut doesn't get any more

319
00:19:39.991 --> 00:19:43.710
for a while.
Okay.
Arnold did not get his promotion,

320
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:48.990
did not get it for want of merit.
This did not make him happy.

321
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:53.160
Washington's trying to explain that there are larger principle that play

322
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:58.530
principles that show how fearful people were of centralized power in any form.

323
00:19:58.531 --> 00:19:59.101
And in this case,

324
00:19:59.101 --> 00:20:04.101
they're afraid of some kind of powerful standing army and they're using regional

325
00:20:04.981 --> 00:20:09.981
balance as a priority to sort of balance out fears of centralized power wherever

326
00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:14.610
they're afraid it's going to crop up.
As one congressman wrote at the time,

327
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.420
Arnold's promotion was blocked because it raised,
quote,

328
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:22.430
a question of monarchical or Republican principle at a most crucial times.

329
00:20:22.431 --> 00:20:26.460
So you can see even this one guy's promotion is being tied into these much

330
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:28.680
larger fears and ideas.

331
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:34.430
Congress felt compelled to establish its promotion policy based on fears of an

332
00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:38.820
independent standing army that might take power for itself.

333
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.970
They're trying to keep control of military promotions.

334
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.420
So here you see fear of a standing army fear,

335
00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:50.200
centralized power and regionalism all stirred up and all that play in full

336
00:20:50.201 --> 00:20:53.620
force.
Now,
luckily for Arnold,
at this point,

337
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.240
there was a military action in Connecticut.
Arnold proved himself militarily,

338
00:20:58.241 --> 00:21:01.210
yet again,
he ends up getting promoted to major general,

339
00:21:01.211 --> 00:21:05.980
but now his rank is beneath those who had been his equals before,

340
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:10.030
right?
They had been promoted ahead of him,
so they still have seniority over him.

341
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.330
Arnold really wants equal rank,

342
00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:17.080
equal seniority with the men he had formerly been equal to.

343
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:22.300
He also felt that Congress owed him money because he had been using his personal

344
00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:27.301
funds to supply his troops and obviously he's already living well beyond his

345
00:21:27.641 --> 00:21:28.474
means.

346
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.410
So this question of whether or not he's actually owed money by Congress and

347
00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:36.340
whether or not Congress is actually going to pay him back for him.

348
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:37.870
That's a serious question.

349
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:44.130
The more that Arnold demanded that he be promoted to the level of his former

350
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:49.351
equals the stronger congress dug in its heels and refused to comply.

351
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.280
So the whole idea,

352
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.450
clearly it's becoming now a matter of principle in which the honor and authority

353
00:21:55.451 --> 00:21:57.700
of the continental congress is at stake now,

354
00:21:57.701 --> 00:22:01.030
in addition to whatever larger issues are at play,

355
00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:03.040
and this might sound a little familiar,

356
00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:07.330
if you think back to some of the logic deployed by the British parliament as

357
00:22:07.331 --> 00:22:11.530
problems we're growing out of questions of taxation in addition to all of the

358
00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:15.070
larger problems and concerns mixed up in that question.

359
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.710
Part of what was at play was at parliament.

360
00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:22.090
Ultimately at some point down the road of that controversy didn't want to lose

361
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:25.720
face by seeming to surrender the issue to its colonies.

362
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.410
So the honor of parliament is involved in that issue here.

363
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.970
The honor of the continental congress,

364
00:22:30.971 --> 00:22:34.240
they feel like that's an issue and they can't just back down because Arnold is

365
00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:38.170
being really persistent about what he wants as South Carolina.

366
00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:40.900
Congressman Henry Lawrence put it at the time,

367
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.320
his colleagues behavior in Congress was quote,
disgusting.

368
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.360
Arnold was refused,

369
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.100
not because he was deficient in merit or that his demand was not well founded,

370
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:56.260
but because he asked for it and that granting at such insistence would be

371
00:22:56.261 --> 00:22:58.660
derogatory to the honor of Congress.

372
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.630
Now that's Lauren's point of view.

373
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.890
Another congressman was different politics and another point of view came up

374
00:23:05.891 --> 00:23:08.740
with a whole different way of looking at this whole controversy.

375
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.570
Drew very different conclusions and said that denying Arnold who's promotion was

376
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:15.700
a triumph of Republican principles,

377
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.110
military rank would stay in control of the legislature.

378
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.950
The army wouldn't become independent and aristocratic.

379
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.000
So you could see even again,
something that is seemingly not that important,

380
00:23:28.001 --> 00:23:32.170
which is the promotion of one guy stirs up all of these larger issues for all

381
00:23:32.171 --> 00:23:36.220
kinds of people in different ways.
People aren't even United about what it means

382
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:42.030
now.
It was at roughly this moment when Arnold is frustrated,

383
00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:44.890
he wants promotion and doesn't see a way to get it.
He keeps getting turned.

384
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.620
He feels like he's only owed money in some way.

385
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:52.850
He's just feels basically stymied in every way.
His reputation now,

386
00:23:52.851 --> 00:23:56.510
he also feels is being attacked simply because he's asking for promotion.

387
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.420
This is roughly the time when he met Peggy Shippen,

388
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.900
who was the daughter of a wealthy merchant in Philadelphia.

389
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:08.630
Now the shipping's along with any number of Philadelphia as other sort of best

390
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.680
families mingled freely with British officers.

391
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.500
When the British were an occupation of Philadelphia,

392
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:19.790
when the British were not there,
mingled freely with American officers.

393
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.430
When the British had possession of Philadelphia,

394
00:24:22.431 --> 00:24:26.240
apparently they were elaborate dances and great sort of theatrical productions

395
00:24:26.241 --> 00:24:29.390
is a grand social scene.
When the British were there,

396
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.750
when the British were not there,
Americans also had entertainments.

397
00:24:32.751 --> 00:24:36.290
They weren't quite as extravagant but still enough to encourage the

398
00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:39.770
participation of all of the best families of Philadelphia.

399
00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:44.900
Peggy Shippen was certainly in the midst of all of this socializing,

400
00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:45.980
enjoying whatever,

401
00:24:45.981 --> 00:24:50.450
socialize what was going on with whatever group and apparently she was very

402
00:24:50.451 --> 00:24:53.090
popular.
She was sort of the literal Belle of the ball,

403
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:57.230
one of the more attractive and noteworthy young women in Philadelphia social

404
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.760
scene at that time.

405
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.130
Now this suggest a few things about Peggy ship in one or two of which are

406
00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:07.610
significant for our story here.
For one obvious thing,

407
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:11.330
it's suggest that she certainly was dressed at the height of fashion,

408
00:25:11.331 --> 00:25:15.800
that she was skilled at flirtation,
that she was aggressive in social circles.

409
00:25:15.801 --> 00:25:20.330
But what that adds up to as far as our story is concerned is that she was

410
00:25:20.331 --> 00:25:25.070
displaying ambition on one of the few stages where women could display open

411
00:25:25.071 --> 00:25:27.260
ambition and that's social events,

412
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.770
social functions in a sense that the private world,

413
00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.570
but certainly on the social stage,

414
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.010
that's a place where women could successfully display an exercise ambition and

415
00:25:37.011 --> 00:25:41.180
it certainly suggests that Peggy ship and was perfectly comfortable doing that.

416
00:25:41.181 --> 00:25:43.160
On the social scene of Philadelphia.

417
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:49.430
So Peggy married benedict Arnold in April of 1779 he already wasn't someone who

418
00:25:51.681 --> 00:25:52.940
was spending extravagantly.

419
00:25:52.941 --> 00:25:56.750
This just encouraged him to increase his spending because now he had a wife to

420
00:25:56.751 --> 00:25:59.420
spend on in addition to whatever he was spending on himself.

421
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:04.400
And it was shortly after his marriage when he still remained frustrated and his

422
00:26:04.401 --> 00:26:08.180
military hopes his expenses are rising and rising all the time.

423
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:13.250
This is the moment where he began to ponder the possibility of aiding the

424
00:26:13.251 --> 00:26:15.920
British.
And apparently in his mind,

425
00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:20.720
he justified his actions by assuming the British were inevitably going to win

426
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.220
anyway,
but the British,

427
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:26.330
the likelihood that the colonies were going to be victorious against the empire

428
00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.710
in his mind is unlikely.

429
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.550
So given that the British are inevitably going to win,

430
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.990
his helping them win the war is going to end bloodshed as quickly as possible.

431
00:26:35.991 --> 00:26:38.960
So he's doing a good thing by somehow helping the British.

432
00:26:38.961 --> 00:26:41.270
Now clearly that's a sort of self serving way of looking at it.

433
00:26:41.271 --> 00:26:44.790
He has other motives to,
but that was part of his logic.

434
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:51.260
So in May of 1779 he and Peggy decided to ask a local man in Philadelphia who

435
00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:58.491
they knew had loyalist sympathies and who was a poet to act as a go between with

436
00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:04.920
the British so they could at least open a conversation with them and this man

437
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:09.810
whose name was Joseph Stansbury later described Arnold's invitation.

438
00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:11.610
He described what Arnold said to him at this moment,

439
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.790
General Arnold sent for me and after some general conversation opened his

440
00:27:17.791 --> 00:27:19.620
political sentiments,
respecting the war,

441
00:27:19.621 --> 00:27:24.000
carrying on between Great Britain and America declaring his abhorrence of a

442
00:27:24.001 --> 00:27:27.270
separation of the latter from the former as a measure that would be ruinous to

443
00:27:27.271 --> 00:27:29.130
both general.

444
00:27:29.131 --> 00:27:32.940
Arnold then communicated to me under a solemn obligation of secrecy.

445
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.800
His intention of offering his services to the commander and chief of the British

446
00:27:37.801 --> 00:27:42.420
forces in any way that would most effectually restore the former government and

447
00:27:42.421 --> 00:27:43.570
destroy the,

448
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:47.730
then you surfed authority of Congress either by immediately joining the British

449
00:27:47.731 --> 00:27:52.530
army or cooperating on some concerted plan with Sir Henry Clinton,

450
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:57.750
who's the British commander in chief.
That's quite some conversation there.
Now,

451
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:02.780
the person who ultimately ended up facilitating communication between Arnold and

452
00:28:03.901 --> 00:28:08.901
Sir Henry Clinton was a young British officer named Major John Andre,

453
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.350
who was a sort of favorite of Henry Clinton,
was sort of his right hand man.

454
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.810
Apparently Peggy ship and knew him.

455
00:28:15.811 --> 00:28:18.750
They had met when the British had been in Philadelphia,

456
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.780
and in fact they'd been a little bit flirtatious where the British were in

457
00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:23.370
Philadelphia.
So they knew each other

458
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.640
to most people who knew Andre.
And as we're going to see later on in the story,

459
00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:31.020
particularly to Americans,

460
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:36.660
Andre was the very ideal of a gentleman.
He was charming,

461
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:41.250
he was well educated,
he wrote poetry,
he wrote plays,

462
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.780
he was flirtatious.

463
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.290
He drew portraits to amuse the ladies and his fellow officers.

464
00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:50.040
He supposedly very good looking.
So basically in a sense,
Andrea,

465
00:28:50.041 --> 00:28:53.640
sort of this gentleman,
Lee ideal,
and then he's also,
there's gallon soldier,

466
00:28:53.641 --> 00:28:57.600
so you add it all up and it's,
it's just a package of,
but of ideal gentlemen,

467
00:28:58.890 --> 00:28:59.940
like Arnold,

468
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:04.530
Andre had used the army as a way to better his station,

469
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.860
although his station was already somewhat elevated.

470
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.830
So Andre's father was a wealthy merchant.

471
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.800
Andre thought that trade was a little bit disreputable.

472
00:29:13.801 --> 00:29:18.720
So he decided that the army was a better way for him to advance himself,

473
00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.830
exercise his ambition and achieve fame and glory.
Again,

474
00:29:22.831 --> 00:29:24.330
not that unlike Arnold.

475
00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.860
So Andre ends up being at the center of Arnold's plans with the British and

476
00:29:31.291 --> 00:29:35.130
basically the plan was the Arnolds would send messages to the British,

477
00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:40.160
but they would be written by Peggy Arnold and then sent to Andre through Joseph

478
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:41.590
Stansberry,

479
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.650
who would pick up the letter and then deliver them crossing back and forth

480
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:46.630
between American and British lines.

481
00:29:46.631 --> 00:29:50.680
And then Andre could go on and speak to Henry Clinton himself.

482
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.880
Now Stansberry hoping to make things a little less risky for himself,

483
00:29:55.150 --> 00:30:00.150
that another poet that he knew behind British lines to carry the messages from

484
00:30:00.251 --> 00:30:02.380
his hand to Andre's hand.

485
00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:07.570
So Benedict Arnold negotiations with the British would be written out by Peggy.

486
00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.590
She'd give her letters to Stansbury Stansberry would give them to another poet.

487
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:15.280
The poet would give them to Andre.
Andre would take them to Clinton.
Okay.

488
00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:17.350
That's a long chain of people.

489
00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.950
But what's really interesting about that chain of people is that when you think

490
00:30:20.951 --> 00:30:23.590
of the pieces and the assumptions underlying the pieces,

491
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:28.390
it reveals a lot about society and some of its assumptions.
At the time,

492
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:33.670
it was actually Andre who suggested that the letter should at least seem to be

493
00:30:33.671 --> 00:30:38.671
written by Peggy Arnold and addressed to Andre because Andre knew that something

494
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:43.630
written by a woman would never be assumed to have anything to do with politics

495
00:30:43.631 --> 00:30:47.530
or war.
A letter from a woman.
It's going to assume to be private and personal.

496
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.380
Women were basically a nonentity in public life.

497
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.630
They didn't exist as public figures.

498
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.500
So as Andre explained in a note to the Arnolds,
the lady,

499
00:30:56.501 --> 00:31:01.030
meaning Peggy might write to me,
this will come by a flag of truce.

500
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:05.080
Every messenger remaining ignorant of what they are charged with.

501
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.170
These will seem like private letters.
They can kind of write in code,

502
00:31:08.171 --> 00:31:10.660
it'll come from a woman.
No one will know what they are.

503
00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:11.980
And under a flag of truce,

504
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:15.340
messengers will help deliver these messages and no one will know what they are

505
00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.170
because they're written by a woman.

506
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.920
So their letters to each other could seem to talk about things like parties and

507
00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:26.800
dances and what Andre termed other nonsense,
right?

508
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:29.050
They could pretend to be talking about whatever they're talking about,

509
00:31:29.051 --> 00:31:33.550
but they're going to actually send coded messages and these letters would be

510
00:31:33.551 --> 00:31:38.380
passed through both the American and British lines because they would supposedly

511
00:31:38.381 --> 00:31:43.330
has nothing to do with the war because they were from or to a woman.
Okay.

512
00:31:43.331 --> 00:31:48.331
So part of this whole plan of espionage is built around the simple fact that

513
00:31:48.761 --> 00:31:52.660
women were invisible in public life,
so they were very useful,

514
00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.910
useful agents of espionage.

515
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.830
It's also interesting to note that both the Arnolds chosen messengers,

516
00:31:59.831 --> 00:32:04.831
Stansbury and Standberry's standsberry's chosen messenger to Andre.

517
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:10.660
Both of them were poets and in a sense poets were also people who would not

518
00:32:10.661 --> 00:32:14.920
necessarily be assumed to be centrally involved with fighting a war.

519
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:20.250
It could have been quite natural for American and British men of letters to

520
00:32:20.261 --> 00:32:25.060
chat,
to meet,
to correspond cultural bonds.

521
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:26.051
For example,

522
00:32:26.051 --> 00:32:30.520
an interest in the art of poetry could easily cross political boundaries.

523
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.740
And Andre himself was a poet of sorts.

524
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:37.630
So that to show something interesting about society at the time,

525
00:32:37.631 --> 00:32:41.720
this assumption that common cultural bonds between American and British men of

526
00:32:41.721 --> 00:32:46.721
letters and literature could be assumed to be above politics and war above

527
00:32:46.941 --> 00:32:51.120
national bonds enough that it might help them pass back and forth between

528
00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:54.110
American and British lines.
Okay.

529
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:58.500
So using this whole string of people,
the string of poets,
um,

530
00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:03.730
Arnold and the British negotiated for a time and then stopped because the

531
00:33:03.771 --> 00:33:07.520
British would not promise to give Arnold the huge sum of money,

532
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.710
but he demanded for his services.

533
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:15.490
A year later in 1780 negotiations began again this time focused on a specific

534
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:18.440
demand by the British.

535
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:23.720
The British specifically asked Arnold for his help and getting control of West

536
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:28.370
Point and Arnold felt that he could probably get command of west point and then

537
00:33:28.371 --> 00:33:32.780
find a way to deliver it to the British.
And in exchange for this mission,

538
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.570
Arnold wanted 30,000 pounds,
sterling,

539
00:33:35.571 --> 00:33:40.040
which is a vast sum of money at this time.
Um,
I think,

540
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:44.450
I mean sterling to dollar,
I can't translate,
but just to give you a sense,
um,

541
00:33:44.451 --> 00:33:47.360
I believe that when the government gets underway,

542
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:53.200
George Washington is making a salary of $25,000 a year and that's a big blob of

543
00:33:53.601 --> 00:33:54.434
money.

544
00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:59.690
I think secretary of State Secretary of the treasury were making $5,000 a year,

545
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:02.900
maybe.
So 30,000 pounds.
Sterling is a lot of money.

546
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.920
Plus he wanted payment of all of his debts.
So he's not being modest,

547
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:12.730
but General Clinton communicating through Andre will refuse to commit any money

548
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:16.430
to Arnold until Arnold had actually accomplished something.

549
00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.740
But he doesn't at this point even have command of West Point.

550
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.650
So at this point with their plan,

551
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.760
almost boiled things go perhaps one step worse.

552
00:34:25.761 --> 00:34:30.650
When George Washington asks to see Arnold and tries to reward him.
Right?

553
00:34:30.651 --> 00:34:33.230
He's still feels bad.
The guy didn't get the promotion he wanted.

554
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:37.160
Washington says he's going to try to reward him by giving him a better command

555
00:34:37.161 --> 00:34:39.920
than west point.
Right.
West Point's not really in the center of the fighting.

556
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.140
Washington basically says,
you don't really want west point.

557
00:34:42.141 --> 00:34:46.550
I'll give you something better than West Point.
And as Washington later recorded,

558
00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:51.590
Arnold had a strange reaction to this offer quote upon this information,

559
00:34:51.591 --> 00:34:55.970
his countenance changed and he appeared to be quite fallen and instead of

560
00:34:55.971 --> 00:35:00.440
thanking me or expressing any pleasure,
the appointment never opened his mouth.

561
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.170
Okay cause see Arnold like,
oh

562
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.300
this is not what I expected.
Right.
Peggy Arnold,

563
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:12.230
when informed in Philadelphia that Arnold had been promised a better command

564
00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:16.520
than west point apparently burst into hysterics and then after regaining herself

565
00:35:16.521 --> 00:35:21.440
said she was sobbing because of the danger that this put her husband in.
Okay.

566
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:25.130
She's really sobbing because their plan is about to be boiled,

567
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:29.360
but her explanation again sort of took advantage of stereotypes about women in

568
00:35:29.361 --> 00:35:30.110
this case,

569
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:34.280
capitalizing on the assumption that women were not involved in such things as

570
00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:37.440
military commands,
they would just be worried about their husbands welfare.

571
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.620
So that's the excuse she comes up with and we're going to see her deployed this

572
00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:44.250
really successfully and just a few minutes at the sort of penultimate moment of

573
00:35:44.251 --> 00:35:46.020
crisis in this whole controversy.

574
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:51.720
Ultimately that offer of another command for Arnold fell through and he was

575
00:35:51.721 --> 00:35:56.220
given command of West Point.
And through that whole chain of letter exchanges,

576
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.730
it was quickly established that Arnold and Andre and Clinton,

577
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:04.590
we're now ready to actually do business.
But now at this crucial point,

578
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:09.830
someone had to speak with Arnold in person to make final arrangements.

579
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:15.300
And here we get yet another example of how important it was for young men to

580
00:36:15.301 --> 00:36:19.950
gain status in the army and actually young men of all kinds to gain status in

581
00:36:19.951 --> 00:36:24.510
the army and how useful the army could be for promoting your own status and

582
00:36:24.511 --> 00:36:28.410
reputation,
even for people who already had some social status.

583
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:29.490
Because in this case,

584
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:35.210
Andres commander in chief and friend General Clinton said the mission was too

585
00:36:35.341 --> 00:36:39.800
dangerous for his favorite right hand man,
right?
He says to Andre,
I,

586
00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.580
this is not for you.
This is too dangerous.

587
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:46.850
But Andre actually insisted on being the communicator between Clinton and Arnold

588
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.100
because he really desperately wanted a chance to earn a promotion.

589
00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:53.910
And he really thought that this moment of potential glory could be,

590
00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:58.320
it could be his big chance.
So Andre and Arnold met.

591
00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:03.210
They talked throughout his trip to meet with Arnold.
And during the visit,

592
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:07.250
Andre claimed to be a merchant named John Anderson,
right?

593
00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.580
And he wore this sort of cloak,

594
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.930
but it's important to note that underneath his cloak he had on his British

595
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:14.003
uniform.

596
00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:18.870
And this was important because if he was captured in his official uniform,

597
00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:22.350
he would be a prisoner of war and thus protected,

598
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:27.750
even possibly traded back to the British in exchange for a high ranking American

599
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.690
prisoner.
But if he was in plain clothes,

600
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:35.250
he would be a lowly spy and a spy.
I had only one fate waiting for him,

601
00:37:35.251 --> 00:37:37.920
and that was death by hanging him.
So he's cloaked,

602
00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:40.530
but he does have on his British uniform.
Okay.

603
00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:45.740
Complications naturally arose when a friend of Arnold saw Andre with the cloak

604
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.330
off,
right?
So the friend of Arnold says,
wow,

605
00:37:48.331 --> 00:37:52.350
you're chatting with a British officer.
What does that mean?
Okay,

606
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:55.290
so forced to come up with some kind of an explanation.

607
00:37:55.291 --> 00:37:58.380
You can imagine that moment.
That's a big sort of,
oh,

608
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.080
I'm chatting with a British officer.
Um,

609
00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:06.870
Arnold said that Andre was a merchant who had put on a British uniform to sneak

610
00:38:06.871 --> 00:38:11.730
through British line.
Quick thinking on Arnold's part.
But Arnold's Fred said,

611
00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.240
oh,
okay,
well given that he says to Andre,

612
00:38:15.241 --> 00:38:17.910
you'd be much safer now just to dress in plain clothes.

613
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:19.980
Cause now that you're past British lines,

614
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.710
you shouldn't be wearing a British uniform.
Okay.

615
00:38:22.711 --> 00:38:27.030
There's not a lot that Andre can say to that logic.
So he puts on plain clothes.

616
00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:31.470
He's carrying papers from Arnold about their plot.
He shoves them into his boot.

617
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.730
And Andre then set off to head back to general.
Clinton had just about,

618
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:41.731
made his way back to British claimed territory when he was stopped by three men

619
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.500
who questioned him,
searched his clothing,

620
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.320
and eventually found the papers in his boot.

621
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:52.360
And the three men brought Andre to American authorities.
Now,

622
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.991
even now,

623
00:38:52.991 --> 00:38:57.991
Andre thought that maybe he could claim to be a secret agent and Arnold Service,

624
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:01.390
right?
He's actually,
he's wearing plain clothes and he has papers from Arnold.

625
00:39:01.391 --> 00:39:02.710
So He's thinking,
well,

626
00:39:02.711 --> 00:39:05.710
there's not actually anything to link me with the British at this moment.

627
00:39:05.711 --> 00:39:09.420
I couldn't just be a lowly spy doing something for Arnold's.

628
00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.130
So maybe I'm still okay.
However,

629
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:17.700
the officer who he was taken to became suspicious when Andre was given clean

630
00:39:17.891 --> 00:39:22.891
clothes and the ribbon that he removed from his hair was dusted with powder.

631
00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.810
Okay.
These sneaky powder,

632
00:39:25.811 --> 00:39:30.160
what that meant was that he clearly was a gentleman who powdered his hair.

633
00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:35.320
He was not a lowly spy.
So whoever this observant person was,
he saw the ribbon,

634
00:39:35.321 --> 00:39:37.330
he saw that it was dusted with powder.
Any thought,

635
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.720
I don't think you're some pseudo lowly by person.

636
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:44.950
I think you must be someone more important.
Something fishy is going on here.

637
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:50.370
So now this American officers sent the captured papers on to George Washington,

638
00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:53.320
Washington.
As luck would have,

639
00:39:53.321 --> 00:39:56.950
it was on his way to west point to meet with Benedict Arnold.

640
00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:01.990
Talk about your sort of lucky strike,
right?
So he's writing off,

641
00:40:01.991 --> 00:40:05.150
going heading to west point to meet with Arnold as a friend,

642
00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.490
see how west point is going.

643
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.870
And now this letter from Andre is winging its way to Arnold's headquarters at

644
00:40:10.871 --> 00:40:15.790
west point when it became obvious that he was now being really held suspect.

645
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:20.820
Andre confessed who he was and he did so at this early point so that he could

646
00:40:20.981 --> 00:40:22.780
reveal that he wasn't a lowly spy,

647
00:40:22.781 --> 00:40:25.780
but actually was a gentleman and an officer who had been caught.

648
00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:30.250
And to him that's really made a difference.
As he explained to Washington,

649
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.230
he wasn't revealing his true identity for his own safety and security as he put

650
00:40:35.231 --> 00:40:35.291
it.

651
00:40:35.291 --> 00:40:40.291
He wasn't trying to rescue himself from an imputation of having assumed a main

652
00:40:40.391 --> 00:40:43.450
character for treacherous purposes of self interest.
So he says,
I'm not,

653
00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:46.060
I'm not revealing this cause I hope I'd be like plead for my life.

654
00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:51.540
Rather he was revealing his true identity quote to vindicate my fame from any

655
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:53.810
suspicion that he was a lowly spy.

656
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:57.490
So basically he's revealing who he is because he wants to be recognized as an

657
00:40:57.491 --> 00:40:58.960
officer and a gentleman.

658
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:04.300
And that letter also sent on to the headquarters at West Point to wait for

659
00:41:04.301 --> 00:41:06.240
Washington when he arrives at with point kept.

660
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:08.410
Boy Washington's going to have fun when he arrives at West Point.

661
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.800
Washington did not yet gotten to Arnold's house.

662
00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.310
He sent two of his aides ahead to prepare for his arrival.

663
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:19.060
They were actually eating breakfast with Benedict Arnold when letters began to

664
00:41:19.061 --> 00:41:21.910
arrive at headquarters.
Um,

665
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:24.760
realizing that something bad was unfolding.

666
00:41:24.761 --> 00:41:28.600
And one after another sort of dispatch came in with these frantic letters that

667
00:41:28.601 --> 00:41:31.690
had to get to Washington.
Arnold ran upstairs.

668
00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:36.290
Washington Washington's aids later said he looked oddly agitated.

669
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:41.740
He told Peggy that they'd been caught.
He ran downstairs.
He told Washington that,

670
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:44.410
and his aides,
actually not,
Washington's not there yet,
you don't.

671
00:41:44.411 --> 00:41:45.410
Washington's aids.

672
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:50.120
But he had to go prepare for a reception for Washington and fled on horseback.

673
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:54.560
Poof,
he's gone.
And eventually he was taken aboard a British ship in the harbor.

674
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:57.800
Washington arrived shortly after this moment,

675
00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.460
reads all of these letters and messages that are waiting for him.

676
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.440
And at this moment,
Peggy,

677
00:42:03.441 --> 00:42:07.280
who now knows that things are really exploding and she's in big trouble,

678
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:12.140
erupts into hysterics entirely flustering all of the men present,

679
00:42:12.141 --> 00:42:14.810
cause she's at this point surrounded by men,
right?
Her husband's age,

680
00:42:14.811 --> 00:42:17.120
George Washington,
George Washington's aids.

681
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:20.450
She rubs into hysterics and one of Arnold's aid said,

682
00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:25.190
I heard a shriek to me and sprang from my bed,
ran upstairs and there,

683
00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:30.191
met the miserable lady raving distracted with her hair disheveled and flowing

684
00:42:30.201 --> 00:42:34.130
about her neck.
Her morning gown with few other close

685
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.770
remained on her too few to be seen by a gentleman of the family,

686
00:42:39.771 --> 00:42:42.770
much less by many strangers.
Okay.

687
00:42:42.771 --> 00:42:44.900
These semi nude piggy Arnold,

688
00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:48.290
she sees me by the hand with this to me,

689
00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:51.500
distressing address and a wild look.
Colonel,

690
00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:56.570
have you ordered my child to be killed?
Okay,
Peggy raving,

691
00:42:56.630 --> 00:43:00.680
you know,
good to kill my baby.
She raved apparently for several days.

692
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.680
Generally speaking,
she could have sincerely been distressed,
right?

693
00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:06.500
Her husband just ran off.
Things are in trouble and Washington's there.

694
00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:10.640
The JIG is up.
People know about the plot,
her seeming insanity,

695
00:43:10.641 --> 00:43:13.970
raving about a murdered baby,
maybe not so sincere,

696
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:19.330
and Washington's aids were entirely sucked in to her distress is that Alexander

697
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:23.180
Hamilton put it and he was really suck right in there.
One moment.

698
00:43:23.181 --> 00:43:24.500
She raved another,

699
00:43:24.501 --> 00:43:28.940
she melted into tears in a matter that would have pierced insensibility itself.

700
00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.440
It was the most effecting scene I ever was witness to

701
00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:35.450
Melton.
Okay,

702
00:43:35.451 --> 00:43:40.010
so here again is Peggy using prevailing assumptions about women to her
advantage.

703
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:43.220
She's raving,
she's hysterical.
She's talking about her baby.

704
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.720
She's not wearing much clothing.
Barely.

705
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.640
There were many reasons for the men who were present,

706
00:43:49.641 --> 00:43:53.480
not to suspect that she's actually involved in the trees in this plot.

707
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:56.300
So Arnold is fleeing to a British ship.

708
00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.830
Andre is an American prisoner and piggy is being doted on by half a dozen

709
00:44:00.831 --> 00:44:05.780
American officers
by prolonging her hysteria.

710
00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.800
She was playing on what you knew would be their sense of gallantry to help her

711
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:14.660
and their emotional response to a distraught woman who's sobbing and semi nude.

712
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:17.660
So eventually she went home to her family in Philadelphia.

713
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.330
Andres fate was still up for grabs.

714
00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:24.530
He assumed that a gentleman and officer of his rank would never be accused of

715
00:44:24.531 --> 00:44:26.060
being a lowly spy,
and he would be.

716
00:44:26.061 --> 00:44:30.800
It's changed for an equivalent American officer,
but this was not to be,

717
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:33.870
but interestingly,
while he was in captivity,

718
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:37.980
Andre became much more than a British spy to the American officers who were

719
00:44:37.981 --> 00:44:40.980
holding him prisoner because during his captivity,

720
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:45.360
Washington and his aide spent a lot of time with him and came to consider him as

721
00:44:45.361 --> 00:44:48.960
the very model of what a gentlemen and an officer should be.

722
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:52.920
All of Washington's aids literally wanted to be Andre.

723
00:44:52.921 --> 00:44:54.750
Some of them actually said that in writing.

724
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:58.950
I wish I were a hundred he's so Kellen.
He's so brave.
He's

725
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.350
Andre really is like this,
this ideal.
He's handsome.

726
00:45:04.351 --> 00:45:08.280
He's aristocratically genteel.
He's stoic in the face of imminent death.

727
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.950
He's willingly sacrificing his life for his country,

728
00:45:10.951 --> 00:45:13.020
even if that country is England and not America.

729
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:17.160
Even Washington was taken with Andre and called him a gallant and accomplished

730
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:20.490
officer.
Despite such respect for Andre,

731
00:45:20.491 --> 00:45:24.180
his request to be shot as an officer and a gentleman rather than hanging as a

732
00:45:24.181 --> 00:45:25.350
spy was denied.

733
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:29.490
Washington couldn't grant that request without raising doubts about Andres guilt

734
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:30.563
as a spy.

735
00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:34.860
So October one 1780 was named as the day of Andre's execution.

736
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:37.350
On that day,
Andre dressed with extreme care.

737
00:45:37.351 --> 00:45:41.880
He went out of his way to show his calm fortitude and his gentility and his

738
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.680
dignity in the face of death.

739
00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:48.840
He was a true British officer to the last because apparently as he walked to the

740
00:45:48.841 --> 00:45:50.580
scaffold,
he said,
quote,

741
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:54.420
I am very much surprised to find your troops under such good discipline

742
00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:00.900
have to die.
Why are you Americans are quite disciplined,
aren't you?
Thank you,

743
00:46:00.901 --> 00:46:05.670
John Andre,
and your music is excellent.
He added,
thank you very much.

744
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.500
He was supposedly taken it back for a moment when he saw the gallows because up

745
00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:13.230
until that moment,
he really had been expecting a firing squad.

746
00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:16.530
He asked if he had to die in this manner,
told he would,

747
00:46:16.531 --> 00:46:17.940
he replied in a loud voice,

748
00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:21.240
which was remembered later by lots of people in their diaries and letters.

749
00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:24.510
I am reconciled to my fate,
but not to the mode.
Right?

750
00:46:24.511 --> 00:46:27.360
So the audience is like Sniff,
oh,
this is moving.

751
00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:31.680
When asked if he had last words,
he said,
I have nothing more to say.
Gentlemen,

752
00:46:31.681 --> 00:46:33.720
what you know you've been in practice last words in this age,

753
00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.640
I have nothing more to say gentlemen,

754
00:46:35.641 --> 00:46:40.290
but this you all bear me witness that I need my fate as a brave man.

755
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.210
At this,
the crowd began to sob

756
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:47.070
and then the trap door was released and that was the end of major John Andre.

757
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:51.720
Now his death inspired engravings songs,
poems,

758
00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:55.680
plays for years afterwards to many Americans.

759
00:46:55.681 --> 00:46:59.220
He remained this sort of ideal gentlemen and officer,
this noble,

760
00:46:59.221 --> 00:47:01.830
insensitive youth,
this sort of romantic hero.

761
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:05.640
He was beloved by young American officers who thought he was the superior,

762
00:47:05.641 --> 00:47:07.140
Genteel,
sophisticated,

763
00:47:07.141 --> 00:47:11.220
cultured individual in a way that they didn't necessarily consider themselves to

764
00:47:11.221 --> 00:47:15.270
be.
He somehow seemed better than them and to many,

765
00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:19.560
this was inextricably tied up with the fact that he was a British gentleman.

766
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:21.390
The best of that breed,

767
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:26.190
the extreme adoration of Andre and America shows how Americans still suffered

768
00:47:26.191 --> 00:47:30.790
from a little bit of an inferiority complex in relation to the British who still

769
00:47:30.791 --> 00:47:33.550
represented at least part we in their minds,

770
00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:37.900
the height of culture and sophistication.
Even now in a time of war,

771
00:47:37.901 --> 00:47:40.480
they're responding to Andre in this this way.

772
00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:43.480
Peggy eventually joined her husband in England,

773
00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:47.680
successfully playing her cards as a woman throughout to protect herself from the

774
00:47:47.681 --> 00:47:49.750
hatred that certainly was shown to her husband.

775
00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:53.200
And Arnold of all of them was really cursed forever,

776
00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:56.920
eternally hated largely of course,
because of his treason,

777
00:47:56.921 --> 00:47:58.630
his betrayal of the American cause.

778
00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:03.490
But partly in a sense also because in some ways his actions were understandable

779
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:05.320
to some people in America.

780
00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:09.130
He was someone who was ambitious and tried to raise his status.

781
00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:13.240
He was someone who spent too much money,
took too many risks to advance himself.

782
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:17.500
He was someone who was seduced by all that the British had to offer.
In a sense.

783
00:48:17.501 --> 00:48:19.540
He was a kind of every man gone wrong.

784
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:22.540
An example of the worst that was possible in this new,

785
00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.660
somewhat more egalitarian American world.

786
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:30.220
So part of the reason why Americans hated Arnold with such passion is that

787
00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.350
partly they understood that in some ways,

788
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:36.550
Arnold was them just in time.
Okay.

789
00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:41.710
That is the end of today's lecture.
We move on and coming weeks,

790
00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:45.540
uh,
to war to Washington,
uh,

791
00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:48.460
to sort of looking at how things are playing out on the battlefield.

792
00:48:48.461 --> 00:48:53.461
And then we will work our way towards articles of confederation and an actual

793
00:48:53.621 --> 00:48:56.530
constitution by the end of the semester.
We will make it there.

794
00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:57.730
See you on Thursday.
