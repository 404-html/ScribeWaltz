1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,540
We've been talking about the question,

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,600
what arguments might be offered for
the existence of a soul and a family of

3
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:11,480
arguments that were considering
initially our arguments that get known as

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,790
inference or inferences
to the best explanation.

5
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:17,600
The thought is that there's something
about us that needs explaining.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,440
We can't explain it in terms
of impure Lee physical terms.

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,090
And so we need to appeal to, we need
to posit the existence of a soul. Now,

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,850
I'll come back to that sort of
argument in just a minute, but,

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,510
uh,
let me,

10
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:37,510
let me bracket that for a moment and say
something about Plato a starting next

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,850
week, we're going to be looking
at Plato's dialogue, the Fito.

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,030
And so although I'll be saying
a great deal about the fetal,

13
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:45,020
once we turned to it,

14
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:49,520
I want to just take a minute or two and
say a couple of introductory remarks.

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,240
I don't know how many of you
have not read any Plato before,

16
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:57,680
but for those of you who haven't,
I actually think you're in for a treat.

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,220
Plato's not only one of the
greatest philosophers in history,

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:06,070
he wrote his philosophy, uh,
in the form of dialogues.

19
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:06,440
Uh,

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,440
that is to say plays a in which various
characters sit around or stand around

21
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:15,830
and argue about philosophical positions.

22
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:16,860
Yeah.

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,860
The particular dialogue that we're going
to be reading the Fito is set at the

24
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:27,600
death scene of Socrates.
Socrates's I'm sure you know,

25
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,030
Socrates was put on trial,

26
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:34,260
condemned to death for corrupting
the youth of Athens. Uh,

27
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,210
perhaps among other things for
arguing philosophy with them. Uh, and,

28
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,730
uh,
the,

29
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,410
he's given hemlock a poison
and he drinks it and he dies.

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,460
Now this is a historical
event. Amman, Socrates had a,

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,620
a circle of friends and disciples
that he would argue philosophy with.

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,560
One of his disciples was Plato.
Plato then, uh, you know,

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,810
grew up and wrote philosophical works.

34
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,530
Plato does not typically
appear in his own dialogues,

35
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:14,840
or if he does, he's only, there
is a minor character. In fact,

36
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:16,010
if I recall correctly,

37
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,100
Plato's mentioned as not being
there on the day that Socrates dies.

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,193
MMM.

39
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,150
So how do we know if you've got this play,

40
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:30,840
whose position is Plato's position?

41
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,830
And the answer to the short
answer is soccer cheese.

42
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,920
The character Socrates in the
play represents playdough,

43
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,780
the author of the plays
philosophical views. Now in fact,

44
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,970
if this were a class
in ancient philosophy,

45
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,980
we'd have to complicate that picture
because it's fairly clear that by late in

46
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:58,170
Plato's career,
Plato is,

47
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,950
has philosophical views that are very
much unlike the views of his teacher

48
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,910
Socrates.

49
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,040
And yet Plato continues to
not appear in the dialogue.

50
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,980
Socrates continues to be sort of the hero.

51
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,110
And so scholars debate,

52
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:19,490
you know which of the s the view is put
forward by Socrates in which ones have

53
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:24,901
the dialogues represent views that
belonged to the actual historical figure

54
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:26,380
soccer teas.

55
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,130
And which of the views put forward by
the character of Socrates in which of the

56
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:35,080
dialogues represent views
that are actually not held
by the historical Socrates,

57
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,900
but were instead held
by the historical Plato.

58
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,100
And we're merely put in the mouth
of the character of Socrates,

59
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,560
no scholars distinguished between the
early platonic dialogues that so called

60
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:52,110
Socratic dialogues where the thought
is those are the views of Socrates,

61
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,040
the actual historical figure.

62
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,240
And then there's the late dialogues
where even though Socrates appears,

63
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,410
most scholars believe those are probably
not the views that the historical

64
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:04,120
Socrates actually believed.

65
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,890
You have middle dialogues where you have
to worry about whose views are who's,

66
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,030
but, but we're not going to worry. We,

67
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:15,010
this is not a class in an ancient
philosophy, and so for our purposes,

68
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,210
we don't have to ask ourselves when soccer
teams in the dialogue says something,

69
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,450
is this a view that the dead man Socrates
actually would have held or is this

70
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,440
simply a view that the dead man Plato put
in the mouth of the character Socrates?

71
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,170
For our purposes,
it won't really matter.

72
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,440
I'll take every view that soccer t's
puts forward as a view of Plato's though,

73
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:41,620
I'll talk, I'll, I'll typically sort
of run back and forth sort of in a,

74
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,000
in a careless fashion.

75
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:47,560
I'll say Plato holds or Socrates argues
because for our purposes it's all the

76
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:51,820
same. But there's one other complication
that you've got to be warned about,

77
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:56,821
which is this because these are dialogs
and they take the form of philosophical

78
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:58,210
arguments,

79
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,870
people put forward views and then over
the course of the discussion changed

80
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,090
their minds about things and and they,

81
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:09,440
and they take them back and,

82
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,500
and maybe something similar is going on
when soccer gs said something because

83
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:19,330
after all it says isn't Plato saying,
you know,

84
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,970
here's what I believe explicitly.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,640
He's just writing a dramatic
play about philosophy.

86
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,320
And so sometimes we'll find
ourselves thinking, you know,

87
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:33,280
there's an argument here that Socrates
is putting forward but maybe it's not a

88
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:37,810
very good argument and it will at least
be worth pausing periodically to ask

89
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:38,644
ourselves.

90
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,120
Maybe Plato realized it
wasn't a very good argument.

91
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,330
We can often better understand the
dialogues by seeing Socrates as putting

92
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:55,501
forward certain positions that he does
not think are all together adequate and

93
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:58,280
he modifies them,
revises them,

94
00:05:58,281 --> 00:06:02,900
or introduces new positions to deal with
some of the difficulties that he was

95
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:06,320
setting himself up to be open to earlier.
They say,

96
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,200
don't worry about any
of those details now,

97
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,470
but it's a point to keep in
mind as you read the dialogue.

98
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:15,500
So that's all I really wanted to say.
By way of introduction,

99
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,800
you should start reading
the Thedo for next week.

100
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,030
We'll be talking about the fito starting
sometime next week and we'll continue

101
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,250
the discussion of the Fito,
uh,

102
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,460
for at least a bit of maybe
all of the week after that.

103
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,660
In the case of Plato,
I'm going to make an exception.

104
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:35,750
Normally I will mention our readings,

105
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,850
but I won't spend a lot of time
actually discussing them in detail.

106
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,810
That's why you have to think of the
readings as complimenting the lectures or

107
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:49,310
think of the lectures as complementing
the readings. I'm not just giving,

108
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,140
you know, the cliff notes as it were,
uh, of, uh, of, of the readings.

109
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,310
Nonetheless,
in the case of of the Pheto,

110
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,340
I am going to spend more
time actually saying,

111
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,320
here's what I think the
first main argument is.

112
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:09,890
Let's try to reconstruct it in terms
of its premises, in his conclusions.

113
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,510
Here are some objections I raised.

114
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,720
Here's then the next
argument that Plato offers.

115
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,240
Let's try to get that up
and premises even there.

116
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,070
I won't be spending time reading out loud,
long passages from the Fito,

117
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,750
but in some sense I'll be giving a closer
commentary of the Fito then I'll do

118
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,100
for the other readings.
So,

119
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,910
so what you shouldn't do is
start reading it from next week.

120
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,610
The, that topic of the
Fito. As I say, it's,

121
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,050
it's set on Socrates last day.
You know,

122
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,080
at the end of the dialogue he
drinks to hemlock and, and he dies.

123
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:47,360
And perhaps unsurprisingly,

124
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:52,450
what he does with his friends up until
that moment is he argues about the

125
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:58,040
immortality of the soul. Quite
strikingly, Socrates is not upset.

126
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,650
He's not worried about the
fact that he's going to die.

127
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:05,180
He actually welcomes this in a certain
way, uh, because he believes his,

128
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:07,760
his soul is immortal.
Uh,

129
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:12,761
and so in addition to
philosophical arguments for
and against the existence and

130
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:16,410
the mortality of the soul, uh,
we end the dialogue with a,

131
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,640
with a quite moving a death scene.
One of the sort of, you know,

132
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,290
great death scenes, if we could call
it that, of, of Western civilization.

133
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,050
As I said,
that's all for next week.

134
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,680
So let's return now to the question,

135
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:35,480
how might we argue for the
existence of the soul? Initially,

136
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:40,370
last time we considered a set of, or a
subset of arguments that basically said,

137
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:44,570
look, there's gotta be more to
us than just material objects.

138
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:49,220
People can't just be machines because
machines can't reason machines can't

139
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:53,960
think. And I said, that doesn't
seem to be a compelling argument.

140
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:56,580
After all chess playing computers,

141
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,080
it seems can reason they have beliefs
about what I'm likely to do next.

142
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,770
They have desires about the goals
that they're trying to achieve.

143
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,620
They reasoned about how best to defeat me.
And it's,

144
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,190
and it's worth pointing out that it's
a point that I didn't make last time.

145
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,100
It's worth pointing out
that what the computers,

146
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:16,570
at least the best chess playing
computers don't do. Indeed.

147
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,470
No computer actually does this.
You might,

148
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,410
you might think that what a computer
with a chess playing computer does is

149
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:27,380
justice. It calculates every
possible branch, you know,

150
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,650
every possible game from here on out.
And then it sort of works backwards.

151
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:33,240
Or these are the ones where or when.

152
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,650
And so it only makes the moves where it
can sort of look ahead, 20 moves, right?

153
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:40,650
And see which branches
have the computer winning.

154
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,670
That is not the way chess playing programs
work for the simple reason that the

155
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:51,981
number of possible chess games is so
huge that computers can't calculate it.

156
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,230
They'd be busy for thousands of years.
I mean, we can do that sort of thing.

157
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,960
When you play Tic Tac toe with your, you
know, seven year old nephew or niece,

158
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:06,800
you just look ahead and work backwards.
Well, if I do that, he'll do that.

159
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:08,910
He'll do that and then he wins.
So I won't do that. Right.

160
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:14,040
But we can't do that with chess.
There's just too many games.

161
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,600
So how do chess playing
programs in particularly the
best chess playing programs?

162
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,070
How do they work? Well, they
play chess the same way you do.

163
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,730
They have various ideas about which pieces
are more powerful and so they're more

164
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:30,990
important to protect.

165
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,120
They've got various ideas about which
strategies tend to be successful,

166
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,510
what sorts of dangers
come along with them.

167
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,760
If you're a serious chess player,

168
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,880
you might study some of the Great Games
of chess history and indeed when they

169
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:52,840
program these things, uh, the
programmers will feed in, you know,

170
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,380
gain after game after game of the Great
Chess Games in history and then arm.

171
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:03,381
With all of that you sort of do your
best and when you'll lose a game you kind

172
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:07,350
of make a mental note to yourself
that really screwed me up.

173
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:10,710
Let me try something different next time.
And you avoid those sorts of moves.

174
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,050
That's how chess playing
programs work as well.

175
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,660
Jumping ahead and let me,

176
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,940
let me just make a remark about this
because there's going to be relevant for

177
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:23,610
something I'll get to in a couple
of minutes. What this means,

178
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:28,611
what this w that the implication is that
if you're playing a great chess playing

179
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:30,444
program,

180
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,040
it's not as though the way to tell what
it's going to do is to study its program

181
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,420
and think it through.

182
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,740
The the people who design these programs,

183
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,920
presumably fairly decent
chess players themselves,

184
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,790
the people who designed these programs,
when they're playing the programs,

185
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,210
they're not thinking to themselves,
let's see,

186
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:02,080
I programmed this computer so that when
I move a queen forward that to this

187
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,880
space,
it should come out with the bishop.

188
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,240
That's hopeless because the program is
constantly revising its strategies in

189
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:12,520
light of what's worked and
what hasn't worked in the past.

190
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,640
When the programmers play these
programs or indeed when anybody,

191
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,570
a good chess player plays these programs,

192
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,920
the best way to try to beat
them as simply ask yourself,

193
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,610
what's the best move to make right now?

194
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,500
The odds are that computer's gone
and make the best possible move.

195
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,830
Treat the computer as though it
were just a great chess player

196
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,490
and indeed the best programs
are great chess players.

197
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,780
And then there was a period of time in
which although they were decent chess

198
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:53,280
playing programs, couldn't beat
the best chess playing humans.

199
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,670
That ended some years ago when the best
programs began to beat a grand masters.

200
00:12:59,660 --> 00:12:59,850
Uh,

201
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,290
and now it's in fact the case of the best
programs can beat pretty much anybody.

202
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,120
Uh, in the, the current
world champion of chess.

203
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:14,450
I think Vladimir Kramnik was defeated
in December by a chess playing program.

204
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:22,550
So no crop chrom Nick's simply treating
this as an awesome opponent and that's

205
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:27,840
the best way to deal with
these things. All right, so

206
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,350
bracket some of those
thoughts for a moment.

207
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,340
We'll come back to them a little bit
later when we start talking about the

208
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:36,690
question. Could machines be creative? No.

209
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,730
Tipping my hand seems pretty clear that
that seems like the right thing to say

210
00:13:40,731 --> 00:13:45,140
about these chess playing programs.
So we had the question,

211
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,720
couldn't machines,
could machines reason?

212
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,170
And although we don't have machines that
can reason about a lot of subjects yet

213
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:52,130
it seems pretty clear.

214
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:56,570
It seems like the natural thing to suggest
machines can reason or at least some

215
00:13:56,571 --> 00:13:57,404
areas.

216
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,470
And so it doesn't seem
plausible to suggest that we
people must not be physical,

217
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,730
merely physical. Because after all we can
reason to no machine can reason. Nope.

218
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,200
Machines could reason.

219
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,510
But this prompts a different move on
the part of the defender of souls.

220
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:15,550
Perhaps the,

221
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,360
the argument shouldn't be we have to
believe in souls because no mere physical

222
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:21,530
object could reason.

223
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,510
Perhaps the argument should be we have
to believe in souls because no mirror,

224
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,750
physical object,
no machine could feel

225
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,250
no. We have emotions
we love, we're afraid,

226
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,570
we're worried.

227
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:38,950
Okay,

228
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,590
we'll get elated,
we get depressed.

229
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,790
So perhaps the arguments
should go, yeah, yeah.

230
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,850
Thinking that's the sort of thing
I'm machine can do. You know,

231
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:50,200
we call them thinking machines,

232
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,590
but feeling that's the sort
of thing no machine could do.

233
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,850
No purely physical objects could
feel anything, could have emotions.

234
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,110
And so since we clearly do feel things,

235
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,990
there must be more to us
than a physical object.

236
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,283
Now

237
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,300
I think it is plausible to suggest
that unlike the case of, you know,

238
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:19,160
chess playing computers, we don't
yet have machines that feel things.

239
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,890
So, but the question isn't
do we, the question is,

240
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,370
could there be a machine
that could feel something,

241
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,930
could have an emotion of some sort.

242
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:35,660
So let's go a little science fictiony
and think about some of the robots that

243
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:38,510
have been shown in science fiction movies,

244
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:41,900
some of the computer programs that have
been shown in science fiction movies,

245
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,110
science fiction novels,
or what have you.

246
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,820
When I was a kid, there was a
television show called lost in space.

247
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,290
I'm afraid I've forgotten
the name of, uh, the,

248
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,800
the robot that was on that show. Uh, but
as it was Katie, I was a TV show. And so,

249
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:01,600
you know, sure enough,
every single episode,

250
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:06,630
some new dramatic danger would take
place and the robot would start,

251
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:11,580
you know, whizzing and binging
and shout out, oh, danger,

252
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,430
commander Robin. So danger will Robinson.
That was a danger. Will Robinson.

253
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,000
It seemed as though the robot was worried.

254
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,250
More recent example number of you have
probably read some of Douglas Adams is

255
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,870
books, the hitchhiker's guide to the
galaxy. Uh, and, uh, the sequels to that.

256
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:34,730
There's a robot, uh, in, in
those books. Marvin, who's, uh,

257
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,660
depressed, uh, I think is the simple
word about it. He sort of, you know,

258
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,320
he's very smart. He thought about the
universe, thinks life is pointless. Uh,

259
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,640
and uh, he asks depressed,
he talks to another robot,

260
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:51,080
depresses the other robot, the other
robot commit suicide. Um, all right.

261
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:56,060
Seems natural to ascribe
depression to Marvin the robot.

262
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:57,530
That's how he behaves.

263
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,960
Okay.

264
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,290
Or my favorite example,
uh,

265
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:07,300
the movie 2001, a space odyssey.
Now I've got to tell you,

266
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:11,530
for those of you who've not seen this
movie, I'm about to spoil it. All right?

267
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:16,090
So you cover your ears
in 2001,

268
00:17:16,091 --> 00:17:17,200
a space odyssey.

269
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,980
We get some kind of indication that
there's life on another planet.

270
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:25,981
It's all various mysterious and we send
off a us a spaceship to investigate,

271
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:33,130
you know, the markings, the, the, the
radio signals from the other place.

272
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,580
This is a very important mission.

273
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:41,670
And so there is a a computer program
named howl that helps run the ship and

274
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:48,880
takes a lot of the burdens off of the
part of the human astronauts who are on

275
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:53,190
the ship.
How's got the goal in terms of reasoning,

276
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:54,300
desires and so forth and so on.

277
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,720
How's got the goal of making
sure the mission is successful,

278
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,810
but how thinks to himself fairly
plausibly humans really screw things up.

279
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,800
This is a very important mission.

280
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,790
Let's kill the humans to make
sure they don't screw things up.

281
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,523
Yeah.

282
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,970
One of the astronauts discovering the
plot attempts to stop how and proceeds to

283
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:26,140
do and the only thing he can do
to defend himself against how,

284
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,200
which is shut down the program basically
killing if we can talk that way.

285
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,210
Killing how meanwhile,
as all this is going on,

286
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,200
howl and Dave, the human, uh,
astronaut are talking to each other.

287
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,720
How realizes what's going on?

288
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,280
How tries to stop Dave
understandably enough.

289
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,510
And how says as day begins
to shut down house circuits,

290
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,310
I'm afraid. I'm afraid.
Dave, what's he afraid of?

291
00:18:57,311 --> 00:18:58,420
He's afraid of dying.

292
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,190
Seems perfectly natural.
Right?

293
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,280
To a scribe.
Fear to how,

294
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:11,281
how is behaving in exactly the way you
would expect him to behave or it to

295
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:15,040
behave if it felt fear,

296
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,930
it's got reason to be afraid.
It's behaving appropriately.

297
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:24,070
It's telling us that it's afraid.
It seems natural to say,

298
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:29,130
how's afraid now you could continue
to sort of fill in examples like this.

299
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,540
As I say,
of course they're all science fiction,

300
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,890
but the fact that we can grasp and you
know it says that we go running away

301
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:40,210
saying, oh no, this was outrageous.
Right. This then it makes no sense.

302
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:42,670
I think the computer could have said,
I'm afraid.

303
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:45,610
It makes no sense to think that it could
try to kill the people who are trying

304
00:19:45,611 --> 00:19:47,020
to shut it down and so forth.

305
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,000
Okay.

306
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,200
Oh, that seems to me to be
prejudice. As I said last time,

307
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:58,650
the natural inclination here is
to say these computer programs,

308
00:19:58,841 --> 00:20:00,850
these robots are feeling emotion.

309
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,330
Okay,

310
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,270
but there's no particular reason to
think there's anything going on there.

311
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:09,170
Then the circuits,
they're just physical objects.

312
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,940
Programs on machines.

313
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,970
Yeah.

314
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,270
If that's right,
if that's the right thing to say,

315
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,450
than what we have to say is we don't need
to appeal to souls in order to explain

316
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,920
emotions and feelings.

317
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,640
Physical objects could
have mere physical objects,

318
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:29,860
could have emotions and feelings,

319
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,460
so we have no reason to posit
the existence of a soul.

320
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,640
Now I think the best
response on the part of the,

321
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,760
the dual list to this reply is to
distinguish two aspects of feelings to of

322
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:48,550
emotions.

323
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:54,300
There's the behavioral
aspect of feeling fear.

324
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,570
Let's say
the,

325
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:04,230
the behavioral aspect is when you're
aware in the environment of something that

326
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:07,190
poses a danger to you know,

327
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,170
that will harm you or destroy you or in
the case of a computer program turn you

328
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:15,950
off. Then you take various
kinds of behaviors in,

329
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:16,600
in a,

330
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,600
in the opposition to that to try to
disarm the danger to try to neutralize it.

331
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:28,030
This is just a matter of
beliefs, goals, responses,

332
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,730
planning,
the sort of thing that we already saw.

333
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:35,590
The chess playing computer can do
that behavioral side of emotion.

334
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,030
Okay.

335
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,840
Seems pretty plausible to
think robots could do that.

336
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:45,780
Physical objects could do that.
And here's what,

337
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,490
here's the crucial
point of this objection.

338
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:54,170
There's another side or another
aspect to emotions and feelings.

339
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,920
It's the,

340
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,790
it's the sensation of
what it's feeling like.

341
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,350
That's why we call them feelings
after all, what it's feeling like.

342
00:22:04,351 --> 00:22:07,230
I'm the inside as it were.

343
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,680
While all this behavioral
stuff's going on,

344
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:18,230
when I'm afraid I have this certain sort
of clammy feeling or my heart's going

345
00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:24,110
pounding Lee, you know your, your blood
is racing, right? When you're afraid,

346
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:27,090
you got this sinking feeling in
the stomach when you're depressed.

347
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,680
There are these, well, we could
call them experiences though.

348
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:35,760
The word experience is also somewhat
ambiguous. So we'll use it for the moment.

349
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,960
There's an experience that
goes along with each emotion.

350
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,480
There's what it feels like
to you when you're afraid,

351
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,780
what it feels like to you when you're
worried or depressed or joyful or in low.

352
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:57,950
Okay?

353
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,920
And the thought, and I think this
is a pretty powerful thought,

354
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,040
is that even if the robots
are behaving behaviourally,

355
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,700
they've got the behavior
side of the emotions down.

356
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,010
They don't have the feeling side at all.

357
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,820
Now,
once you start thinking these thoughts,

358
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:28,540
there's no need to restrict
yourself to emotions. The, the,

359
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,930
the missing stuff.

360
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,320
The missing thing is there in all
sorts of familiar humdrum ways as well.

361
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:40,680
So No, right now I'm looking at, you
know, the chairs in the auditorium.

362
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:44,120
There are some kind of shade
of blue. Think about, you know,

363
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,970
look at someplace in the room
where the curtains with their red.

364
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,340
Think about what it's like to see red,

365
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,820
the sensation of seeing red.

366
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,130
Now again,

367
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,400
we've got to distinguish between the,

368
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:06,230
what I'll continue to call the
behavioral side of seeing red and the

369
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,020
experiential side of seeing red.

370
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,000
It's easy enough for us to build a
machine that can tell red from blue, no,

371
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:18,290
just checks and sees what kind of light
frequencies are bouncing off the object.

372
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,970
And so we can build a machine that
could sort red balls from blue balls.

373
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:27,660
My son has a little robot
that can do that. Still.

374
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,050
When you think to yourself,
what's the,

375
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,600
what's going on inside the machine?
What does it feel like to be the machine?

376
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,560
While it's looking at, well, I've got
this little light sensors, you know,

377
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,080
pointed at the,
the red ball.

378
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,130
Does it have the sensation of seeing red?

379
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,490
What I suppose you want to say?
Certainly what I want to say is no, no,

380
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,450
it doesn't have that sensation
at all. The it, it's, it's, it's,

381
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,290
it's, it's sorting things
based on the light frequencies,

382
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,060
but it doesn't have the experience
of seeing red. You know,

383
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,820
this is what we're trying to get
at here is it can be very elusive,

384
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:07,710
but I imagine most of
you are familiar with it.

385
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:12,860
It's the sort of thing you wonder about
when you ask yourself if somebody was

386
00:25:13,141 --> 00:25:14,640
born blind,

387
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,340
could he possibly know what
it's like to see color?

388
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,950
He might be a scientist and know all
sorts of things about how light works.

389
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,790
No.

390
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:33,570
The such and such frequencies in which
objects you hand them an apple and I'll

391
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:36,870
say, oh, must be very red. Right?
Maybe he points his little,

392
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,080
his little light detector at, at and
an, and it reads out. It says, you know,

393
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:43,170
this is such and such a frequency.
Says, oh, this is a very red apple.

394
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,750
Much better than that tomato or whatever.
But for all that we've got the notion,

395
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,150
not only is he not seen red,

396
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:55,230
he can't even imagine what it's like
to see red never having had these

397
00:25:55,231 --> 00:25:59,130
experiences
and once you start to see this,

398
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:03,630
we realized of course our life
is filled with this aspect.

399
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,910
Things have colors, things have
sounds, things have smells.

400
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,080
There's the qualitative
aspect of experience.

401
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,530
Yeah,

402
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,980
and the point that I started with earlier
about sort of the internal aspect of

403
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:24,430
emotions is it's not just out there,
but inside as well.

404
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:28,270
We have certain kinds of
sensations inside our body.

405
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:29,780
Yeah.

406
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,560
The characteristics,
sensation of fear or joy or depression.

407
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,631
All right,

408
00:26:35,631 --> 00:26:40,370
so they're suggesting
there might be this what,

409
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,400
what no physical object can get cause
no physical object can get it all is the

410
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:51,510
qualitative aspect of experience.

411
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,990
That's the aspect that we're after.
When we ask ourselves,

412
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,020
what's it like to see red?

413
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,370
What's it like to smell coffee or tea?

414
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,900
Taste pineapple.
Now it's pretty full.

415
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,040
Philosophers sometimes qualities thing
call these things [inaudible] because of

416
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,530
the, the notion of the
qualitative aspects of things.

417
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,810
Our experiences have
qualitative properties

418
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,530
and the suggestion then
might be no physical object.

419
00:27:26,531 --> 00:27:31,531
No mere machine could possibly
have qualitative experience.

420
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:39,400
But we've got it.
So we're no mere physical object.

421
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,050
We're no mirror machine.

422
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,290
All right now the, that's the
objection. That's pretty good objection.

423
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:52,720
And then the question is what can
the physical essay in response, no,

424
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:57,790
the best possible response would be for
the physical list to say here's how to

425
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:04,091
build a machine that can be conscious
in this sense that is have a qualitative

426
00:28:07,341 --> 00:28:11,120
experience. Here's how
to do it. Here's how to,

427
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,210
just like we can explain in materialistic
physicalist terms how to get desires

428
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:20,800
and beliefs in the behavioral stuff down.
Here's how to get the,

429
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,560
the feeling qualitative
aspect of things down too.

430
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,250
It would be best if the physicalist
could give us that kind of story.

431
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:33,140
And I think the truth of the matter
has to be, I think, I think the, the,

432
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:36,920
the answer right now is we don't
know how to give that story

433
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,230
consciousness.
If what we mean by consciousnesses,

434
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:46,430
this qualitative aspect of,

435
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,470
of our mental life consciousness
remains a pretty big mystery.

436
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,360
We don't know how to explain
it in physicalist terms
and it's because of that,

437
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,620
that I think we shouldn't be dismissive
of the dualist when the dualist says

438
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:11,100
we've got to believe in
souls in order to explain it.

439
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,870
We shouldn't be dismissive,

440
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,620
but that's not to say that I
think we should be convinced

441
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:27,540
because it's one thing to say we don't
yet know how to explain consciousness in

442
00:29:28,871 --> 00:29:29,890
physical terms.

443
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,970
It's another thing to say we won't ever
be able to explain consciousness in

444
00:29:37,841 --> 00:29:42,190
physical terms.
If we had

445
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,550
the ladder,
okay,

446
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:49,490
excuse me. If we had the, the bold claim,

447
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,550
okay.

448
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:56,550
That no physical object
could see red taste,

449
00:29:57,221 --> 00:29:58,054
honey.

450
00:29:59,270 --> 00:29:59,640
Okay.

451
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,760
Then we'd have to conclude since we can
do all that we're not a physical object

452
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:04,140
or not merely a physical object.

453
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:05,960
Okay.

454
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,390
But I don't think we're yet
in a position to say that.

455
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,740
I think the simple fact of the
matter is we don't know enough about

456
00:30:12,741 --> 00:30:17,741
consciousness yet to know whether or not
it can be explained in physical terms.

457
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:24,170
When I think about this situation,
I, an analogy always occurs to me.

458
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,320
Imagine that we are somewhere in let's
say the 14th century trying to understand

459
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,030
life,
the life of plants a,

460
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,300
it is a living thing.
And we ask ourselves,

461
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:43,630
could it possibly be that life could
be explained in material terms?

462
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:48,050
It's going to seem very mysterious to us.

463
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,850
How could it be when we think of the kinds
of examples of material machines that

464
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,280
we've got available to
us in the 14th century?

465
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,480
And I try to imagine what would somebody
in the 14th century think to himself or

466
00:31:01,341 --> 00:31:06,341
herself when he entertains the possibility
that a plant might just be a machine.

467
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:12,500
And, and then I have this little image of,
uh, some, some plant made out of gears,

468
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:16,760
right? And the gears begin turning
and the bud opens dot, dot, dot, dot,

469
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:21,500
and and the, and the person's just going
to say, my God, that wouldn't be alive.

470
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:26,750
So it's pretty obvious that
no machine could be alive.

471
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:30,230
No material object could be alive.
In order to explain life,

472
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,790
we have to appeal to something
more than just Adams.

473
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,610
He didn't have Adam's but you
know more than just matter.

474
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,880
Life requires something in material
above and beyond matter to explain it.

475
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,960
That would have been an understandable
position to come to in the 14th century,

476
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,280
but it would have been wrong.

477
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:58,510
We didn't have a clue back then how
to explain life in material terms,

478
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,920
but that didn't mean it couldn't be done.

479
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,060
Okay.

480
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:11,060
I am inclined to think the same thing's
true right now for us and consciousness.

481
00:32:13,771 --> 00:32:15,330
I know that are,
there are theories out there,

482
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,470
but my best take is we're pretty
much like in the 14th century,

483
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:25,160
we don't really have a clue yet or not
much of a clue as to how you could even

484
00:32:25,261 --> 00:32:26,520
so much as begin to it.

485
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,130
It's not that merely that we
don't have the details worked out.

486
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:34,340
We don't even have the picture in broad
strokes as far as consciousness is

487
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,680
concerned.
How it can be done in physical terms

488
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:44,710
but not seen how it's possible is
not the same thing as seen that it's

489
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:50,960
impossible.

490
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,820
If the dualist comes and says,

491
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:00,080
can't you just see that
it's not remotely possible?

492
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:05,081
It's not conceivably possible for a
purely physical object to have experiences

493
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,380
to have quality.
What I want to say is no,

494
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:14,120
I don't see that it's impossible.
I admit I don't see how to do it,

495
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,770
but I don't see that it's impossible,

496
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,980
so I don't feel forced to
posit the existence of a soul.

497
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:27,260
Of course, the the, the fan of
the soul could come back and say,

498
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,740
but that's not fair.
The question isn't,

499
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:36,350
is this explanation impossible?
The question is just,

500
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,690
who's got the better explanation?

501
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,160
You guys can offer any kind of
explanation at all yet I can offer an

502
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:49,490
explanation.
How is consciousness possible?

503
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,020
We have souls.

504
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,610
Souls are really very different from
physical objects and so they can be

505
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:56,444
conscious.

506
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,080
Yeah.

507
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,460
But at this point I think it's crucial
to remember the point that it's not just

508
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:08,030
the question, you know,
who's got an explanation,

509
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,160
but who's got the better explanation?

510
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,690
And before we say that the soul
views got the better explanation,

511
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:19,900
we have to ask ourselves just how
much of an explanation is it to say,

512
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,261
Oh,

513
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:25,460
I can explain consciousness consciousness
is housed not in the body but in the

514
00:34:25,461 --> 00:34:29,930
soul. Okay. How exactly is it
that a soul can be conscious?

515
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,430
We ask and then the sole
theory says, well, um,

516
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,210
er, uh, it just can,

517
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,840
that's not really much of an explanation.

518
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:46,990
I don't feel I've got any sort of account
going here as to how consciousness

519
00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:50,030
works.
Even if I become a dualist.

520
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,480
If the dualist where to start off on us,
you know,

521
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:55,930
some elaborate theory of consciousness.
Well,

522
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:59,960
other z sorts of soul structures and
those sorts of souls structures and these

523
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:03,710
create these sensations and those create
those sensations. And here's a theory.

524
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,130
Well then I'll begin to take
it seriously as an explanation.

525
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,730
But if all the soul theorist is just
saying is Nana, you guys can't explain it.

526
00:35:13,731 --> 00:35:17,090
And I can,
because I say this is an explanation,

527
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,660
then I find myself wanting to
say that's not really any better.

528
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,840
That's no improvement at all.
There was a question or comment.

529
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,133
Yeah.

530
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,040
Capabilities to explain the consciousness.
Is it not also possible

531
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,180
technological capabilities to detect soul.

532
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,950
So the question was,

533
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:51,050
first was the accusation
before the question that I'm
holding on sort of double

534
00:35:51,051 --> 00:35:55,910
standard. I'm defending bar. I'm
defending the physical list by saying,

535
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,440
you know, don't blame us. We
don't know how to explain it yet.

536
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,720
Why aren't I allowing the sole
theory to say don't blame us.

537
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,690
We don't know how to explain it yet.
Good question.

538
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,090
And my answer is in some sense I
think this one's a tie. All right.

539
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,570
I think the sole theorists
doesn't have an explanation.

540
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:26,650
The physical theorist doesn't have an
explanation as far as I can see right now,

541
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:31,460
nobody's got a good explanation
about how consciousness works.

542
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,770
It's a bit of a mystery right now.

543
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,780
So I don't mean,
I hope I haven't been doing this.

544
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:41,180
It's not so much a double
standard is needed. It's a tie.

545
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:46,340
But notice if it's a tie that doesn't
give us what we were looking for.

546
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,520
What we're looking for after all was some
reason to believe in souls and if the

547
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:55,670
best the sole theorists can say is,
I can't explain it and neither can you,

548
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,070
that's not a reason to believe this side.

549
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,640
We already believe there are bodies.

550
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:04,870
Okay,

551
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,740
we all ready know bodies can
do some pretty amazing things.

552
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,260
The question we're asking is,

553
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:16,410
is there a good reason to add
to our list of things there are.

554
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,100
Is there a good reason to add the soul,
something immaterial,

555
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,300
and if the best that the
soul theorist has is,

556
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,610
maybe we need this to explain something
that I don't see how you guys can

557
00:37:30,611 --> 00:37:34,270
explain. Maybe this would help
do, I can't quite see how either.

558
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:39,640
That's not a very compelling argument.
So what I'm,

559
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,840
what I'm inclined to think with regard
to this particular strand of this

560
00:37:43,841 --> 00:37:47,920
particular version of the
argument is the jury's still out.

561
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,840
Maybe at the end of the day we'll give
it our best. We'll decide, you know,

562
00:37:52,841 --> 00:37:55,450
you can't explain consciousness
in physical terms.

563
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,680
We'll begin to work out some sort
of alternative, immaterial theory.

564
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,300
Okay.

565
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,790
Maybe at the end of the day we will
decide we need to believe in souls,

566
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:08,560
but right now I don't think the
evidence supports that conclusion.

567
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:09,990
Okay.

568
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,490
Still there's other possibilities.

569
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,093
Yeah.

570
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,940
Consider creativity.

571
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,720
Here's another version of an argument
that goes from inference to the best

572
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:26,460
explanation. Creativity. It
says people can be creative.

573
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,810
Yeah. We, we write new pieces
of music. We write poems,

574
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,410
we prove things in mathematics that
I've never been proven before. We,

575
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,940
we find new ways to prove these
theorems or what have you,

576
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:41,380
and we can be creative.
No mere machine can be creative,

577
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,360
so we must be something
more than a mere machine.

578
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:51,420
Okay.

579
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,650
Well, again, the question's going to be,

580
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:57,330
could it be the case that there could
be a physical object that's creative

581
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,560
and I'm inclined to think yes.
In fact,

582
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:06,150
I already suggested as much when I
talked about the chess playing computers,

583
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,970
that chess playing computer programs.

584
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,210
Okay.

585
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:14,630
Think of moves.
Think of strategies.

586
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,970
No one's thought of before
in the most straightforward,

587
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:23,910
natural meaning of the term.
We'd have to say no. When the,

588
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:28,550
I think the program that the beat the
world champion was called Deep Fritz.

589
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,980
So in deep Fritz beat Kramnik,

590
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,120
it was being creative and it made a move
the chronic didn't think of and perhaps

591
00:39:35,121 --> 00:39:38,510
it nobody had perhaps no chess
game before it had this move.

592
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,630
Computers can do other sorts
of things of this sort. Uh,

593
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:50,660
there are mathematical
theorem proving programs.

594
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,100
No,
no.

595
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,830
Some of these things can prove things
that you know mathematically way over my

596
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:59,400
head. But let's take something
simple like the Pythagorean Theorem,

597
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:04,290
which we all learned in high school and
we learned how to prove the Pythagorean

598
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,540
theorem in Euclidean geometry,

599
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:09,750
starting with the various axioms of
you'll clean look Euclidean geometry,

600
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,180
you know, bump up, up,
up, up, up, up a bomb.

601
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:16,770
This proves Pythagorean theorem and it
turns out there's a variety of proofs of

602
00:40:16,771 --> 00:40:19,530
the Pythagorean theorem.
And in fact,

603
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,940
computer program has come up with
a proof that as far as was known,

604
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,390
nobody in the world had
ever come up with before.

605
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,220
Well,
other than prejudice,

606
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:34,570
what would stop us from saying
the program was being creative,

607
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:41,160
not just any sort of mathematical things
like chess or, or math. Uh, there are,

608
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:41,671
as you know,

609
00:40:41,671 --> 00:40:46,380
programs that can write music and I
don't just mean throw out some random

610
00:40:46,381 --> 00:40:49,560
assortment of notes,
programs that,

611
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:51,750
uh,
you know,

612
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,990
can produce music I have that
we recognize as music that had,

613
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,060
have melodic structure and develop themes,
resolve

614
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,200
music that nobody's heard before.

615
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:08,490
Why not say the machine is creative?

616
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,240
What other than prejudice
would stop us from saying that?

617
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,750
So if,
if the argument's going to be,

618
00:41:16,751 --> 00:41:20,860
we need to posit the existence of a soul
in order to explain creativity. Again,

619
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:25,350
that just seems wrong.
Well,

620
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,880
there's a question comment

621
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,111
this,

622
00:41:33,111 --> 00:41:38,111
just like a scientific way to make a
machine produce something that pass hasn't

623
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:39,803
been used before.

624
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,930
But the question was when I
talk about creativity here,

625
00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:46,920
am I trying to build in some appeal to
the feeling that we may have when we're

626
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:50,430
being creative? And the answer
is no. All I had in mind.

627
00:41:50,431 --> 00:41:53,130
As you notice just in talking
about the creativity issue,

628
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,310
I just have in mind
producing something new,

629
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:00,690
producing something that hasn't been
around before and most particularly

630
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,430
producing something that your programmers
didn't go already have in mind.

631
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:06,930
Remember,

632
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:11,910
it's not as though the people who designed
the chess playing programs can beat

633
00:42:11,911 --> 00:42:15,060
it.
The chess playing program makes moves.

634
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,580
These guys haven't thought of.

635
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:19,823
Yeah.

636
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:23,840
All right. The creativity
argument may not work, but,

637
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,330
but there's something that sort of
immediately comes on. It's heels.

638
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,860
Even if we could build a program,

639
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:34,310
even if we have built
programs that can be creative,

640
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,700
they can do things that
nobody's thought of before.

641
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:45,650
Oh, the program is doing
is following its program.

642
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,160
Right?

643
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:51,160
It's just a series of lines of code and
and and the robot or the computer or

644
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:55,310
what have you is just,
you know,

645
00:42:55,430 --> 00:43:00,430
automatically mechanically following
the code commands of the program.

646
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:10,820
We might say even if we are smart
enough to build programs that can buy

647
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,590
mechanistically following the program,
do things we've never thought of.

648
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:20,460
Still all the computer can do.

649
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:25,610
All the robot can do is automatically
necessarily mechanically follow the

650
00:43:28,741 --> 00:43:33,600
program.
It doesn't have free will,

651
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,290
but we have freewill.

652
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,020
So here's a new argument for
the existence of the soul.

653
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:44,680
Okay?

654
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,100
People have freewill.

655
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,270
Yeah,

656
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:51,990
no,
merely mechanical objects.

657
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,300
No robot,

658
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,560
no computer could have free will.

659
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:00,350
Okay.

660
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,330
But since we've got freewill,

661
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:07,420
we must be something more
than a merely physical object.

662
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,740
There must be something extra,
something immaterial about us.

663
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,023
The soul.

664
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,533
Yeah.

665
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:21,750
So maybe that's why we need to believe
in souls in order to explain freewill.

666
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:25,143
Now

667
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,350
th th th the subject,
freewill is a very,

668
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,450
very common subject.
Consciousness is a very complicated,

669
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:39,060
no one could have an entire
semester devoted to thinking
about the philosophical

670
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:40,920
problem of consciousness.

671
00:44:40,921 --> 00:44:44,130
And indeed as it happens in our
department this very semester,

672
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:49,170
there is such a class devoted all
semester to the topic of consciousness.

673
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,900
One could similarly have,
uh,

674
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:55,830
a course devoted to the
problem of freewill.

675
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:57,540
Okay,

676
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,630
I'm going to spend all of,
you know, two minutes on it.

677
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,810
So it's by no means do I mean to suggest,
oh, here's everything and you know,

678
00:45:03,811 --> 00:45:04,650
about the subject.

679
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,920
I simply wanted to point out enough
about the problem to help you see why I

680
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:12,330
don't think free will's a slam dunk

681
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,640
for the soul.

682
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:17,890
So, so what's the
argument? Well, the, the,

683
00:45:17,891 --> 00:45:19,820
the thought seems to
be something like this

684
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:25,683
one

685
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:29,780
we have freewill.

686
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,663
Okay.

687
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:36,160
To,
let me say something about this.

688
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:40,600
What is it about the thought that the
computer is just following a program while

689
00:45:40,601 --> 00:45:41,021
there thought,

690
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:45,880
I suppose is and philosophers jargon
that the computer is a deterministic

691
00:45:45,881 --> 00:45:46,714
system.

692
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:51,580
It follows the laws of physics and
the laws of physics are deterministic.

693
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,510
You know that if you're in this state
you will necessarily given the laws of

694
00:45:55,511 --> 00:45:58,900
physics and the way the computer is
programmed and built and so forth, these,

695
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:03,520
these, you know, these wires will turn
on, turn off, these circuits will turn on,

696
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:07,050
turn off, boom. Suddenly you'll
be in that state. You know,

697
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,150
there are certain laws such a given
that the computers in this state,

698
00:46:10,151 --> 00:46:15,151
it must necessarily move in that state
when you've got a view about cause and

699
00:46:15,221 --> 00:46:18,850
effect that works this way
for everything that happens.

700
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:24,150
There's some earlier thing that caused
it to happen such that given that earlier

701
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:29,710
because the event had to follow.
That's a deterministic picture

702
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,590
and the thought of course is that the
robot or the computer is a deterministic

703
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:40,390
system and you can't have freewill
if you're a deterministic system.

704
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,043
So

705
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,210
well number one we have free will

706
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:47,843
to

707
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,320
nothing subject

708
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,320
to determinism

709
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:02,300
has free will.

710
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:05,873
Okay.

711
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,910
Put One and two together.

712
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:12,170
It follows if nothing's subject to
determinism has freewill but we have free

713
00:47:12,171 --> 00:47:15,980
will. It follows that we're
not subject to determinism.

714
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:17,920
Okay.

715
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,960
It's supposedly then add three.

716
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,700
All right.

717
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:24,610
Surely physical systems,

718
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:25,943
yeah.

719
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,030
Are subject to determinism.

720
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:47,640
Well one and two gave us that we
are not subject to determinism.

721
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:51,930
Three says all purely physical
systems are subject to determinism.

722
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,460
What would follow them from one,

723
00:47:53,461 --> 00:47:57,780
two and three that we are
not a purely physical system.

724
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:04,370
So conclusion for we are not

725
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:08,490
a purely

726
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:12,390
physical system.

727
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:17,880
All right.

728
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,850
That's the argument from freewill.

729
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:21,483
Yeah.

730
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,720
Now the argument is valid.
That's philosophers jargon.

731
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:28,780
That is to say given the three premises,

732
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:30,820
the conclusion really does follow.

733
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:32,803
Okay.

734
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,480
The interesting question is,
are the three premises true?

735
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:39,880
And they've got to all be true.

736
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:43,810
It's got to be that every
single one of them is. So

737
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:46,003
yeah.

738
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:50,300
I'll just spend a minute more
on this starting next time,

739
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:53,600
but the point to think
about for next time is just,

740
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:58,100
is it really true that all
three of the premises are true,

741
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:02,090
or my one or more of them be false. All
right. That's where we'll start next time.
