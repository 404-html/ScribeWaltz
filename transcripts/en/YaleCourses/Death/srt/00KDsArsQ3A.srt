1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,480
The end of last class,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,290
I suggested that from here on out,

3
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:09,800
I'm going to be assuming
that there is no soul.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,990
I'm going to be discussing the class
discussing the issues that we turned to

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,020
hereafter from the perspective of the
physicalist person who says that a person

6
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:24,050
is basically just a fancy body,
a body that can do certain special tricks,

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,350
a body that can function in certain ways
that we associate with being a person,

8
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:33,050
a body that can pee function as we put it.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,480
Yeah,

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,180
no,
I've given you my reasons for believing.

11
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:41,350
There are no souls basically that the
various arguments that might be offered

12
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:43,630
for believing in souls,
uh,

13
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:46,480
don't seem very compelling
upon examination.

14
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:49,510
So there's no good reason
to posit this extra entity.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,233
Okay.

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,370
For the most part that I'm going to be
putting aside soul talk periodically.

17
00:00:55,371 --> 00:01:00,220
I'll come back and talk about how a
some issue that we are considering might

18
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:05,060
look from the perspective of somebody
who does believe in souls. But as I say,

19
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:07,610
for the most part, I'm going to
be assuming there are no souls,

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,880
but those of you who still do
believe in the existence of souls,

21
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,930
I suppose you could take a great deal
of the discussion that follows as some

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,700
form of large conditional or subjunctive.
You know,

23
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,690
if there were no souls,
then here's what we'd have to say.

24
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,400
So although I'll be largely talking from
the perspective of the physical list,

25
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:31,190
if you know, if you haven't become
convinced of the truth of physicalism,

26
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,730
so be it.
Well,

27
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,710
at least explore what will we say about
death if we've decided that people are

28
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:39,530
basically just bodies.
Now,

29
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:41,750
you'll recall that at the
start of this semester,

30
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:45,290
I said in thinking about the question,
could I survive my deck?

31
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:48,290
There were two basic things
we had to get clear on. First,

32
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,060
we had to get clear on what am I,
what are my parts?

33
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,410
And that's why we've spent the last
several weeks worrying about the question,

34
00:01:57,411 --> 00:02:02,180
am I just a body and my body? Am I a
body and an immaterial soul as well?

35
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,880
Or perhaps strictly speaking,
just the soul.

36
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,270
Having looked at that question,

37
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:10,520
we're now going to turn to
the second basic question.

38
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:12,140
What would it be to survive?

39
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,380
What would it be for a thing
like that to continue to exist?

40
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:18,411
Now,

41
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:22,600
of course we're going to ask
most particularly particularly
what would it be for

42
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:27,601
a thing like that to survive the death
of the body couldn't even make sense for

43
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:29,960
a person to survive the death of his body.

44
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,450
Okay?

45
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,630
You might think the answer to that
is no if we are physical lists,

46
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:37,270
but in fact it's not so clear.
The answer to that is no,

47
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,730
but in order to address
that particular question,

48
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:45,010
what does it for me to
survive the death of my body?

49
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:46,720
Is that even a possibility or not?

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,540
We first have to get clear
about the more general question.

51
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,390
What does it for me to survive,
period.

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,540
Take them more familiar humdrum case.

53
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,820
Here I am lecturing to you today.

54
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,800
Thursday.
Somebody's going to be here,

55
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:10,030
no doubt lecturing to you next week.
Next Tuesday,

56
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,250
the question of survival can be
asked about that very simple case.

57
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,320
Is the person who's going to
be lecturing to you on Tuesday,

58
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,510
the very same person as the person
who is standing in front of you,

59
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:27,520
lecturing to you.
Now,

60
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,000
will that person survive the weekend?

61
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,620
I certainly expect to survive the weekend,
but what is it to survive the weekend?

62
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,150
What is, well, we might say, look,

63
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,180
we've already got the beginnings of an
answer for me to survive till Tuesday

64
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,440
presumably is for there to be somebody,

65
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,030
some person alive lecturing
to you on Tuesday,

66
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,600
and here's the crucial point for that
person lecture into you on Tuesday,

67
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:57,960
Debbie,

68
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,960
the very same person as the
person lecturing to you today.

69
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,060
I'm Thursday.
Yeah.

70
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,120
If I were to be killed in a plane accident
this weekend and there was a guest

71
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:18,580
lecturer for you on Tuesday, there'd
be somebody alive lecturing to you.

72
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,500
But of course that wouldn't be me.

73
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,640
So the question we want to get clear on
is what is it for somebody on Tuesday to

74
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:32,380
be the same person as the person
here talking to you on Thursday?

75
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,300
And we can ask the question more
grandly about larger expanses of time.

76
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,240
Suppose there's somebody alive.

77
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,090
Yep.

78
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,480
40 odd years from now in the year 2050

79
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,060
could that be me to ask?

80
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,840
Have I survived until 2050 is to ask,

81
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,020
is that person who's alive in 2050 the
very same person as the person who's

82
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,000
standing here now lecturing to you?

83
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,550
Okay.

84
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:09,290
What is it for somebody in the future?
Tabby.

85
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:13,640
The very same person as this
person who's here now, today.

86
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,690
Now I'm thinking about this question.
Thinking about this question.

87
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,820
It's important not to miss.
Understand what we're asking.

88
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,650
Some of you may misunderstand
what I'm asking. I mean,

89
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:31,870
some of you may want to say,
look,

90
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,010
person lecturing to you now has
at least a fair bit of his hair.

91
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,980
He's got a beard.
Let's oppose it.

92
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:44,690
The Person Alive in 2050
is bald and bent over,

93
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:48,130
has no beard. How could they be
the same person? One's got heroin,

94
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,680
doesn't one's got a beard, one doesn't.
One stand straight, one's crooked,

95
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,360
cannot be the same person.

96
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,600
That's the mistake that it's
important for us to get clear about.

97
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,290
So I'm going to spend some time talking
about examples that I think we would not

98
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:10,331
find puzzling and work our way back
up to the case of personal identity.

99
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,640
So first I'm going to say some things
about identity across time or indeed

100
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:21,641
initially identity across space with
some familiar humdrum material objects.

101
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,490
So let's start.

102
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,780
Suppose you and I are walking
along and we see a train.

103
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,910
So let me draw the train first.

104
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,323
Not

105
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,800
very good artists,
but

106
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,470
all
right,

107
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,390
there's our train.
We start walking.

108
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,980
I point to the locum,
I prompted the caboose.

109
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,610
Let's make this look more like a caboose.
Slightly more that caboose

110
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,820
just so it doesn't look too much like
the locomotive. I pumped in a caboose.

111
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,800
I say, look at that train
and we're walking along,

112
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:24,130
we're walking along,
we're walking a walking along.

113
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,660
We come to the end of the train and I
pointed a locomotive and they say, wow,

114
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,520
look how long that trade is.

115
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,910
That's the very same train I
pointed to five minutes ago.

116
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,490
We've been walking along it all this time.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now imagine that you say you wouldn't
say anything as stupid as this,

118
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:46,270
but imagine that you
said this. You say, yeah,

119
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:51,420
this isn't the same train as the train
we we pointed to five minutes ago after.

120
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:56,590
All right, now what you're
pointing to is a locomotive,

121
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,290
whereas five minutes ago what
you pointed to was a caboose.

122
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,610
Caboose isn't the same
thing as a locomotive.

123
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,580
How can you possibly
say it's the same thing?

124
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,520
Who could possibly make
a mistake like that?

125
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,810
You know though the locomotives
got smoke coming out of it,

126
00:08:16,811 --> 00:08:21,580
the caboose doesn't and so forth and so
on. A lot of differences between the two.

127
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,240
How can you make such a silly
mistake? Well, of course.

128
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,580
What I would then want to say to you is,
no,

129
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:32,110
actually you're the one who's
making the mistake. I agree.

130
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:36,730
Of course that a locomotive is
not the same thing as a caboose,

131
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,070
but it wasn't claiming that.

132
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:43,870
It was rather initially
when we started our walk,

133
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,110
I pointed to a caboose,

134
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,570
but by pointing to the caboose,
I picked out a train.

135
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,100
I said,
look at that train.

136
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,250
And what I was referring
to wasn't just the caboose,

137
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,820
but the whole long extended
through space object.

138
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,750
The train which took
the boost is just apart.

139
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,173
Okay.

140
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,440
And when at the end of our walk when
I pointed to a locomotive and said,

141
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:21,330
look at that train by
pointing to the locomotive,

142
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,540
I was picking out a train and entire
train this long extended through space

143
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,260
object,
the train.

144
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,250
And when I said this train that I'm
pointing to now is the very same train as

145
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,970
the train I pointed to five minutes ago.

146
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,930
I'm not saying what is certainly false.

147
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:49,800
I'm not saying the locomotive is
the same thing as the caboose.

148
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,410
Rather.

149
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,410
What I'm saying is the entire
extended through space train

150
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:07,130
that I'm pointing out now is this same
train as the entire extended through

151
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:12,870
space train that I picked
out five minutes ago.

152
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,980
And that claim far from
being false is true.

153
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,290
Now, as I say, none of us
would make that mistake,

154
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,190
but it's attempting mistake
if you're not being careful.

155
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,090
And that mistake might mislead us if
we start thinking about the personal

156
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:32,940
identity case. But let's continue
with the train for a bit.

157
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,740
Suppose

158
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:45,120
as we taking our walk,
part of the train isn't invisible.

159
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,690
There is a large

160
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,400
warehouse that's blocking the view.

161
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,660
Walking along the way, we see a
caboose. I say, Huh, there's a train.

162
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,480
Then for a while we're walking.

163
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:08,690
We don't see anything because
all you can see is the warehouse

164
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,390
and then after we get past the warehouse,
very long block, long warehouse,

165
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,090
I see a locomotive and I say, Hey, look,

166
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,810
there's a train and then I ask you,

167
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,200
do you think this is the same train
as the train we pointed to before?

168
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,160
Now again, it's important not to
misunderstand that question, right?

169
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:37,570
That questions not asking
is the locomotive that we're
pointing to now the same

170
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:44,570
as the caboose that we pointed
to earlier? No, of course not.

171
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,920
The locomotive is not the same as the
caboose, but that's not what I'm asking.

172
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,560
What I'm asking rather is,

173
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,460
remember earlier when I pointed to the
caboose in doing so and I started talking

174
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:58,444
about a train,

175
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,570
I was picking out some entire
extended through space train.

176
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,550
Right now in pointing to a locomotive,

177
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,960
I'm picking out not just locomotive, I
mean to be talking about an entire train,

178
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,020
some entire extended through space train
and I'm asking not about the locomotive

179
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:24,310
and the caboose,
but rather I'm asking about the trains.

180
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,690
Did I pick out by means of
the locomotive and caboose,

181
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:34,020
are they the same train and
the answer is don't know,

182
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,690
can't tell the buildings
blocking the view.

183
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,830
Suppose we had x ray vision
and could see through

184
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,590
the building. Then the answer would
be, well look, if what we've got is

185
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,470
something like this.

186
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:01,590
Then of course we do
have one single train.

187
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:06,770
The extended through space train I picked
out at the end of our walk is the same

188
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:11,820
as the extended through space train that
I picked out at the beginning of our

189
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:14,880
walk,
but it might not turn out that way.

190
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,870
It might turn out if I had x ray
vision that what I'd see is this,

191
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,630
then the answer would be, oh,
there's not one train here,

192
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,120
but two trains.

193
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,590
The extended through space
train that I'm picking out.

194
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,060
When I pointed a locomotive,

195
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:42,061
turns out to be a different train from
the extended through space train I picked

196
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:47,800
out, when I pointed to the caboose,
they don't have ECS revision.

197
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,830
I don't know which of these metaphysical
hypotheses is the correct one.

198
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,350
All right.

199
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:00,530
Easy enough with trains.
We know how it works with trains.

200
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,383
Okay,

201
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,580
well let's talk about something
not a whole lot more complicated.

202
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,623
Cars

203
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,550
used to have a car I bought in 1990

204
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,663
yes.

205
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,440
My ability to draw cars is even
worse than my ability to draw trains.

206
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,360
There's my car in 1990 it was new.

207
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,720
Okay.

208
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Was sparkly.

209
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,373
Yeah.

210
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,530
Then I drove it for some years and I
got some dense and so forth and so on.

211
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,313
It's a smile

212
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,160
by 1996 or 2000 wasn't looking so good.

213
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,900
Sparkler gone. Had a couple of
dance. That was the car in 2000

214
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,080
by 2006

215
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,680
had a lot of dance.

216
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,350
2006 when it finally died.

217
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,733
All right.

218
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,620
Now we all understand the claim that
the car I had in 2006 was the very same

219
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:32,340
cars.
The car I had in 1990

220
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,460
of course.
Again

221
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,890
gotta be careful not to
misunderstand what's being said.

222
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We all know that in 2006 the car had a
lot of scratches and had gotten banged in

223
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:50,180
on one side and

224
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,880
pretty sorry looking in terms of the
scrapes and the paint job and the rust.

225
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:02,170
Whereas the car in 1990
new and shiny and smooth

226
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,743
might say

227
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,970
that 2006 cars stage is obviously not
the same thing as the 1990 car stage.

228
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,910
That's like thinking that the locomotive
is the same thing as the caboose,

229
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,140
but when I say it's the same car,

230
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:30,860
I don't mean they be
talking about car stages.

231
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,820
I mean to be talking about a single

232
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,433
thing

233
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,170
that was extended through time.

234
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:49,590
There I am proud owner of my new
car in 1990 and I say this is a car.

235
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,220
It's a car that will exist
for more than a few minutes.

236
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,000
It's a car that will exist for years
and years and years though at the time I

237
00:16:58,001 --> 00:17:01,210
didn't realize what was going
to last 16 years or longer.

238
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,540
When I refer to my car as opposed to what
we could dub the car stage or the car

239
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,743
slice.

240
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
When I refer to the car in 1990 I mean
to be talking about the entire extended

241
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:21,870
through time object

242
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,410
2006 when I point to that sad heap.

243
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,330
Okay.

244
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,270
And talk about,
I've had that car for 16 years.

245
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,230
Well I haven't had that
car stage for 16 years.

246
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,880
That car stage or that car slice if
we wanted to talk about it that way.

247
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,640
It has only been around
for however long months,

248
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:48,350
years a year hasn't been around for 16
years, but when I talk about that car,

249
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,860
I'm picking just the current slice
or the current stage of the car,

250
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,960
but the entire extended
through time object.

251
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,660
Okay.

252
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,640
When I say that's the very
same car I've had for 16 years,

253
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,720
I mean,

254
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:07,900
okay,

255
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,900
think of the object extended through
time that I'm picking out by pointing to

256
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:14,440
the current slice.

257
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,580
That's the very same extended through
time object that I picked out 16 years ago

258
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:27,100
by pointing to what was then the current
slice. The slices aren't the same.

259
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:31,690
The car is the same.
It's the very same car.

260
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,400
Okay,

261
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,670
well now let's imagine a
somewhat more difficult case.

262
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,560
The end of 2006 my engine failed.

263
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,790
I sold the car to a dealer.
Junk dealer.

264
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,420
Suppose that in 2010

265
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,380
I see a car.

266
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,820
Okay

267
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,020
and the junk lot

268
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,390
and it looks familiar to me.

269
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,630
Take, Whoa, that's my car.

270
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,400
Is it or isn't it my car?

271
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:32,180
This is sort of like the case with
the factory blocking the view.

272
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,450
Yeah.
1990 to 2006 very easy.

273
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,060
Saw the car everyday in my garage,

274
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,030
but here's a four year

275
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,100
set of a factory blocking my view.

276
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:54,080
It's the mists of time blocking
my view and I ask same car or not.

277
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,440
Again, by this time I imagine you
don't need to be warned. Well,

278
00:19:57,441 --> 00:20:00,410
let me just warn you a couple more times.
I'm not asking,

279
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,360
is the car stage the 2010 car stage,

280
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,500
the same car stage as the 2006 car stage?

281
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,980
Maybe not. Maybe. Obviously not.

282
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,280
I'm asking rather in pointing
to the 2010 car stage.

283
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,800
I mean to be picking out an entire
extended through time entity.

284
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:31,190
The car and I'm asking is that the very
same extended through time entity as the

285
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:34,250
extended through time
entity that I used to own.

286
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,280
I wonder and the answer is don't know
the mists of time or blocking my view.

287
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,020
I don't know the answer,
but we know what the possibilities are.

288
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,700
One possibility is that
indeed it's the very same.

289
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,840
All right.
Won't draw it all.

290
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,600
Oh, 2008 and so forth. It
couldn't be the very same car.

291
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:10,010
If we knew what it took to have the
various stages of a car add up to the very

292
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:16,200
same car,
then that would be one possibility,

293
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,820
but there might be
a different possibility.

294
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,930
Could have been that after I sold it
to the junk dealer, he crushed it,

295
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,820
turned it into a heap of metal and that
was the end of my car and the car I'm

296
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:36,570
seeing on the dealer's lot in
2010 it might be some other car

297
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,130
with its own history.

298
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,680
What we're wondering about
is is there a single, oh,

299
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,790
here's a piece of jargon.

300
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:57,770
Is there a single space time
worm here or are there too?

301
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:04,410
When I look at the the car in
2010 and say there is a car,

302
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,700
I wonder if it's the same car.

303
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:10,701
I'm asking about this thing
that's extended obviously
through space since cars

304
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:13,500
take up some space and through time.

305
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,380
Okay.

306
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,370
Looks a bit like a worms.
So philosophers call them spacetime worms

307
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:26,050
is the space time worm that makes up this
car the same space time or him as the

308
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:29,240
one that made up my car,

309
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:34,160
one worm there or two and the
answer might be don't know,

310
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,140
need to have more facts,

311
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,890
but at least that's what
the question is now,

312
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,820
metaphysically there's different ways of
trying to pose the set of issues that I

313
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:53,280
had begun to talk about.
Should we say,

314
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:56,400
as we might say with the train,

315
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,640
the train is made up
out of the various cars,

316
00:23:02,011 --> 00:23:04,860
the locomotive, the caboose,
and the intervening cars.

317
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,850
So the train, that's the, that's the
way we normally think about trains,

318
00:23:08,851 --> 00:23:10,290
at least the way I normally
think about trains,

319
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,360
the trains a bit like a sandwich,
right?

320
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,200
The metaphysically fundamental things
are the caboose, the locomotives,

321
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:23,430
the intervening trains. If they're
glued together in the right way,

322
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:28,790
they make up a train. What's
the right kind of metaphysical
glue for trains? Well,

323
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:31,110
it's being connected
with those little locks

324
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,500
that may or may not be the right way to
think about what I've been calling car

325
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:43,501
stages or car slices on some metaphysical
views you might say just exactly like

326
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:50,050
what the train their car stages or the
metaphysically fundamental things and an

327
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:55,811
a car or something extended through time
is glued together like a sandwich from,

328
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,770
uh,
the car stages.

329
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,930
And then we might worry about what's the
relevant metaphysical glue for cars and

330
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,680
other metaphysical views.
No,

331
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:13,681
what's really prior is the car itself
and talking about car stages is a certain

332
00:24:15,491 --> 00:24:16,570
convenience,

333
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:21,310
a kind of way of chopping up
the fundamental thing, the car.

334
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,910
So to use an analogy that
I think David Kaplan,

335
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,860
a philosopher at UCLA offers,

336
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,510
it's as though you have to think of it
more like a Bologna or Salami that you

337
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:35,470
can slice it for certain purposes.
You can talk about slices,

338
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,630
but the fundamental things to Salami.

339
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,540
Yeah.

340
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,530
All right.
In thinking about cars,

341
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,560
should we say that the fundamental
thing is the car stages and they get put

342
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:52,880
together like a sandwich to make cars
or should we think that the fundamental

343
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:56,830
thing is the car extended through time
and they can be sliced up to make cars

344
00:24:56,831 --> 00:25:00,560
stages for our purposes,
I think we won't have to go there.

345
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,521
It doesn't really matter.

346
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:05,810
As long as we're comfortable talking
about entire spacetime worms,

347
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,370
the cars and the slices are the
stages we don't have to ask,

348
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:13,640
which is metaphysically prior.
Should also notice that.

349
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:17,840
I should also mention that there are other
metaphysical views about what goes on

350
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:21,490
when an object exists over time.
Uh,

351
00:25:21,491 --> 00:25:26,390
I've been here helping myself to the
suggestion that we should think about

352
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:32,000
extension over time and now all will
this lead to the way we think about

353
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:36,620
extension over space. That's why I
started with, uh, a spatial example,

354
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:41,250
the train and move to the 10
poral example, the car. And,

355
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,180
and there are those philosophers who think
that's exactly the right way to think

356
00:25:44,181 --> 00:25:48,440
about it. And those philosophers, I
think, no, no, that's misleading. Uh,

357
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:52,490
when an object is extended over a time.

358
00:25:52,491 --> 00:25:55,760
Really the entire objects right
there at every single moment.

359
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,360
These are interesting and
difficult questions, but again,

360
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:02,480
I think for our purposes
we don't have to go there

361
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:09,030
so I will help myself to
this language of space,

362
00:26:09,641 --> 00:26:10,900
time,
worms,

363
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:15,901
objects that extend not only over space
but also over time and distinguish the

364
00:26:16,271 --> 00:26:21,271
entire worm from the various slices or
stages that either make up the warm where

365
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,530
that we could slice the warm into.

366
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,890
The point that I've been emphasizing is,

367
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:32,220
well first point of course has been
don't confuse the stages with the entire

368
00:26:34,031 --> 00:26:35,200
space.
Time worm.

369
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:40,510
The stages can differ without the entire
space time I'm being a different worm.

370
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:41,940
Okay.

371
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,810
Second question.

372
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:46,910
I've hinted at that we're about to turn
two and not literally turned to them

373
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,000
longer but so shortly we'll turn
to is what's the relevant glue?

374
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,630
What makes two stages stages
of the very same thing.

375
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,790
The case of trains, as I
say, it's fairly obvious.

376
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,820
What is it in the case of cars,

377
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,730
what makes

378
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,320
the 1990 car stage a stage
in the very same car?

379
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,650
The extended through space and time,

380
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:23,730
warm car as the 2006 stage.

381
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:29,180
What's the metaphysical glue that glues
the stages together and the answer,

382
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,090
not that there aren't puzzled about it,
but the answer's roughly.

383
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:39,290
It's the very same car if it's the
very same hunk of metal and plastic and

384
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:43,284
wires.

385
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,180
Yep.

386
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,670
There was the car cars,

387
00:27:48,671 --> 00:27:53,671
just some metal and plastic rubber and
that very same honk continued into 2000

388
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,390
and continued into 2006

389
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,580
okay.

390
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,450
The glue,

391
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:09,451
the key to identity across time for
cars is being the same hunk of stuff.

392
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:23,890
Now that doesn't mean it's got
to be the same Adam for Adam,

393
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,450
we know that's not true.
Think about my steering wheel.

394
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,740
Every time I grabbed the
steering wheel to drive,

395
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,310
I wore away thousands of Adams.

396
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,260
You can lose some atoms and still
be this very same steering wheel.

397
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:49,930
Okay,

398
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:54,580
that'd be no,
and then I'd replace the tires on my car,

399
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,270
but for all that it was
the same hunk of stuff.

400
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,350
Now, this is ways, it's sort
of an interesting issue.

401
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:08,530
How money changes of the constituent
parts can you have and still be the same

402
00:29:12,111 --> 00:29:13,220
hunk of stuff.

403
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,610
Okay.

404
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:20,610
If this was a class in which we were going
to worry about the general problem of

405
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:26,530
identity across time, this would be
a problem we'd have to directly face.

406
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:31,000
But since we are only looking at uh,

407
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:36,020
north of the problem of identity to get
to the question that we really want to

408
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:41,120
think about the nature of
personal identity across,

409
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,080
I'm not going to pursue that.

410
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,560
I just want to flag the thought that
you can be the very same hunk of stuff.

411
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,220
Even if some of the constituent atoms
have changed along the way and even bigger

412
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,360
parts,
you can replace the,

413
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,720
the headlights and still be the
same hunk of stuff and right.

414
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,550
That's what's going on in the car case.
Same hunk of stuff.

415
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:11,610
1900 to 2006 and when I seen the car on
the junk dealer's yard in 2010 and ask

416
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,000
is that my car or not?

417
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,290
The answer lies in if only we could know.

418
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:24,700
So at the same hunk of stuff or not.
That's what the key,

419
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,030
the metaphysical glue is
being the same hunk of stuff.

420
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,233
All right,

421
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,800
turn now to the case,
we really wonder about

422
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,780
personal identity.

423
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,050
Here's somebody

424
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,210
lecturing to you.

425
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,393
Okay.

426
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,600
In 2007

427
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,210
Shelly Kagan,

428
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,400
we imagine there's somebody

429
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,480
in 2050

430
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,643
okay,

431
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,520
and we ask, is that Shelly
Kagan? We'll call him mr x.

432
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:24,260
We ask is that the same person or not?
Now again,

433
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:29,750
this point, you're not going to be tempted
by the mistake, right? I'm not asking,

434
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,980
is this person stage Mr x,

435
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:39,190
this same person's stage as s k 2007
obviously nots k 2007 still got his hair.

436
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,040
Has the beard stands up
more or less straight?

437
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:53,230
Mr X's ball doesn't have a beard.
I should.

438
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,160
I suppose I should have drawn him bent.

439
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,420
Can I do that little cane right?

440
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,320
I'm not asking is the person's stage Mr
x the same as the person stage sk 2007

441
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,433
how's it go?

442
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,930
Computers get the SK two not asking that.
I'm asking.

443
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,793
I'm saying you look,

444
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:24,130
when you look at the current stage,

445
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:29,190
the current person slice and think
about the entire extended through time

446
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,070
entity.
The person that makes up Shelly Kagan,

447
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,900
where that is Shelly Kagan,

448
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:43,740
is that the very same person
as the extended through
time person that you got in

449
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:53,450
mind when you point to the Mr x 2050

450
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:55,840
yeah.

451
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,840
The stages are obviously different but
by looking at the stages we pick out a

452
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:03,730
space time worm

453
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:10,490
that makes up a person and we're asking
is that the very same space time where

454
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:16,271
it as the one we picked up previously
or different spacetime worm than the one

455
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,090
we picked up previously.

456
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,920
And the answer presumably is going to be,

457
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:28,100
well it depends on getting
clear on whether the stages
are glued together in the

458
00:33:31,471 --> 00:33:33,150
right metaphysical way.

459
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,750
Okay.

460
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,580
And so what we'd like to know is,

461
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:42,540
well what does it take for two person
stages to make up or be part of the very

462
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:49,720
same extended through time person.

463
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:55,680
What's the metaphysical
glue that underlies being a
single extended through time

464
00:33:57,281 --> 00:33:58,114
person?

465
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:02,590
What's not key to personal identity.

466
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:04,800
Okay.

467
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,090
If we could get clear about what the
answer to that metaphysical question,

468
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,490
the key to personal identity,

469
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:16,670
we'd at least know what we needed
to find out to answer the question.

470
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,620
Is this one person or two,

471
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,390
are the pieces glued
together in the right way?

472
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,980
Different question.

473
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:34,300
The question that were ultimately
hoping to get an answer to.

474
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,010
Yeah.

475
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,440
Could I survive my death? Well, look,

476
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,670
think again about the question we
started with, could I survive the weekend

477
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:48,890
to survive the weekend?
There's gotta be somebody who's alive,

478
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,150
some person
on Tuesday

479
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,800
and that person's got to be the very same
person as the person you're looking at

480
00:35:02,661 --> 00:35:04,040
mag you're thinking about now.

481
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,750
Or to put it in terms of stages,

482
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,950
that person's gotta be that stage.

483
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:16,980
That slice has to be part of the very
same extended through time space,

484
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,100
time worm as as this stage is

485
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,690
it gotta be glued
together in the right way.

486
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,440
The can't tell whether that's true
until we know what the glue is,

487
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,560
but at least we anticipate that there
be somebody here on Tuesday who is glued

488
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,660
together in that way the right way,

489
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:45,070
whatever that turns out to be the stage,

490
00:35:45,071 --> 00:35:46,560
it'll be glued together in the right way.

491
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,860
Suppose I ask then will
I survive my death?

492
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,090
All right,
so I'm going to be optimistic.

493
00:35:58,091 --> 00:35:59,800
I'm going to assume that I make it to 2040

494
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,720
okay.

495
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,650
2040 won't even be nine to yet.
That's not to wildly optimistic.

496
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,100
It's optimistic but not wildly optimistic.

497
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,080
So here's the SK 2040

498
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:16,810
we know that

499
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:23,070
there's an extended through space and
time, space, time where I'm a person,

500
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:31,220
Ben's suppose sadly 2041
my body dies and they ask,

501
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,620
could I survive my death?
That is to say the death of my body.

502
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:42,811
Well,

503
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:47,811
we want to know after 2041 let's say
2045 is there somebody who's a person

504
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,940
call him mister X.

505
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:05,360
Could it be the case that there'd be a
person in 2045 after the death of my body

506
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:15,530
in 2041 could it be the case that there's
a person who's part of the very sane

507
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,440
spacetime warm,

508
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,910
but you're thinking about right now?
Could that be or not?

509
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:34,190
We can't answer that question until we
are clear about what does it take to have

510
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:42,570
identity across time.
What's the key to personal identity?

511
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,400
What's the metaphysical glue?

512
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,030
Once we get clear about what the
relevant metaphysical glue is,

513
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:52,200
we'll be in a position just started
asking could this happen or not?

514
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,400
All
right.

515
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,440
That's the question I want to turn to.

516
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:09,100
Then what are the possible
positions on this question?

517
00:38:09,101 --> 00:38:10,780
What's the key to personal identity?

518
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:17,820
What's it to be that very same person as
we might put it somewhat misleadingly.

519
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,940
What is it for to quote unquote people
to really be the same single extended

520
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:26,720
through time person.

521
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,250
Suppose we believed in souls.

522
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,580
Then here would be a natural proposal.

523
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:39,820
That metaphysical key to personal
identity is having the very same soul,

524
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,630
so I suppose I was a
duelist. I'd say, look,

525
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:51,190
you're looking at a body but connected
in this intimate way with his body is a

526
00:38:51,191 --> 00:38:54,190
particular soul. The
soul obs, Shelly Kagan.

527
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:00,420
What makes it true that the person
lecturing to you next Tuesday is Shelly

528
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,970
Kagan,
the very same person.

529
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:08,980
What makes that true is that
it's the very same soul.

530
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,760
As long as this soul is here.
Again,

531
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:17,761
on Tuesday it'll be Shelly
Kagan if it's a different soul.

532
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,740
It's not Shelly Kagan.

533
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:29,020
That's the natural thing to suggest.
If we believe in the soul view,

534
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,980
the key to personal identity,

535
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,040
not the only thing of
soul theorists can say,

536
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:41,041
but the natural thing for a sole theorist
to say the key to personal identity is

537
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:47,970
having the very same Sol saying Sol,

538
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:53,260
same person, different
soul, different person.

539
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,160
Imagine that God or a
demon or what have you,

540
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,700
for whatever perverse reason severs the
ordinary connection between my body and

541
00:40:09,931 --> 00:40:14,931
my soul and then reconnects the wires
as it were so that there's a different

542
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:21,651
soul animating and controlling
this body on Tuesday

543
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:28,480
for whatever perverse reasons. Maybe it
makes them sort of philosophical point.

544
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,720
That person decides to come in anyway
on Tuesday and lecture to you about

545
00:40:33,821 --> 00:40:38,410
philosophy
according to the view that we're taking,

546
00:40:38,411 --> 00:40:42,970
which we now call the soul view
according to the soul view.

547
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,950
It won't be me lecturing
to you on Tuesday.

548
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,993
Why not?

549
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:54,090
Because we just stipulated it's not
the same soul to different soul.

550
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:02,270
The key to personal identity according
to the sole theory of personal identity,

551
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,670
the key to personal identities,
having the same soul.

552
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:15,120
When I asked myself,
will I survive the weekend?

553
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:20,040
What I'm asking is no. Well, my soul
is still be around. Come Tuesday.

554
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,340
As long as my soul still exist in
his functioning, it's still me.

555
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,990
I'm still around. In fact,
peeking ahead, of course,

556
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:34,940
and this is why we often
drawn his soul views.

557
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,670
Even if my body dies,

558
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,850
as long as my soul continues to exist,

559
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,130
I continued to exist.

560
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,050
The key to personal identity according
to the soul views having the same soul.

561
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,200
As long as my soul continues to exist,
it's still me.

562
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,780
Whether or not my body's still alive,

563
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,713
okay.

564
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,020
As precisely for this reason that at
least the salt belief in the soul combined

565
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:09,021
with the sole theory of personal identity
holds out the possibility of surviving

566
00:42:09,781 --> 00:42:10,614
my death.

567
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,400
We may not know that the soul will
continue to exist after the destruction of

568
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:20,880
the body, but at least it seems like a
possibility. Plato, of course, as we know,

569
00:42:20,881 --> 00:42:25,800
tried to argue that we could know if
there was or there are good grounds for

570
00:42:25,801 --> 00:42:28,110
believing the soul would
continue to exist. I said,

571
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,450
I don't find those grounds so convincing,

572
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:35,430
but even if we didn't think we could show
that the soul would continue to exist,

573
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,870
at least it could.

574
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:40,260
It would make perfect sense to
think about it continuing to exist

575
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:44,340
and so I could survive
the death of my body.

576
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,760
In contrast,

577
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,850
it looks the prospects don't look so
promising for survive in my death of my

578
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:57,480
body. If we don't believe in
dualism, if we're physical lists,

579
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:01,350
if a,
if a person is just a p functioning body,

580
00:43:01,351 --> 00:43:05,460
how could it be that after the death
of his body, he's still around? Well,

581
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,050
we'll say more about that a little
bit later. Come back to the soul view.

582
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:18,240
It's me. As long as it's
the same soul, it's not me.

583
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:22,850
If it's a different soul,
now consider the following possibility.

584
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:24,240
Okay?

585
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,240
Suppose that over the weekend
at 3:00 AM Saturdays Nights,

586
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:32,940
Sunday morning,
while I'm asleep,

587
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:39,540
God replaces my soul
with a different soul,

588
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,790
hooks it up to the body,
gives that soul,

589
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:49,200
that replacement soul.
All of my memories,

590
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,560
all of my beliefs,
all of my desires,

591
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,300
all my intentions.

592
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:01,520
Somebody wakes up Sunday
morning, says, Hey,

593
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:06,350
it's great day, wonderful to be alive.
I'm Shelly Kagan, got to get to work.

594
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:10,370
Whatever it is,
says I'm Shelly Kagan,

595
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:15,200
but he's not according to the soul view.

596
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:20,230
He's not because according to the sole
theory of personal identity to be me,

597
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:26,830
that person's got to have my soul and
in this story he doesn't have my soul.

598
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:33,960
My soul got destroyed.
Let's suppose 3:00 AM Sunday morning,

599
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,300
a new soul got created.
It's not me.

600
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,670
There's a person there,
all right?

601
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,330
It's a person that doesn't
have a very long history.

602
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,510
Maybe he'll go on to have a long history,

603
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:53,520
but it's a different extended
through space and time person.

604
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,030
Then the one you're
thinking about right now,

605
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:00,390
because according to
the soul view to be me,

606
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,930
it's got to have the same soul and
we just stipulated not the same soul.

607
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,210
Think about what that means.

608
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:12,650
If God were to replace
my soul Saturday night,

609
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,600
I die.

610
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,760
And the thing that wakes
up Sunday isn't me.

611
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,310
Of course he think he was me.
He thinks to himself.

612
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,520
I'm the very same person who was
lecturing about philosophy last week,

613
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,360
but he'd be wrong.

614
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:43,450
Isn't the same person because it's
not the same soul. He be wrong.

615
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:48,370
And notice this,
there'd be no way at all.

616
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:52,660
He could tell,
he can check his beliefs,

617
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,750
he can check his desires,
he can check his memories.

618
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,280
But that's not the key to personal
identity. According to the soul of view,

619
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,860
the key to personal identity
according to soul views,

620
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:06,730
having the very same
soul can't check that.

621
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,630
You can't see the soul to
see if it's the same one.

622
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,630
So this would have happened to him.

623
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,600
He wouldn't be Shelly Kagan,
the person who'd been lecturing last week,

624
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:26,170
but there'd be no way at all.
He could know that.

625
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:31,030
And now the question you
need to ask yourself is,

626
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,890
how do you know this didn't
happen to you last night?

627
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:44,030
You woke up this morning thinking,
I'm the very same person, Joe, Linda,

628
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:45,800
Sally,
whatever it is.

629
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:49,190
The very same person who
was in class yesterday,

630
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:51,110
how do you know?

631
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:56,350
How could you possibly know if God
replaced your soul with a new one,

632
00:46:56,961 --> 00:47:00,470
destroyed the old one, gave the new one?
All the old memories, beliefs, desires,

633
00:47:00,471 --> 00:47:05,450
goals, and so forth. That person
who was in class last week,

634
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:08,000
yesterday died.

635
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:14,060
The person who's here now hasn't been
around 10 years, 20 years, what have you.

636
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:16,280
Yeah,

637
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:21,280
you were born a few hours ago and
there'd be no way at all that you could

638
00:47:22,551 --> 00:47:23,750
possibly tell.

639
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,150
How do you know not only that
it didn't happen to you last?

640
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:34,560
How do you know something like this
doesn't happen every single night,

641
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,750
every hour on the hour,
every minute,

642
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:44,530
every second God whips
out the old soul destroys.

643
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:49,090
It puts in a new one with maybe souls
only last for a minute and a half.

644
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:51,390
Okay?

645
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:55,980
If that was happening,
then people don't last very long.

646
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,760
Bodies May last 20 years, 50
years, 80 years, a hundred years,

647
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,940
but people would only last an hour or if
it's every minute substitution a minute

648
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:09,420
and you'd never possibly be able to tell.

649
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:15,890
Now these worries were
raised by John Locke,

650
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,550
great British philosopher,
and he thought,

651
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,990
this is too big a pill to swallow.

652
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,050
This is too big a bullet to bite.

653
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:33,040
We can't take seriously the suggestion
that there was no way at all to tell

654
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,500
whether it was still me from the one day
to the next from one hour to the next,

655
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,970
from one minute to the next.
Just not plausible.

656
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:48,530
It's not that there's anything in coherent
about this year that does anything

657
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:52,340
logically contradictory about this view.
You just have to ask yourself,

658
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,140
could this really be,

659
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:59,141
what personal identities all about that
there'd be no way at all to tell whether

660
00:48:59,451 --> 00:49:04,451
I've survived from one minute to the
next from one hour to the next lock

661
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,560
thought,
no,

662
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:11,830
you couldn't possibly take this view
seriously if you thought about what it

663
00:49:12,591 --> 00:49:13,424
meant.

664
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,620
Notice this is not an argument
that souls don't exist.

665
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,620
If you find this argument convincing,

666
00:49:21,621 --> 00:49:26,621
what it's an argument for is the
claim that even if souls do exist,

667
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:30,860
they may not be the key
to personal identity.

668
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:35,930
And so what we have to ask
ourselves is what's the alternative?

669
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:41,110
What better suggestion is there for what
we could point to as the metaphysical

670
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,560
glue,
the key to personal identity.

671
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,020
And that's the question
that will take up next time.
