1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,880
All right. So this is
philosophy one 76, uh,

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,970
the classes on death.
My name is Shelly Kagan,

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,270
and the very first thing I want to do
is to invite you to call me Shelly.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,820
Uh, that is, uh, you know,
we meet on the street,

5
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:20,250
you come talk to me during office hours.
He asked some question.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,190
Shelley's the name that I respond to,

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,930
I will eventually respond
to professor Kagan. Uh,

8
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:31,260
but the synapsis take a bit longer,
uh, for that. It's not the name.

9
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:36,030
I immediately recognize. Uh, I
have found that over the years,

10
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:40,710
fewer and fewer students feel comfortable
calling me. Shelly, when I was young,

11
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:45,390
it seemed to work. Now
I'm gray and August. Uh,

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,370
but as Eddie's Shelly,
if you're comfortable with it,

13
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:52,050
it's the name that that I prefer
to be called by. Now. As I say,

14
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,430
this is a class on death. Uh,
but it's a philosophy class.

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,780
And what that means is that the set of
topics that we're going to be talking

16
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:05,170
about in this class are not
identical to the topics that, uh,

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,220
other classes on death might try to cover.

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,310
So the first thing I want to do is say
something about the things we won't be

19
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:18,471
talking about that you might reasonably
expect or hope that a class on deck one

20
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:21,354
talk about.

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,860
So that if this is not the
class you were looking for,

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,920
you still have time to go
check out some other class.

23
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,140
So here are some things that you know,

24
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:34,020
a class on death could cover
that we won't talk about.

25
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,260
And what I primarily have in mind are
sort of psychological and sociological

26
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:43,410
questions about the nature of
death or the phenomenon of death.

27
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:46,390
And so a class on death, well, uh,

28
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:51,410
have a discussion of the process of dying
and coming to reconcile yourself with

29
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:58,100
the fact that you're going to die.
Some of you may know about, uh,

30
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,140
Elizabeth Kubler Ross's discussion of
the so-called five stages of dying.

31
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:07,260
There's denial and then there's anger.
And then there's bargaining.

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,950
I'd actually remember the five stages.
We're not going to talk about, uh,

33
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:12,420
about that.
Similarly,

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,480
we're not going to talk about the funeral
industry in America and how it rips

35
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:24,270
off people in which it does rips off
people in their moments of grief and

36
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:28,250
weakness and overcharges them for,
for the various things that it office.

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,230
We're not going to talk about that.
We're not going to talk about, uh,

38
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,850
the process of grieving or bereavement.

39
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,060
We're not going to talk about
a sociological attitudes
that we have towards the

40
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:46,390
dying, uh, in our culture
and how we tend to, you know,

41
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,120
try to keep the, the, the dying,
uh, hidden from the rest of us.

42
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,980
These are all perfectly important
topics, but they're not, as I say,

43
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:59,320
topics that we're going to be
talking about in this class.

44
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,560
So what will we talk about?
Well,

45
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,080
the things we'll talk about
are philosophical questions
that arise as we begin

46
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:11,290
to think about the nature of death.

47
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,400
Like this here's in, in, in broad scope,

48
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,000
half the class is going
to be the first half.

49
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,170
The class is going to be metaphysics.

50
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,040
For those of you who are familiar with
the philosophical piece of jargon and

51
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,210
roughly half the class,

52
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:30,211
the second half the class is going to be
value theory so that first half of the

53
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:35,461
class is going to be concerned with
questions about the nature of death.

54
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,780
What happens when we die?
Indeed to get at that question,

55
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:43,750
the first thing we're going to
have to think about is what are we,

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,960
what kind of an entity is
a person in particular?

57
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,680
Do we have souls and for this class,
what I talk about a soul,

58
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:54,700
what I'm going to mean,

59
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,790
it's sort of a bit of philosophical
jargon isn't going to mean something in

60
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,880
something distinct from our bodies.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Do we have in material souls something
that might survive the death of our body

62
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,320
and if not, what does that
imply about the nature of death?

63
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:14,080
What kind of an event is death?

64
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,030
What is it for me to survive? What would
it mean for me to survive my death?

65
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,600
What does it mean for me to
survive tonight? That is, you know,

66
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,160
somebody is going to be here lecturing
to your, to the class on Thursday.

67
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:28,570
Presumably that will be me.

68
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,400
What is it for that person who's there
on Thursday to be the same person as the

69
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:36,520
person who's sitting here
lecturing to you today?

70
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,810
These are questions about the nature
of personal identity pretty clearly to

71
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:43,900
think about death and continued
existence and survival.

72
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,380
We have to get clear about the
nature of personal identity.

73
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,600
These sorts of questions will occupy
us for roughly the first half of the

74
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:55,840
semester and then we'll turn to

75
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,750
value.
Questions is if death is the end,

76
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,220
is death bad?

77
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,910
Now of course most of us are immediately
in strongly inclined to think the death

78
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,451
is bad,

79
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:12,451
but there are a set of philosophical
puzzles about how death could be bad to

80
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,590
just sort of give you a quick taste.

81
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,030
If after my death I won't exist,

82
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,610
how could anything be bad for me?

83
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:25,120
How could anything be bad for
something that doesn't exist?

84
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,010
So how could death be bad?
So it's not that the result's going to be,

85
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:32,080
I'm going to try to convince you
to death isn't bad, but it's,

86
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,450
it takes actually a little bit of work.

87
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:38,290
Then pin pin down precisely what is it
about death that's bad and how can it be

88
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,950
death? And as a more than one thing
about death that makes it bad,

89
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,980
we'll turn to questions like that.
If death is bad,

90
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:48,100
then one might wonder is would
the mortality be a good thing?

91
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,880
And that's a question that we'll think
about or more generally we'll worry about

92
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,910
how should the fact that I'm going
to die affect the way I live?

93
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,720
What should I attitude be
towards my mortality? Should I,

94
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,520
uh, uh, should, should I be
afraid of death? For example,

95
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:10,940
should I despair at the fact
that I'm going to die? Um,

96
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,850
finally we'll turn to
questions about suicide. Uh,

97
00:06:14,851 --> 00:06:19,560
many of us think that given the valuable
and precious thing that life is suicide

98
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:23,780
and makes no sense, you're throwing away
the only life you ever going to have. Uh,

99
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,620
and so we'll end this semester by thinking
about questions along the lines of

100
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:32,150
the rationality and morality of suicides.
So roughly speaking,

101
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:34,190
that's where we're going
first half of the class,

102
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,280
metaphysics second half
of the class value theory.

103
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,160
Next thing I need to explain is this.

104
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,930
There's roughly speaking
two ways to do a class,

105
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:48,950
especially in introductory class
like this. In approach number one,

106
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:53,951
you simply lay out the various
positions pro and con and the professor,

107
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,600
uh,
strives to remain neutral,

108
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,700
sort of not tip his hand about what he
holds, that sort of approach. Number one,

109
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:07,970
and sometimes in my intro classes,
that's the approach that I take,

110
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,110
but the other approach and the one that
I should warn you I'm going to take this

111
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,900
semester in this class
is rather different.

112
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,360
There's a line that I'm
going to be developing,

113
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,140
pushing,
if you will or defending in this class.

114
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:29,350
That is to say there's a certain set of
views I hold about the issues that we'll

115
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:33,950
be discussing and what I'm going to try
to do in this class is argue for those

116
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:37,640
users. Try to convince you
that those views are correct

117
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,800
to help you know sort of ahead of
time quickly what those views are.

118
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,280
I want to start by describing a set of
views that many of you probably believe.

119
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,160
So I'm going to give you a cluster of use.
Logically speaking,

120
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,410
you could believe some of these
things are not all of them,

121
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,770
but here's a set of views that
many of you probably believe in it.

122
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:05,400
I imagine most of you believe at
least some of these things. So here,

123
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:09,770
here's the set of common views.
First of all, that we have a soul.

124
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:12,980
That is to say we're not just bodies,

125
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:17,810
we're not just lumps of bone and flesh,
but there's a part of us,

126
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:22,700
perhaps the essential part of us that
is something more than the physical,

127
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:26,690
the spiritual, immaterial part of
us, which as I say in this class,

128
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:29,360
we'll call a soul.
So most of us,

129
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:31,790
most of you probably believe in soul,

130
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:36,470
certainly most people in America
believe in some sort of immaterial soul.

131
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,380
And given this existence
of this immaterial soul,

132
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,720
it's a possibility,

133
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,740
indeed a fair likelihood that
we will survive our deaths.

134
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,910
The death will be the, you know,
the destruction of my body,

135
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,980
but my soul is in material.

136
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,800
And so my soul can continue
to exist after my death.

137
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,450
And whether or not you
actually believe in a soul,

138
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,440
you hope that there's a soul,
uh,

139
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:09,441
so that there'll be this
serious possibility of
surviving your death because

140
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,320
death is not only bad but so horrible
that what we would like to have happen is

141
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,760
we would like to live forever.
And so armed with a soul as it were,

142
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,820
there's at least the
possibility of immortality in
mortality would be wonderful.

143
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,020
That's what we hope is the case. Uh,
whether or not we know that it's the case,

144
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,950
the mortality, it would be wonderful.
That's why death so bad, it robs us of,

145
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,420
of immortality. And if,
if there is no soul,

146
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:43,350
if death is the end, if there's, if
there is no immortality, this is such an,

147
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,510
if there is no immortality,

148
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,230
this is such an overwhelming
Lee bad thing that the only,

149
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:51,630
the obvious reaction,
the natural reaction,

150
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:56,631
the universal reaction is to face the
prospect of death with a fear and despair.

151
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,010
And,
uh,

152
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,250
as I mentioned earlier than death is so
horrible and life is so wonderful that

153
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:10,890
it could never make
sense to throw it away.

154
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,040
And so suicide is both immoral on
the one hand and never make sense.

155
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:21,420
It's always irrational, uh, as well. In
addition, all right. That, that as I say,

156
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:26,421
as I think a common set of views about
the nature of death and what I'm going to

157
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:29,790
be doing,

158
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,750
what I'm going to be arguing in this
class is that that set of views is pretty

159
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:38,550
much mistaken from beginning to end.
Uh,

160
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:41,730
and so I'm going to try to
convince you that, you know,

161
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:45,330
there is no soul in mortality,
would not be a good thing.

162
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,560
Fear of death isn't actually
inappropriate. Uh, response to death.

163
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,880
Suicide under certain circumstances
might be rationally, morally justified.

164
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,600
As I say,

165
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,100
they're common picture is pretty
much mistaken from start to end.

166
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,650
That's at least my goal.
That's, that's my aim.

167
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,840
That's what I'm going to be doing now.

168
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,770
Since of course I believe the views I
believe and I hope at the end of the

169
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:12,720
semester you'll agree with me because I
think they're true and I hope you'll end

170
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:14,910
up believing the truth.
But I shouldn't say that.

171
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,780
The crucial point isn't
for you to agree with me.

172
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,110
The crucial point is for you to think
for yourself and so what I'm really doing

173
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,210
is inviting you to take a good cold,

174
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,360
hard look at death and to face it and
think about it in a way that most of us

175
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,233
don't do.

176
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,720
If you at the end of the semester haven't
agreed with me about this particular

177
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:49,350
claim of that particular claim,
so be it. I'll be content,

178
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,130
I won't be completely content,
but I'll be at least largely content as,

179
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:58,530
as you've really thought through the
arguments on each side of these various

180
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:04,080
issues. Carry. Maybe it would be a good
time for the past around the syllabus.

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,640
Alright,
next introductory remark.

182
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,590
Let a lot of today's talk's going to
be devoted to business. I'll get to a,

183
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:13,930
if time permits,
some philosophy at the end.

184
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,820
I want to make you one more remark about
what I'll be doing in terms of this

185
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,950
class. This class, as I say,
it's a philosophy class.

186
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:26,130
We'll basically be sitting here thinking
about what we can know or make sense of

187
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:30,200
with regard to death using our,
you know,

188
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,260
our reasoning capacities.
We'll,

189
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:36,560
we'll be trying to think about death
from a rational standpoint. Um,

190
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,880
one kind of evidence or one
kind of argument that we
won't be making use of here

191
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,720
is appeal to religious authority.

192
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,470
So some of you may believe in,
for example,

193
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:54,280
the existence of an afterlife may believe
you're going to survive your death. Uh,

194
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:59,230
you may believe in immortality because
that's what your church teaches you. And,

195
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,850
and that's fine.

196
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,120
It's not my purpose or intention here to
try to argue you out of your religious

197
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:10,240
beliefs or to argue against
your religious beliefs.

198
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,480
All I'm going to ask is that we not appeal
to such religious arguments appeal to

199
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,440
revelation or the authority of the Bible
or what have you in the course of this

200
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,890
argument, of course, of
this class, if you want to,

201
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:30,670
you could think of this class
as one big hypothetical.

202
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,940
What conclusions would we come to about
the nature of death if we had to think

203
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:41,140
about it from a secular perspective,

204
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,320
making use of only our own reasoning as
opposed to a whatever answers we might

205
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,430
be given by divine revealed authority.

206
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,990
Those of you who believe in divine
revealed authority, uh, you know,

207
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:57,580
that's a debate for another day.

208
00:13:57,581 --> 00:14:02,200
It's not a debate that we're going to be
engaged in here, uh, in this semester.

209
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,190
And similarly,

210
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,570
although I'm not going to ask you in
your discussion sections to hide your

211
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:10,490
religious views, uh,
you'll be asked, you know,

212
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,130
in the course of defending them to,
to give reasons that would make sense to,

213
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:19,200
you know, to all of us. All right.

214
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,490
Uh, that's my way of sort of where the
class is going. Let me now turn to uh,

215
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:29,170
some discussion about the requirements
of the class grades and so forth and so

216
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:32,560
on.
The syllabus is going around the class.

217
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,660
Almost all of you have it at this point
that this all does doesn't really say a

218
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:40,780
whole lot. I've already given you an
overview of what topics we'll be going to.

219
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,170
The,

220
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:46,170
the crucial point about the syllabus is
that it indicates what reading you need

221
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:50,170
to have done for any given week.
Now,

222
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:55,230
I've done my to peg the readings to
where I will be on that week's lectures,

223
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:02,090
but I don't lecture with
lecture notes for the most part.

224
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:05,210
Sometimes they take a little bit
longer than I anticipated. Actually.

225
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,510
I often take a little bit longer
than I anticipated. No doubt.

226
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:12,020
At some point I'll fall behind. At some
point they may rush to catch up ahead.

227
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,200
It won't always be the case that the
readings will exactly coincide with where

228
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:19,220
the lectures are at.
Nonetheless,

229
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,670
in any given week for
the start of that week,

230
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,450
you should have done the readings
that are listed for that week.

231
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,330
The readings on the syllabus,
simply say the author, you know,

232
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,200
and there's, there's a couple
of books that are available.

233
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:41,201
A at the bookstore there are a larger
packet of readings that's available as a

234
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:46,040
course pack at Tycho's. Uh, and
so for any given week, you know,

235
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:50,510
you can find the reading one or two cases,
uh,

236
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,830
maybe just one actually where I've got
more than one article by the given author,

237
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,650
I've given the,

238
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,450
the title of the article as well shouldn't
be difficult to locate the reading

239
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:00,320
for any given week.

240
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,160
The format of the class of course is
a familiar and straight forward one.

241
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,800
I'll be sitting here lecturing,
uh, twice a week. This time,

242
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,270
10 30 to 11,
20.

243
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,800
Once a week you will break
up into discussion sections,

244
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,530
the discussion sections,
we'll meet for 50 minutes.

245
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,040
You of course will have a single time.
Each one of you will have a single time.

246
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,300
That will be different times.

247
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:28,330
The discussion sections meet for this
for the first time that the philosophy

248
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:33,560
apartment has just switched over
to the online discussion section.

249
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,460
Registration System.
I'm not 100% certain how that works.

250
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,040
I've not used it before.
I take it.

251
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:44,990
The idea is something like this right now,
if you were to shop the class,

252
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:49,991
you could find the tentative list of
discussion section days and times,

253
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,350
so it'd be sure to find some
time that works for you.

254
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,500
You can't actually register for any of
those discussions section times yet,

255
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:05,530
but as of I think next week when you're
able to begin your online registration,

256
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,890
you will be able to register for any
discussion section that still has a slot,

257
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,160
still has a space open in it.
In fact,

258
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,600
you won't be able to
finalize your discussion.

259
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,990
You won't be able to finalize your
registration for your courses until you've

260
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:28,910
actually signed up for an available
slot once you have registered.

261
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,990
Uh, if some other slots become available
that weren't previously available,

262
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:36,980
I gather you'll be sent some sort of email
by the system in case some other time

263
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:40,520
would be better for you. You can put
yourself on waiting lists and so forth.

264
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,510
It sounds pretty good on paper.

265
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,930
Maybe the law works smoothly.
I've never been through it before.

266
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,500
I hope we won't have any problems,

267
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,670
but right now what you want to make
sure is that there is a time that's

268
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:55,770
available.
I mean right now all the times available,

269
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,940
but that there is a time that works
for you because if you can't find a

270
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:03,840
discussion section that works for you,
you won't be able to take this course.

271
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,650
Any questions about that?
Any questions?

272
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,470
I should actually ask any questions
about anything that I've asked or said so

273
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:13,060
far up to this point.

274
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,200
Let me make a remark about
questions, which is, Oh yeah,
today's mostly business.

275
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:21,070
Hopefully it will be
fairly straight forward,

276
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,070
but both today and throughout the
entire semester as I'm lecturing,

277
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,850
I want to invite you to
jump in with questions.

278
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:32,850
We'll jump into a bit of an exaggeration.
I don't want to just start talking,

279
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,610
but you know, raise your hand. You know,

280
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,240
if I'm saying something
that you don't understand,

281
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,720
that chances are pretty good that there's
25 or 50 other students in the class

282
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,270
who don't understand it either.

283
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,860
I'm just not being clear and
so I want to welcome you.

284
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:57,300
I really want to invite you whenever you
got some reactions to the things that

285
00:18:57,301 --> 00:19:00,630
I'm saying, you know, Shelly know, raise
your hand. I'll call on you. Say, shall,

286
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:02,820
I didn't really understand what
you were saying about the soul.

287
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,800
Could you please explain that again or
for that matter if you've got some quick

288
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:12,801
reactions or thoughts or responses to
the arguments that I'm laying out and you

289
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:15,780
want to share them with
the class as a whole,

290
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,120
then very much I want to
invite you to do this.

291
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,530
Now this class is too big for us
to have some, you know, close,

292
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:25,560
intimate,
a conversation between the 150 hours,

293
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,740
180 however many students there are here.
That's not going to happen.

294
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:29,700
Yeah.

295
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,010
But you know,
the,

296
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,890
the chance for detailed discussion
in the discussion section,

297
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:39,450
I mean that's where that should happen.
But still there is a chance for, you know,

298
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:43,110
brief reactions and definitely a chance
for questions and I very much want to

299
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:44,100
invite you to do that.

300
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:47,310
So if at any point you've got something
you want to ask about or some two bits

301
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:52,200
you want to add, raise your hand,
wiggle it around, make sure I see you.

302
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,650
I may want to finish that
particular point that I'm making,

303
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,560
but I'll try to come back to
you and I'll then you know,

304
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:03,210
raise your question and if I remember
at least I will repeat the question out

305
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:05,730
loud. Uh, so that everybody can hear it.

306
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:11,510
Also want to say that I will try to
have the practice of after class ends.

307
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:16,580
If you want to continue the discussion,

308
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,430
you have some questions that
occurred to you towards the end.

309
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,010
We didn't have a chance to share
them with the class as a whole.

310
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,280
I will on a normal day meet outside and
continue to talk with however many of

311
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:33,200
you want to do that until
you're done. Uh, so I mean,

312
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:36,590
I just love talking about
this stuff. Uh, and you know,

313
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:39,740
so I welcome you to
come to my office hours.

314
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,120
I invite you to ask questions in class
or if you prefer after class as well.

315
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:45,440
And again,
any questions about any of that?

316
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,143
Yeah,

317
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,750
one on my office hours.

318
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,180
That's a great question and I
don't know the answer to it on fee.

319
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,310
I haven't planned them yet on Thursday.

320
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,150
Start the class by asking me that and
I'll give you an answer. All right.

321
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,190
Um, other bits of business. I
should say something about grades.

322
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,320
Now, many of you may have
heard, many of you may know,

323
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,490
and if you don't already know this,

324
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:17,491
I should warn you that I have a reputation
around Yale as being a harsh grader.

325
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,290
I know this is true.
That is,

326
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,110
I know I have the reputation both
because I periodically and my student

327
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:27,520
evaluations get told I'm one of Yale's
harsher graders, harder graders.

328
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,790
And because every now and
then the Yale Daily News,

329
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,090
we'll have an article about grade
inflation on the law. Always ask me, well,

330
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:35,590
you know,
professor Kagan is somebody,

331
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,850
once there was a story on grade inflation
that the Aal Daily News began by

332
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:40,450
saying,

333
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:45,400
as Shelly Kagan parentheses known at
Yale is one of the hardest graders,

334
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:46,360
closed parentheses.

335
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,120
So I know I've got at least the
reputation of being a hard grader. Uh,

336
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:57,121
I don't actually know
whether it's deserved or not
because Yale does not publish

337
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,260
a information about what the
grading averages are. You know,

338
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,570
at other schools I've
taught at, uh, there's been
information along the lines of,

339
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:04,801
well,

340
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:08,590
the typical grade and an introductory
course in the humanities is such and such.

341
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,440
Uh, shortly after I came
here to Yale, uh, and I said,

342
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,620
realizing that people were
thought it was a harder,

343
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:17,260
greater than than most
other Yale professors. Uh,

344
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:21,310
I called the administration and asked,
do you have this sort of information?

345
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:26,110
And the answer is yes. Will you
give it to me? The answer was no.

346
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,620
Uh, they don't share this
information with the Yale Faculty.

347
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,520
Seems odd that the,
the,

348
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,200
the explanation courts actually
isn't that hard to come by.

349
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,380
The worry is that those of us who
are harder graders than average,

350
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,160
if the information war published would
feel guilty and sort of ease up on our

351
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:49,024
grading.

352
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:54,060
But those who are easier graders than
average will never feel guilty and toughen

353
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:59,620
up. And so the result would
be a constant push up, uh,

354
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:03,370
with the grades anyway. So I don't know
for a certainty that I'm a harder grader,

355
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,520
but I believe that it's the case based
on reactions I get when I give the speech

356
00:23:11,501 --> 00:23:14,050
that I'm about to give. Okay. So

357
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:21,820
when I open the blue book,
the Yale guideline, you know,

358
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:25,360
th th th th the Yale catalog,
it's got a page, as you all know,

359
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,600
where it says what grades,
what letter grades mean at Yale.

360
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,120
I didn't actually bring it this year.
Sometimes I do,

361
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,530
but I've got it pretty much
memorized. Uh, it says, for example,

362
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:39,160
next to each letter grade, you
know what it means. B for example,

363
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,690
means good.

364
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:46,040
A means excellence seeming satisfactory
or a d is passing. F is failing being,

365
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:49,220
I'll start with B. B means good. Now,

366
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:52,190
quite crucial question then
is what does good mean?

367
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:58,100
I take good to mean good.

368
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,990
Consequently,

369
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,560
if you want to write a good paper for me,

370
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,170
that would get a B.

371
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,340
And when you get a B from me,
and I say me,

372
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,530
this is the royal me, you know? Uh,

373
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,200
because I won't actually be
grading your papers. Uh, your,

374
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:24,010
your papers will be graded
by a small army of tas,

375
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,120
but they will grade under my supervision.

376
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:33,220
And in keeping with the standards that
I asked them, uh, to, to grade myself.

377
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,670
So when you're pissed off about your
grades, the person to take it up with it,

378
00:24:36,671 --> 00:24:38,770
well, I'll take it up with
them, but, but you know,

379
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,250
then surely you want to take it up with
me. So when you get it right be from us,

380
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:49,300
B doesn't mean what a
piece of crap B means.

381
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,260
Good job.

382
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,090
And so you shouldn't be pleased to get
a B because it meant you were doing good

383
00:24:56,091 --> 00:25:01,091
work and it's not easy to do good
work in philosophy a means excellent.

384
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:08,720
Now,
excellent does not mean publishable.

385
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,830
Excellent does not mean you are
God's gift to philosophy. Right?

386
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,110
And so it's crucial to understand.

387
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:21,560
It doesn't mean if the only way you're
going to get an a is to be God's gift to

388
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,394
philosophy.

389
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,730
A's mean excellent work for
a first class in philosophy.

390
00:25:27,871 --> 00:25:29,490
This is an introductory class.

391
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:33,420
It does not presuppose any
background in philosophy.

392
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,600
Well to get an a,

393
00:25:37,601 --> 00:25:41,980
you've got to show some
flair for the subject.

394
00:25:41,981 --> 00:25:45,610
You've got to show not only have you
sort of understood the ideas and they've

395
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:48,940
been put forward and the readings,
uh, and in the lectures and so forth,

396
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,910
but you see how to sort of
put them together in a paper
in a way that shows you

397
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,380
got some aptitude here. You did it
in a way that made us take note.

398
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,470
That's what we try to
reserve a [inaudible] for.

399
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,430
Some of you will end up getting
A's if not at the beginning.

400
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:06,820
By the end of the semester,
many of you will end up getting B's.

401
00:26:06,821 --> 00:26:08,710
If not at the beginning.
By the end of the semester,

402
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:13,570
many of you will not
start out doing good work.

403
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,711
Many of you,

404
00:26:14,711 --> 00:26:19,711
we'll start out doing satisfactory work
or truth be told less than satisfactory

405
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,530
work.
Now look,

406
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:28,710
I was an undergraduate once and I
know what it is to write a typical

407
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:30,910
undergraduate paper.

408
00:26:30,911 --> 00:26:35,320
You sit down the night before
and you had a couple of ideas.

409
00:26:35,321 --> 00:26:38,860
You thought about it maybe for a half
an hour at Ba and you meant to get to it

410
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:39,311
sooner,

411
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:43,950
but you had a lot of other things to do
and you throw it off in a couple hours

412
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,611
and you know,

413
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:49,611
maybe stay up late and you know it's not
the worst thing you ever wrote and it's

414
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:56,130
not the best thing he ever wrote.
And it has a couple of Nice ideas,

415
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:59,910
but maybe it could be better.
It's sort of a satisfactory job.

416
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,480
Well Yale says satisfactory
means c and so many of you,

417
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:11,820
we'll start off the semester
writing that kind of paper.

418
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,240
And the fact of the matter is some of you,

419
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:19,320
we'll start off writing worst papers
than that because writing a philosophy

420
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:23,730
paper is a difficult thing
to learn how to do. It's not,

421
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:28,731
it's exercising a set of muscles that a
lot of you have not spent a lot of time

422
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:33,630
exercising. Now the thought is that you
haven't spent any time doing it. I mean,

423
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,570
you've had bull sessions, right, with
your high school friends or, and you know,

424
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,180
your college dorm or what have you,

425
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,010
but you haven't done it with the kind of
discipline and rigor that we're looking

426
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:46,140
for here.
And so like anything else,

427
00:27:46,141 --> 00:27:50,700
it's a skill that gets
better with practice and,

428
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,380
but what that means of course,

429
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:57,060
is you won't do as well at the beginning
as you're likely to be doing toward the

430
00:27:57,061 --> 00:27:59,430
end.
Some of you unfortunately,

431
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:03,300
won't do very good jobs at the beginning.
And my tas,

432
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:06,120
I'll encourage them to be
prepared to give, you know, Ds,

433
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,540
if the vices of the paper
significantly outweigh the virtues,

434
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,700
that's a d if devices very significantly
outweigh whatever virtues are,

435
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,200
that's some kind of an f.

436
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,740
So the fact of the matter is many of you
in your initial papers will get lower

437
00:28:24,391 --> 00:28:28,320
grades than you've probably
ever gotten before in your life.

438
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,500
Wanted to warn you about that.

439
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:38,180
Now I say this not so much to
depress the hell out of you,

440
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:39,181
but hey,

441
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:44,181
partly to warn you and B to make it
clear that I believe that it's a skill

442
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:47,611
writing philosophy.

443
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:51,780
Good philosophy paper is a skill and you
can get better at it and consequently

444
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:56,670
most of you will get better at it. And
so let me make the follow me to remark.

445
00:28:56,671 --> 00:29:01,620
Look officially each paper you
have three five page papers.

446
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:06,650
Each paper is worth 25%
of your grade officially,

447
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,550
but the remaining 25% of his discussion
section, we'll get to that in a minute.

448
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,120
Officially 25% of your grade
for each of the three papers,

449
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:19,500
but if over the course of
the semester you get better,

450
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,890
then we will give at the end of the
semester when we're figuring out your

451
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:23,724
semester grade,

452
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:28,730
we'll give the later stronger papers
more than their official weight.

453
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,320
For many of you,

454
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:35,910
the first paper will be clearly the
worst paper you write and then we'll just

455
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:37,260
throw that great away,

456
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,950
give greater weight to
the second third paper.

457
00:29:40,951 --> 00:29:44,380
The third paper is a stronger still
we'll get even more weight to the third

458
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:46,990
paper.
There is no formula here.

459
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,570
Great deal depends on the overall pattern,

460
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:52,990
what uta tells me about how you've
done over the course of the semester,

461
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,260
but this policy of giving greater weight
if you show improvement is something

462
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:01,930
that most of you will benefit from.

463
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,630
And so if you end up not doing well,

464
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,020
the moral of the story is not to go
running off and dropping the class,

465
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,740
but to figure out what you did right,
what you didn't do right,

466
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,550
how to make the second paper better and
then the third paper stronger again.

467
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,080
And if you do show improvement,

468
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:22,060
that will vary significantly influence
and emerge in terms of the impact it has

469
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:25,960
on your overall semester grade.
Because of this policy,

470
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,130
I don't actually know when all is said
and done are there at the end of the

471
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:33,370
semester, I'm any harder, you know,

472
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,790
whether I depart from the average or not.
Let me quickly mention,

473
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,880
here's a fairly typical grade distribution
for the overall grades of this.

474
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,660
At the end of the semester,

475
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,500
roughly 25% of you are likely to end up
with some kind of an a at the end of the

476
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:51,694
semester,

477
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:57,090
50 55% of you are so are likely
to end up with some kind of uh,

478
00:30:57,821 --> 00:31:02,590
be 2020 5% of you might
end up with some sort of a,

479
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:05,920
see sometimes there's a couple of
percent that end up worse than that.

480
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,510
Unsurprisingly,

481
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,900
you've got the ability to do decent work
in this class and most of you have the

482
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:16,750
ability to do good work and some
of you have a fair chunk of,

483
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:20,980
you have the ability to do excellent
work though it may take some work on your

484
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:25,750
part to get to that point. Last thing
I should say about the grades is,

485
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,190
look, why do I do this? It's really,

486
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:33,940
I try to do it as a
sign of respect for you.

487
00:31:33,941 --> 00:31:36,880
I know that may seem like a surprising
to say what I've just sort of gone on my

488
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:40,930
little gleeful Amanda, but I'm going to
fail all of you. But I mean it's, it's,

489
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:45,280
it's worth my saying, you
know, you guys are so smart,

490
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,250
you're so talented.

491
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:53,820
You've gotten so far on your ability that
many of you have learned to coast and

492
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:02,790
it's not doing you any kind of
service to let you continue coasting.

493
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,830
My goal here is to be honest with you,
right? Say, look, you're smart enough,

494
00:32:08,831 --> 00:32:11,140
probably most of you to Paul,
some sort of be without a lot of,

495
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:15,190
without breaking into a sweat, at least
not a significant sweat. So be it.

496
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:20,980
But it's just lying to you to pretend
that that's excellence in philosophy.

497
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:26,020
And so what I want to do in this class
is be honest with you and tell you you've

498
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:31,021
really done work here to
be extraordinarily proud
of yourself versus yeah,

499
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,740
you've done something okay or hook, you
done good work. Admittedly it's not great,

500
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:40,670
but you've done good work. All right,
that's 75% of your grade is the papers.

501
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,390
The remaining 25% of your grade
is based on discussion section.

502
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,230
Now that's a lot of your grade
to turn on discussion section.

503
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:52,130
And so the first thing I need
to tell you is I really mean it.

504
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:57,050
If you blow off discussion section,
your grade will suffer.

505
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,090
So it's worth knowing in a general way.

506
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:03,010
What do you need to do to earn a good
grade and discussion section and hearing

507
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:07,490
the answer is perhaps the obvious one.
You need to participate,

508
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:12,980
you need to come to discussion sections.
Having thought about the lectures,

509
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,900
having done the readings,

510
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:18,790
having thought about the questions
that they raise and you need to come to

511
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,551
discussion section.

512
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:24,551
Then prepared to discuss
this week's set of issues.

513
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:31,510
You need to listen to what your classmates
are saying and say why you disagree

514
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:38,591
with them and not just that you disagree
with him but to raise an objection or

515
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,680
why you agree with them and when somebody
else and attacks them and say, look,

516
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,980
I think that what John was saying was
a good point and here's how I think he

517
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:48,050
should have defended his
position or what have you.

518
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:52,400
You need to engage in
philosophical discussion.

519
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,690
If you're not participating
in discussion section,

520
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,310
you're not doing what the section is.
Therefore,

521
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:07,390
philosophers love to talk and we love
to argue and the way to get better at

522
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:13,210
thinking about philosophy is
by talking about philosophy.

523
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,150
And so I'm putting my money where
my mouth is. I'm saying, look, yeah,

524
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,710
that's an important part of the class.

525
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:23,270
So important that it's going to
be worth 25% of your grade. Again,

526
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,700
it doesn't mean this is slightly
different from the papers.

527
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:30,020
It doesn't mean that you've got to be
brilliant philosophically to get an a

528
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:35,530
rather you got to be a wonderful class
citizen to get an a for discussion

529
00:34:36,381 --> 00:34:38,480
sections. And so as I put it, in fact,

530
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:41,930
I think I put it this way in the
syllabus sort of participation and here,

531
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:46,220
I mean sort of, you know, respectful
participation, not hogging the limelight,

532
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:50,180
but no participation
can improve your grade,

533
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:55,040
but it won't lower your grade non
participation or not being there.

534
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,820
That will lower your participation grade.
Again, any questions about any of that?

535
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,440
All right, so you know, I'm sorry to have
this sort of the long gloom and doom,

536
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,180
but it seems that it's only fair to
sort of let you know what you're getting

537
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:10,190
into. One other remark about
the discussion sections,

538
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:15,370
the way I think of it is
like the conversation hour
for your foreign language

539
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:20,060
class. Many, how many of you have
had a philosophy class before?

540
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:26,300
Look, thanks. You know, maybe
15% of you, maybe 20% of you,

541
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:30,110
most of you have not. All right?
That's pretty normal, right?

542
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,040
Don't go into discussion section
thinking, oh, I can't talk.

543
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:35,570
I don't have any background in philosophy.

544
00:35:35,571 --> 00:35:39,570
I've never done this sort of thing before.
That's true for most of you.

545
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,780
The way you get better
is by talking philosophy.

546
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,980
Alright,
next remark.

547
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,800
I guess this is sort of just one last
connection with God. Your grades.

548
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,570
This is an intro philosophy class.

549
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:58,740
The crucial point about intro is it
means FirstClass in philosophy doesn't

550
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:01,230
presuppose any background in philosophy.

551
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,050
It doesn't necessarily mean easy.

552
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,130
Some of this material for some of you
is going to be very, very difficult.

553
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:12,800
And although the number of pages that
you'll have to read are not, you know,

554
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:17,400
there's not a lot, you know, probably
typical week, 50 pages, maybe less.

555
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,690
It's for many of you,

556
00:36:18,691 --> 00:36:23,580
you got to find it dense material and
although I don't really have the fantasy

557
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:27,840
that many of you will read this stuff
twice if you had the time to do it,

558
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,390
that would be a wonderful thing to do.

559
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:34,410
Philosophy is hard stuff to read.

560
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,350
Other remark about this being an intro
intro classes that it's introductory in

561
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:42,480
that the issues that we're talking about,

562
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:47,481
our kind of first run through every
single thing that we discuss here could be

563
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:53,400
pursued at greater depth.
So for example,

564
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,570
will spend whatever it is maybe a week
and a half talking about the nature of

565
00:36:57,571 --> 00:36:59,460
personal identity,
two weeks,

566
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:04,730
but one could easily spend an entire
semester thinking about that question

567
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:06,090
alone.

568
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,810
So don't come away thinking that whatever
it is that we've talked about here in

569
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:10,290
lectures,

570
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:15,290
the last word on the subject rather
it's something more like first words.

571
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,350
Actually one of the work
about what worried about um,

572
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,940
the readings and the lectures.

573
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:27,020
With one exception I won't be spending
very much time talking about the

574
00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:32,640
readings. The exception is Plato
where I'll spend a lecture,

575
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:37,080
maybe two lectures trying to
reconstruct Plato's central arguments,

576
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,650
at least the arguments
relevant to our class.

577
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,650
It will be really one to Plato's
dialogues, but for the most part,

578
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:48,740
although I'll occasionally
periodically refer to the readings,

579
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:54,950
I won't spend a lot of time talking
about the views in the readings,

580
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:01,610
the readings you should think of
as complimentary to my lectures.

581
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:07,130
The idea is that there's more to say
than what I've said and you'll find some

582
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:12,381
more of what there is to say in the
readings or there may be positions that I

583
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:15,330
mentioned but I don't develop cause
I'm not perhaps sympathetic to them.

584
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,510
And you might find somebody who is
sympathetic to them, developing them,

585
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,370
developing them in the readings.

586
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:24,780
The readings are a crucial
component of the class.

587
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:29,820
You won't get everything
you need simply by doing,

588
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,440
by coming to the lectures.

589
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:36,710
But equally the case that the views
that be developing and the lectures are,

590
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:41,020
although not necessarily unique to me,
aren't all laid out in the readings.

591
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:44,800
You won't get everything I'm
talking about in the lectures.

592
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:48,310
If all you do is the readings.
They're both parts of the class.

593
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:55,350
All right. I want to end by, uh,

594
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,430
we were not close to MD,

595
00:38:56,431 --> 00:39:01,431
but the last time I'm going to do is
read aloud some student evaluations.

596
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,670
I have found over the years
that some students like me,

597
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,010
some students don't like me.

598
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:13,250
I don't know how to make this point any
clear then to share with you a sampling

599
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:18,600
of the uh, student evaluations. These
are not actually from last spring,

600
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:22,680
but their typical enough that I was
too lazy to make some new quotes.

601
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:30,540
Oh one. So these are actual quotes
from former actual students. One,

602
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:35,970
the lecturers were clear and
followed a very logical order to,

603
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:41,110
I thought the class was not
always organized. Three,

604
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:46,320
I thought it was a very well organized
class for overall I was unsatisfied with

605
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:52,570
this course.
Few substantive conclusions were reached.

606
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,150
Five along the same vein.

607
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,360
I think he should avoid saying at
the end of each segment of the class,

608
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,960
ultimately you'll have to decide
what to think for yourself.

609
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,690
I should end the class by saying
you will blow the, okay. I actually,

610
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:12,691
I started the class by saying that you
will believe what I believe six it might

611
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:16,420
be improved by presenting other
views better and more objectively.

612
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,170
Since Kagan always ended up particular
line of reasoning by defeating the

613
00:40:20,171 --> 00:40:21,550
argument.
If he didn't agree with it,

614
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,600
he could be a bit more unbiased
and tolerant of other perspectives.

615
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:32,070
Seven lectures where sometimes repetitive
or obvious but occasionally they

616
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:34,510
provided new insights.
Eight,

617
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,740
I know that some felt the pace of
the arguments was a little slow,

618
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:43,390
but I felt this was generally necessary
not only for the on philosophy savvy

619
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:46,060
population but also to cover our points.

620
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:51,610
Nine extremely thorough and thoughtful,
receptive to questions.

621
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:56,110
Brilliant. I like that
one. Often longwinded

622
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,760
10 he does go wrong and her on
the same idea a number of times,

623
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,030
which does cut down on the notes for the
class, but it can get a little boring.

624
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,460
11 though. I've heard students
say he often repeats himself.

625
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,910
I think this is a merit in a philosophy
course in which arguments and thoughts

626
00:41:15,911 --> 00:41:17,560
can quickly become confusing.

627
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:23,170
12 Shelly Kagan is a fabulous,
resourceful,

628
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,540
honorly convincing lecturer.

629
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,700
13 he would work through arguments
right in front of him. This one,

630
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,010
this what actually I like this one going.

631
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,360
I think this is what at least aimed to
be inside my head. Here's what I'm doing.

632
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:39,230
13 he would work through
arguments right in front of us,

633
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,500
which then helped me work
through them on my own.

634
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,660
14 Shelly is an incredibly
dynamic lecturer.

635
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,740
15 he's just in his own world,

636
00:41:51,741 --> 00:41:54,080
babbling on and on.

637
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:57,020
I zone out with regularity.

638
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:03,940
16 I have to say that's Shelly Kagan is
probably the best lecture I had in my

639
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:06,560
four years at Yale.

640
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,400
17 he's the type of teacher
you either love or hate.

641
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,570
Now,
that's pretty clearly true.

642
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:19,660
I wish there were some easy litmus test
that I could just give you so you'd know

643
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,240
which of you would be making
a mistake taking this class.

644
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:28,220
I don't know how to give it to
you. Next topic, grades one,

645
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:33,700
he tried to intimidate us too much with
his promise of impossible grading so

646
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:39,191
that everyone took the class credit d
fail when we all probably ended up with

647
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:44,531
A's or B's because grading was not hard
to I recommended but only credit d fail.

648
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:54,670
Professor Kagan is harsh with grading
three when Shelly says he's the harshest

649
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:57,980
grader on campus,
he isn't lying.

650
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:02,050
I was consistently surprised
by how poorly I did on papers.

651
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:08,900
The standards in this class are just
different from all other classes.

652
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:14,560
For Kagan's reputation as a
harsh grader is unfounded.

653
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:20,180
If you put in the effort, the grade
will reflect that so that does that.

654
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:23,120
You know that settles the question on
my a harsh grader, not now. As you know,

655
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:25,550
the last question for the evaluations
or should you take the class or not,

656
00:43:25,551 --> 00:43:27,920
would you recommend it to somebody else?
One,

657
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:33,970
I believe this class is one of the most
mind opening experiences of my life to,

658
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:38,270
no,
it's a waste of a course.

659
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,640
Three it gets kind of depressing at times,

660
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,450
but I suppose that's due to
the nature of the subject

661
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:54,640
for this course stands out as one of
the more unique and stimulating courses.

662
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,420
I've taken it Yale five excellent class.

663
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,300
It made me think about life
and death in a new way.

664
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:07,540
What more can you ask for from a
class six I would not recommend it.

665
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:13,510
The class just seemed to be a platform
for Kagan to throw out random ideas and

666
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:18,110
the students were never required
to engage in any thought. Well,

667
00:44:18,111 --> 00:44:22,280
that clears that up. Let me end with
a couple of other quick remarks.

668
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:27,080
One, these are some of my all time
favorites from previous years.

669
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:31,890
One not doing the reading
didn't hurt me at all.

670
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,070
Now I of course these
are anonymous comments.

671
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:37,440
I don't know who wrote this comment,
but I do know this.

672
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,590
Whoever wrote this remark is an idiot.

673
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:47,280
Whoever wrote this or mark seems to be
under the impression that the point of

674
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:52,281
being at Yale is to spend $40,000 a
year of your parents' money and get away

675
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,390
with learning as little as possible.

676
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,960
Well for those of you who want to try it,

677
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:05,990
you probably could pass this class and
maybe even get an okay grade without

678
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:08,640
doing the readings.
There's no final exam,

679
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,940
but still it's crucial to understand.

680
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,530
Doing the readings is an important part
of learning what this course has to

681
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:19,260
offer.
Different quote.

682
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:23,070
Cagan is a self righteous little man.

683
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,090
Got To tell Ya. That been about
being little at really hurts.

684
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,590
Another one. Great course, wonderful
professor, fascinating subjects.

685
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,420
It's the deepest thinking I've
done in my life. Final quote,

686
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:47,070
this class taught me how to think
more than any other at Yale.

687
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:51,810
I don't know whether I pull it off pretty
obviously for a number of students.

688
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:56,040
I don't manage to pull it off,
but that's at least what my aim is.

689
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,500
I'm trying to help you think.

690
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,440
I welcome you and I hope
you'll be back on Thursday.
