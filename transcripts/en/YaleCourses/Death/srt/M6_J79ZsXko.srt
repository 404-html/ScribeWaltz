1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,550
The end of last class,

2
00:00:02,551 --> 00:00:05,940
we started sketching an argument
that comes from Descartes,

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,210
the Cartesian argument that says

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,720
merely by the process of thinking and the
basis of thought alone attempt to show

5
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:19,230
that the mind. We all agree
that though our minds, what the,

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,480
what the argument attempts to show is
that this mind must be something separate

7
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:26,730
from my body and what's,

8
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:30,450
what's amazing about the argument is that
it works on the basis of pure thought

9
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:31,320
experiment.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,660
The thought experiment you'll recall was
one in which I imagine I tell myself a

11
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:41,661
story in which what I'm doing
is I'm imagining my mind
existing without my body.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,010
It doesn't seem especially
difficult to do that,

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,790
but then we add this extra
philosophical premise.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,290
If I can imagine one
thing without the other,

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,830
then it must be that those are two things,

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,370
so my mind must not be my body.

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,700
My mind must not be the same thing as
my body or way of talking about my body

18
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,950
because of course if my
mind just was tosca bi,

19
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,560
I'm a mom talking about my mind just
was a way of talking about my body.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,710
Then to try to imagine
my mind without my body.

21
00:01:20,711 --> 00:01:23,100
It would be trying to imagine
my body without my body.

22
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,360
That obviously can't happen,

23
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,260
but suppose we try to imagine
a world in which Shelly exists,

24
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,670
but Kagan doesn't. Well, you can't, right?

25
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:40,980
Because of course there's
just a single thing,

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,820
Shelly Kagan and so if you've
imagined Shelly existing,

27
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,070
then of course you're
imagining that single thing.

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,540
Shelly Kagan existing and if you
imagine nene Kagan not existing,

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,170
then you're imagining that single thing.
Shelly Kagan not existing,

30
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,550
so you can't even imagine a world in
which Shelly exists, but Kagan doesn't.

31
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,730
Now it's important not to
be confused about this.

32
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,240
We can easily imagine a
world in which you know,

33
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,150
I don't have the last name Kagan
or perhaps to switch it around.

34
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,500
Shelly's not my name.
Supposedly my parents had named me Bruce.

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,860
Nothing would be easier.
Imagine a world in which Kagan exists,

36
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:20,400
but Shelly doesn't exist because
nobody in the world, his name's Shelly.

37
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,840
The question is not,
can you imagine me with a different name,

38
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,130
Bruce instead of Shelly.
Easy enough. It's rather,

39
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,400
can you imagine a world in which the very
thing that you really are picking out,

40
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:39,330
when you refer to me by the name
Shelly, namely, you know this thing,

41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,770
can you imagine a world in which
that thing exists but the war.

42
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,430
But the thing that you're picking out
when you use the word Kagan does not exist

43
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,770
and that you can't do because
in the real world, of course,

44
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:53,310
Shelly and Kagan pick out just two
different names of this very same thing.

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,180
This thing right here. So imagining
a world in which Shelly exists,

46
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:59,920
but Kagan doesn't, or Kagan
exists. Shelly doesn't.

47
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,340
That's trying to imagine a world in
which you know I exist, but I don't.

48
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:07,390
And that's of course incoherent.
So if you can,

49
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:08,470
I'm going to hand contrast.

50
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,250
Can I imagine a world in which my left
hand exists but my right hand doesn't

51
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,920
easy. Why is it so easy? Because of course
there's two different things. Of course,

52
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,160
that doesn't mean that in the real world
one of them does exist in the other one

53
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:25,870
doesn't. But it does show that in the
real world there are two different things.

54
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,290
That's why I could imagine a
world with one but not the other.

55
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,633
Yeah.

56
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,890
Try to imagine a world in which somebody
smile exists but their body doesn't.

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,130
You can't do it.

58
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,970
You can't have the smile without the
body and of course no mystery about that.

59
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:56,040
That's because the smile isn't really
some separate thing from the body.

60
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,810
Talking about smiles, as we've noted
before, it's just a way of talking about,

61
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,190
you know, either what the body can do or
what a certain area of the body can do.

62
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,210
You can try to imagine it. You
know, in Alison Wonderland,

63
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:11,700
the Cheshire cat disappears
and all we have left.

64
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:14,130
The last thing that
disappears is the smile.

65
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,430
But of course when you imagine the
Cheshire cat only having the smile there,

66
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,510
you're still imagining the
cat's lips, teeth, maybe tongue,

67
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:25,344
whatever it is.

68
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,820
If you try to imagine a
smile with nobody at all,

69
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,190
can't be done. Why? Because the smile
isn't something separate from the body.

70
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,640
Try to imagine.
My mind says,

71
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:44,641
day card without my body easy from which
it follows that my mind and my body

72
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:50,560
must not be one thing.

73
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,500
They must in fact be two things.

74
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,710
That's why it's possible to
imagine the one without the other.

75
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,250
So this Cartesian argument seems to show
us that the mind is something separate

76
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:10,051
from distinct from not reduceable to
not just a way of talking about my body.

77
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,320
Yeah.

78
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,000
So it's gotta be something extra
above and beyond my body. It's a soul.

79
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,900
That's what Descartes argued.
As I say to this day,

80
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:26,070
philosophers disagree about
whether this argument works or not.

81
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,320
I don't think it does work.

82
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,150
And in a second I'll give you a conjurer
example and then having given the

83
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:34,260
counter example,

84
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:38,160
I mean that is what I'm going to give is
an example of an argument just like it

85
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:38,761
or at least an argument.

86
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:42,600
It seems to be just like it where we
can pretty easily see that that argument

87
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:46,920
doesn't work. And so something must go
wrong with Descartes' argument as well.

88
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,780
Well,
here's the counter example.

89
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,150
Okay.

90
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,500
Some of you,
I'm sure most of you,

91
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:57,010
maybe all of you are familiar
with the evening star.

92
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:02,230
The evening star is the roughly speaking
first heavenly body that's visible in

93
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:07,040
the sky as it gets dark,
at least at certain times of the year.

94
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,620
And I'm sure you're also familiar.
Then with the Morningstar,

95
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,600
the morning star is that heavenly body,

96
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:21,601
which is the last heavenly body that's
still visible as dawn comes in and begins

97
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:26,170
to get light. So as a first
pass, it's the evening stars,

98
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:29,230
the first star that's visitable.
And uh,

99
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:32,500
the morning star is the last
star that's visible, you know,

100
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:33,760
at the right times of the year.

101
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,103
Okay.

102
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,260
The world that we live in has both in
the evening star and the Morningstar.

103
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,710
Uh, but try to imagine a world
in which the evening star exists,

104
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,780
but the Morningstar does not seems
fairly straight forward. Right. You know,

105
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:54,890
I get up in the morning,
uh, at dawn's approaching,

106
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:57,110
I look around in the
Morningstar is not there.

107
00:06:57,111 --> 00:07:02,000
There is no star where the Morningstar
had been or where people have claimed it

108
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:06,890
would be or something.
But the evening star still exist.

109
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:11,590
When I go out as, as sunsets and dusk
falls, there is the evening star. So it's,

110
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:11,750
it's a,

111
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,590
it's a trivial matter to imagine a world
in which the evening star exists in the

112
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,490
Morningstar does not. And so we've
got a, we could imagine that a, uh,

113
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,610
a day cart like argument saying,

114
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,010
if I can imagine the evening star
without the morning star that shows the

115
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,160
evening star in the Morningstar must
be two different heavenly bodies.

116
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,791
But in fact,

117
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:35,791
that's not so the evening star and the
morning star are the very same heavenly

118
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,320
body. In fact, it's not a
star at all. So it's a planet.

119
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,830
It's a venous,
if I recall correctly.

120
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:51,770
So look, there's only one thing.
The evening star is Venus.

121
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,140
The Morningstar is Venus.

122
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,370
So they couldn't be a world in
which the evening star exists.

123
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:02,450
But the morning star doesn't cause that
would be a world in which venous exists

124
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,700
and Venus doesn't exist. And obviously
that's not possible. Of course,

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
what you can imagine is a world in which
venous isn't visible in the morning.

126
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,780
Still that's not a world in which
the Morningstar doesn't exist.

127
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,740
Given that what we mean by the
Morningstar is that heavenly object,

128
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,100
whatever it is that in this
world we pick out, you know,

129
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:27,080
at that time in the morning
and looking up at the sky.

130
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,700
Okay?

131
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,450
So when I refer to the morning star,
I'm talking about Venus,

132
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:37,770
whether or not I realize it's Venus.
When I talk about the evening star,

133
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:42,510
I'm referring to Venus, whether or not I
realize that Venus is the evening star.

134
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,220
So as long as Venus is around,
well there's the evening star,

135
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:49,070
there's the Morningstar,

136
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,120
there's Venus can't have a world in
which the Morningstar doesn't exist.

137
00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:57,480
But the evening star does.

138
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,650
Although you could have a world in which
Venus doesn't show up in the morning,

139
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,910
still from the fact that I can
imagine the world in which you know,

140
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:12,270
I look around for the morning. There it
isn't. I look around for the evening star.

141
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:15,090
There it is.
You might've thought that showed,

142
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,020
didn't Descartes prove to us that that
shows the evening star in the Morningstar

143
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,200
are two different things?
Well, no, obviously it didn't.

144
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,620
So let's think about what that
means. So, so we've got this argument

145
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,860
that they cart puts forward.

146
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:33,861
I can imagine my mind without my body
and Descartes says that shows that in

147
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:37,260
fact, my mind is something
separate from my body.

148
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,120
Well, I can imagine the evening
star without the Morningstar.

149
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,810
So son of Descartes,
you know,

150
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,530
they Cartson uh, has to say, oh,

151
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:55,620
so that shows that the morning starting
the evening star two different things,

152
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,220
but they Cartson would be wrong when
he says that the morning starting the

153
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:05,040
evening star are two different
things there. Just one thing,

154
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,460
namely Venus. In fact, the sentence,

155
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,470
they are one thing slightly misleading,
right? It's just one thing. Venus,

156
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,190
if that argument,
if the argument,

157
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,420
if trying to run the Cartesian
argument for astronomy fails

158
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,980
yet it seems to be an
exactly analogous argument,

159
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,010
we ought to conclude that
the argument for them,

160
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,150
the distinctness of the mind
and the body must fail as well.

161
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,780
Now that seems to me to be right.
I think the Cartesian argument does fail.

162
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,080
And I think the example of the
evening star in the morning star,

163
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:44,910
which is not at all original to me,

164
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:50,160
that this example shows this Kadra
example shows that Descartes' original

165
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:54,780
argument doesn't work either. At least
that's how it seems to me. Well, as I,

166
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:58,050
as I say, there are philosophers
are say, no, no, that's not right.

167
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,340
Maybe somehow we've misunderstood how the
argument goes and it doesn't. Exactly,

168
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,460
although these two arguments
seemed parallel, they're
not in fact parallel there,

169
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,860
there there's some subtle differences that
if we're not looking carefully, we'll,

170
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,450
we'll, we'll overlook. But God,
as I said, the debate goes on.

171
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,350
One of the reasons for thinking it's not
clear whether the argument fails or not

172
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,240
is because it's hard to pin down
where exactly did it go wrong?

173
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,270
Look, take, take, uh, take
the argument of the, uh,

174
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:39,210
the of the planets. You know, the, the
Morningstar in the evening star example,

175
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,100
I take it that we all agree that when
we attempt to run the Cartesian argument

176
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:46,770
in terms of the morning star,
the evening star, it fails.

177
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,110
But it's harder to say what went wrong.
How did it go wrong?

178
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,620
Why did it wrong? What are
the possibilities? Well,
we said, look, first claim,

179
00:11:56,621 --> 00:12:01,000
first premise. I can imagine a world and
with in which the evening star exists,

180
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:04,270
but the Morningstar doesn't.
Well,

181
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:08,110
I suppose one possible response would be,
you know, you couldn't really do that.

182
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,240
You thought you were imagining a world
in which the evening star exists and the

183
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:14,500
morning star doesn't,

184
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,040
but you weren't really imagining a world
in which the evening star exists in the

185
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:25,060
morning star. Doesn't you miss
describe what it is you've imagined?

186
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,450
Well, that's, that's a silly thing
to say about the astronomy case.

187
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:35,680
Maybe that's the right diagnosis.
Could we similarly say,

188
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,450
I didn't really imagine a
world in which my mind exists,

189
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:41,950
but my body doesn't.

190
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,810
That little story I told last time I
thought I was describing a world in which

191
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:50,410
my mind exists. My body doesn't,
but it wasn't really imagining.

192
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:55,411
A world like that doesn't
seem so persuasive over there
did seem as though I was

193
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:58,420
imagining it.

194
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,690
What else could go wrong with
the uh, astronomy example? Well,

195
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:09,100
maybe I did imagine a world in which the
Morningstar exists and the evening star

196
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,550
doesn't exist.
But maybe imagining,

197
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:17,410
does it mean it's possible?
Normally we think if we imagine something,

198
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:20,100
it means it's possible here. I don't
mean of course empirically Po, yeah,

199
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,150
I can imagine a world with Unicorns.

200
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,460
It doesn't mean I think unicorns
are physically possible.

201
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,710
All we mean here is logically possible.

202
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,360
I can imagine a world with Unicorns seems
to follow that Unicorns are logically

203
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:36,190
possible. Imagination seems
to be a guide to possibility,

204
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,100
but maybe not always.

205
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:44,020
Maybe sometimes we can imagine
something that's really impossible.

206
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,880
Hmm. Try to imagine what can you
do that? Can't you not do that?

207
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,210
Try to imagine a round square.

208
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,340
Can you imagine it?
Can you not a man in certain moods?

209
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,880
I sort of feel I can just
begin to imagine it in.

210
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:03,100
Of course it doesn't really mean it's
possible. It seems like it's impossible.

211
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,670
So maybe imagination is a
flawed guy de possibility.

212
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:10,120
So maybe that's what we should say
about the mind body case. Yeah.

213
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:13,990
I can imagine a world
in which my mind exists,

214
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,700
but my body doesn't. But that doesn't
show that it's really possible,

215
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,500
logically possible to have a world in
which my mind exists is my body doesn't.

216
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,250
Maybe that's where the argument goes
up wrong or the hand isn't imagination.

217
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:34,360
Our best guide to logical
possibility isn't the reason.

218
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:38,080
I think unicorns are logically coherent
just because I can imagine them so

219
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:42,300
easily.
Another possibility.

220
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Maybe we should say the mere fact that
it's possible for a and B to be separate

221
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,730
for a to exist without beef,
for that's clearly where they're separate.

222
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,000
The mere fact that it's possible for
them to be separate doesn't mean that in

223
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:58,160
the actual world they are separate.

224
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Maybe the argument goes wrong by assuming
that identity when when a is equal to

225
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:09,670
B, it's always equal
to be, no matter what,

226
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:15,160
maybe identity as philosophers like to
put it. Maybe identity is contingent.

227
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,260
Maybe

228
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,520
a could be the same thing as B
in this logically possible world,

229
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,900
but we could imagine a
completely different logically
coherent world in which a

230
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:30,640
was not the same thing as B.

231
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,410
Okay.

232
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:37,400
If that's right, then maybe the
conclusion should be, well, you know,

233
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,920
uh, yeah. The,

234
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,360
the Cartesian thought experiment shows
that there could be a world in which

235
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,000
there are mines that are not identical,
the bodies,

236
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,230
but that doesn't mean that in this
world the mind is not identical to it.

237
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,640
To my body. Maybe in this world,
minds and bodies are identical.

238
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,380
Even though in other logically possible
worlds, the identity comes apart.

239
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:05,830
Identity is not necessary but
contingent as the philosophers put it.

240
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,790
It's not clear that that's right either.

241
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,490
The notion of contingent
identities very puzzling after all,

242
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:18,250
if if a really is B, how could they come
apart? There's only one thing there.

243
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:22,210
There's nothing to come apart. There's
just a equals B, that single thing.

244
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:24,490
What's to come apart,
so,

245
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:28,150
so where exactly does
the argument breakdown?

246
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,780
Is it that I'm not really imagining,
I'm just thinking, I'm imagining,

247
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,960
is it that imagination is not
really a good guide to possibility?

248
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:39,250
I just often it is, but not always
is it that identity is contingent.

249
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The interesting thing about Descartes'
argument is that it's easy to see

250
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,440
something God has gone wrong in the
case of the morning star in the evening

251
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:53,644
star,

252
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,390
but it's difficult to pin
down what exactly went wrong.

253
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,650
Different philosophers agree that
something's gone wrong in the Morningstar

254
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,770
Morningstar in the evenings,
dark case,

255
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:10,050
but disagree about the best diagnosis
of where the mistake went in.

256
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,240
Okay.

257
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,570
Armed with your pet diagnosis of
where the argument goes wrong there,

258
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,010
you got to ask, does it also go
wrong in the mind and body case?

259
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,560
Yeah,

260
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,530
well, we could spend more
time, but I'm not going to.

261
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,520
I think Descartes' argument fails.

262
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:34,030
I think the Morningstar evening star
case shows us that arguments like this at

263
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:37,424
the very least,

264
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,460
can't be taken at face value just because
it looks as though we can imagine it

265
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,980
and just because it's seems as often
the fact that we can imagine one without

266
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:46,490
the other.

267
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,430
It just won't necessarily fall that
we really do have two things that are

268
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:54,150
separate and not identical
in the real world.

269
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:56,920
Okay.

270
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,610
I'd be happy to discuss with you, you
know, outside class at greater length.

271
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:05,290
My favorite theories as
to where the argument goes
wrong and why I think it goes

272
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,560
wrong and Descartes' case as well.
But I,

273
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,940
but I suggest that the argument
goes wrong. It's not, it's not.

274
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,870
It's not right.

275
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:19,470
And so Descartes' attempt to establish
the distinctness of the mind,

276
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:24,280
the than the immateriality of the mind
on the basis of this Cartesian thought

277
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:29,050
experiment. I think that's unsuccessful.
Well, we've spent, let's, let's,

278
00:18:29,051 --> 00:18:30,310
let's step back and think
of where we've been.

279
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:33,160
We spent the last week and a half or so,
maybe a bit more,

280
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,840
two weeks talking about arguments
for the existence of the soul.

281
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,570
And unsurprisingly,

282
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:45,310
since I announced this was going to be
the result before the class had barely

283
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:49,750
gotten started,
I don't think any of these arguments work.

284
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:55,470
I believe the attempts to establish
the existence of a soul and in material

285
00:18:56,771 --> 00:19:00,220
object, that house of consciousness
separate and distinct from the body.

286
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,950
I think those arguments fail.

287
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:09,150
But I recognize that this is something
that reasonable people can disagree

288
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,203
about.

289
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,480
And so this is as well be many times the
case over the course of the semester.

290
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,860
Something that I invite you to
continue to reflect on for yourself.

291
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,430
If you believe in a soul,
what's the argument for it?

292
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,280
Well,

293
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,280
what we're about to turn two is Plato's
discussion of these issues in the

294
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:36,550
dialogue. The Thedo, which
as I told you last week,

295
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,970
purports to lay out the final
days discussion with soccer.

296
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:47,211
Socrates before he is killed by
bee kills himself by drinking,

297
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,900
uh, the hemlock in
accordance with the, uh,

298
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:55,330
the punishment that's been given to him.

299
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,080
Okay?

300
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,360
Now in the course of this discussion,

301
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Socrates and his disciples argue about
not so much the existence of the soul,

302
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:12,470
but the question really is the
immortality of the soul after all,

303
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,820
even if you believe in a soul,
as I remarked previously,

304
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
that doesn't give us yet any reason to
believe the soul continues to exist after

305
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:23,990
the death of your body.

306
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,860
The kind of dualist position that we are

307
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:34,530
considering in this class is an
interaction just position where the sole

308
00:20:35,171 --> 00:20:38,920
commands the body. That's what
makes my fingers move right now.

309
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,850
And the body can affect the soul.

310
00:20:42,851 --> 00:20:46,840
If I poke my body,
I feel it in my mind.

311
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,660
So the mind,

312
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,310
the soul and the body are obviously very
tightly connected and so it could be

313
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,810
even if the soul is something separate
from the body, then when the body dies,

314
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,000
the soul dies as well.

315
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,360
That's the question that's driving
the discussion in the Fito.

316
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:13,070
Do we have any good reason to believe
the soul survives the death of the body

317
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,920
and more particularly still do we have
good reason to believe it's immortal?

318
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:21,260
Okay.

319
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,800
Soccer. Socrates believes in
the immortality of the soul,

320
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,040
and so he tends to defend this position
justify to his disciples who are worried

321
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:35,040
that it may not be true. It's
important too, to realize as you,

322
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,090
as you read the dialogue,

323
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:41,070
it becomes fairly apparent that there
isn't so much any defense of the belief in

324
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:45,480
the soul. There's some of it, but it's
not the primary goal. For the most part,

325
00:21:45,481 --> 00:21:50,481
the existence of the soul is just
taken for granted in the dialogue.

326
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,980
Plato's a dualist portray
Socrates as being a dualist,

327
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,740
and that's just taken for granted.

328
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,170
The question that the
philosophical discussion turns
on is not is there a soul,

329
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,590
but rather does it survive
the death of the body?

330
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,180
Is it immortal? Now, as I said,

331
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,450
this is Socrates,
his last day on earth,

332
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,310
and you'd expect him to be pretty bummed.

333
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,160
You'd expect him to be sad,

334
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,400
and one of the striking things is that
Socrates is in a very happy indeed,

335
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,520
jovial mood, joking with his, his friends.

336
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,150
Why is that? Well, of course
it's because he thinks,

337
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:41,360
first of all there's a soul and
it will survive and it's a mortal,

338
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,500
but more importantly still. Oh
really? Yeah, those are all crucial,

339
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:47,000
but there's an extra ingredient as well.

340
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,410
He thinks he's got good reason
to believe when he dies,

341
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,230
he's going to go basically
what we call heaven.

342
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,580
He thinks there's a realm you're
populated by sort of good,

343
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:03,050
God's and maybe other philosophical
kindred souls and, and if sort of you,

344
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,050
if you got your stuff
together here on life,

345
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,410
you'll get to go to that when you die.

346
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,720
And so he's excited,
he's pleased.

347
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:22,110
Why does he think he's going to go?
Well,

348
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,270
in thinking about Socrates is
belief in the existence of a soul.

349
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,360
It's important to understand is important
to notice that his take on which stuff

350
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:33,960
gets assigned to the body.

351
00:23:33,961 --> 00:23:38,160
You know what have a bodily things
versus what are the sole like things is

352
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:41,490
rather different from the way I think
most of us nowadays would draw the line.

353
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,130
When I talked about
arguments for the existence

354
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,420
of a soul, I said, look, here's one
possible argument. I see colors.

355
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,920
No physical object could, no purely
physical Africans could see colors.

356
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,150
I can taste tastes and have this and
the smell of coffee and so forth,

357
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,500
but Socrates thinks all
those bodily sensations,

358
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,500
that's all stuff that
the body takes care of.

359
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:12,340
So unlike those modern dualist who
think we need to appeal to something

360
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:17,090
immaterial in order to explain bodily
sensations, Socrates thinks, no, no.

361
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,990
The body takes care of
all the bodily sensations,

362
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,400
all the desires and the wanting things
and the emotions and the feelings and the

363
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:30,050
cravings. That's all.
That's all bodies stuff.

364
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,450
What the soul does.

365
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,440
Socrates thinks there's soul thinks.

366
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,760
This soul in its essence is rational.

367
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,340
It takes care of the
thinking side of things.

368
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,990
What does the soul think about?
Well,

369
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,520
it's all things about all sorts
of things. Doubtless, you know,

370
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:01,490
but one of the things that it can do,

371
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,840
one of the things that sort of provides
the underpinnings as we'll see for

372
00:25:05,841 --> 00:25:08,840
Plato's arguments for the
immortality of the soul,

373
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,070
it's the soul can think about,
well,

374
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:15,980
here I have to introduce a
word of philosophical jargon.

375
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,540
Sometimes the idea that sometimes
the term is called ideas.

376
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,380
Sometimes the term is called forms,

377
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:30,010
but the thought is that the soul can
think about certain pure concepts or ideas

378
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,520
like justice itself or beauty itself
or goodness itself or hell itself.

379
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,040
So to explain all this we need now,

380
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,360
I'll sort of crash course
in Plato's metaphysics.

381
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,310
Okay.

382
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,470
Obviously this will be rather superficial.

383
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:59,960
Those of you who would
like to know more about it,

384
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:03,770
I recommend reading more platonic
dialogues or taking a class in ancient

385
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,230
philosophy.
But here's the basic idea.

386
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,080
There's all sorts of beautiful
objects in the world.

387
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:17,120
Objects can vary in terms
of how beautiful they are.

388
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,660
The Plato's got the idea that there is
nothing in this world that perfectly

389
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,240
beautiful and yet for all that
we can think about beauty itself.

390
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,970
Well,
we might put it this way.

391
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:36,971
You might say ordinary humdrum everyday
physical objects are somewhat beautiful.

392
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,730
They're partially beautiful as
sometimes Platonists put it,

393
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,120
they participate in beauty,

394
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,050
they partake of beauty to varying degrees,

395
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:57,650
but none of them should be confused
with beauty itself or take justice.

396
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,160
There are various arrangements,

397
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:06,910
social arrangements that can be
just or unjust to varying degrees,

398
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,440
but we don't think anywhere in the world
there any society that's perfectly just

399
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,280
yet for all that the mind can think about.

400
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:20,340
Perfect justice and and
notice how ordinary empirical
social arrangements fall

401
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:26,080
short of perfect justice.
So whatever perfect justice is,

402
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:30,610
it's not one more thing
in the empirical world.

403
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,800
It's something we can think about.

404
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,620
It's something that things
in the empirical world can
participate in or partake

405
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:39,400
of to varying degrees,

406
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,670
but we shouldn't confuse
the physical things,

407
00:27:42,671 --> 00:27:47,671
which can be just the people who can be
virtuous to one degree or another with

408
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,100
perfect virtue or perfect justice.

409
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,060
That's something that only the mind can
think about that we don't actually have

410
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,210
in the world.
The empirical world itself

411
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:04,710
or take being round the mind can
think about perfect circularity.

412
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,700
No physical object is perfectly circular.

413
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,750
They're only thing that are circular
to a greater or lesser degree.

414
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,550
So by thinking about it,
by thinking about these kinds of issues,

415
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:26,551
we can see that the mind has
some kind of handle on these.

416
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,540
Perfect. Well, we need
a word, and as they say,

417
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,340
Plato gives us the word ideas. Sometimes
it's translated as ideas or forms.

418
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,620
These things that we can think about
that are the sort of the template or at

419
00:28:42,911 --> 00:28:45,430
least the standard or or,
or maybe at the very least,

420
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,230
it's that which the ordinary humdrum
things can participate in to varying

421
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:54,490
degrees. Perfect justice,
justice itself, beauty itself,

422
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,720
goodness itself, circularity
itself, health itself.

423
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:03,130
All of these things are well
as as plus goes nowadays,

424
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:05,950
call them platonic forms.

425
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:07,550
Oh,

426
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:12,550
ordinary material objects of this world
can partake of the various platonic

427
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:19,160
forms, but they should not be
confused with the platonic forms.

428
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,511
But we still,

429
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:25,250
even though we don't bump into
the platonic forms in this world,

430
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,200
we can think about them.

431
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,180
Our mind has a kind of grasp of them.
Of course.

432
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,980
The problem is we're,

433
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,210
we're distracted by
the comings and goings,

434
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:43,210
the hurly burly of the,
of the ordinary everyday world.

435
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,780
And so we don't have a very good grasp
of the platonic forms were able to think

436
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:54,010
about them,
but we're distracted.

437
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,580
What the philosopher tries to do,

438
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:02,320
this is Socrates is thought or Plato's
thought that he puts in Socrates.

439
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:07,321
His mouth with the philosophy tries to
do is free himself from the distractions

440
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:14,570
that the body poses,
the desire for food,

441
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:18,050
the craving for sex,
being concerned about pain.

442
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,400
All this stuff get, you know,
dry Hungary and after pleasure,

443
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,520
all this stuff gets in the way of
thinking about the platonic forms.

444
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:35,020
What the philosopher tries to do then
so as to better focus on these ideal

445
00:30:36,021 --> 00:30:40,880
things is to sort of disregard the body,

446
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,170
put it aside,

447
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:47,210
separate his mind as
much as possible from it.

448
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,490
That's what Socrates says
he's been trying to do.

449
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,010
And so because of that,

450
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,210
he's got a better handle
on these ideal forms.

451
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,980
And then he believes when death comes in,

452
00:31:03,981 --> 00:31:08,981
the final separation occurs
of the mind and the body.

453
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,730
His mind gets to go up.

454
00:31:10,731 --> 00:31:14,390
His soul gets to go up to
this sort of heavenly realm.

455
00:31:14,391 --> 00:31:16,310
Philosophers nowadays
called Plato's heaven.

456
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:22,300
Let's go to Plato's heaven where he can
sort of have more direct contact with

457
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,440
these things with the forms.

458
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,553
Now

459
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,160
I don't have the time here to say
enough to try and make it clear why this

460
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:42,330
platonic metaphysical view is a view
that not only is worth taking seriously,

461
00:31:43,211 --> 00:31:45,760
but you know to this day,
many,

462
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:49,900
many philosophers think that at least
in its basic strokes, must be right,

463
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,060
but let me at least give you one
example that may give you a feel for it.

464
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,690
Think of math,

465
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:04,030
I think of some simple mathematical
claim like two plus two equals four.

466
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:09,250
When we say that two plus two equals four
or are we a two plus three equals five

467
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:14,050
we're saying something about numbers
that our mind is able to grasp,

468
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:18,820
but what are numbers anyway?

469
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,450
They're certainly not physical objects.

470
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,380
It's not as though some day you're
going to open up an issue of national

471
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:31,000
geographic and where the cover story is
going to be at long last explorers have

472
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:33,190
discovered the number two,
right?

473
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,880
It's not as though the number two is
something that you see or hear or taste or

474
00:32:41,121 --> 00:32:45,590
could bump into whatever
the number two is.

475
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,220
It's something that our mind can grasp
but isn't actually in the physical world.

476
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,170
Okay.

477
00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:00,820
That is the platonic take on mathematics.

478
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:04,090
There are numbers.
The mind can think about them.

479
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,050
Things can sort of partake of them.

480
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:10,900
If I were to hold up two pieces of paper,

481
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,580
there's a sense in which they
are participating in two hood,

482
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,490
but of course this is
not the number two here.

483
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,400
If I were to rip these pieces of paper,
I wouldn't be destroying the number two.

484
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:29,110
So the number two, the number was three,
whatever it is, whatever they are,

485
00:33:29,111 --> 00:33:34,111
are these platonic abstract entities that
don't exist in space and time yet for

486
00:33:36,251 --> 00:33:38,590
all that the mind can think about them.

487
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,930
That's the idea and it's not a
silly idea. I mean it's, it's,

488
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:48,990
it seems like a very compelling account
of what's going on in mathematics.

489
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:55,590
What mathematicians are doing is using
their mind to think about these platonic

490
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:02,400
ideas of mathematics to Plato's
thought was everything is like that.

491
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,630
It's not just math,
but justice itself is like that.

492
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:11,650
There are Josta unjust things in the
world. The mind can think about them,

493
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,330
but justice itself,

494
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,470
this sort of perfect I this
idea of being perfectly just,

495
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,310
that's something the mind can think about,
but it's not here in the world.

496
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:24,460
It's another abstract platonic form.

497
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:30,990
So that's the picture.
Plato's idea is that

498
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,410
if we start doing enough metaphysics,

499
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:39,411
we can see there must be
this realm of platonic ideas,

500
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,910
platonic forms,

501
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,960
and we can see that we are able
to grasp them through the mind.

502
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,690
This can't be a job the body does
because the body's only got it's bodily

503
00:34:54,691 --> 00:34:57,960
capacities, right? It's able
to do the five senses thing.

504
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,950
It's the soul that thinks
about the platonic forms.

505
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:03,870
Okay.

506
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,870
And as Plato's than glad
to go on to try to argue,

507
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,850
given this picture of
what the mind can do,

508
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,360
he thinks he can persuade
us that the mind,

509
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:20,250
the soul not only survives
the death of your body,

510
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:25,350
but will last forever.
It's, it's, it's perfect.

511
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,820
It's immaterial, and, and,
and, and can't be destroyed.

512
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,780
It's a mortal.

513
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,700
So he offers a series of
arguments for that conclusion, uh,

514
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:38,070
for that position. And
starting next time, you know,

515
00:35:38,071 --> 00:35:40,170
we'll work our way
through those arguments.
