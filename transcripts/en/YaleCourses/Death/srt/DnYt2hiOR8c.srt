1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,720
Last time we ended with the following,

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,120
a puzzle or a question.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,830
If we say that to be a person
is to be a p functioning body,

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,070
it seems as though we have to conclude
that when you're not p functioning,

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,250
you're dead. Uh, and that is your dead.

6
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:23,660
As a person who previously
we distinguished between
the death of my body and my,

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,850
my death as a person.
Let's focus on my death as a person.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,930
If I'm not a peak function,
if I'm not paying functioning,

9
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,700
do we have to then say I'm dead?
Well,

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,610
that may seem to be the most
natural way to define death,

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,500
but it's not an acceptable approach
because it would follow them that when I'm

12
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:44,580
asleep, I'm dead. Well,
not during those times.

13
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:48,630
Perhaps when I'm,
when I'm dreaming while I'm asleep.

14
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,430
But think of the various periods during
the night in which you are in a deep,

15
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:57,330
deep dreamless sleep. You're not
thinking, you're not planning,

16
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:58,620
you're not communicating.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Let's just suppose as seems likely that
none of the p functioning is occurring

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,530
at some point during sleep.
Should we say then that you're dead?

19
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,530
Well,
that's clearly not the right thing to say.

20
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,580
So we need to revise our account of what
it is on the physicalist picture to say

21
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:22,740
that you're dead.
What is it to be dead?

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,250
It can't just be a matter
of not functioning well.

23
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,770
One possibility would be to say the
question is not whether you are p

24
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,350
functioning.

25
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,350
It's okay if you're not be functioning
as long as your not be functioning as

26
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:42,600
temporary, if you will,
pee function again.

27
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,630
If you have been p functioning in the
past and you will be p functioning again

28
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,880
in the future p functioning
for person functioning,

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,440
you will be p functioning again in
the future, then you're not dead.

30
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,280
Well that's a at least an improvement
because then we can say look while you're

31
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:01,620
asleep, even though there's
no p functioning going on,

32
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,150
the lack of p functioning is temporary,
so you're still alive.

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,660
But I think that won't quite do either.

34
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,600
Let's suppose that come Judgment Day,

35
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,450
God will resurrect the dead.

36
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,090
And let's just suppose that the correct
theory of personal identity is such as

37
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:28,560
to put aside any worries we might have
along with Vaughn in wagon that we

38
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:31,980
discussed previously. So whether or not
on resurrection day that would really be,

39
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:36,570
you are not, suppose it would be
you. So God will resurrect the day.

40
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,270
The dead Judgment Day comes,

41
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,190
the dead are resurrected
well and other p functioning.

42
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,930
So it turns out that during that
period in which uh, they were dead,

43
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:51,900
they were only temporarily
not be functioning.

44
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:57,470
But if death means permanent
cessation of p functioning,

45
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,290
then it turns out the dead
weren't really dead after all.

46
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,890
They were only temporarily
not p functioning,

47
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:10,390
just like we are temporarily not
p functioning when we're asleep.

48
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,310
Well that doesn't seem right
either on Judgment Day,

49
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,830
God resurrects the dead.

50
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,760
It's not that he simply wakes
up those in a deep, deep sleep.

51
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,020
So the proposal that death is a matter
of permanent cessation of p functioning

52
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:33,310
versus temporary. That doesn't seem
like it's going to do the trick.

53
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,130
But what else do we have up our sleeves?

54
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,510
Here's a different proposal that I
think is probably closer to the right

55
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,790
account. We might say,
look, while you're asleep,

56
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,330
it's true that you're not p functioning.
For example,

57
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,940
you're not doing your
multiplication tables,

58
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,320
but although you are not
engaged in p functioning,

59
00:03:56,321 --> 00:04:01,321
and it does seem true to say
that you still can pee function,

60
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,490
you still couldn't do your
multiplication tables.

61
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,090
Although it's not true that
you are speaking French.

62
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,770
Let's suppose that you
know how to speak French.

63
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,920
It's still true of you while you're
asleep that you can or could speak French.

64
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,030
How do we know this? Well, all we have
to do is just, you know, wake you up.

65
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,710
We wake you up and we say, Hey
John, what's three times three?

66
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,950
And after you stop
swearing us, you say, well,

67
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:33,670
it's nine or we say Linda, hey, you know,

68
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,540
conjugate touching such a verb and French,
you can conjugate it.

69
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,870
Even though you were not engaged in
p functioning while you were asleep.

70
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,650
It's still true that
while you were asleep,

71
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,800
you had the ability to
engage in p functioning

72
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,120
abilities aren't always actualized.

73
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,360
European functioning is actualized
now because you're engaged in thought,

74
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:09,390
but you don't lose the ability to think
during those moments when you're not

75
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:10,264
thinking.

76
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,430
Suppose we say then that to be alive as
a person is to be able to engage in p

77
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:19,744
functioning

78
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,580
and to be dead then is to be
unable to engage in p functioning.

79
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,110
Why are you unable?
Well,

80
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,130
presumably because whatever cognitive
structures it takes in your brain to

81
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,930
underwrite the ability to pee function,

82
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,200
those cognitive structures have
been broken so they no longer work.

83
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,600
It's when you're, when you're
dead, you're brain is broken.

84
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,200
It's not just that you're
not engaged in p functioning.

85
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,170
You're no longer able to
engage in p functioning.

86
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,790
That at least seems to handle
the case of sleep properly.

87
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,020
Although you're not engaged in
PE functioning, you're able to,

88
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,690
so you're still alive.
Take the dead.

89
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:14,210
He'll be resurrected on judgment day.

90
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,980
Although they will be engaged
in pay functioning later on.

91
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,080
It's not true right now that
they can engage in p functioning.

92
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,470
Their bodies and brains are broken
until God fixes them so they're dead.

93
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,360
All right. That seems to give
the right answer and in fact,

94
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,990
it gives us some guidance how to
think about some other puzzling cases.

95
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,100
Take somebody who is in a coma,

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,020
not engaged in p functioning.
Their body, let's stipulate,

97
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:51,500
is still alive. The their,
their heart's still beating.

98
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:54,410
The lungs are still breathing
and so forth, but we wonder,

99
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,120
is the person still alive?
Does the person still exist?

100
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,973
Well,

101
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,100
they're not engaged in p functioning.
That's pretty clear. We want to know,

102
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,100
can they engage in p functioning?

103
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,590
Now at this point,

104
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:20,510
we'd want to know more about the
underlying mechanics about what's gone on.

105
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:21,980
In the case of the coma,

106
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,580
if the following is the right description,
then we perhaps it should say,

107
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:32,540
that's still alive.
Look when somebody's asleep,

108
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,130
we need to do something to in effect,
wake them up.

109
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,930
Something to turn the functioning back on.
The,

110
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,260
the cognitive structures are still there,

111
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,340
but the on off switch is switched to off.

112
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,540
Perhaps that's what it's like when
somebody's in a coma or perhaps at least

113
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,100
certain types of comas.

114
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,790
Of course to turn the on off switch on.

115
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:03,340
It's harder when somebody's
in a coma. It's, it's, it's,

116
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:07,550
it's a bit more as though to continue
with the metaphor of the on off switch as

117
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:11,240
though not only is the switch
turned to off, there's a,

118
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:16,241
there's a lock on the switch and so we
can't turn the switch on in the normal

119
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:20,630
way. You know, pushing the person
in Tacoma and saying, wake up,

120
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,430
Jimmy doesn't do the trick,
but for all of that,

121
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,400
although the on off switch
may be stuck in off,

122
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,320
if the underlying cognitive structures
of the brain are such as to still make a

123
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:42,041
chew that flipped the on switch back to
on and the person can still engage in

124
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:47,150
cognitive p functioning. Maybe the right
thing to say is the person's still alive

125
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,540
coma case too. I'm not sure whether this
really shouldn't be called the calm,

126
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,860
I don't know the
biological medical details,

127
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,020
but imagine that what's gone on is there
has been decay of the brain structures

128
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,210
that underwrite the cognitive functioning.

129
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,610
So now it's not just at the
on off switch is stuck in off.

130
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:14,150
The brain's no longer capable of engaged
in these higher order p functions.

131
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,440
This might be a persistent vegetative
state with no possibility of turning it

132
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:26,490
on.
Even in principle of such a person,

133
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:31,491
we might say there are no longer capable
of p functioning and that perhaps the

134
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:35,160
right thing to say is the
person no longer exists,

135
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:37,410
so they no longer exist as a person,

136
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,880
even if the body's still alive today.
So far so good.

137
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,180
Here's a harder case to think about.

138
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,260
Suppose we put somebody in a
state of suspended animation,

139
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,760
cool their body down so that the various
metabolic processes come to an end.

140
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,020
They stop now as, as I'm sure you know,

141
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,760
we're able with various lower organisms
to put them in a state of suspended

142
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:16,710
animation. And then the amazing thing is
if you heat them back up again properly,

143
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,250
they sort of start functioning again.

144
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,080
Now we can't do that yet with humans,

145
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,110
but it doesn't jump out at us,

146
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:30,660
at least at that should
be an impossibility.

147
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,800
So suppose we eventually learn
how to do this with humans.

148
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,010
And now suppose we take Larry and put
him in a state of suspended animation.

149
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,280
Is he dead?
Well,

150
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,500
most of us don't feel comfortable
saying that he's dead.

151
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,870
Just like we don't feel
comfortable saying that the,

152
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,210
let's suppose we could do this with,
with a fruit fly.

153
00:10:57,211 --> 00:10:58,330
I don't know whether we can or can't.

154
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:01,020
Suppose we can because we
do it with a fruit fly.

155
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,390
Don't feel comfortable
saying the fruit flies dead.

156
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:06,750
Rather it's in a state of
suspended animation. Well,

157
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:10,950
similarly then perhaps we wouldn't
want to say that Larry is dead and, uh,

158
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,130
the broken [inaudible] account
of death allows us to say,

159
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,880
Larry's not dead.
The structures in the brain,

160
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:26,030
which would underwrite the ability
to engage in p functioning,

161
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,760
they're not destroyed
by suspended animation.

162
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,280
So perhaps in the relevant sense,

163
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,370
the person can still engage
in p functioning so they're
not dead good enough.

164
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,770
And the other hand,
it doesn't seem so plausible.

165
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,280
Doesn't seem intuitively right
to say that they're alive,

166
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:53,070
you know? Is is Larry Alive when he's
in a state of suspended animation? No.

167
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,660
That seems like he's not alive either.
Oh, that's a bit puzzling, right? It's,

168
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,340
it's as though we need.
Normally we think that, well,

169
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,290
either you're alive or you're dead.

170
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,890
The two possibilities
exhaust the possibilities.

171
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,420
But thinking about suspended animation
suggests that we may actually need a

172
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:13,540
third category suspended,

173
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,510
neither alive nor dead. Well, all right.

174
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,460
If, if we do introduce a
third possibility, I'm not
sure this is the right thing.

175
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:25,090
It's, it's, it's,

176
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,540
it's not clear what's the right or best
thing to say about suspended animation,

177
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,660
but at least that doesn't seem
like an unattractive possibility.

178
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,780
If there are three possibilities,
dead,

179
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,770
alive or suspended to be dead,

180
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,830
we can still say,
you gotta be broken,

181
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,290
incapable of functioning.

182
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,610
Suspended isn't broken,
it's just suspended.

183
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,850
But then what do you need to be alive
in addition to not being broken?

184
00:12:57,851 --> 00:12:59,320
What do you need to be alive?

185
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,430
While the initially tempting thing to
say is not only are it broken but you're

186
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:07,900
actually engaged in p functioning,
but if we say that,

187
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:11,110
then we're back to saying that somebody
who's asleep isn't really alive.

188
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,210
That doesn't seem right either.

189
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,480
So we need some account to distinguish
between suspended animation and out and

190
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:25,570
out being alive and I'm not
quite sure how to draw that line,

191
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:30,640
so I'll leave that to you as a
puzzle to work on, on your own.

192
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,120
That puzzle aside,

193
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,080
it seems to me that once
we become physical lists,

194
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,850
there's nothing especially
deep or mysterious about death.

195
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:49,380
The body is able to function
in a variety of ways.

196
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,450
When some of those lower biological
functions are occurring, the body's alive.

197
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,950
When all goes well,

198
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,910
the body is also capable of
engaging in higher order,

199
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,050
higher order,
personal p functioning,

200
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,120
and then you've got a person,

201
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,570
the body begins to break.

202
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,580
You get the loss of pay functioning and
at that point you no longer exist as a

203
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:19,260
person.
When the body breaks some whore,

204
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,350
you get the loss of
biological or be functioning.

205
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,890
And then the body dies.

206
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,960
There's nothing especially
mysterious about death,

207
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,410
although there may be a
lot of details to work out.

208
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:37,240
From a scientific point of view,

209
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,280
what are the particular processes that
underwrite biological functioning?

210
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,490
What are the particular processes
that underwrite personality or person

211
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:51,220
functioning?
Still?

212
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:59,490
There are a couple of claims about death
that get made frequently enough about

213
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:05,641
death being mysterious and one way or
another that I want or special or unique

214
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:11,170
that I want to focus on in effect
from the physical point of view,

215
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:16,171
although death is unique because it sort
of comes at the end of this lifetime of

216
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,420
various sorts of functions,
there's nothing especially

217
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,490
puzzling.
Nothing especially mysterious,

218
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,630
nothing especially unusual
or hard to grasp about it,

219
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,890
but there are a handful of claims that
people make about death suggesting that

220
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,320
they think and they think we all think
that death is mysterious or unique or

221
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:47,280
hard to comprehend and want
to examine a couple of these.

222
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,450
One of them I'll get to later, not
later today. Then the next lecture.

223
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,660
Sometimes people say that we die
alone or everybody dies alone,

224
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,030
and this is something this is supposed
to express some deep insight into the

225
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:05,190
nature and uniqueness of death.

226
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,940
So although we're able
to eat meals together,

227
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,120
we're able to go on vacations
together and take classes together.

228
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,840
Death is something we all
have to do by ourself.

229
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,900
That's the claim. We all die alone.
That's a claim. I'll come back to you.

230
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,940
Why do I want to look to look at first
is the suggestion that somehow and some

231
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:30,714
level,

232
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,900
nobody really believes
they're going to die at all.

233
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,053
Now,

234
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,650
having distinguished between what we've
called the death of the body and the

235
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:51,690
death of the person, the question
whether or not you're going to die,

236
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,130
it needs to be distinguished.

237
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,950
The question whether or not you
believe you're going to die,

238
00:16:55,951 --> 00:16:58,500
it needs to be distinguished,
distinguished. If somebody says, you know,

239
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,890
nobody really believes they're going to
die, they could mean one of two things.

240
00:17:01,891 --> 00:17:06,891
They could mean nobody really believes
they're going to cease to exist as a

241
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:12,660
person. First possibility,
second possible claim.

242
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:17,790
Nobody really believes
they're the underground.

243
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,190
They're going to undergo
the death of their bodies.

244
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,100
Let's take these in turn.

245
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:30,460
Is there any good reason to believe that
we don't believe that we're going to

246
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:34,910
cease to exist as a person?

247
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,560
Wow.
Well,

248
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,560
the most common argument for this
claim I think takes the following form.

249
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,100
People sometimes say,

250
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,080
since it's impossible
to picture being dead,

251
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,160
it's impossible to picture being dead,

252
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,970
but as to say it's impossible to
picture your own being dead. You know,

253
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:05,550
each one of us has to think about this
when the first person perspective or

254
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:09,300
something like that. Think about
your dying. You're being dead.

255
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,170
Since that's impossible to picture.
That is impossible to imagine.

256
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:18,830
Nobody believes in the possibility
that they're going to die,

257
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,140
but the grinders cease to exist.

258
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,520
The idea seems to be that you can't
believe in possibilities that you can't

259
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,210
picture or imagine

260
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,070
now that that hypothesis,
that that thesis,

261
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:42,010
that assumption could be challenged.

262
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,580
I think probably we shouldn't believe
the theory of belief which says that in

263
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:51,880
order to believe in something,

264
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,870
you got to be able to
picture it or believe it.

265
00:18:59,480 --> 00:18:59,690
Okay.

266
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,620
But let's grit that assumption
for the sake of argument.

267
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,690
Let's suppose there,
in order to believe in something,

268
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:08,390
you've got to be able to picture it.
What then?

269
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,550
How do we get from there to the conclusion
that I can't believe that I'm going

270
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:18,170
to die. I'm going to cease
to exist as a person. Well,

271
00:19:18,171 --> 00:19:23,171
the thought of course is I can't
picture or imagine my death.

272
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,320
I can't picture imagine my being dead.

273
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:32,030
It's important here to draw
some distinctions. I can
certainly picture being ill,

274
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,220
you know, there I am on my
death bed, dying of cancer,

275
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:38,600
growing weaker and weaker.

276
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:43,640
I can perhaps even picture
the moment of my death.

277
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,240
I've said goodbye to
my family and friends.

278
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,380
I sort of the,
everything's growing grayer and dimmer.

279
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:55,460
It's growing harder and harder
to, uh, to concentrate. And then,

280
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,450
well, and then there is no
and more. The claim, however,

281
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:03,950
is not that I can't picture being
ill or die iin the claims got a B,

282
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,750
I can't picture being dead.

283
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,200
Well, try it. Try to picture being dead.

284
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,740
What's it like to be dead?

285
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,750
Sometimes people claim it's a mystery.

286
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:26,350
We don't know what it's like to be dead
because every time we try to imagine it,

287
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,800
we fail.
We don't do a very good job.

288
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,833
Okay.

289
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:38,020
I'm inclined to think that that way of
thinking about the question is really

290
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,820
confused. I mean, you know,

291
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,880
you set yourself the goal of trying
to put yourself in this situation

292
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,610
imaginatively of what it's
like to be dead, you know?

293
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,700
So I start by trying to strip off the
parts of my conscious life that I know I

294
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:03,130
won't have when I'm dead. You
know, I won't hear anything.

295
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,300
I won't see anything.
I won't think anything.

296
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:12,301
And you try to imagine what it's like
to not think or feel or hear or see

297
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,150
and you don't do a very good job of it.
So you throw your hands up and you say,

298
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:26,410
Oh, I guess I don't know what it's
like. So it must be a mystery.

299
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,480
It's not a mystery at all.
Suppose I ask,

300
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,370
what's it like to be this cell phone?

301
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:42,040
The answer is it's not like anything.

302
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:48,160
Well, that doesn't mean there's something
that it's like to be a cell phone,

303
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,030
but different from being anything else.

304
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,070
So it's not like anything else.

305
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,850
It's a special way of
feeling or experiencing.

306
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:03,180
No cell phones don't have
any experience at all.

307
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,120
There is nothing that it's like
on the inside to be a cell phone.

308
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,400
Imagine that. I try to ask myself,
what's it like to be my ballpoint pen?

309
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:20,280
And I try to imagine, well first imagined
being really, really stiff cause you're,

310
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:23,820
you're not flexible. When you're a
ballpoint pen, you can't move and,

311
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,270
and imagine being really,

312
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:29,620
really bored because you don't have
any thoughts or interests or no,

313
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:34,650
that's completely the wrong way to go
about thinking what it's like to be a

314
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:37,660
ballpoint pen.

315
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:42,430
There's nothing that it's
like to be a ballpoint pen.

316
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:47,110
There is nothing to describe.
Nothing to imagine.

317
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:52,650
No mystery about what it's
like to be a ballpoint pen,

318
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,920
no mystery about what it's like to be a
cell phone will similarly then I put it

319
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:01,300
to you.

320
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:06,300
There is no mystery about
what it's like to be dead.

321
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:13,840
It isn't like anything where I don't mean,
oh,

322
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:16,630
it's like something but different
from everything else. I mean,

323
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,640
there is nothing there to
describe when you're dead.

324
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,820
There's nothing happening on
the inside to be imagined.

325
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:34,000
Well,
should we conclude therefore,

326
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,560
given that we've got the premise,

327
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:39,940
if you can't picture it or imagine it,

328
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,690
then you can't believe in it.
Since I've just said, look,

329
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,650
you can't imagine being dead,

330
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,100
but that's not due to any
failure of imagination.

331
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,600
I because there's nothing there to imagine
or picture still granted the premise.

332
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,990
If you can't picture it or imagine it,
you can't believe in it.

333
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:02,050
Shouldn't we conclude therefore that you
can't believe you're going to be dead?

334
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,350
No,
we shouldn't conclude that

335
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,890
after all.

336
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,980
Not only is it true that you can't picture
from the inside what it's like to be

337
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:15,974
dead.

338
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:21,130
You can't picture from the inside what
it's like to be in dreamless sleep.

339
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:28,370
There is nothing that it's
like Ted be in dreamless sleep.

340
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:33,020
When you're in dreamless sleep, you're
not imagining or experiencing anything.

341
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,753
Similarly,

342
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,820
it's not possible to picture or imagine
what it's like to have fainted and be

343
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:46,211
completely unconscious with
nothing happening cognitively

344
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,850
is nothing to picture or imagine.
Well, should we conclude therefore,

345
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,440
so nobody really believes that
they're ever in dreamless sleep?

346
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,100
Well, that would be silly. Of course,

347
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,830
you believe that at times
you're in dreamless sleep.

348
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,490
Should we say if somebody who's fainted
or knows that they're subject to

349
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:11,060
fainting spells, they never
actually believe that they pass out?

350
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,460
That would be silly. Of course,
they believe they pass out

351
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,320
from the mirror fat that they
can't picture it from the inside.

352
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,550
It doesn't follow that.

353
00:25:25,551 --> 00:25:29,690
Nobody believes they're ever in dreamless
sleep from the mere fact that they

354
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:34,490
can't picture from the inside what it's
like to have fainted and not yet woken

355
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,324
up.

356
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:40,130
It doesn't mean that nobody believes
that they ever faint from the mere fact

357
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:44,450
that you can't picture from the
inside what it's like to be dead.

358
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,800
It doesn't follow that.
Nobody believes they're going to die.

359
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,200
Yeah,

360
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,820
but didn't I start off by saying I was
going to grant the person who was making

361
00:25:56,821 --> 00:26:00,780
this argument that nor to
believe something you've
gotta be able to picture it

362
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,310
and having, I just said, look, you
can't picture being dead, John.

363
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,360
Did I taking it back since they say you
can believe you're going to die yet you

364
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,220
can't picture it from the inside.

365
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,640
Haven't I taken back the assumption
that in order to believe it,

366
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:16,740
you've got to be able to picture it.
Not Quite.

367
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,200
Although I am step to go about that claim,

368
00:26:19,201 --> 00:26:23,100
I am going to continue giving it to the
person who makes us argument because I'm

369
00:26:23,101 --> 00:26:27,210
not so prepared to admit that
you can't picture being dead.

370
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,940
You can picture being dead.
All right.

371
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:35,220
You just can't picture it from the n side.

372
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:39,270
You can picture it from the outside.

373
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,280
I can picture being in
dreamless sleep quite easily.

374
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,530
I'm doing it right now.

375
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,560
I've got a little mental image
of my body lying in bed asleep.

376
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,100
Dreamless Lee.

377
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,980
I can picture fainting or
having fainted quite easily.

378
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:03,630
It's a picture of my body lying
on the ground unconscious.

379
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:09,650
I can picture my been dead quite easily.

380
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,120
It's a little mental picture
of my body in a coffin,

381
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:20,070
no functioning occurring in my body.

382
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,890
So even if it were true,
that belief requires picturing.

383
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,480
And even if it were true that you can't
picture being dead from the inside,

384
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,200
it wouldn't follow that.
You can't believe you're going to die.

385
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,270
All you have to do is picture
it from the outside. We're done.

386
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,550
So I conclude,

387
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,820
of course you can and do
believe you're going to die.

388
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,950
But at this point,

389
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,780
the person making the argument has a
possible response and it's a quite common

390
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:59,550
response. He says, look, I
try to picture in the world,

391
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:00,780
admittedly from the outside,

392
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:05,340
I try to picture the world
in which I don't exist.

393
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,880
I'm no longer conscious.
I'm no longer a person,

394
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:13,200
no longer experiencing anything. I
try to picture that world. I picture,

395
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,840
for example,
see my funeral.

396
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,470
And yet when I try to do that,
I'm observing it.

397
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,890
I'm watching the funeral,

398
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,950
I'm seeing a funeral.
Consequently, I'm thinking,

399
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,460
so I haven't really imagined a
world in which I no longer exist.

400
00:28:40,691 --> 00:28:42,100
A world in which I'm dead,

401
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:46,210
a world in which I am incapable
of thought and observation.

402
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:51,810
I've smuggled myself back in
as the observer of the funeral.

403
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,540
Every time I try to
picture myself being dead,

404
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,200
I smuggle myself back in conscious,

405
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,960
hence existing as a person,

406
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:10,210
hence not dead as a person,
maybe my body,

407
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:15,070
I'm imagining my body dead,
but I'm not imagining myself,

408
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:20,080
the person dead
from which it follows.

409
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:25,380
The argument goes that I don't really
believe I'll ever be dead because when I

410
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:31,720
tried to imagine a world in which
I'm dead, I smuggle myself back in

411
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:37,990
this argument shows up in various places.
Let me mention,

412
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,510
let me quote one case of it.

413
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,500
Fried Fried says, this is,

414
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:50,180
I'm quoting from one of the
Walter Kauffman essays that
you'll be reading called

415
00:29:50,181 --> 00:29:50,630
death.

416
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:55,630
He quotes Fried Fried says after all
one's own death is beyond imagining and

417
00:29:57,831 --> 00:29:59,690
whenever we try to imagine it,

418
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,680
we can see that we really
survive as spectators.

419
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,200
Thus, the dictum could be dared in
the psychoanalytic school at bottom,

420
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:13,130
nobody believes in his own death or,

421
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,490
and this is the same in his unconscious.

422
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:20,960
Every one of us is convinced
of his immortality. Alright,

423
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,790
there's Freud basically just running the
argument. I've just sketched for you.

424
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,260
When you try to imagine you're being dead,

425
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,240
you smuggle yourself back in as a
spectator and so fried concludes at some

426
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:38,870
level. None of us really
believes we're going to die.

427
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,560
Want to say?

428
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:47,150
I think that argument's
a horrible argument.

429
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:54,450
How many of you believe that there are
meetings that take place without you?

430
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,320
Suppose you're a member of some club
and there's a meeting this afternoon and

431
00:31:02,021 --> 00:31:05,560
you won't be there because
you got to be someplace else.

432
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,840
So you ask yourself,

433
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:12,870
do I believe that meeting's going to
take place without me first glance looked

434
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:14,320
like you do.

435
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,320
But here's the the Freud in argument that
shows you don't really try to imagine

436
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:24,490
and try to picture that
meeting without you. Well,

437
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:28,010
when you do picture it,
you know there's that room in the Ma.

438
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,930
You in your mind's eye,

439
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:32,800
that little picture of people sitting
around the table perhaps discussing the

440
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:37,480
business of your club.
Oh, I smuggled myself in.

441
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:38,830
Okay.

442
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,620
As a spectator.
I've

443
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,280
if, if, if like you, you,

444
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,300
I think most of us sort of picture these
things sort of up from a perspective

445
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:53,800
sort of in a corner of the room up
on the wall, sort of looking down.

446
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:58,650
We're upset kind of a fly's
perspective. Um, alright.

447
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:03,520
I've smuggled myself in as a spectator.
I'm actually in the room after all,

448
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,120
so I haven't really pictured the
meeting taking place without me.

449
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:10,570
So I guess I don't really believe that
meeting's going to take place without me.

450
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,180
Yeah.

451
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,470
If Freud's argument for death,

452
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,440
that is to say none of us believe
we're going to die was any good.

453
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,700
The argument that none of us believe
meetings ever take place without us would

454
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:25,510
have to work as well.
But that's silly.

455
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:30,990
It's clear that we all do believe in
the possibility indeed more than mere

456
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:36,670
possibility. The actuality of
meetings that occur without us,

457
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,220
even though when I imagined meeting,

458
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:46,070
I'm in some sense smuggling
myself then as an observer

459
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:53,190
from which I think it follows that the
mere fact that I smuggled myself in as an

460
00:32:53,741 --> 00:32:55,750
observer doesn't need that.

461
00:32:55,751 --> 00:33:00,751
I don't really believe in the possibility
that I'm observing in my mind's eye.

462
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:08,310
I can believe in the existence
of a meeting that takes place.

463
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:13,110
Even though I smuggle myself in as an
observer, when I picture that meeting,

464
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,940
I can believe in the possibility
of a world without me.

465
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,180
Even though I smuggle
myself in as an observer.

466
00:33:21,181 --> 00:33:23,160
When I picture that world without me

467
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,860
Freud's mistaken, it's
although I'm picking on fried,
it's not only Freud that,

468
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,920
uh, uh, runs this sort of argument.

469
00:33:33,921 --> 00:33:37,460
One comes across it periodically
within the last year,

470
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,700
a member of our law school here put
forward this very argument and said he

471
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:46,820
thought it was a good one.
So people think the arguments are good.

472
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:50,780
One strikes me as it's gotta be a bad one.
The confusion,

473
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:54,920
the mistake I think people are
making when they make this argument,

474
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,770
the mistake I think
they're making is this.

475
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:03,950
It's one thing to ask yourself
what's the content of the picture?

476
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:10,020
It's another thing to ask when you
look at the picture, are you existing?

477
00:34:10,021 --> 00:34:13,050
Are you looking at the picture
from a certain point of view?

478
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,150
Suppose I hold up a photograph
of a beach with nobody on it.

479
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,780
All right? Am I in that beach
as pictured in that photograph?

480
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,800
Of course not.

481
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,173
But

482
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:31,340
as I look at it,
whether in reality or in my mind's eye,

483
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,400
I'm looking at it from our
perspective as I think about it,

484
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,933
I'm

485
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:44,410
viewing the beach from a point of view,

486
00:34:44,411 --> 00:34:49,060
which may well be on the beach if
somebody draws a painting of a beach.

487
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,280
But for all that, that doesn't mean
that within the picture of the beach,

488
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,620
I'm in the beach.

489
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:02,500
Looking at a picture doesn't
mean you're in the picture.

490
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,700
Viewing the meeting from a point of
view doesn't mean you're in the meeting.

491
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:16,770
Viewing the world without you from a
point of view doesn't mean you're in the

492
00:35:18,731 --> 00:35:22,390
world.
So although of course it's true.

493
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,380
When I imagine these various
possibilities without me,

494
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,240
I'm thinking about them.

495
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:33,660
I'm observing them and I'm observing
them from a particular perspective,

496
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,650
from a particular standpoint,

497
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:41,340
for all that I'm not in the
picture that I'm thinking about.

498
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:48,210
So I think the Freud he in
argument just fails. Now.

499
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,240
Maybe there's some other reason to believe
the claim that nobody believes they

500
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:58,680
will cease to exist,

501
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,240
but if there is another
argument for that claim,

502
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,640
I'm eager to hear it because this
argument at any rate seems to me to be

503
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,540
unsuccessful.

504
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:15,660
Now at the start I distinguished two
claims people might have in mind when they

505
00:36:15,661 --> 00:36:18,000
say nobody believes they're going to die.

506
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,920
First possibility was the claim was
nobody believes that they'll ever cease to

507
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:26,310
exist as a person and
I've just explained why,

508
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,460
at least the most familiar argument
for that claim I think doesn't work.

509
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,100
The second possible
interpretation was this.

510
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,020
Nobody believes their
body is going to die.

511
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:45,170
That is the more familiar humdrum
event of death where your body sees his

512
00:36:46,141 --> 00:36:49,830
functioning and you know you end up having
a corpus of gets buried and so forth.

513
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,940
Sometimes it's suggested that
nobody believes that either.

514
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,350
Of course, often I think people
run together. These two questions.

515
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,660
When they say you don't
believe you're going to die,

516
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:04,020
do you mean you don't believe your body's
gonna die or you don't believe you're

517
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:08,510
going to cease to exist as a person?
Maybe it when people make the claim,

518
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,070
it's not clear which of these
things they've got in mind,

519
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,960
but let's at least try to not focus on
the second question. Could it be true?

520
00:37:15,961 --> 00:37:20,961
Is there any good reason to believe it
is true that nobody believes they're

521
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:26,130
going to undergo bodily death?
Now,

522
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:30,210
you know after all, even
if you believe that, well,

523
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:34,560
you know your soul will go to heaven,
so you won't cease to exist as a person,

524
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,490
you might still believe
that your body will die.

525
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:41,100
Most of us presumably do
believe our bodies will die.

526
00:37:41,101 --> 00:37:43,320
At least that's how it seems to me.

527
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,800
So it's a bit odd to suggest as it
nonetheless does get suggested that no,

528
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:52,800
no. At some level, people don't really
believe they're going to die. Oh, wait,

529
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,920
point out just how odd the claim that
is because people do all sorts of

530
00:37:59,671 --> 00:38:04,650
behaviors which become very,
very hard to interpret.

531
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,600
If they don't really believe their
bodies are going to die. People,

532
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:10,710
for example,

533
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,720
take out life insurance so that,
well,

534
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,850
here's what seems to be the explanation.

535
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,360
They believe that there's a decent chance
that they will die within a certain

536
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:24,000
period of time.
And so if that happens,

537
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,940
they want their children and
family members to be cared for.

538
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:32,730
If you didn't really believe you are going
to die, that is undergo bodily death.

539
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:38,200
Why would you take out life insurance?
People write wills.

540
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,620
Here's what you should do
with my estate after I die.

541
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,760
If you didn't really believe
that your body was going to die,

542
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,340
why would you ever bother writing a will?

543
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:54,160
Since many people write wills,
many people take out life insurance.

544
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,630
It seems as though the natural
thing to suggest is that many,

545
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:03,040
or at least perhaps most, at least many
people believe they're going to die.

546
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:08,230
Why would we think otherwise?
Well,

547
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,000
the reason for thinking otherwise,

548
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:14,950
the reason for not being utterly
dismissive of this suggestion is that when

549
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:16,450
people get ill,

550
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,610
terminally ill and often seems
to take them by surprise.

551
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,690
So I've been having
you read total stories,

552
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,930
novella the death of Ivan Illich.

553
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:34,020
Ivan Illich falls. He
hurts himself. Uh, he, the,

554
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:38,470
the injury doesn't get better. He gets
worse and worse. Eventually it kills him.

555
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:43,890
The astonishing thing is that I,

556
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,900
even Ilitch is shocked to discover
that he's mortal and of course,

557
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:56,500
what,
what Tolstoy is trying to,

558
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:01,790
to convince us of what he's trying to
argue by illustrating the clean I take it

559
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:08,791
to toll stories making is that most of
us are actually in Ivan Ilitches boat.

560
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:17,950
We give lip service to the
claim that we're going to die,

561
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:22,960
but at some level we
don't really believe it.

562
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,200
And notice again, just to, you
know, to emphasize the point,

563
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:31,120
the relevant lack of belief here has
to do with the death of the body. It,

564
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:35,440
that's the thing that Ivan Illich just
skeptical about. Is his body going to die?

565
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,580
Is he moral in that sense?
This is what, uh, what,

566
00:40:40,581 --> 00:40:45,070
what, what takes him back to discover
that he's mortal for all we know,

567
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:46,960
Ivan Illich still believes in souls,

568
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:48,670
believes he's going to go
to heaven and so forth.

569
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:53,620
So it's not his death as a
person that he's puzzled by.

570
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:55,480
He made,
I think he's going to die as a person.

571
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,080
It's his bodily death that surprises him,

572
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,960
his bodily mortality that surprises him.

573
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:08,550
Tolstoy draws a highly realistic and
believable portrait of somebody who is

574
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:16,591
surprised to discover that
he's mortal as he puts it.

575
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,190
It was a famous syllogism that people
learn in their logic classes from,

576
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,370
you know, from Aristotle.
All men are mortal,

577
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,600
Socrates is a man.
So Socrates is mortal.

578
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,660
Ivan Illich says, yes, yes, I knew that,

579
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,790
but what did that have to do with me?

580
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,250
Well,

581
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:42,230
it may be a kind of irrationality
and maybe a kind of failure to,

582
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,360
to conduct the logic,

583
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:50,320
but we're not asking is it rational or
irrational to not believe that your body

584
00:41:50,531 --> 00:41:53,240
is going to die?
We're simply asking,

585
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,780
noting the fact that there do seem to
be cases where people are surprised to

586
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:05,060
discover that are mortal.
Now, for all that,

587
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:06,860
notice,

588
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,300
I presumed that Ivan Ilitch had a
will and for all I know Ivan Illich,

589
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:12,620
Chad life insurance.

590
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:17,330
So we're in the peculiar
situation where on the one hand,

591
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:22,690
some of Ivan Ilitch's behaviors
indicate that he believed he was mortal,

592
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:25,310
that his body was going to die,

593
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:31,060
and yet the shock and surprise that faces
that he overcomes him when he actually

594
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:38,681
has to face his mortality strongly
suggests that he's reporting correctly.

595
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,830
He didn't believe he was going to die.

596
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,080
How could that be?

597
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,370
There's a kind of puzzle there as to
even if before we moved to the question,

598
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,160
how widespread are cases like this?

599
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,380
There's a puzzle as to how are
we even to understand this case.

600
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:04,450
We need to distinguish perhaps between
what he consciously believes and what he

601
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:10,280
unconsciously believes. Maybe at the
conscious level he believed he was mortal,

602
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:15,260
but at the unconscious level he believed
he was immortal or maybe we need to

603
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:20,060
distinguish between those things he gives
a kind of lip service to versus those

604
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:23,060
things.
He truly and fundamentally believes.

605
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,760
Maybe he gives lip service to
the claim that he was mortal.

606
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,120
If you had asked them, I get more
early, what is that? Oh, of course I am.

607
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,400
And he buys life insurance accordingly.

608
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:36,680
But does he thoroughly and truly and
fundamentally believe he's mortal?

609
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:37,790
Perhaps not.

610
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:43,930
We need some such distinction if we're
going to make sense of Ivan Elledge.

611
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:48,470
Well, let's suppose we've done
it. Still have to ask not,

612
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:53,150
are there ever cases of people who
don't believe they're going to die,

613
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,930
but rather is there any good
reason to think that we're all,

614
00:43:56,931 --> 00:44:00,860
or most of us are in that situation,
are in that,

615
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,720
in that state of belief,

616
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:05,390
where although we give lip service
to the claim that we're going to die,

617
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,860
is there any good reason to believe that
fundamentally we don't actually believe

618
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:12,710
it? That's the question we
have to turn to next time.
