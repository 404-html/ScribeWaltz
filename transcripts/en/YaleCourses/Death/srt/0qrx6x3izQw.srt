1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:01,471
All right.

2
00:00:01,471 --> 00:00:05,280
Last time we started asking ourselves
about what are some of the other aspects

3
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:09,360
of death that might contribute to its
badness or at least other features of

4
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:11,100
death that are worth thinking about.
Conceivably,

5
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:15,270
some of them might reduce the
badness of death in some way.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,580
We talked about the
inevitability of death.

7
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:22,581
We talked about the variability that
people have different lengths of time

8
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:28,161
before they die and we turn
to the discussion of the
unpredictability of death.

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,840
The fact that because we don't know,

10
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:35,520
we can't predict how much
more time we've got. We May,

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,220
as it were,
pace ourselves incorrectly.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,800
We may take on a longterm project,
uh,

13
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:44,640
and then die before you've
been able to complete it.

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,730
Or alternatively you made sort of peak
too soon and then a sort of continue to

15
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:54,870
stick around in an anticlimactic way.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,080
These are bads of life that
could presumably be avoided
if only we knew how much

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,930
exactly we had,
how much longer we had.

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,600
And the other hand we
have to ask ourselves,

19
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,640
and this is a question that
I left us with last time,

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,800
whether it would really
all things considered,

21
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:14,880
be better to know how much time
you had after all, if you knew,

22
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:19,440
suppose we had the, the, the birthmarks
that told you when you were going to die,

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,660
if you had that kind of a birthmark,

24
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,700
you would face your entire life with the
burden of knowing I've got, you know,

25
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,440
48 years left, 47 years, left
50 have ears, let you know,

26
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,610
I should've been counting
down 35, 30, 25 and so forth.

27
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,550
Many of us would find that,
uh, or as they say, a burden,

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,700
something hanging constantly over us,

29
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,790
interfering with our
ability to enjoy life.

30
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,170
Suppose that there were some
sort of genetic marker. Uh,

31
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:52,320
and although we didn't have a tattoo
that you just have to look at,

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,860
but you could have genetic counseling
and have the right kind of Da,

33
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,890
have your DNA examined and you could
tell if you had the DNA testing,

34
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,590
how much time you had left,

35
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,190
would you want to get that testing done?

36
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,940
Now that's of course science fiction
and I presume it's going to stay science

37
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:16,941
fiction though we're on the cusp of having
something at least approximating that

38
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:22,371
as we learn more and more
about the various genes that
carry a various diseases.

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,571
Uh,

40
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:28,440
we more and more of us face the question
of whether or not we want to get tested

41
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:29,610
for those diseases.

42
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,970
Suppose there was a test date will
occasionally reads in the newspaper about

43
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:36,600
this sort of thing where you can get
tested for such and such a disease.

44
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:40,140
You might know already that you've
got a 50% chance of having it,

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,220
but you don't know whether you
yourself have it. If you do have it,

46
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,930
you know the disease will always have
onset by age 40 50 or what have you.

47
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,850
Would you want to have that
kind of information closely?

48
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:54,960
Related question.

49
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,980
If you did know how
much time you had left,

50
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,260
how would you act differently
from what you're doing now?

51
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,710
Would it,

52
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:10,710
would it focus your attention on making
sure you did the things that were most

53
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,970
important to you?

54
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,020
And it's worth in sort of a
useful test for asking yourself,

55
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,720
what are the things you
most value in life to ask?

56
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,970
What would you choose to do if
you knew you had five years,

57
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,190
10 years, what have you.
There's an old Saturday,

58
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,360
Saturday night live routine where uh,
uh,

59
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,560
one of the actors is in the
doctor's office and the,

60
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:39,561
and the doctor gives him the very sad
news that he's got two minutes left to

61
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,480
live.
Uh,

62
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,550
and he says I'm going to pack a
lifetime of enjoyment into those,

63
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,900
those two minutes.

64
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,530
And then of course the point of the skid
as he presses the down button on the

65
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,980
elevator and the minute and a half goes
by while he's waiting for the elevator

66
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:58,210
to come. If you knew you had
a year left or two years left,

67
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,490
what would you do with that time?

68
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,690
Would you be in school?
Would you travel?

69
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:09,100
Would you spend more time hanging
out with your friends? Uh, a very,

70
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,600
uh,
for me,

71
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:15,070
extremely striking example of this
question occurred in this very class.

72
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,100
There was a student in this class some
years ago who was dying and he knew that

73
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:25,300
he was dying. He'd been diagnosed with,
if I recall correctly, cancer, uh,

74
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,170
as a freshmen.

75
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:31,171
And his doctor had told him that he
pretty much had no chance of recovery and

76
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:35,800
indeed had only a couple more years
to live faced with that question.

77
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:40,480
He had to ask himself, well, what
should I do with my remaining years?

78
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,980
It was astonishing enough that somebody
perhaps understandable that somebody in

79
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:49,981
that situation would decide to take a
class on death and then have himself sort

80
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:54,460
of submit himself to my getting up
here week after week talking about how

81
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,210
there's no soul, there's no
prospect for an afterlife. Uh,

82
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,220
it's a good thing that
we're all going to die.

83
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,460
But faced with the question
of what should he do,

84
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:05,800
what did he want to do with
his remaining couple of years?

85
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,060
What he decided he wanted to
do was finish, is Yale degree.

86
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,360
Thought he'd set himself the goal of
graduating college before he died.

87
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:20,851
And he was taking this class
second semester of his senior year,

88
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,180
at least he was taking it until
spring break. By spring break,

89
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:28,090
he'd gotten sufficiently sick
that his doctor basically said,

90
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:32,230
you can't continue in school anymore.
You've got to go home. Basically.

91
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,840
You've got to go home to die.
Uh,

92
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:39,841
and indeed he got progressively and
then rapidly deteriorated at that point.

93
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,190
There's the faculty members who were
teaching his classes that semester.

94
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:48,280
Then all face the question posed
to them by the administration.

95
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,380
They start on the work he's done
so far this semester. Has He,

96
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,830
what kind of grade, uh, do you,
are you prepared to give him?

97
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,350
Because depending on which of his classes
he passed and which of his classes he

98
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:04,700
failed, the question was going to be, you
know, was he going to graduate or not?

99
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,850
In fact, of course he did
manage to graduate and Yale too.

100
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:11,481
It's a,

101
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:16,481
I think we will glory and credit sent a
member of the administration down to his

102
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:21,500
deathbed to award him, uh, his
degree before he passed away.

103
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,520
So let's say it's a very striking story.

104
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,560
I'm not sure how many of us would decide.

105
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:31,700
The last thing we wanted to do with
our remaining years is to spend it in

106
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:35,330
college. Well, what is it that
you'd want to do? And again,

107
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:39,920
to move back and ask ourselves the larger
question would knowing how much time

108
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:44,690
you have be something that would allow
you to actually embrace those choices or

109
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:47,030
would it instead just be a burden?

110
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,620
That's the kind of question we have to
face when we think about the fact that we

111
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:54,290
don't know how much time we've gone.

112
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:58,310
Is that something that increases the
badness of death or does it reduce its

113
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:59,600
significance somewhat.

114
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,310
Here's another feature in
addition to the inevitability,

115
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:08,540
in addition to the variability,
in addition to the unpredictability,

116
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,220
there's the fact that death is,
as I like to think of it ubiquitous.

117
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,970
I don't just mean the fact that
people are dying all around us,

118
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,710
but I mean rather you yourself
could die at any time.

119
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:27,190
There never any getting away from
the possibility that you'll die now,

120
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,420
even if we didn't have unpredictability.

121
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,060
I mean whether even if
we had unpredictability,

122
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,670
it wouldn't necessarily follow that
death was pervasive in this way.

123
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,120
The point I've got in mind here is this,

124
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,200
even when you think you're perfectly safe,
you could of course die of a stroke.

125
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,750
You could die of a heart attack.

126
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,010
Even somebody who's young could have an
aneurysm or one of my favorite examples.

127
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,450
You can be sitting in your,

128
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:59,000
you've sort of read this sort of
thing in the liver and the newspaper.

129
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:04,001
Periodically you can be sitting in your
living room when suddenly an airplane

130
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,260
crashes into your house,
killing you,

131
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,530
the sorts of things happen.
You thought you were safe,

132
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:16,730
you are watching reruns on television.
The next minute you're dead.

133
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,290
The fact that you could die and you don't
know when you're going to die doesn't

134
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:25,490
yet in tale that you could die
at any minute at any moment,

135
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,500
but in fact that's true of us as well.
Get another example. Close to my heart.

136
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,280
I remember before I taught here,

137
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:38,630
I used to teach at the University of
Illinois at Chicago and once I was driving

138
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,810
down the highway and a car
pulled in without looking, uh,

139
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,780
and clipped my car, uh, and caused
my cock pulled in from the entrance,

140
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,430
caused my car to go careening
across three lanes of traffic,

141
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,720
spinning out of control.

142
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,000
And I remember quite clearly
thinking to myself as that happened,

143
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,590
the whole thing lasted only a few moments,

144
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,780
but I remember thinking quite clearly
I'm going to die. Uh, now as it happens,

145
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:04,501
I didn't die.

146
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:08,550
I walked away from the accident and the
damage to my car was rather minimal,

147
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:10,620
but it could have happened like that.

148
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,790
Death is the possibility
of death is ubiquitous.

149
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,090
It's pervasive.
We have to ask ourselves then,

150
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,300
does this make things worse?

151
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:26,280
It certainly feels to my mind is though
it's an extra bad about the nature of

152
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:30,000
death.
It would be nice to get a breather.

153
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,750
Imagine if you will,
that there were certain locations,

154
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,950
certain vacation spots where you,
as long as you were there,

155
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,150
you couldn't die.

156
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,550
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to go
someplace and just for a period think to

157
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:48,230
yourself, well, you know right now
I don't have to worry about it.

158
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,860
It doesn't even have to cross my mind.

159
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:54,960
Maybe if there were these sort of death
free zones, they'd get rather crowded,

160
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,920
so perhaps we should change the example
instead of having death free zones

161
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,760
imagined that there were death free times.

162
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,340
Just suppose to,
for whatever reason,

163
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,080
nobody could die between 12 and one.

164
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,760
You could just sort of put it out of your
mind. Wouldn't that be nice? All right.

165
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,150
One o'clock sort of you
take the mantel back on,

166
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,010
but wouldn't it be nice to just have a
certain period of time every day when you

167
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:28,011
didn't have to even have it be so much
as a remote possibility or supposed to

168
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,250
wear a certain death free activities?

169
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,900
Maybe reading philosophy
would be something that as
long as you were doing it,

170
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:41,190
you couldn't die or, or as perhaps some
religious traditions might've taught.

171
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,790
As long as you are engaged in prayer,
you couldn't, you couldn't tie.

172
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,590
Wouldn't that be nice or are turned
the entire thing the other way around.

173
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,110
Suppose that most times and
most activities were death free,

174
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:02,590
but certain activities introduce
the possibility of dying.

175
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,570
So you couldn't die unless you
were engaged in certain activities.

176
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:13,490
So you would be immortal, but not in
a sense of immortal against you will.

177
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,100
There'll be certain activities
perhaps, you know, for example,

178
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,650
putting a gun to your head,
that would put an end to your life.

179
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:20,720
So even if more immortality would be bad,

180
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,880
there'll be certain things you
could do that could end it.

181
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,090
Okay.

182
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:25,960
Ask Yourself,

183
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,990
what sorts of activities would you engage
in if you knew that those activities

184
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,280
carried with it,
carried with them the risk of dying.

185
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,240
So most of the time you couldn't die.

186
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,980
What things would be so important to
you that you'd be willing to suddenly

187
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:53,920
risked death for the sake of doing things?

188
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,590
You like? Art? Is Art important enough to
you? Uh, that you'd be prepared to watch?

189
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,700
Look at a masterpiece. If you knew that
while you were enjoying it, you could die,

190
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,320
but that wouldn't happen otherwise.

191
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,560
Is Sex great enough that you'd be prepared
to run the risk of dying while you

192
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:16,780
were engaged in sex? Again, it's
a nice lens for asking yourself,

193
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,230
what are the things that
are most valuable to you?

194
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,290
By asking which of them are so valuable,

195
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,300
you'd be prepared to do them even if
they would introduce what isn't the

196
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:30,250
otherwise there namely the risk of death

197
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,490
now and posing the question that way.

198
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:38,491
I've been assuming that these are things
you do despite the fact that they run

199
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,040
the risk of death. I suppose there
is a further question we have to ask.

200
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,280
Are there things that would be worth
doing precisely because of the fact that

201
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:52,120
they introduced the risk of death?

202
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Now I've got to admit that
when I posed that question,

203
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:59,220
that sounds rather bizarre.
At least you know,

204
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,800
putting aside the possibility that we've
now lived are a hundred thousand years

205
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:07,150
and have exhausted all that life's got
to offer for us certainly to engage in

206
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:09,000
activities now.
Well,

207
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:14,001
life still has so much more to offer to
engage in activities now where precisely

208
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:19,120
for the chance of dying.
That strikes me as bizarre.

209
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:23,890
And yet it seems to me that
there are many activities,

210
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:24,341
if not many,

211
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:29,110
at least several activities that
people do precisely for that reason.

212
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,570
For example, let me tell you something.
I know there's going to shock you.

213
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:36,810
Did you know there are people
who jump out of airplanes now,

214
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,320
admittedly, they've got this
little piece of cloth, uh,

215
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,580
that gives them a decent chance of not
killing themselves when they jump out of

216
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:49,450
airplanes. But these things
do fail every now and then.

217
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:53,940
He sort of read in the newspaper about
somebody who's parachute failed to open

218
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:57,070
it, so they died. I asked myself why,

219
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,070
what could possibly drive somebody to,

220
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,100
to jump out of an airplane with nothing
but a little piece of cloth between them

221
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,810
and death?
And the answer that tracks me,

222
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:12,811
his most plausible is it's this very
fact that there's a significant chance of

223
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:18,040
death that helps explain
why people do this. Now,

224
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:21,100
I know if you talked to some of these
people, they'll often say, oh, no, no, no,

225
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,920
the views are so glorious,
or something like that.

226
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:28,330
But I think this is rather an implausible
suggestion because of course you could

227
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:33,040
have these glorious views just by going
up in the airplane and looking down from

228
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,510
the safety of your airplane.

229
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,380
Part of the thrill has got to be,

230
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:43,381
or so it seems to me part of the thrill
has got to be the very fact that they

231
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:48,250
now have an increased risk of death.

232
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:53,120
The chance of dying is part of what drives
somebody to jump out of an airplane.

233
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,770
Well,

234
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,770
if that's right then should we say
that the pervasiveness of death,

235
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,120
the ubiquitousness of death,

236
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,120
the thing that I was earlier
suggestion was oppressive.

237
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:10,121
Wouldn't it really be nice to have a
death free time or Jeffrey location are

238
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:14,960
debt free activities?
Maybe I was wrong and suggesting that if,

239
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:18,500
if the chance of death
would add kind of zest,

240
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,800
then perhaps the ubiquity of death is
actually a good thing rather than a bad

241
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:29,120
thing. I'm inclined to think, at least
in my own case, that that's not right.

242
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,480
Um, perhaps the explanation has got to
be the ubiquity of death is this kind of

243
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,700
background constant. Hum. Uh, and,

244
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:41,390
uh,

245
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,280
the fact that we are always facing
some risk of death recedes into the

246
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:49,790
background or the way that most
of us don't hear background noise.

247
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,150
The what jumping out of an
airplane does for you is it,

248
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,030
it's spikes the risk of death.

249
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,050
So it's not really good enough
to just have some risk of death.

250
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,410
It's gotta be greater risk than usual,
if that's right.

251
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,890
If that's the psychology,
then even for those death,

252
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:12,190
death thrill seekers of ubiquity of
death won't necessarily be a good thing

253
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:16,130
because of it being constant,
it just recedes into the background.

254
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,140
All right,
so again,

255
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,410
what had been asking us to think about
our various aspects of death that might

256
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:28,580
contribute to either increase or perhaps
in certain ways reduced somewhat the

257
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:30,230
badness of death.

258
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,180
There's one more aspect that I want to
take a couple of minutes and have us

259
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,600
think about, and that's this.
Look previously to this,

260
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,680
this most recent discussion I
talked about the value of life,

261
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,130
some rival theories about
what makes life worth living.

262
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,440
And now for the last lecture or so I've
been talking about in addition to the

263
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:52,370
deprivation account,

264
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,300
the additional things that
contribute to the badness of death.

265
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,190
So you might think, well, what about
the human condition as a whole?

266
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,180
What about the fact that it's not
just that we live or for that matter,

267
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:06,290
it's not just that we die?

268
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,760
What's true about humans is
that we live and then we die.

269
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,770
That's the human condition.

270
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Life followed by death might ask what's
the value of that entire combination?

271
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,460
Now, the most natural
thing to suggest would be,

272
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,430
well, you know, you get clear on your,

273
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,880
your favorite theory about the
value of life, whatever that is,

274
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,870
you get clear about the kinds of
questions we've just been asking about the

275
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:38,300
badness of death,
whatever that is.

276
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,920
What's the overall assessment of the
human condition? You might think,

277
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,670
well that's just a matter of adding up
the goodness of life and subtracting the

278
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:49,770
badness of death and summing it.
Whatever comes to

279
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,760
I suppose again, kind of optimist
says, know, yeah, death is bad,

280
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:57,740
but life is good,

281
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,410
sufficiently good to outweigh the badness
of the fact that we're going to die on

282
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:05,700
balance. It's a good thing to be born and
pessimists might be those who say, no,

283
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:10,590
no, I'm balanced. The negative of death
outweighs the positiveness of life,

284
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,950
but I want to pause for a moment and and
note that this assumption that the way

285
00:18:15,951 --> 00:18:20,540
to think about the value of the
combination is just a matter of adding the

286
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,910
goodness of life and the badness of
death and just summing them that way.

287
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That may not be right because sometimes
the value of a combination is different

288
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:35,850
than the value you would get by just
thinking about each one of the parts in

289
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:38,130
isolation and then adding them up.

290
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,280
I kind of addition approach to values
of holes may not always be correct.

291
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,480
Here's a nice simple
example to make that point.

292
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,470
My two favorite foods in the world
are probably pizza on the one hand and

293
00:18:56,581 --> 00:19:01,020
chocolate on the other. I know I've shared
my love of chocolate with you before.

294
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:05,250
I don't recall having shared my love of
pizza with you before, but there it is.

295
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,480
Two favorite things. I Love, Love Pizza,
delicious love chocolate, delicious.

296
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,770
Take these two delicious
things and combine them into
a chocolate covered pizza.

297
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,240
I'm like, God, the whole idea
just sounds disgusting and it is.

298
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,520
I take it disgusting,

299
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,010
but you wouldn't notice the disgusting
this if you just thought about the value

300
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:30,120
of pizza in isolation and the
value of chocolate in isolation,

301
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,630
the value of chocolate covered pizza
is not just a matter of summing up the

302
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:40,470
value of the parts and
I'd taken in isolation.

303
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:45,600
You've got to think about what we
might dub the interaction effects.

304
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,060
So let's ask ourselves,

305
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:52,020
are there any interaction effects when
we talk about the human condition that

306
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:56,700
it's life followed by death. We've thought
about the value of life in isolation.

307
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,210
We've been in effect thinking about
the value of death in isolation.

308
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,270
Does the fact that death follows life,

309
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,870
does that produce any interaction
effects between the two,

310
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,820
which need to be added into our formula
added into the mix as well? Well,

311
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:14,190
there's obviously I suppose
two possibilities. Well,

312
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,360
really three possibility number one is no,
doesn't make any difference.

313
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:23,430
Uninteresting possibility.
More interestingly to
remaining possibilities. Yeah.

314
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:27,810
There is actually some ways in which
the combination ends up becoming worse.

315
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,990
The interaction effects make things
even worse than we can't overlook.

316
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:33,090
Those interact,
those negative interaction effects.

317
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,430
Also the possibility that there might
be some positive interaction effects.

318
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,480
Let me start briefly by mentioning a
possibility for a positive interaction

319
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,863
effect

320
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:52,120
because of the fact that you're
going to die obviously enough.

321
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,970
It's not just the he'll
get whatever life you get,

322
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,930
but there's a finite amount of
life that you're going to get.

323
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,960
Life is a scarce resource.

324
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,260
It's precious and we might be attracted
to the thought that the value of life is

325
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,550
increased by its very preciousness.

326
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,820
There's a kind of aspect of value for
many of us where we feel that some things

327
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:24,610
especially valuable,
if it won't endure,

328
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,390
if it's fragile or if it's rare,

329
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,360
this can enhance the value of something.

330
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,890
And so arguably the fact
that life is precious,

331
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:37,360
that it won't endure,

332
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,830
could actually increase it's value for us.

333
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,420
There's a short story by
the science fiction writer,

334
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,730
Orson Scott Card,
uh,

335
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:53,731
where the basic point of the story
is that of all the life forms in the

336
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:55,750
universe,

337
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,840
we here on earth are the
only ones that are mortal.

338
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,210
And because of this,

339
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:08,950
we are the envy of the
rest of the universe.

340
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,950
It's not so much that in mortality,

341
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:16,750
what the rest of them have is unattractive
or boring. It's perfectly fine.

342
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:22,170
But they envy us for our finite lifespans
because what we've got and they don't

343
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:27,250
have is something that sort
of for each individual rare,

344
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:31,900
something that not lasting,
something that's precious in that way.

345
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,430
All right?
It's a possibility.

346
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:38,790
So it's possible that the very fact
that we're going to die sort of has,

347
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:43,710
it causes an interaction effect
with our life. So as there's a,

348
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:48,100
there's an upside to it. It makes
our life fragile, ephemeral,

349
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,290
and as a result of that,
more precious.

350
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,750
But it's also possible actually
compatible with accepting that fact.

351
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:59,320
There are two additional possibilities
that there might be some negative

352
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,180
interaction affects.

353
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,660
It could be that they're in thinking
about the nature of the combination.

354
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,950
We're led to see that in certain
ways that the combination,

355
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:12,700
the interaction effects are, are
negative or bad ones. So here's,

356
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,980
here's two possibilities for that thought.

357
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,270
First possibility I think of under
the heading a taste is just a tease.

358
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,730
It's,
it's as though we live life for a while,

359
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:32,790
getting a feel for all the wonderful
things life could offer us and then a

360
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:37,390
moment later as it were,
it's snatched away from us.

361
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,360
It's sort of adding insult to injury that
we w we were that were offered just a

362
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:43,990
weird,

363
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:48,990
it's as though somebody brought in this
delicious meal to are hungry before a

364
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:52,880
hungry person.
Allow them to see what it looked like.

365
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,960
Allow them just smell the, you
know, the, the delicious aromas.

366
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,820
Perhaps gave them just one little tiny
forkful to see just how beautifully

367
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:05,330
delicious the food was and then
they snatched the whole thing away.

368
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,720
You can imagine somebody who says,
look,

369
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,400
it would be better never to have had the
taste at all than to have the taste and

370
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:19,160
then not be allowed to
have the entire meal.

371
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:25,040
That's something that you might not
notice if you just focus on the intrinsic

372
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:28,910
nature of the taste after
all the intrinsic nature of
the taste was positive or

373
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,900
if you just focused on the intrinsic
character of the not having a meal after

374
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:34,820
all,
not having to meet those just you know,

375
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,880
an absence of a certain experience to
capture what's excrutiatingly undesirable

376
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,590
about the two.

377
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:47,650
You need to think about the
two in combination to an
interaction effect and when

378
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:49,790
my thing look this,

379
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,680
this is one of the negative things about
the human condition that we get a taste

380
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,240
of life, nothing more before it
snatched away. That's one possibility.

381
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,140
The second possible thought that comes
to mind for me and thinking about the

382
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:06,420
negative interaction effects.
I call under the the,

383
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:10,970
the title I think about under the title
how the noble have fallen. I mean,

384
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,350
right now there's
something amazing about us.

385
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,630
We are people

386
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,240
in the universe. We, oh, you know, who
knows what is out there in the universe,

387
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:25,220
but at least in her on earth,

388
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:30,280
we may well be the only people there are,
ah,

389
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:34,340
who knows, maybe dolphins or or, or
a certain, some of the great apes,

390
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:38,870
but at the very rate,
it's a rather select club.

391
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:42,860
We are, as I said, you know, early in the
semester when I sent him a physical list,

392
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,630
I believe that people are just machines,
but we're not just any old machine.

393
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,590
We're amazing machines.
We're able to love,

394
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,660
we're able to write poetry.

395
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:58,790
We're able to think about the farthest
reaches of the universe and ask what our

396
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,650
place is in the universe.

397
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,980
People are amazing and we end up rotting.

398
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,370
We end up corpses.

399
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,930
There's some thing for many of us,

400
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:19,931
there's something horrifying about the
thought that something as amazing as us

401
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,040
as exalted and valuable as us could end
up something as lowly and unimportant as

402
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:34,020
a piece of rotting flesh. It
again, think about it, you know,

403
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,420
uh,
I,

404
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,440
the imagery that comes to mind for me is
one of these deposed kings who ends up

405
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:46,680
waiting on a tables to make a living.
You know, in New York and you,

406
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:48,900
and it's,
you might think are the light of a way.

407
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:52,740
There's not the worst thing in the
world, but there's extra, again,

408
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:57,770
insult to injury when the person's got
to remember that he used to be something

409
00:26:58,111 --> 00:27:01,380
extraordinary. A ruler. Again,

410
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:03,630
if you just thought about life as a ruler,
well,

411
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,460
pretty good thinking
about it in isolation.

412
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,670
Life has a waiter not so bad
thinking about it in isolation,

413
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,200
to see the nature of the,
of the problem,

414
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:16,320
you've got to think about the fact
that it's a combination package.

415
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,560
There's something especially insulting
about having gone from king to waiter how

416
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:26,991
the mighty have fallen and that fate
before is waiting for all of us.

417
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,740
It's a fact about the human condition
that the amazing things we are don't stay

418
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,910
amazing.
We turn into pieces of rotting flesh,

419
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,410
decaying.
So two possible negative effects.

420
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,630
The taste is just a tease. The how
the noble have fallen on the one hand,

421
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,730
one possible positive effect, uh, that
sort of extra preciousness of life.

422
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,720
I'm not quite sure where on
balance we should say, uh,

423
00:27:57,721 --> 00:28:00,300
how these things play out.
Again,

424
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:04,590
I suppose we could have different
views. On the one hand, the,

425
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,050
the optimists might say,

426
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,030
even when we throw in the
extra interaction effects,

427
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:17,031
even the negative interaction affects
the overall nature of the human condition

428
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,300
is positive so that it's a good thing to
be born even though your life is going

429
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,700
to be followed by death.

430
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:32,210
And against that we could have
the pessimists who say the,

431
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,380
the negative side, especially once we
throw into negative interaction effects,

432
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:42,530
the negative side is so great that it
would be better never to have been born at

433
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:46,980
all.
That's the pessimist view,

434
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,520
given that we're going to die this,

435
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,790
this fact seeps back in and poisons the
nature of life or perhaps poisons the

436
00:28:57,961 --> 00:28:59,190
nature of the,
of the,

437
00:28:59,191 --> 00:29:03,180
of the whole life followed
by death so that unbalanced,

438
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:08,160
the whole thing's negative.
Better to have not had any event betters,

439
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:09,630
have not been born at all,

440
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:14,631
say the pessimists then to have this
combination package of life followed by

441
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,640
death.
Now for myself,

442
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:21,930
I'm sufficiently optimistic that I'm
inclined to think life's wonderful.

443
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,100
The negative combination effects that I
was talking about are certainly there,

444
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,770
but on balance I think the
human condition for most of us,

445
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:32,090
there's a good one better to
have been born there never had,

446
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:36,120
even though that's followed by death
than never to have been born at all,

447
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,740
but I do want to emphasize the point
that even if we were to accept the

448
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,640
conclusion that it would be better
never to have been born at all.

449
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,710
It doesn't follow,

450
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,690
at least doesn't follow without further
argument that the right response to the

451
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,270
realization if it is
the correct realization,

452
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,030
that'd be better narrative been
born at all. It doesn't follow that.

453
00:29:58,031 --> 00:30:00,340
The right response is to commit suicide

454
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:06,340
to tempting thought, right? To Go
philosophically from life's so bad,

455
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:09,940
given the nature of the human condition
life followed by death that better to

456
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:14,350
never have had any of it. Then they've
just had a taste and a tease and so forth.

457
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,970
But it's a tempting philosophical thought
to say once I've shown it's better

458
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:23,440
never to have been born. It follows that
suicide is the appropriate response,

459
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,500
but in fact, as a matter of
logic, that doesn't follow it all.

460
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,660
Because if you think about it,

461
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,870
suicide doesn't change the fundamental
nature of the human condition.

462
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,030
Life followed by death.

463
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,850
It's not as though if you kill yourself,

464
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:43,600
you somehow bring it about that
you've never been born at all.

465
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,460
It's still the case that if
there's something horrible
about having just a taste,

466
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:52,600
well indeed, if you commit suicide,
you've made it an even shorter chased.

467
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,760
If there's something sort of
degrading or an unknowable about,

468
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:58,743
uh,

469
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,710
being a person who's going to become a
corpse committing suicide doesn't alter

470
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:06,790
that fundamental fact either.
It just makes the insult comes sooner.

471
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,120
So, even if we were to agree
with the pessimists that
it would be better never to

472
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,750
have been born at all. Uh, you
know, as, as the old joke goes,

473
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,010
show me one person in a
thousand who so lucky, right?

474
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,060
We have all been born and from the fact,

475
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,290
even if we were to agree with it,

476
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:28,600
that it would have been
better if we hadn't been born.

477
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,140
Instead of feeling sorry for unborn Larry,

478
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:35,890
perhaps we should end the unborn Larry.
That's what the pessimists say.

479
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,180
Even if that were true,

480
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,740
it wouldn't follow that suicide
was an inappropriate response.

481
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,590
It doesn't mean, of course it's suicide
isn't ever inappropriate response.

482
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,391
You know,
we're,

483
00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:53,260
we're coming on towards the end of the
semester and the last topic we'll be

484
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,320
talking about is indeed
the topic of suicide. When,

485
00:31:56,321 --> 00:32:01,321
if ever is suicide and
appropriate rational or moral
response to one situation.

486
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:09,270
Let's hold off on thinking about that
question a bit further before we get to a

487
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:11,750
suicide might say,
look,

488
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,360
the question that's going to entertain
us for the remaining few weeks is this.

489
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:22,120
How should one live in light
of the facts about death?

490
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,930
That I'd been laying out in
the semester up to this point.

491
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,320
How should we live in light of the facts
about death and one possible response.

492
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,610
The last one we'll look
at is what you should do,

493
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:37,780
at least sometimes is kill yourself.
Come to that.

494
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,440
Well, we're going to spend it the next
couple of weeks asking ourselves different

495
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:43,730
aspects of the question.

496
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,880
What should our response be to the fact
of our death and the specific features

497
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:53,810
of death and the nature of
death that we'd been exploring.

498
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:55,790
Okay.

499
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:59,810
But the very first question I suppose
we really need to ask is this,

500
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:05,480
should we be thinking about
all of this at all? Well,

501
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:09,320
I realize that for you
guys, it's too late, right?

502
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,470
It's sort of late in the day for students
who've been through the better part of

503
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:17,020
a semester, uh, thinking about the nature
of death to argue, maybe, you know,

504
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,910
it was such a good idea for you to
take this class in the first place.

505
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,880
But you know,
as as theorists,

506
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,830
we could be interested in the theoretical
possibility that the right response is

507
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:31,850
to not think about the facts
of death at all. In principle,

508
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,950
in principle, I suppose there's
three different reactions. Yup.

509
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:43,130
So, so I make various claims of the
sort that I've been making about,

510
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,930
well look, you know, we're just physical
objects. When these objects break,

511
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,280
we cease to exist. The objects don't
get put back together, you know,

512
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,420
and so forth and so on.

513
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:58,490
One possibility of course is simply
to disagree with me about the facts.

514
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:02,480
And so you of course, if you do
disagree, I think you're mistaken.

515
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:06,350
So I'll think of us denying the facts,
but that's a possibility.

516
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,430
Another possibility,

517
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:14,431
the one I'll turn to a little bit later
is admit the facts and live accordingly.

518
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,910
Of course, we haven't yet asked
ourselves, how should you live?

519
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,600
If you recognize and take
into account those fats,

520
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,820
that's the question we'll turn to.
But there's the,

521
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,500
there's the middle possibility,

522
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:31,501
which is not so much think about them and
deny them not so much think about them

523
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:37,000
except them and act accordingly.
But simply don't think about them.

524
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,760
Okay.

525
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,070
Maybe the best response,
ted,

526
00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:45,300
the facts of death are just
put it out of your mind.

527
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,670
Don't give it any thought at all.

528
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,240
No.
On the one hand,

529
00:34:52,241 --> 00:34:57,241
you might think that can't
possibly be the right response,

530
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,250
the appropriate response after all,

531
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,450
how can it be appropriate to disregard,

532
00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:08,830
to put out of your mind facts?
Well,

533
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,100
that all sounds very nice, but I think
that claims got to just be mistaken.

534
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:17,250
There's nothing unacceptable
or inappropriate or
misguided about not thinking

535
00:35:18,071 --> 00:35:22,030
about all sorts of facts that you might
have learned at some point or the other.

536
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,770
Here's my favorite
example of stupid facts.

537
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:30,960
I was forced to learn when I was
younger state capitols, right?

538
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,980
I've gotten pretty far in my life and
as far as I can tell, I've never ever,

539
00:35:35,981 --> 00:35:40,350
ever had to remember the
capitals of the 50 states.

540
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,200
Yeah,

541
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,290
so I just don't think
about it pretty much.

542
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:49,820
I think about it only once a year
when I'm giving this very lecture.

543
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,910
I started asking the how many k say
capital's can I remember in the answer is

544
00:35:52,911 --> 00:35:57,350
really not all that many of them not
thinking about those facts that I knew at

545
00:35:57,351 --> 00:36:00,470
one point,
just not all that objectionable,

546
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,630
so in a matter of fact if it is a fact,
you know,

547
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:07,490
suppose the facts about life and death
are as I've described them until we say

548
00:36:07,491 --> 00:36:10,200
something more, it's not clear
that we shouldn't just, all right,

549
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,590
just note it stored away
from getting about it.

550
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:17,480
Just like the facts about the
state capitals, that seems odd,

551
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,540
that seems misguided,
but why?

552
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:25,750
What is it about thus the facts about
life and death that seemed to make it

553
00:36:27,231 --> 00:36:30,620
misguided to think we should just put
them aside and pay no attention to them?

554
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,720
Presumably because we're,

555
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:37,810
we're led to the thought or tracked into
the thought that the nature of death,

556
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,850
the facts about death,

557
00:36:40,851 --> 00:36:45,080
whatever they are should have
an impact on how we live.

558
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,060
The appropriate way to live,
get shaped,

559
00:36:50,061 --> 00:36:55,040
at least in part by the fact that we're,
that we're going to die,

560
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:59,660
that we won't be around forever.
If that's right,

561
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:04,690
then it seems as though
there'd be something irrational
and inappropriate about

562
00:37:05,151 --> 00:37:08,360
simply disregarding those facts.
Let me,

563
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:11,000
let me tell you two stories that might,

564
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,110
well look before I tell you the
stories, here's, here's the other side.

565
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,130
Suppose somebody said, yeah, it's true.

566
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:24,410
If I thought about the nature of death,
the fact that you know,

567
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:29,150
the 50 80 90 years I've got on
this earth is all on gone ahead.

568
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,860
If I thought about that fact,

569
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,430
it would just be overwhelming.

570
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,770
It would be crushing.

571
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,280
I'd be unable to sort
of go on with my life.

572
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,720
People sometimes claim that that's
the case and because of that,

573
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:50,350
the the right thing to do is to
not think about it. You know,

574
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,660
you've read at this point,
you know,

575
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,740
long since a total stories
death of Ivan Illich,

576
00:37:55,410 --> 00:38:00,410
then the people in the toll story story
seem to have put the facts of mortality

577
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,240
out of their mind. Why?
Presumably because they,

578
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:08,270
they think that facing it is just
to crushing and overwhelming.

579
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,160
So the way they cope with it, they think
the appropriate responses, put it aside,

580
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,620
disregard the facts about death.

581
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:18,960
Oh,

582
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,520
does it say that there's seems to be
something Amiss about that reaction?

583
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:24,630
That was certainly the point.

584
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:29,190
That toll was trying to get us to see
there's something wrong about lives,

585
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,280
something inauthentic about lives that
are lived without facing the facts of our

586
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:39,640
mortality and living accordingly. Whatever
the appropriate responses might be.

587
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:44,740
Here are, here are two stories not
having to do with death per se,

588
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:49,890
that may help us get a feel for the
oddity of trying to disregard these facts.

589
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:55,700
So Paul is that you're on a hot date or
about to go out on a hot day with Peggy

590
00:38:56,111 --> 00:39:00,880
sue. Oh. Or, or depending on your
preferences. Billy Bob, uh, and,

591
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:06,150
and your roommate holds
up an envelope and says,

592
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:11,610
written in this envelope are certain
facts about Peggy sue or Billy Bob.

593
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:17,740
I, I'm not going to tell you what these
facts are yet. They're in the envelope,

594
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,710
but I'll give you the envelope.
You can open it up and read them.

595
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,220
But I do want to tell you
this, this one thing, it is,

596
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,810
it is indeed the case that if
you were to read these facts,

597
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,730
if you were to think about these facts,

598
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:33,700
if you were to know the things
written down in the envelope,

599
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,180
you would not want to
go out with Peggy sue

600
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,620
and you say to yourself,
well,

601
00:39:40,621 --> 00:39:44,970
let's see right now I want to go out
with Peggy sue. But if I knew these true,

602
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,180
it's not that you think, oh, your roommate
has made it up, that these are lies.

603
00:39:48,181 --> 00:39:50,820
These are slander.
You really believe and you're,

604
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:55,260
and it is in fact the case that the things
written down in the envelope are true.

605
00:39:55,350 --> 00:40:00,270
And so you know that if only you were
to read these things in the envelope,

606
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,820
you would change your mind and no
longer want to go out with her.

607
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,430
And so what you say is,
don't show me the envelope

608
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:11,730
that seems odd,
doesn't seem like it makes sense.

609
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:15,270
If there are things that would change
your mind and you know that they would

610
00:40:15,271 --> 00:40:20,100
change your mind about your behavior,
how can it be rational to disregard them?

611
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,250
Here's another story.

612
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:29,180
You're about to drink a milkshake and
your roommate comes rushing in and say,

613
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,380
I've got the lab report.

614
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:36,600
I had said my suspicions about the
milkshake and so I took a sample.

615
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,180
I rushed it down to the lab.
I've got the lab report.

616
00:40:39,181 --> 00:40:42,030
You're about to drink it right cause
you're thirsty. It's a hot day.

617
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:46,920
You love milkshakes and your roommates
says inside the envelope are facts about

618
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:50,430
this milkshake that if I promise
you it is indeed the case.

619
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:54,450
If you know the new these facts,
you would not drink the milkshake anymore.

620
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:58,860
And he'd say, Oh, thank God, don't open
the envelope and you drink the milkshake.

621
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:03,720
Disregarding the facts.
That's seems inappropriate.

622
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:05,761
Well,

623
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:10,761
if it really was true then that if only
we faced the facts about our mortality,

624
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,910
that we would live life
rather differently.

625
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,950
How could it be reasonable for
us to disregard those facts?

626
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,980
Well, that's the puzzle.
I may mask the puzzle.

627
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,920
Maybe we shouldn't call it a puzzle or
maybe the answer is that just shows the

628
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,720
options,
not really all that reputable.

629
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,080
What we either have to do is deny the
claims I've made about the nature of death

630
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:45,170
or else go on to ask
suppose that they are true.

631
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,270
How should we live in light of them?

632
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,320
Maybe the disregard option just as one
that we can't raise actually take on as a

633
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,340
intellectually acceptable alternative,

634
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:59,690
but I suspect that that's
probably a little bit too quick.

635
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,640
Yeah,

636
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,640
because really there are two different
ways in which facts could influence our

637
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,380
behavior and if we're not careful,

638
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:12,440
we'll disregard this distinction even
though I think it's an important one.

639
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,410
Here's the two ways.
On the one hand,

640
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:20,500
it could be that certain
facts if you knew them,

641
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,500
would cause you to behave differently
without actually giving you any reason to

642
00:42:31,221 --> 00:42:34,970
behave differently.
That's possibility number one.

643
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,011
Possibility.

644
00:42:37,011 --> 00:42:42,011
Number two is the facts change your
behavior by giving you a reason to behave

645
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,673
differently.

646
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,250
Let me show you an example of the first
possibility cause that's the one I think

647
00:42:51,251 --> 00:42:56,080
we may be overlooking when we assume that
disregarding can't ever make any sense.

648
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,980
So there you are kissing,

649
00:42:59,981 --> 00:43:03,610
making out with Peggy sue or Billy Bob,
whoever it is,

650
00:43:03,611 --> 00:43:06,490
and your roommate birth centers
as I have in the envelope.

651
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:09,760
Certain facts such that if
you were to think about them,

652
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:14,170
you would no longer want to
kiss Peggy. Sue, Billy, Bob.

653
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,960
Let me just tell you what the facts and
the envelope are there certain facts

654
00:43:19,961 --> 00:43:24,220
about the nature of Peggy Sue's
digestive system. Now, why not? You know,

655
00:43:24,221 --> 00:43:27,190
you're making out after having had dinner
and while you're sitting there making

656
00:43:27,191 --> 00:43:29,800
out food is making its way down.

657
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:35,040
Peggy Sue's digestive track being turned
into shit and eventually it's going to

658
00:43:37,001 --> 00:43:41,980
be excreted. And if you started
picturing to yourself, uh, the feces, uh,

659
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,960
inside,
uh,

660
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:48,040
Peggy Sue's dad digestive track and the
fact that she's eventually going to be

661
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:51,310
wiping the feces off of her or behind you,

662
00:43:51,311 --> 00:43:55,940
might find it difficult to continue to
engage in making out with Peggy sue.

663
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,470
It's not. So now these are just facts,
right? I didn't make any of this up,

664
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,690
but you know, there you are.
As I'm talking about them,

665
00:44:01,691 --> 00:44:05,750
you're just being grossed out as
I described them. Now, does any,

666
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:11,010
do any of these facts about the digestive
system make it inappropriate to kiss

667
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:15,790
another human being? Oh, of
course not. But for all that,

668
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:21,360
thinking about those facts make it rather
difficult while you're thinking about

669
00:44:21,581 --> 00:44:25,120
the facts to continue
enjoying kissing the person.

670
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:27,350
Yeah.

671
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:31,890
So there are certain facts
about the digestive tract,

672
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:36,420
such set. If you think about
them, you can't do something,

673
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,270
kiss the person.
But for all that,

674
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:43,770
it's not because you got any good reason
not to kiss the person. It's not that.

675
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,420
The facts about the human digestive
process give you reason not to kiss her.

676
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:53,600
They cause you to change your behavior
without giving you any reason to change

677
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:59,610
your behavior. So when the roommate
comes running in holding the envelope,

678
00:44:59,611 --> 00:44:59,970
it says,

679
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:03,360
I have in this envelope certain facts
such that if you read these facts and

680
00:45:03,361 --> 00:45:06,240
thought about these facts,
you would stop kissing this person.

681
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,940
The question you should
put to your roommate is,

682
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:14,300
are these facts that would merely caused
me to change what I'm doing or what are

683
00:45:16,901 --> 00:45:20,940
the, are these facts things that would
give me some good reason to change?

684
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:21,240
You know,

685
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:26,220
if these are facts about how Peggy sue
likes to kiss and tell or then goes

686
00:45:26,221 --> 00:45:28,740
around and talks about who's a
good kisser and who's a bad kisser,

687
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:32,280
maybe that gives you a reason to
not continue what you're doing.

688
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:36,570
So the facts could be things that would
give you reason to change your behavior,

689
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,290
but the mere fact that they would change
your behavior doesn't yet tell you

690
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:43,230
whether they're reason generating facts.

691
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:44,970
Yeah.

692
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:49,970
If they're mirror causes and not reasons
that maybe it's perfectly okay to

693
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:51,900
disregard them.

694
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,450
Your roommate comes in and starts
trying to tell you facts about the human

695
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:57,360
digestive system. You say, not now.

696
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,030
Okay.

697
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:03,320
Disregarding is sometimes
the appropriate thing to do.

698
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,033
Okay.

699
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:10,160
What about the fact about death?
Are the facts about death,

700
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:13,700
things that it's appropriate to disregard.

701
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,073
Okay.

702
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:19,430
A bold claim would say yes.

703
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:24,110
A bold claim would say
the facts about death.

704
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:29,140
If I thought about them would change my
behavior but not because it would give

705
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:35,081
me a reason to change my behavior simply
because it would influence my behavior

706
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,370
and given that we might say
better than I think about them,

707
00:46:40,371 --> 00:46:43,130
that would be the bold
claim to make at this point.

708
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,610
Okay.

709
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:49,320
Suppose for example that you know the
the right way to live in light of the

710
00:46:49,321 --> 00:46:53,360
facts about death is to live life
to the fullest. But suppose if,

711
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,020
if you think about death,

712
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,080
you just get too depressed and you
can't live life to the fullest.

713
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:03,120
It's not that the facts about death
give you reason to stay in your room and

714
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:03,900
Sulk,

715
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,900
it's just that the facts about death
caused you to stay in your room and salt.

716
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:12,960
If that was the case,
then district gardening

717
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:19,220
always disregarding the facts about death
might well be the appropriate response.

718
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,370
Well,
that would be a rather bold claim.

719
00:47:22,371 --> 00:47:25,430
I'm not inclined to believe
that the bold claim is right.

720
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:26,920
Okay.

721
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,200
Should we conclude therefore that no,

722
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:32,350
you should always be thinking about the
facts about death. No, I'm a client.

723
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:36,780
I think that that other bold claim on the
other side is probably mistaken as raw

724
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,610
as well.
So there you are one more time,

725
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:44,560
one last time making out with
Peggy sue or Billy Bob and uh,

726
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:49,600
your roommate comes in and starts
trying to tell you about the fact that,

727
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:49,990
you know,

728
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:53,660
he's taken Shelly Kagan's a class on
death and he's been studying some biology

729
00:47:53,661 --> 00:47:58,661
class and he wants to tell you about how
human bodies decay when they turn into

730
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:04,450
corpses. You know, as, as he
begins to tell you this story,

731
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:08,380
you start picturing Peggy
sue as a rotting corpse.

732
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,010
Suddenly, you know, you don't really
feel like kissing her anymore.

733
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:16,090
It sort of like the digestive track
story. It's not that, as far as I can see,

734
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,240
the fact that she's going to be a corpse
gives you any reason not to kiss her.

735
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,100
It's just that thinking about the fact
that she's going to be a corpse causes

736
00:48:27,101 --> 00:48:31,990
you to not want to enjoy a case or
not be able to enjoy kissing her.

737
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:38,080
So I'm inclined to think that the right
position here is a kind of moderate one,

738
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:39,580
a modest one.

739
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,240
There are times and places for
thinking about the facts of death.

740
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,530
When you're kissing somebody
that is not the time,

741
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,150
and that is not the place,

742
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:58,260
the position that says you should always
have the fact of your mortality forever

743
00:48:59,171 --> 00:49:02,920
before your mind's eye.
I think that's misguided.

744
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,050
Similarly though,

745
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:10,350
anybody who says you should never think
about the facts of mortality in the

746
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:14,170
nature of death,
I think that's misguided as well.

747
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,960
There's a time and place,

748
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,190
but that still leaves us
with the question. All right,

749
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,710
so I suppose this is the time and place.
You know,

750
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:27,160
if ever there was a time and place for
thinking about the facts of death and how

751
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:30,580
to influence our life,
it's right now in a class on death.

752
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,280
So we still have to face the question,

753
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,980
how should you live?

754
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:41,070
What is the appropriate response
to the facts about life and death?

755
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:44,620
That's the question we
have to turn to next time.
