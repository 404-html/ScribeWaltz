1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,440
Last time we were discussing
the rationality of suicide.

2
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:08,520
We separated the question of the
rationality of suicide from the ethics of

3
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:09,031
suicide,

4
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:13,620
of the morality of suicide will be
turning to the morality of suicide later

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,880
today,
but the first question,

6
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:18,690
thinking about the rationality of suicide
was whether or not it could actually

7
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:23,100
be the case that somebody would be
better off dead. Having argued that,

8
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:25,740
at least on what struck me is
the more plausible theories.

9
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,090
That was a possibility.

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,610
We then turn to the question of under
what circumstances more particularly or

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,670
perhaps a better way to put it,

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,880
at what point would it be true that
suicide might be rational in tackling the

13
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:43,350
question? We were initially bracketing
the question about whether you could ever

14
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:48,090
reasonably or rationally judge that
the circumstances actually obtained.

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,220
We'll turn to that question a few minutes.

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,170
The question we were
focusing on originally,

17
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:55,800
it was just from the objective
perspective as it were.

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,320
What does the graph need to look like in
order for it to be the case that you'd

19
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:04,650
be better off dead and suicide
would be a rational choice?

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,600
I do a variety of different graphs and
different different lines about your life

21
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:13,020
doing better or worse and noted for
each one of them. At what point,

22
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:16,470
if ever suicide might
be a reasonable choice.

23
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,850
Why to draw a couple of more grafts
before handing this bit of the discussion.

24
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,050
So the, the easy your call, the axes, the,

25
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,410
the x axis represents time.

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,680
The y axis represents how good or bad
your life is overall taking into account

27
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:40,800
the value of being a life per se.
If you accept a valuable container theory,

28
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,600
the higher the line, the better your
life is at that time. The lower the line,

29
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,700
the worst your life is at that time.
Might say the easy cases,

30
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:54,660
at least from a philosophical point of
view, are ones where things get worse.

31
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,010
Eventually your life
becomes worse than nothing.

32
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:04,011
You'd be better off dead and it's going
to stay that way until such time as you

33
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:08,610
might die from natural causes
dying from natural causes.

34
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,320
In a situation like this,

35
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,190
killing yourself from here
on out would make sense.

36
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,810
Assuming you knew the facts could trust
your judgment and so forth and so on.

37
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:21,120
Some of the issues that will
come back to in a minute

38
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,330
and indeed as we saw,

39
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,530
there'll be even cases in which it might
make sense to kill yourself earlier if

40
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,270
this was the last chance at which you
had the ability to kill yourself or not,

41
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,840
even though you'd be giving up
some life that was worth living.

42
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,370
That was the only way to avoid a much
larger chunk of life that was not worth

43
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:44,940
living, so suicide might
makes sense. The other hand,

44
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:46,710
if the choice was way back here,

45
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,750
although this is killing yourself early
on would be the only way to avoid the

46
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,710
later chunk,

47
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:56,970
not worth living at least
if that chunks small enough.

48
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,310
I suppose it was like this,

49
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,780
we'd say doesn't make sense
to kill yourself this early.

50
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:08,530
It'd be throwing away too much even though
that's the only way to avoid the bad

51
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,330
stuff.
Now as you say,

52
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,290
that's the easy graph where you go from
a life worth living to a life not worth

53
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,490
living in stays there,

54
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,830
but to Paul's instead.
We have a situation like this

55
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,330
here, life becomes worse
than nothing for a while,

56
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,710
but you recover.

57
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,880
You're going to return to a life that's
worth having and suppose that you,

58
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:44,940
after you recover,
you'll have a very nice third stage,

59
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,110
third act of your life before you would
eventually die of natural causes or

60
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:49,944
natural death.

61
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,150
Here are the crucial point to make of
course is that even though for a while

62
00:03:57,151 --> 00:04:02,151
your life will be worse than
nothing negative overall.

63
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:07,460
It doesn't mean that it makes sense to
kill yourself at this point because of

64
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:11,910
course, although it's true that
if you do kill yourself here,

65
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,010
you're avoiding this negative chunk,
this bit below the x axis.

66
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,730
Doing that also throws away the very
large third act where your life returns to

67
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:25,230
being better than nothing.

68
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,150
Since the choices have
neither of these or both,

69
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,750
and the positive third act is great
enough to outweigh the negative second act

70
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,170
on bounced, it doesn't
make sense. But of course,

71
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,800
so even though your life might be
worse than nothing, for some stretch,

72
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,370
suicide wouldn't necessarily
be a rational decision,

73
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,440
but it's crucial in making that argument
that the what I've been calling the

74
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:54,480
third act,
here's one,

75
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,570
here's act to here's act three is crucial
in making this argument is that the

76
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:03,000
third act was sufficiently great,

77
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:08,001
sufficiently long and sufficiently high
that it outweighs the bad of the second

78
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:12,600
act. And although that's true,
the way I've drawn the graph,

79
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,470
we could imagine that it
wasn't quite like that.

80
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,850
Suppose that

81
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,750
after the second act in which
your life is not worth living,

82
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,500
you will recover and have
a third act in which life,

83
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:34,160
once again is good for you.
Overall.

84
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,790
Still at this point at three doesn't
outweigh act two although those are

85
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,120
recovery,
it's too short,

86
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,870
not high enough to outweigh
the bad of that too.

87
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,420
And so under that circumstance,
when you ask yourself,

88
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:54,080
let's say at this moment, you know,
would suicide here be rational?

89
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:58,070
The answer could well be yes.
Although killing yourself,

90
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:02,930
you've given up act three which would
be good for you overall doing that.

91
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,880
The only way to avoid act two,

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
which is bad for you overall
and sufficiently bad to
outweigh the good of act

93
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:14,840
three. So if you've got the
choice and suicide here,

94
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,930
it might well be
rational. Notice, however,

95
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,280
that's a crucial point again,

96
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,670
is when are we talking about the
possibility of committing suicide?

97
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,150
Committed suicide here might be rational,

98
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,870
but not necessarily indeed not
at all at this later moment

99
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,380
because at this point, the
fact that you've gone through
act two is now history.

100
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,270
There's nothing you can do about it.

101
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,420
You've had this horrible period
of your life and now it's over.

102
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,510
Your question is not can you avoid
act two it's too late for that.

103
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,520
You're a simple,
you're asking yourself,

104
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,990
what do I think about act three should
I avoid act three and that doesn't make

105
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:05,040
sense. We've stipulated that act
three is good for you overall,

106
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:13,030
so here suicide no longer makes sense
even though it would've made sense over

107
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:16,344
here.

108
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,550
The interesting point is that these
possibilities and our mirror theoretical

109
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:25,100
possibilities but actually can happen.

110
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,850
There's a famous case of in the,

111
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,860
in the bioethics literature of somebody
who suffered a horrible set of burns

112
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,880
over great deal of their body
and had to go through a period,

113
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:45,040
a very long period of recovery
in which they were hospitalized,

114
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:50,041
basically immobilized and in a great deal
of pain while their nerves regenerate

115
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,900
it and their skin we graft and the like.

116
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,970
And early on in that period,
this person said,

117
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,440
although he believed that
he eventually recover

118
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,050
what he was going to have to go through
was so horrible that he wished he were

119
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:11,980
dead because of the nature
of his hospitalization.

120
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:14,400
He wasn't able to kill himself.

121
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,840
He asked that he be killed and people
refused and he went through a period and

122
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:23,640
sure enough, he recovered and
eventually he said, yes, no,

123
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,370
my life is worth living again.
And of course,

124
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,260
since it is worth living,
now that I'm able to kill myself,

125
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:36,261
it no longer makes sense for me to kill
myself because here I am as he might put

126
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:40,870
it in act three with the life
we're living. But for all of that,

127
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,840
even though I now have
a life worth living,

128
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,960
I haven't changed my opinion.

129
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,890
That would have been
better for me back here.

130
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,030
It's toward the beginning of act two
for me to have been killed or for me to

131
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,883
have died.

132
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,580
It remains the case that I wish I had
died here so as to avoid all the pain and

133
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:06,750
suffering even though I'm now in
a period which is better for me.

134
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,210
Good for me overall. All
right. One other case,

135
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,160
this is just repeating a point
that actually made very early on.

136
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,563
Okay.

137
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,360
In all of these cases where I've
argued for the rationality of suicide,

138
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:31,190
it's because of then surely the
line his dipped below the x axis.

139
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,340
The crucial point to remember is

140
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,540
even if your situation deteriorates
and indeed doesn't recover,

141
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,860
that still doesn't make suicide rational.

142
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,490
The question is not am I worse off than
I had been or then I might have been had

143
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:57,000
I not had the decline?

144
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,720
The question and thinking about
the rationality of suicide is,

145
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,250
am I so badly off that
I'm better off dead?

146
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,600
And if your life is a sufficiently
rich and valuable one,

147
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,550
there's a great deal
of room for going down,

148
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,790
having a worse life while still ending
up at a life better than nothing.

149
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:20,941
And in that case,

150
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:25,590
of course suicide's not
rational at all still,

151
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,360
it does seem to me that there are cases
in which the line does cut below the x

152
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:36,270
axis and remained there for
a sufficiently long time.

153
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:40,500
Perhaps remain there forever so
that the person is better off dead.

154
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,750
And so we might say
from that point of you,

155
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:47,751
if only the person could recognize the
facts and know for a certainty that's

156
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:52,800
what their line was going to look like,

157
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,710
suicide would at certain
points be rational

158
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,193
still.

159
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,990
That means we need to turn to
the second part of the question.

160
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,620
Somebody who believes suicide,

161
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,710
it cannot be rational, might say, look,

162
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:16,300
the whole game is in the
phrase I just used. Sure.

163
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,930
There are situations in which
if only you knew the facts,

164
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,000
if only you had a crystal ball.

165
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,470
And knew for a certainty this is what my
life is going to go on from here on out.

166
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,480
Then suicide would be rational, but of
course we never have a crystal ball.

167
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,990
We never have the guarantee that
this is how the line's going to go.

168
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:44,190
The question we need to turn to now is
could it be rational for you to judge

169
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,240
that your situation is one in which the
line's going to go below unstable or

170
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:56,320
stable long enough so that
unbalanced you'd be better off dead.

171
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,740
Let's suppose that somebody situation
is like that or at least the can be

172
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:04,600
situations like that.

173
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,750
Could it ever be reasonable to judge that
your situation is like that and if so,

174
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:16,240
could it ever then be reasonable to
act on that judgment and end your life?

175
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,850
We still bracketing questions
about morality here.

176
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:22,150
We're still looking at things from
the personal, rational perspective

177
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,860
and once again, what I want to do
next is distinguished two questions.

178
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:30,790
They want to distinguish between questions
about what should we say if you were

179
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:35,791
thinking clearly versus what should
we say if you're thinking is clouded.

180
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,890
Again,
one might think,

181
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:43,690
look in the type of cases where
suicide might be rationally warranted,

182
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,710
it's going to be so stressful that
nobody can think clearly in the middle of

183
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:52,711
that situation and so even if it were
true that you could reasonably decide to

184
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:56,680
commit suicide, if only you
weren't thinking clearly,
nobody does think clearly.

185
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,510
Let's come back to that worry in a moment.

186
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,900
Let's assume for the moment that you
can think clearly about your situation.

187
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,580
Perhaps you've got some
sort of painful disease,

188
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:10,030
but the disease is not painful constantly.

189
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,500
There are periods in which it comes to
an end brief periods in which you're able

190
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:18,010
to assess your situation,
weigh up the facts.

191
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,930
Could it ever be rational in that
situation to decide to kill yourself?

192
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,873
Well,

193
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,420
as they say, we don't have a crystal
ball. If he did have a crystal ball,

194
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:34,421
if you knew for a certainty that your
line was so bad that it was below zero and

195
00:13:35,211 --> 00:13:37,460
wasn't going to recover,
perhaps we'd say, yeah,

196
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:39,440
in that case it would be
rational to commit suicide,

197
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,690
but we don't have a crystal ball.
What should we say?

198
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:46,691
Then the critics of suicide
might come back and say,

199
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,400
well, look, since you
don't have a crystal ball,

200
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:52,490
since you never know for
sure that you won't recover,

201
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,360
since there's always a
possibility of recovery,

202
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,300
suicide never makes sense.
After all,

203
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,770
we all know that there is
constant progress in in medicine.

204
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,120
People are always making breakthroughs
and what seems like an incurable disease

205
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:11,270
one day may have some
sort of cure the next,

206
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,880
but if you've killed yourself,

207
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,110
you've thrown away any
chance of getting that cure,

208
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,740
and even if medical
cures don't come around,

209
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:23,990
okay,

210
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,280
various diseases sometimes simply
have miraculous remissions.

211
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:34,430
Somebody might just get
better spontaneously.
That's always a possibility.

212
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:37,730
It doesn't happen very often, but it
does happen now. And then and again,

213
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,380
if you've killed yourself,
you've thrown away any chance of recovery.

214
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,230
So the critics of suicide might say,
given that there's a chance,

215
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,320
however small of recovery,

216
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,670
whether through medical progress or
just some sort of medical miracle,

217
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:56,760
okay,

218
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,020
but of course if you kill yourself,

219
00:14:58,021 --> 00:15:03,021
there's no chance of recovery given
that it doesn't make any sense.

220
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:06,150
It can't make sense
rationally to kill yourself.

221
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,660
That sort of position gets
articulated now and again,

222
00:15:09,661 --> 00:15:11,790
but I think it's got to be mistaken.

223
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,970
It's true that we don't
have a crystal ball.

224
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:17,880
And so in deciding
whether to kill yourself,

225
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:22,590
what you're doing is playing the odds.
You're gambling.

226
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,010
But still gambling is something
we do all the time. Indeed,

227
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,330
there is no getting away from the
fact that in the suicide case,

228
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:35,430
in the case of some
terminally ill patient,

229
00:15:35,431 --> 00:15:37,950
or at least somebody who
appears to be terminally ill,

230
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:43,130
there is no getting away from the fact
that regardless of what decision he or

231
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:47,910
she makes, they are gambling, gambling,

232
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:48,271
playing.

233
00:15:48,271 --> 00:15:53,271
The odds just is one of the facts
of life about how we have to decide.

234
00:15:54,271 --> 00:15:58,230
We have to make our
decisions under uncertainty.

235
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,310
That's suppose somebody says, well, look,

236
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,230
since we agree that we're
deciding under uncertainty,

237
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:08,430
it doesn't make sense to throw
away the small chance of recovery,

238
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,750
and then I want to say that doesn't seem
to be in keeping with the rules that we

239
00:16:12,751 --> 00:16:17,040
would normally use in
deciding how to face a gamble.

240
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,810
The back of this room,
there are two doors,

241
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,340
so let's talk a little fantasy science
fiction story about the two doors.

242
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:27,450
After class is over,

243
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,050
you're going to have to decide which
one of these doors to go through.

244
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,910
Let's suppose,

245
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,360
okay

246
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,820
that if you go through door one,

247
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:42,540
it's virtually guaranteed that what will
happen is you'll be kidnapped and your

248
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:48,301
kidnappers will then torture you for
a week after which perhaps you'll be

249
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,374
released

250
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,450
virtually certain 90% certain 99% certain,

251
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,330
perhaps 99.9% certain.

252
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:03,450
There's a small chance one in 1,001 in
10,000 that you won't be kidnapped and

253
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,550
tortured.
Instead,

254
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,390
you'll be whisked away to a
wonderful tropical vacation. Well,

255
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:12,700
you'll have a fantastic time for a week.

256
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,140
Not very likely,
but not impossible.

257
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,230
One of the thousand one
in 10,000 maybe less.

258
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,280
That's if you go through door one door
one has 99.99 chance of a week of torture

259
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,820
and a 0.01 or zero zero one whatever
it is per cent chance of wonderful

260
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:35,170
vacation.
If it had,

261
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:40,171
if you go through door number 200%
certainty that the following is going to

262
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:46,300
happen,
you will immediately fall asleep.

263
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,510
You'll be in a deep dreamless for the
week. At which point you'll wake up

264
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,480
well, what should you
do? What should you pick?

265
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,650
It's not quite certainty of being
tortured versus certainty of sleeping.

266
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:07,320
If it was certainty of being tortured
versus certainty or sleeping,

267
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,990
I suppose we'd all agree.

268
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,590
The thing to do is to go
through door number two sleeps.

269
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,420
Nothing positive, but on the
other hand it's nothing negative.

270
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:19,250
I suppose if we were going
to slap a number on it,

271
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:21,440
we'd give it a zero but torture.

272
00:18:21,441 --> 00:18:25,130
It's clearly a negative and
if it's a week of torture,

273
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,620
it's a very large negative,

274
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,960
so it's zero versus some huge negative
number. Certainty versus certainty.

275
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,700
What should you pick?
We'd all agree.

276
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:39,701
I presume you should pick door number
two and pick the dreamless sleep for a

277
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,020
week.
Now we remember all by weight,

278
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:45,740
but it wasn't a surgeon that you were
going to be tortured. It was just very,

279
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,660
very, very likely that you are going to
be tortured and imagine somebody says,

280
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:55,550
Oh, you must go for the
gold. Go for door number one.

281
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,730
Sure. It's overwhelmingly likely
that you're going to be tortured,

282
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,470
but those are very small chance that
you'll get this wonderful vacation.

283
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:07,280
Whereas if you pick door number two,
you're throwing that chance away.

284
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,760
And so the only rational decision
must be to pick door number one,

285
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,750
hold out for that chance no matter how
small of getting that fantastic vacation.

286
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,340
That's the only rational decision.
If anybody were to say that,

287
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:28,580
I'd laugh at them. I'd say,
look, if you want to talk about,

288
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:30,830
well maybe there's room for choice.
Either way.

289
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,320
It depends how great the vacation
is. Something like that. Yeah,

290
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:34,400
there's maybe room for talk.

291
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:39,490
But if you want to insist that the only
rational decision must be to hold out

292
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:44,780
for the chance of a wonderful vacation,
no matter how small,

293
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:49,781
the odds given that if you don't
get that wonderful vacation,

294
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:52,220
you're going to be tortured.

295
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,730
And you could avoid all that
by picking the sleep option.

296
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,750
If somebody insisted in
the face of all that,

297
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,300
that the only rational decision
is to go through the door,

298
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:06,170
which is likely to be torture and a
vanishingly small chance of vacation,

299
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,270
I'd say they are just wrong.

300
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,600
That's not a rationally required
decision given the odds.

301
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,783
Yes.
Question

302
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,853
bias,

303
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,850
it's not a temporary state doesn't last

304
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,700
forever,
so it makes more sense for you.

305
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:37,340
But we actually choose what's your,

306
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,553
um,

307
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,550
great. So, so the question was
this, so the, the, the quiet,

308
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:48,400
the point was perhaps I'm cheating in
making the example this way because death

309
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:52,150
of course isn't of course what you're
all supposed to be lulled into.

310
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,890
Thinking is that death,
choosing death,

311
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:56,050
choosing suicide is sort of
like choosing to be asleep.

312
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,960
I stayed in dreamless sleep,
but sleep nonetheless.

313
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,790
And the suggestion that was I'm
cheating because death is forever.

314
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:09,180
I deliberately framed the example in
terms of being tortured for a week versus

315
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,170
being asleep for a week and
perhaps given that choice,

316
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,200
it's clearly rationally acceptable to
decide that you'd rather pick the sleep

317
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:23,500
for a week option,
but death isn't just for a week.

318
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,020
If you commit suicide,
you're dead forever.

319
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,140
So let's change the example.
Suppose that you know you guys are mostly,

320
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:36,970
I suppose in the vicinity of 20 suppose
that if you go through door number one,

321
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:42,260
there's overwhelmingly likely chance
90% 99% 99.9% chance that you'll be

322
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:49,711
kidnapped and tortured and the torture
will take place and last for another 50

323
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,850
60 70 years and then you die.

324
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,470
There's a slight chance
a 10th of a percent,

325
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:04,570
a hundred of a percent that no, no, you
won't be tortured for the 50 60 70 years,

326
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,020
but instead you'll be brought to
this tropical island paradise.

327
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:10,210
We will have this great
time for the next 50 years.

328
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:16,050
But what has happened in 99 out of 100
cases or 109 hundred 99 out of a thousand

329
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:23,281
cases or 9,999 out of 10,000
cases is the torture scenario.

330
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,270
While the people are being tortured,
they beg for mercy,

331
00:22:28,271 --> 00:22:30,940
they begged to be put to death.
They wish they were dead.

332
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:35,590
It is truly the case that the tortures
are so bad that these people are better

333
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:37,120
off dead.
Remember,

334
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:40,720
we're assuming that we've got a case
where you really will be better off dead

335
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:44,530
and less than miraculous recovery
takes place. And so again,

336
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:49,531
we have to ask in a situation like that
where the person says if you and I,

337
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,970
and similarly of course if you
go through door number two,

338
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,300
you immediately fall asleep and you stay
that way for the next 70 years and then

339
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:57,400
you die while in your coma.

340
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,040
The fan of door number one comes along
and insists the only rational decision is

341
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:11,341
to pick door number one
where it's overwhelmingly
likely that you face 50 years

342
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:16,900
or 60 years or 70 years of torture
because of course if you were to pick door

343
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:17,590
number two,

344
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,950
you're throwing away your chance no
matter how small you're throwing away,

345
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:24,070
the only chance you have of
the wonderful vacation, well,

346
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,300
each of us has to decide for themselves.
But when I think about this case,

347
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,590
this modified case,

348
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,740
I still want to say choosing door
number two could perfectly be,

349
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:40,570
it could be a perfectly rational decision.
It's just not right to say.

350
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:45,290
The only rational decision
is door number one.

351
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,050
Yeah.

352
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,500
Again,

353
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,300
somebody wanted to take a more modest
position and say it depends on how great

354
00:23:52,301 --> 00:23:55,900
the vacation would be,
how mild the torture would be.

355
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,890
Maybe 1% chances versus a 5% chance.

356
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:05,010
There's room for debate about when might
the the balance come closer to even.

357
00:24:05,441 --> 00:24:09,880
So it would be reasonable to take the
chance. Yeah, there's room for debate,

358
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,200
but if it, chances are small enough
and the person insists nonetheless,

359
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,330
no matter how small the chances are,

360
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,170
it could never be rational
to pick door number two.

361
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:25,240
I can only say that doesn't seem to be
the way we would normally think about

362
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,380
making choices,

363
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,880
and of course at this point you can see
how the argument exactly carries over to

364
00:24:30,881 --> 00:24:32,770
suicide.
If you kill yourself,

365
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,550
you're throwing away forever
any chance of recovery,

366
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,640
and that's important and
that's worth thinking about.

367
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:44,560
But it's also important to think
about what was the chance of recovery,

368
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,720
how large or more to the point,

369
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:51,930
just how small and how badly off will
you be if you don't commit to aside,

370
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,500
you guys are 20 but of course these sorts
of choices also perhaps get faced by

371
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:01,240
people who are considerably older.

372
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,710
I now in the final stages
of some progressive disease,

373
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,920
the doctors told them perhaps there's
70 that there's no significant chance of

374
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:13,630
recovery.
Sometimes it happens,

375
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:18,460
but no more than one in a hundred or
one in a thousand but if you continue

376
00:25:18,461 --> 00:25:23,410
alive, you will be in,
well, perhaps great pain.

377
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:28,420
Perhaps unable to do the various things
that give your life meaning and value.

378
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,130
Could it be true that it
would never be rational,

379
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,730
provided that you're thinking
clearly, never rational to say, look,

380
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,940
the chances of something negative are
so overwhelmingly great that even though

381
00:25:45,571 --> 00:25:50,550
deciding for death throws away whatever
small chance I've got of recovery,

382
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,360
the chance of recovery is
so small that I'm balanced.

383
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:59,420
It's reasonable to throw that chance
away and avoid the overwhelmingly likely

384
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:05,390
possibility that I'll continue
in my current state with
a life not worth living.

385
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,890
Seems to me that you're thinking clearly
there could be cases in which suicide

386
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,170
would be a rational choice.

387
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:14,900
Yeah,

388
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,840
but that still leaves us
with the question, well,

389
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,030
maybe that's where all
the work needs to be done.

390
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:22,550
What about this point
about thinking clearly?

391
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:27,970
Even if we grant for the sake of argument
that there could be cases in which the

392
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:33,131
person's life is so bad that they
actually are better off dead and they stay

393
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:37,030
that way.
Even if we grant that,

394
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:39,970
if only somebody were thinking clearly,

395
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,030
they would see that that was
so likely to be the case,

396
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,440
that suicide would be a
rational or reasonable choice.

397
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,810
Still,

398
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,400
isn't it plausible to think that in real
life people can't think clearly about

399
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,530
their situation when they're
in situations like that? Okay.

400
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,510
It's one thing for us to be
sitting here in this classroom.

401
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,321
Well,

402
00:27:08,321 --> 00:27:13,321
I certainly hope that none of you
are in this kind of situation.

403
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:19,780
It's easy for us to be
sitting here thinking clearly
about it and recognize the

404
00:27:19,781 --> 00:27:24,781
philosophical possibility of thinking
clearly about a case and realizing that it

405
00:27:26,141 --> 00:27:29,500
was a rational decision to
end it and end your life,

406
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,120
but people who are actually
in those situations in point
of fact are not able to

407
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,140
think clearly because just think about it.

408
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:46,470
What would have to be true of you for
your life to be so bad that suicide might

409
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:50,620
be a rational choice?
That you'd be better off dead?

410
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,100
Yeah.

411
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,090
Odds are you've got to be in
some indeed more than just some.

412
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,700
You've got to be in a great deal of pain.

413
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:04,010
Probably a great deal of physical pain.
Beyond that,

414
00:28:04,011 --> 00:28:09,011
you probably also need to be incapacitated
in a certain large number of ways so

415
00:28:11,061 --> 00:28:12,440
that perhaps you're bedridden.

416
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,690
Can't enjoy discussions with your family,

417
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,610
can't read poetry or watch
television or whatever it is,

418
00:28:22,611 --> 00:28:27,200
a life watching television may not be as
fantastic as the like that you all are

419
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:28,160
able to have,

420
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,960
but it might still be better than
nothing to imagine a life so bad.

421
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,840
It's going to have to have so much
physical disability that the amount of

422
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:43,520
emotional distress is going
to have to be so overwhelming.

423
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,780
How could anybody think clearly
in a situation like that?

424
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,710
Okay,

425
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,340
and then the argument might go,
he can't think clearly.

426
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,940
You can't rationally decide
to trust the judgement.

427
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:04,200
You might make that you're in a situation
where suicide is a reasonable choice.

428
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,540
You might make the judgment,

429
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:12,930
but if we ask ourselves,
should you trust your opinion,

430
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,690
the odds are so the argument goes,
no, you shouldn't trust your opinion.

431
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,840
Precisely because anybody for whom
it would be true would have to be so

432
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:28,560
emotionally distressed that they're not
able to think clearly if they're not

433
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:29,880
able to think clearly.

434
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,810
They can't have a judgment
that's trustworthy.

435
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,960
The judgments not trustworthy,
you shouldn't trust it.

436
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:42,620
And so suicide could never turn out
to be a rational opinion after all.

437
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,260
Well,
that's an interesting argument.

438
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:48,370
I think it's an argument more worth taking
seriously. And some of the other ones,

439
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,750
some of the early objections we've
had against suicide, but even here,

440
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:53,950
I'm not convinced.

441
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:59,460
Let's again try to think of a case not
quite like suicide and ask ourselves,

442
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:05,790
can't there be cases where despite the
fact that you're thinking is clouded,

443
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,040
it's still reasonable to
trust the decisions that you
make within your cloud or

444
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:12,460
thinking?

445
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:17,460
Suppose you've got some
disease that causes you a
great deal of incapacity and a

446
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:21,910
great deal of pain,
but as it happens,

447
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,220
there's a cure,

448
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,850
or at least there's a surgical procedure
that can be done and the surgical

449
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:30,880
procedure is almost always successful.

450
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,410
So what are the choices?
Choice number one,

451
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,990
continue in your current state.

452
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,190
You've got some horrible painful disease

453
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,290
and it won't get better
unless you have the surgery.

454
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,970
If you do have the surgery, it's very,
very likely that it will get better.

455
00:30:55,090 --> 00:31:00,090
99 cases out of a hundred the surgery
works or 99.9 cases out of 100 there's

456
00:31:00,981 --> 00:31:05,981
surgery works are 99.99 cases out
of a hundred the surgery works,

457
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,160
of course, like all
surgery, there are risks.

458
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,000
Sometimes you put the person under
anesthesia and they don't wake up.

459
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,140
Doesn't happen very often. One in 1,001
in 10,001 in 100,000 whatever it is,

460
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:22,030
there's some chance to surgery won't work
and you'll die on the operating table,

461
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,090
but it's very,
very small chance.

462
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:31,060
Overwhelmingly likely the surgery will
succeed and if it does succeed, oh,

463
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,660
you'll be recovered. That's option
number one. Option number two,

464
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,720
you continue in your current state,

465
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,590
incapacitated or unable
to lead a valuable life,

466
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,460
suffering full of pain.
Well,

467
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:50,180
that's overwhelmingly likely
one in a thousand cases,

468
00:31:50,181 --> 00:31:52,010
there's some sort of natural cure.

469
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,190
Maybe one in 10,000 cases
there's a natural cure,

470
00:31:55,370 --> 00:32:00,370
but in 999 out of a thousand cases
or 9,999 out of 10,000 cases,

471
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,360
the disease just continues
until till you die.

472
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:09,200
Some years down the road
there's your choice.

473
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,730
Should you have this surgery or not?

474
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,600
I suppose what we think is of
course you should have this surgery.

475
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,400
You'd be a fool not to have the surgery.

476
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:21,170
It's overwhelmingly likely going
to cure you, but now we worry,

477
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:22,004
wait a minute,

478
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:27,130
can you trust that judgment after all
the condition you are in is so stressful,

479
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:32,801
so painful that you are obviously Neary
emotionally worked up and any judgment

480
00:32:33,561 --> 00:32:36,860
that you make that it's a
reasonable decision to have.

481
00:32:36,861 --> 00:32:38,570
The surgery is a judgment.

482
00:32:38,571 --> 00:32:42,560
You're while under the
cloud of emotional distress,

483
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,990
how can you possibly trust that judgment?

484
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,120
And so you shouldn't trust the judgment.

485
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,420
The argument goes and so you must never
agree to the surgery in this situation,

486
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,420
but that can't be right.

487
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:56,640
Yeah,

488
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,640
surely we agree and it couldn't be
reasonable to trust your judgment in this

489
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:03,594
situation.

490
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,940
Now to be sure the fact that you are in
all this pain shouldn't make you pause,

491
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,240
should make you hesitate,

492
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:20,450
should make you think twice and then
think again before deciding what to do.

493
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,120
But still, if somebody says,
since you're so worked up,

494
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:31,990
it could never be rational to
decide to have the surgery.

495
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:37,030
That just seems to be going too far.
It doesn't make sense.

496
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,270
You got to make some kind of decision.

497
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:45,510
Deciding not to have the surgery is still
making a kind of decision and either

498
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:51,391
decision then is a judgment that you're
going to be making wild worked up while

499
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:55,090
stressed while under the
cloud of pain and suffering.

500
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,830
So think twice.
Think third time.

501
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,280
Get the opinions of others perhaps.
But still,

502
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:08,350
if somebody says it could never be
rational to decide to have the surgery and

503
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:11,950
then act on that decision,
they're just wrong.

504
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,950
Well now let's come back
to the suicide case.

505
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,730
Same kinds of odds just reversed.

506
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,060
If you don't decide to commit suicide,

507
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:27,061
we are imagining that it's overwhelmingly
likely you'll continue in suffering.

508
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:32,080
Some slight chance that you'll recover,
but overwhelmingly likely you'll can,

509
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,910
can continue in suffering.

510
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,310
Whereas if you do kill yourself,
it's overwhelmingly likely,

511
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,370
perhaps even guaranteed your software,
you will come to an end

512
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,650
only chanted it won't is if you think
there's some chance of an afterlife.

513
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,070
Well,

514
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,320
should we be swayed by the argument at
this point that since you are suffering,

515
00:34:56,321 --> 00:35:00,640
your judgment is cloudy and so you
should not trust your judgment?

516
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,730
Well,
that can't be a good argument.

517
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,000
If it wasn't a good argument
in the surgery case,

518
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:12,070
I can't see how it could suddenly become
a good argument in the suicide case.

519
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,920
What does seem writers,

520
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:19,050
precisely because you're working and
deciding under the cloud of emotional

521
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:25,471
stress and pain that you should think
twice and think a third time and perhaps

522
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:30,100
think yet again, you should not
make this decision in haste.

523
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,190
You should discuss it with your doctors.

524
00:35:33,191 --> 00:35:37,920
You should discuss it with
your loved ones, but if says,

525
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,040
you could never reasonably trust the
judgment that you make while in the

526
00:35:44,111 --> 00:35:45,270
circumstances,

527
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,720
I can only say that doesn't seem
like a sound piece of advice.

528
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,400
That claim doesn't seem right to me.

529
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,340
I conclude therefore,

530
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
that as long as we're focused on the
question of the rationality of suicide,

531
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,260
ethics aside,

532
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:08,880
the rationality of suicide
under certain circumstances,

533
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:13,320
suicide could be rationally justified.

534
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:18,630
You could have a life that
is worse than nothing.

535
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,460
You could have good reason to
believe you were in that situation.

536
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,760
You could either be thinking clearly
about your situation or even if your

537
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,370
judgment is clouded and difficult,

538
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:37,320
you could still find the odd sufficiently
great that it was a reasonable to

539
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:39,870
eventually trust your judgment.

540
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,760
The rationality of suicide
I think is secured,

541
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,250
but for all that,
of course it could still be immoral.

542
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,640
There couldn't be actions that
are rationally legitimate,

543
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,810
but for all that morally illegitimate.
As I mentioned previously,

544
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:05,040
there's a big debate in philosophy as
to whether or not these two things can

545
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,820
really come apart or not.
Arguably,

546
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,940
reason actually requires you to obey
morality and and so even if something's in

547
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:19,410
your self interest, perhaps it's not
rational to do it if it's immoral.

548
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,760
Interesting question.

549
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,910
Let's just bracket that question and just
focus directly on the question now of

550
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:31,380
morality. What should we say
about the morality of suicide?

551
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:35,940
Rationality aside, what should we
say about the morality of suicide?

552
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,410
Well,
to really do justice to this question,

553
00:37:40,411 --> 00:37:45,411
of course we would need to have an
entire theory of morality lay down and

554
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:52,980
unsurprisingly I don't have time
to do that for us. You know,

555
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,630
entire class on introduction to ethics
where we try to lay down a basic

556
00:37:57,631 --> 00:37:59,580
fundamental theory about morality.

557
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:04,320
All we've got left as a couple of
minutes today and then one more lecture.

558
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:09,710
So instead what I want to do is first
mentioned some quick and dirty arguments

559
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:15,381
that had a kind of moral tinge to them
and then turn to some somewhat more

560
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:20,781
systematic arguments where I'll quickly
put in place some basic elements of a

561
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:25,230
plausible moral theory. We won't
have time to explore them in detail,

562
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,670
but at least we'll get a shape of a basic
moral theory and see what it might say

563
00:38:29,671 --> 00:38:33,480
about suicide.
So systematic a little bit later.

564
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,430
First some quick and dirty arguments,

565
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,730
whether we should call it a moral
argument. The first one or not,

566
00:38:40,731 --> 00:38:41,660
I'm not quite certain,

567
00:38:41,661 --> 00:38:46,661
but it's certainly an argument that
gets stated all the time in this area.

568
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,380
When we think about the
legitimacy of suicide,

569
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:52,880
yeah,

570
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,550
it's common enough to have the reaction.

571
00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:00,590
Suicide is illegitimate because
it's thwarting gods will.

572
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,840
Maybe this isn't so much a moral argument
as a theological argument and for the

573
00:39:05,841 --> 00:39:09,040
most part of course,
as you know in this class I've avoided,

574
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,470
okay.

575
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:14,100
At least some theological questions is
obviously question about the existence of

576
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,140
a soul as itself.
I feel logical argument,

577
00:39:16,141 --> 00:39:19,650
but I've tried to discuss them as far as
possible without bringing in questions

578
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:22,080
about God.
God's existence in God's will,

579
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:27,720
but the topics almost unavoidable.
When we think about suicide,

580
00:39:27,721 --> 00:39:29,700
given the prevalence of the thought,

581
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,940
it's God's will that we stay alive and
so it's going against God's will to kill

582
00:39:36,511 --> 00:39:37,344
ourselves.

583
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,041
Well,

584
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:47,041
I think the best response to this argument
was given by David Hume some several

585
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:53,790
centuries ago, two and a half
centuries ago were Hume says, look,

586
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,030
yeah,

587
00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,030
if all we've got to go on is just the
idea of a creator who has built us and

588
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:01,990
given us life,

589
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:07,030
we can't infer that suicide
is against God's will.

590
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:11,950
At least if you found that
thought a compelling one,

591
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,700
then why wouldn't you also
find it compelling to say
it goes against God's will

592
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,040
when you saved somebody's life is a point
that close to one I've raised before.

593
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,531
You're,

594
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:27,670
you're walking along chapel street and
you're the person you're talking to.

595
00:40:27,671 --> 00:40:31,540
You see he's about to be hit by a car,
so you push them out of the way.

596
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,620
Previously when we talked
about this question,

597
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:37,650
the question was whether or not
they should be grateful to you.

598
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:41,940
Now the question is whether or not they
should complain. How dare you do that?

599
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,490
You've sorted God's will.

600
00:40:44,491 --> 00:40:48,270
It was God's will that
I be hit by that truck.

601
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,800
So when we're about to
save somebody's life,

602
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:57,030
should we decide not to do that on the
grounds that it must be God's will,

603
00:40:57,031 --> 00:41:01,860
that they're going to die if you're a
doctor and somebody in cardiac arrest and

604
00:41:01,861 --> 00:41:06,861
you could now perform CPR or whatever
it is in order to get their heart going

605
00:41:07,771 --> 00:41:10,890
again. Shouldn't we say as a
doctor, oh no, I must not do that.

606
00:41:10,891 --> 00:41:14,490
It's God's will that they die
if I try to save their life,

607
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:18,180
I'm forwarding God's will.
Well, nobody says that,

608
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:26,460
but then
why is the argument any better?

609
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:29,490
In the case of suicide,
we could of course,

610
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,310
imagine you know when,
when you're,

611
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,690
when you've saved your friend's life and
he says, Oh, you forward and God's will.

612
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,420
What? You might come back
and say, oh no, no. You see,

613
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,270
it was God's will that I save your life.

614
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:42,500
Yeah.

615
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,400
And so it was God's will that you be in
this situation where the truck was going

616
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:49,880
to hit you unless I saved you. But it was
also God's will that I save your life.

617
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:51,800
And maybe the doctors should
say something similar,

618
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,780
not an implausible thing to say,

619
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,410
but given that that's not
an implausible thing to say.

620
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,320
Why not say the same thing about suicide?

621
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,890
It was God's will that I be in
this situation and then God's will.

622
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:05,150
Did I kill myself

623
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:11,710
absent any special
instruction manual from God?

624
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,030
The gods will argument cuts both ways,

625
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,150
which is to say it doesn't
give us any guidance.

626
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,960
We don't know whether it's God's
will that we act or God's will,

627
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:29,961
that we don't act absent an
instruction manual from God,

628
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,560
so we can't conclude that suicide is
obviously wrong because it violates God's

629
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:41,060
will. Well, unless you've
got an instruction manual,

630
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,270
you might think, for
example, that you know,

631
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:47,720
the Bible tells us not to commit suicide,

632
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,430
and since the Bible is God's word,

633
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,330
we must do whatever the Bible tells us.

634
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,340
That's a kind of argument that I'm
perfectly prepared to engage in.

635
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:02,600
Although of course there's a lot of
assumptions behind that argument that we

636
00:43:02,601 --> 00:43:06,250
would need to really examine.
Yep. Is there a god? Well, the,

637
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,420
obviously we needed that one
even for the gods will argument.

638
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:13,100
Has God expressed his will in a book?
If so,

639
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,690
what book is it?

640
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,300
Do we have more reason to obey God?
Also relevant for the gods will argument,

641
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:25,040
and of course if we do think we have
an obligation to obey this instruction

642
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:26,090
manual,

643
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,740
are we really prepared to
obey this instruction manual?

644
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:33,740
Even if there's a sentence in
this instruction manual that says,

645
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:37,070
don't commit suicide?
A lot of other things,

646
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:42,100
the instruction manual also says that
most of us are not inclined to do.

647
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,350
Instruction. Manual says
not to eat pork. Oh,

648
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:53,380
how many of you are not
willing to eat pork?

649
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:58,530
The instruction manual tells you not to
mix various kinds of material together

650
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:03,850
in a single item of clothing. How many
of you think that that's unacceptable?

651
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,890
The instruction manual tells you that
if a teenager is rude to their parents,

652
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:10,540
they shouldn't be stoned to death.

653
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:13,390
How many of you think that
that's a moral requirement?

654
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:18,160
If you're going to pick and choose
which bits of the instruction manual you

655
00:44:18,161 --> 00:44:21,970
actually think are morally irrelevant,
then you can't come to me and say, oh,

656
00:44:21,971 --> 00:44:25,900
suicide is wrong because the
instruction manual says so.

657
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,010
You're not really using the instruction
manual to give you moral guidance.

658
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,050
You're starting with your moral beliefs
and then picking and choosing which bits

659
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:38,580
of the instruction manual you want to
accept. Well, that's a big question.

660
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,670
That's a big topic and so
having just touched on it,

661
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:46,590
I'm going to have to put it aside.
Instruction manual aside,

662
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,450
at the very least we might say,

663
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:53,540
appeal to God's will can help us to decide
whether or not suicide is legitimate

664
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,413
or not.

665
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,620
There's a different quick
and dirty argument also,

666
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:00,660
it can be run in a theological forum,

667
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:05,780
but it need not be run that way
and that has to do with gratitude.

668
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:11,970
We've been given life on.
Life's pretty amazing,

669
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,810
and so we have an obligation,

670
00:45:15,811 --> 00:45:20,811
a debt of gratitude to keep the gift.

671
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,953
Now,
look,

672
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,150
gratitude is not one of the moral virtues
that gets a lot of discussion nowadays.

673
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:32,160
It's fallen on rather hard times,
but I see no reason to dismiss it.

674
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,400
It does seem to me there's such a thing
as a debt of gratitude is someone does

675
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:41,880
you a favor,
you owe them something,

676
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:46,290
you owe them a debt of gratitude. And
so the argument might then go, look,

677
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:52,250
either God gave us life or nature gave
us life or our parents gave us life.

678
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,660
Whatever it was.

679
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:59,780
We owe a debt of gratitude for
this wonderful gift and as such,

680
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:03,090
how do you repay the debt?

681
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:08,490
You repay the debt by keeping the gift.

682
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:12,450
If you kill yourself,

683
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:17,630
you're rejecting the gift that's being
ungrateful and in gratitude is immoral.

684
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,950
It's wrong,
and that's why suicides suicide is wrong.

685
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,520
That's the second quick
and dirty argument.

686
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,880
Perhaps it won't surprise you that I
don't find this second argument persuasive

687
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:37,990
either. Not because I'm skeptical
about debts of gratitude,

688
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:43,500
but I want us to pay attention to what
exactly obligations of gratitude require

689
00:46:43,961 --> 00:46:45,610
us to do.
In particular,

690
00:46:45,611 --> 00:46:50,110
it's important to bear in mind that you
owe the person who gives you a gift,

691
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:55,320
something only when what he's given
you or she's giving you is a gift.

692
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,153
Okay?

693
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:02,600
Imagine that somebody,
I'll call him the bully,

694
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,590
gives you a pie and says,
eat it.

695
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,510
It's not an apple pie.
It's not a cherry pie.

696
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,090
It's some Gross,

697
00:47:14,091 --> 00:47:16,760
disgusting slicing Pie,

698
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,520
some rotting slime pie.

699
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:23,120
And he cuts out a big piece and he says,
eat it.

700
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,100
Do you owe this person as a debt
of gratitude out of gratitude?

701
00:47:28,101 --> 00:47:33,100
Do you owe him the obligation to eat
the pie and continue eating the pie?

702
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:37,060
That would seem like a
rather odd thing to claim.

703
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:41,020
This guy is indeed as I've named him,
just a bully.

704
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:47,590
Now, of course, typical bullies, at least
you know in the, in the comic book cases,

705
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:50,830
bullies are big and strong.

706
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,590
The bullying might be able to
say the following thing to you,

707
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:58,710
you eat this pie or I will beat
you up or beat the crap out of you.

708
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,500
And, and, and look, I'm
not a very strong guy.

709
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:10,450
He might well be able to do it
and I might not. I might. Well,

710
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:12,430
no,
he is going to do it.

711
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:16,840
And so it might be prudent
for me to eat this lime pie.

712
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,750
Disgusting, appalling, as it may be.

713
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:23,080
It might be better to have a couple
of slices of slime pie than B,

714
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:24,640
three beaten up to a pulp,

715
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,390
but there's no moral obligation here.

716
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:32,020
There's no moral
requirement to eat the pie.

717
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:33,521
Well,

718
00:48:33,521 --> 00:48:38,521
if God takes on the
role of bully and says,

719
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:42,820
eat the pie,
or I'll send you to hell,

720
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,780
maybe it would be prudent to
review to do what he says.

721
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,770
And if God takes on the
role of bullying and says,

722
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:56,100
even though your life has become so
horrible that you'd be better off dead,

723
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:01,890
I insist that you keep living or I'll
send you to hell if you kill yourself.

724
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:05,650
Maybe it's prudent of
you not to kill yourself,

725
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,920
but there's no moral requirement here.

726
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:13,810
God's just a bully on this story.
Now,

727
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:17,530
that's not to say that
I think God is a bully.

728
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,520
If you believe plausibly enough,
God is good,

729
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:27,510
then God's not going to want
you to continue eating the pie.

730
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:32,980
Once it's spoiled, he gives
you an apple pie. He says,

731
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:37,090
eat it. It's good for you. You'll
like it out of gratitude. You eat it.

732
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:42,150
But then God not being a bully
says if the pie ever spoils,

733
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,680
you can stop eating.

734
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,280
Why in the world would he insists that
we continue to eat a spoiled pie if he's

735
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:51,724
not a bully?

736
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:58,020
So I can't see how any argument from
gratitude is going to get off the ground.

737
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,380
If there's something
immoral about suicide,

738
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:06,640
we're not going to get the immorality
through these quick and dirty arguments.

739
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:11,500
We're going to have to get it from some
more systematic appeal to moral theory,

740
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,330
and that's what will turn to next time.
