1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,670
Last time we made the turn from
metaphysics to value theory and we started

2
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:08,580
asking about what it is about
death that makes it bad.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,000
The first aspect of the badness of death
that we talked about was the fact that

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,540
when somebody dies that's hard on the
rest of us were left behind having to cope

5
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:27,270
with the loss of this person
that we loved. Nonetheless,

6
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:31,770
it seems likely that if we want to get
clear about the central badness of death,

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,870
it can't be a matter of the loss
for those who remained behind,

8
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,520
but rather the loss, the badness
of death for the person who dies,

9
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,760
that any rate is what I want
to focus on from here on out.

10
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,290
What exactly is it about my death or the
fact that I'm going to die that makes

11
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,180
that bad for me.

12
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,880
Now want to get clear about precisely
what it is we want to focus in on here.

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,390
Now,

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,390
one thing that could be bad obviously is
the process of dying could be a painful

15
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:04,680
one. It might be, for example,

16
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:09,681
that I get ripped to pieces
by Bengali tigers and if so,

17
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:13,170
then the actual process of dying,
it would be horrible.

18
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:17,640
It would be painful and clearly it
makes sense to talk about the process of

19
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:21,000
dying is something that could
potentially be bad for me,

20
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,480
although similarly I
might die in my sleep,

21
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:29,340
in which case the process of dying
would not be bad for me. At any rate,

22
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,110
I take it that most of us though we might
have some passing concerned about the

23
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:38,130
possibility that our process of dying,
my pay painful one,

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,450
that's not the,
again,

25
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:43,440
the central thing we're concerned about
when we face the fact that we're going

26
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:45,750
to die.
It's also true,

27
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:50,280
of course it many of us find here right
now, while we're not actually dying,

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,030
the prospect of dying to be unpleasant.

29
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,860
So one of the things that's bad about my
death for me is that right now I've got

30
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:03,330
some unhappy thoughts as I anticipate
the fact that I'm going to die.

31
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,570
But again,
that can't be the central bad thing.

32
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:11,571
That's central thing that's bad about
death because it the prospect of my death,

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,810
it makes sense for that to be a
painful one or an unpleasant one.

34
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,050
Only given the further claim that death
itself is bad for me having fear or

35
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:28,851
anxiety or concern or a Greg or anguish
or whatever it is that maybe I have now

36
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,340
about the fact that I'm going to die
piggy backs on the logically prior thought

37
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,690
that death itself is bad for me.

38
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:41,691
If it didn't piggyback in that way
wouldn't make any sense to have fear or

39
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:46,520
anxiety or dread or anguish or whatever
it is that I may have now. I mean,

40
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,620
suppose I said to you tomorrow something's
going to happen to you and that thing

41
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:57,360
is going to be simply fantastic.
Absolutely incredible.

42
00:02:57,361 --> 00:03:02,320
Absolutely wonderful. And you said, well,
I believe you and I had to tell you,

43
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:06,100
I'm just filled with dread and
foreboding in thinking about it.

44
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,530
Well that that wouldn't
make any sense at all.

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,740
It makes sense to be filled with
dread or foreboding, what have you.

46
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,860
Only if the thing you're looking
forward to anticipating is itself bad.

47
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,580
Maybe,
for example,

48
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:23,581
it makes sense to dread going to the
dentist if you believe that being at the

49
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:26,980
dentist is a painful,
unpleasant experience,

50
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,580
but if being at the dentist
isn't itself unpleasant,

51
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,360
it doesn't make sense to to dread
it in anticipation. So again,

52
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,260
if we're thinking about the
central badness of death,

53
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,300
it seems to me that we've got
to focus on my being dead.

54
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,160
What is it about my being
dead that bad for me?

55
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,740
Now,
if we pose that question,

56
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:57,670
it seems as though the answer should
be simple and straight forward.

57
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,830
When I'm dead, I won't exist.
Now previously, you know,

58
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:03,970
the first part of the class,

59
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:06,910
we spent some time saying
they look on certain views.

60
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,610
There'll be a period of time
in which you might be dead,

61
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:13,030
but your body might still be
alive or you might be dead.

62
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,550
But even though your body's still exist,
it's not alive,

63
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:19,930
but you exist as a corpse.
Put all that aside.

64
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,760
Go to the period beyond any of that,
that that murky stuff in the short term.

65
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,500
And just for simplicity,

66
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:31,420
let's suppose with the
physicalist that once I die,

67
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,140
I cease to exist.
All right,

68
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,580
so don't we have the answer to what's bad
about death right there when I'm dead,

69
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:40,930
I won't exist.

70
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,950
Isn't that the straight forward
explanation about why death is bad?

71
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,840
Now what I want to say in effect is this.

72
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,870
I do think the fact that I won't exist
does provide the key to getting clear

73
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:59,590
about how and why death is bad,

74
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,510
but I don't think it's quite straight
forward. I think as we'll see,

75
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,260
it actually takes some work to,

76
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,150
to to spell out exactly how death,

77
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,740
how nonexistence could be bad for me.
And even having done that,

78
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,520
there'll be some puzzles that remain that
will be turned into in a little while.

79
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,420
So the basic idea seems to
be straightforward enough.

80
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,880
When I'm dead,
I won't exist.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,630
Isn't it clear that non-existence
is bad for me? Well,

82
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:30,610
immediately you get an objection.
You say,

83
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,790
how could nonexistence
be bad for me after all?

84
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,310
The whole point of nonexistence
is you don't exist.

85
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,820
How could anything be bad for you
when you don't exist doesn't it isn't.

86
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,240
They'll kind of logical requirement
that for something to be bad for you,

87
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,740
you've got to be around two
to receive that bad thing.

88
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,660
A headache, for example,
can be bad for you,

89
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,350
but of course you exist
during the headache.

90
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,130
Headaches couldn't be bad
for people who don't exist,

91
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,310
they can't experience or have
or receive headaches. How could,

92
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,500
how could anything be bad for you when
you don't exist and in particular then

93
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:22,640
how could not existence be bad for
you when you don't exist? So it's not,

94
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,270
as I say,

95
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:28,270
altogether straight forward to see how
the answer death is bad for me because

96
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:30,980
when I'm dead I don't exist.

97
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,100
How that answers the problem as opposed
to simply focusing our attention on the

98
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:41,390
problem. How can
nonexistence be bad? For me,

99
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,240
the answer to this objection I think
is to be found in drawing a distinction

100
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:51,680
between two different ways in
which something can be bad for me.

101
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,880
On the one hand,
something can be bad for me.

102
00:06:55,881 --> 00:07:00,260
We might say in an absolute robust,
intrinsic sense,

103
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,540
take a headache again or other,

104
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:06,330
some other kinds of pain of stubbing
your toe or getting stabbed or whatever,

105
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,880
whatever it is,
being tortured.

106
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,690
Pain is intrinsically bad.

107
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:14,030
It's bad in its own right.

108
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,720
It's something we want to
avoid for its own sake.

109
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,230
And those normal,
normal,

110
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,340
normally things that are bad
for you are bad. Intrinsically,

111
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,570
they're bad by virtue of the,
their very nature.

112
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,930
There's something about the way
they are that you don't want those.

113
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:34,310
They're bad in their own right.

114
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,470
But there's another way of something
being bad for you that it's easy to

115
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:43,220
overlook. Something can
be bad. Comparatively.

116
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,580
Something could be bad because of what
you're not getting while you get this bad

117
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:50,890
thing.

118
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,820
So it could be what the economists call
bad by virtue of the opportunity costs.

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,710
It's not that it's intrinsically bad,
it's bad because while you're doing this,

120
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,440
you're not getting something better. How
could, how could that be? Let's go. Let's,

121
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,680
let's have a simple example.

122
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,380
Suppose that I stay home
and watch something on TV.

123
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,530
Just so you know, uh, a deal or no deal.

124
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:20,180
I watched this on TV and I have a good
enough time. How could that be bad for me?

125
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:24,200
Well, in terms of the first notion of
bad something, dean, intrinsically bad,

126
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,170
it's not that it's a,

127
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,250
it's a pleasant enough way to spend a
half an hour or however long it shows.

128
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:32,420
On the other hand,

129
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:37,450
suppose what I could be doing instead
of watching a half an hour of television

130
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,920
is being at a really great party.

131
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,360
Then we might say the fact that I'm stuck
home watching television is bad for me

132
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:52,550
in this comparative sense.

133
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,030
It's not that it's in itself
an way to spend some time,

134
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,300
it's just that there's a better way
to spend time that I could be doing in

135
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:07,050
principle at least.
If only I'd gone if only I'd been invited.

136
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:12,051
If only I remembered what have you
and because I'm forgoing that better.

137
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:15,150
Good.
There's something bad.

138
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,770
Comparatively speaking about the fact
that I'm stuck at home watching TV,

139
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,490
there's a,
there's a lack of the better good.

140
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,380
A lack is not intrinsically bad,

141
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,800
but it's still a kind of
bad in this second sense.

142
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,200
To be lacking a good is itself bad for me.
Similarly,

143
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,280
suppose

144
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,840
I hold out two envelopes and I say pick
one and you open up the first one and

145
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,580
you pick the first one and you
open it up and say, hey look,

146
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:49,200
10 bucks isn't that good for me?
Well,

147
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:53,700
of course 10 bucks is intrinsically good
anyway. Both of them intrinsically good.

148
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:55,290
It's only good as the
means to buy something,

149
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,930
but it's sort of good fourth
having for its own right,

150
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,390
but or because of what it can get you,

151
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,820
but if unbeknownst to you the
other envelope had $1,000 in it,

152
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,613
then we can say,
look,

153
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,730
it's bad for you that you pick the
first envelope bad and what sense?

154
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Because you would have been better
off had you pick the second envelope,

155
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,810
you would have been having more
good or a greater amount of good.

156
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,410
Well nonexistence can't be
bad for me in our first sense,

157
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,380
it can't be that nonexistence
is intrinsically bad
worth avoiding for its own

158
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:42,030
sake. That would only make sense if
nonexistence with somehow, for example,

159
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,320
painful. But when you don't exist,
you have no painful experiences.

160
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,560
There's nothing about non-existence in
and of itself that makes us want to avoid

161
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:54,654
it.

162
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,690
Nonexistent as only bad for me in this
comparative sense because of the lack.

163
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,230
When I don't exist,
I'm lacking stuff.

164
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,600
What am I lacking?
Well,

165
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,630
of course what I'm lacking is life and
more particularly still the good things

166
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,920
that life can give me.

167
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:19,550
So nonexistence is bad by virtue of the
opportunity costs that are involved.

168
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,440
Famously a WC fields,
uh,

169
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:30,090
on his tombstone says personally,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia, right?

170
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,120
What's bad about being dead is you don't
get to experience and enjoy any longer

171
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,460
the various good things
that life would offer us.

172
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:47,090
So nonexistence does point to
the key aspect about death.

173
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:50,640
Why is death bad? Because
when I'm dead, I don't exist.

174
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,760
But if we ask why is and how can be
the case that nonexistence is bad,

175
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,990
the answer is because of the
lack of the good things in life.

176
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,030
Because when I don't exist,

177
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,120
I am not getting the things that I could
have otherwise gotten if only I were

178
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:10,450
still alive.

179
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:16,140
Death is bad because it deprives
me of the good things in life.

180
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,950
This account is known as nowadays known
as the deprivation account of the evil

181
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:27,400
or badness of death for obvious reasons,
right?

182
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,840
The key thought is what the
central bad about death,

183
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,930
about nonexistence is that it deprives
you of the goods of life you might

184
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:38,230
otherwise be getting.

185
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:43,610
That's the deprivation account and it
seems to me that the deprivation account

186
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,000
basically has it.
Right?

187
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,750
Eventually I'll go on to argue that
there are other aspects of death that may

188
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:56,821
also contribute to its badness aspects
above and beyond the one that gets

189
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,680
focused on by the deprivation to count,

190
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:04,360
but still it seems to me the deprivation
account points us correctly to the

191
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:07,930
central thing about death that's bad.

192
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,600
What's most importantly bad about the
fact that I'll be dead is the fact that

193
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:16,000
when I'm dead, I won't be
getting the good things in life.

194
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:17,110
I'll be deprived of them.

195
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,140
That's the badness of death according
to the deprivation to count.

196
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,230
Now,
if we accept the deprivation account,

197
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,750
if we try to accept the
deprivation account,

198
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,260
we faced some further
philosophical puzzles,

199
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,980
puzzles that many people have thought
are sufficiently overwhelming that we,

200
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,620
despite the initial plausibility of the
deprivation account, have to give it up

201
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,010
first objection is this.
Look,

202
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,790
if something is true,
quite general point,

203
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,700
it seems about metaphysics
is something is true.

204
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,870
There's got to be a time when it's true.
If I,

205
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,790
if I make some claim about a fact,

206
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,590
there's gotta be a time when
that fact is true. Here's a fact.

207
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,130
Shelley's lecturing to you now
about the badness of death.

208
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,910
When is that facts true? When was that
factory? Well, you know, right now.

209
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,850
Now here's another fact Shelly
wants lecture to you about, uh,

210
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:22,450
the nature of personal identity.
When was that fact true? Well,

211
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:27,451
we can point to a period of perhaps
of a week or two last month when I was

212
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:30,370
lecturing to you about personal identity,

213
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,530
things that are facts can be
dated. All right? That seems right.

214
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,790
But if it is right,
then immediately we got a puzzle.

215
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:45,320
How could death be bad for me if death
was bad for me, that would be a fact. If,

216
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,640
if, if my death is bad for me, that
would be a factory to ask. Well,

217
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:53,570
when is that fact true? Might
say, well, it's not true now.

218
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,540
Death isn't bad for me
now. I'm not dead. Now.

219
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,180
Maybe death is bad for me when I'm dead,

220
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,190
but that seems very hard to believe. I
mean, when I'm dead, I don't exist. Right?

221
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:12,191
How could anything be bad for me
then surely you've got to exist.

222
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,240
So there's a puzzle about
dating the badness of death.

223
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,373
Now

224
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:25,060
it may be that this puzzle about time
and the date of the badness of death is

225
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:29,450
what Epicurus had in mind.

226
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:33,480
There's a passage that I'm going to read
to you in a moment from epicurious this,

227
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,850
this passage has, has puzzled people,
has puzzled philosophers ever since.

228
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:42,090
Epicurus seems to me putting his finger
on something puzzling about death though

229
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,460
it's difficult to pin down exactly
what it is that's bugging him.

230
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,810
So we're going to try it
interpretation or two. But first,

231
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,430
here's the passage from Epicurus.

232
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,850
So death,

233
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:01,090
the most terrifying of ILS is nothing
to us since so long as we exist,

234
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,990
death is not with us,
but when death comes,

235
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,880
then we do not exist.

236
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,860
It does not then concern either the
living or the dead. Since for the former,

237
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:15,560
it is not,
and the ladder are no more.

238
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,550
They say it's not altogether clear
what Epicurus is bothered by there,

239
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:24,551
but one possible interpretation is this
puzzle about the timing of the badness

240
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:29,780
of death. Death can't be bad
for me now because I'm alive.

241
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,390
Deaf can't be bad for me when I'm dead.

242
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,900
I am no more than how can
things be bad for me then?

243
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,510
But if death has no time
that which is bad for me,

244
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,640
and if anything, that's true. Any fact
has to have a time when it's true,

245
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,410
then the purported fact that death
is bad for me can't really be a fact.

246
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,080
All right,
how could we respond to this objection?

247
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,360
Well know, one way of course is to to
accept the objections. Hey, you're right.

248
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:03,770
That doesn't really bad for me,

249
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,340
and some philosophers have indeed
accepted that very conclusion.

250
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,520
Maybe Epicurus the most of us want to say,
no,

251
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:14,750
no death is bad for me, and so we
need a better answer to that. Oh yeah.

252
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,750
When is it bad for you?
Objection.

253
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,570
Two possible responses.

254
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,500
One possible response would be to
grab the bull by the horns and say,

255
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,370
death is bad for me.
Facts do have to be dated.

256
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,140
Let me tell you when it's bad for me.

257
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,990
The other possible responses to grab as
it were the other horn and say, you know,

258
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:39,440
death is bad for me and I
agree that I can't date it,

259
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,910
but you were wrong to assume that
all facts have to be datable.

260
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,070
There are some things that are
true that we can't put a date on.

261
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,000
Let's start with the second.

262
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,930
Could there be some things that are
true that we can't put a date on?

263
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,030
Well,

264
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:05,030
here's one I think maybe suppose
that on Monday I shoot John.

265
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,510
I wound him with the bullet
that comes out of my gun,

266
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,220
but it's not a wound
directly into his heart.

267
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:19,250
He simply starts bleeding and he believes
slowly so he doesn't die on Monday,

268
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,620
he's wounded and he's dying,
but he doesn't die on Monday.

269
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,680
On Tuesday, let's suppose that
I have a heart attack and I die.

270
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,060
John's still around bleeding,
but still around.

271
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,460
On Wednesday,

272
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,230
the loss of blood finally overtakes
him and John Dies. All right,

273
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,800
so I shoot him on Monday,
I die on Tuesday.

274
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,420
John Dies on Wednesday.
Now I killed John.

275
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,420
I take it, we're all in agreement
about that. If I hadn't shot him,

276
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:59,190
he wouldn't be dead. I killed
him. When did I kill him?

277
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:06,220
Did I kill him on Monday? The day I
shot him. Oh, that doesn't seem right.

278
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:10,660
He's not dead on Monday. How
can I kill him on Monday? Oh,

279
00:19:10,661 --> 00:19:14,860
he died on Wednesday. Did I
kill him on Wednesday? Well,

280
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,870
how could that be? I don't even exist
on Wednesday. I dyed myself on Tuesday.

281
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,550
How can I kill him after I'm dead?
So I didn't kill him on Monday.

282
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:27,280
Didn't kill him. I've got her on
Wednesday. I didn't come on Monday.

283
00:19:27,281 --> 00:19:32,080
Didn't kill him on Wednesday when
he dies. When did I kill him? Well,

284
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,661
you know,
maybe,

285
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:36,490
maybe the answer is there's no particular
time at all when I killed them,

286
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:38,740
but for all that it's
true that I killed him.

287
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,540
What makes it true that I killed him?

288
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,780
What makes it true that I killed him
is that on Monday I shot him and on

289
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:47,170
Wednesday he died from the wound.
That's what makes a true.

290
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,560
But when did I kill him?
Maybe we can't date that.

291
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,603
Okay,

292
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,670
suppose we can't.
If we can't,

293
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:01,740
then there are facts that you can't date.
Like the fact that I killed John.

294
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,280
If there are facts that you can't date,
maybe here's another one.

295
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,630
My death is bad for me. When does,
when does that true? Can't date it.

296
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:11,610
But for all that,
maybe it's true.

297
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,730
So maybe we shouldn't
accept the assumption of the
argument that all facts can

298
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:21,360
be dated.
Of course,

299
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,410
the thought that all facts can be dated
as a very powerful one and no doubt many

300
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:28,680
of you are going to go home and start
trying to come up with an adequate answer

301
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:32,270
to the question. You know, when
exactly didn't Shelly killed John and,

302
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,820
and cover the natural maybe that
you can even accept and any rate,

303
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,440
maybe we should accept the thought
that all facts can be dated,

304
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,780
in which case, if we're going to want
to insist that my death is bad for me,

305
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,260
we better be able to come up with
that date. Well, maybe we can.

306
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:56,550
When would it be plausible to
claim my death is bad for me?

307
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,990
Well, not now. I deaf can't be
bad for me now I'm not dead.

308
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:08,020
But it's not 100% clear that the
other alternative isn't acceptable.

309
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:13,050
Why not say my death is
bad for me when I'm dead?

310
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,580
After all,
when is a headache bad for me?

311
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:23,310
When the headache is occurring now
according to the deprivation of cowed,

312
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,510
the badness of death consists in
the fact that when you're dead,

313
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,390
you are deprived of the goods of life.

314
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,310
So when his death bad
for you during the time,

315
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,960
perhaps you're being deprived
of the goods of life.

316
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,410
Well, when are you deprived
of the goods of life?

317
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,840
When you dead?
When does the deprivation actually occur?

318
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:54,010
When you're dead. So perhaps we
should just say, well, you were right.

319
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,880
Epicurus is was epicurious his argument.
You were right.

320
00:21:57,881 --> 00:22:00,970
Epicurus all facts have to be dated,

321
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,660
but we can date the badness of death.

322
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:10,020
My death is bad for me during the time
I'm dead because during that time I'm

323
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,160
deprived of,

324
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:20,161
I'm not getting the good things in life
that I would be getting if only I were

325
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:24,100
still alive.
Well,

326
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,640
that's a possible
response to the objection,

327
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,780
but of course it just immediately
raises a further objection.

328
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,300
How could it be that death is bad for me?

329
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Then how could it be that death
is bad for me when I don't exist?

330
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:55,040
Surely I have to exist in order
for something to be bad for me.

331
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,880
Well, for that matter, for
something to be good for me,

332
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,780
don't you need to exist in order for
something to be good or bad for you?

333
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:13,770
Well,
this point,

334
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:17,550
our way to a different possible
interpretation of Epicurus is argument.

335
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:23,580
The argument would be a something
could be bad or for that matter,

336
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:27,960
good for you.
Only if you exist be when you're dead.

337
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:32,040
You don't exist. So see,
death can't be bad for you.

338
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,450
Put that up on the board.

339
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,483
Hey,

340
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,000
something can be bad for you.

341
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,060
Only
you exist.

342
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,463
B,

343
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,060
when you're dead,
you don't exist.

344
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,030
So inclusion,
see,

345
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,990
death can't be bad for you.

346
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,123
Yeah,

347
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,300
maybe that's the argument
that Epicurus had in mind.

348
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:38,080
Let's hear epicurious has the quote
from epicurious again. So death,

349
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:43,140
the most terrifying of ILS is nothing
to us since so long because we exist.

350
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,130
Death is not with us,
but when death comes,

351
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:53,020
then we do not exist. It does not then
concern either the living or the dead.

352
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,890
Since we're the former, it is not.
And the ladder are no more. Again,

353
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,650
the passage from Epicurus
isn't off together. Clear,

354
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:04,480
but maybe he's got in mind something like
this argument. Maybe Epicurus thanks.

355
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:07,330
Look a,
something can be bad for you.

356
00:25:07,331 --> 00:25:12,100
Only if you exist be when you're dead.
You don't exist.

357
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,640
So see,
death can't be bad for you.

358
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,653
Okay,

359
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,510
well,
what should we say?

360
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:30,090
It's pretty clear that B is true.
When you're dead, you don't exist.

361
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,750
And so the conclusion,
see death can't be bad for you.

362
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,310
Looks like it's going to follow.

363
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,570
Once we accept a call a
the existence requirement,

364
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:44,130
something can be bad or for that
matter, good for you. Only if you exist.

365
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,340
That's the existence
requirement for bads and goods.

366
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,870
If we accept the existence requirement,

367
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,550
it looks as though we have to accept the
conclusion. Death can't be bad for you.

368
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:58,710
Yeah.

369
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,580
What should we say?

370
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:04,730
Maybe what we should say is reject the
existence requirement in the ordinary

371
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:11,940
case pains,
being blind,

372
00:26:11,941 --> 00:26:15,960
being crippled, what have you.
Losing your job in the ordinary case,

373
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,080
things are bad for you when
you exist in the ordinary case,

374
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:26,160
in order to receive Bads,
you've got to exist,

375
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,390
but perhaps that's only the ordinary case.

376
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,280
It's not all cases.

377
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,750
Perhaps we should say look
for certain kinds of bads.

378
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,200
You don't need to even exist in order
for those things to be bad for you.

379
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,140
What kind of bags could be like that?
Well,

380
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:51,141
of course deprivation bads
would be exactly like that.

381
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,210
To lack something you don't need to exist.
Indeed.

382
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:02,990
The very fact that you don't exist might
provide the very explanation as to why

383
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:09,030
you've got the deprivation,
why you've got the lack.

384
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,730
Not all lax might be like that,
right?

385
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,600
Remember the television case you existed
while you were being deprived of the

386
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:20,601
great party you existed while you were
getting the mirror $10 instead of the

387
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:26,430
thousand dollars. So sometimes
deprivations coincide with existence,

388
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:31,610
but the crucial point about deprivations
is you don't even need to so much as

389
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:35,610
exist in order to be
deprived of something.

390
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,770
Existence guarantees that
you're deprived of something.

391
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,030
So perhaps we should just reject
the existence requirement.

392
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,830
Perhaps we should say when
we're talking about lax,

393
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,720
when we're talking about
deprivations a is wrong,

394
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,660
we should reject the
existence requirement.

395
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:03,130
Something can be bad for
you even if you don't exist.

396
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,670
The existence requirement is false.
Well,

397
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:14,330
that would be a possible
way to respond to this.

398
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,090
The second possible interpretation
of Epicurus is argument.

399
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,780
It would be a way to retain
the thought that I take it.

400
00:28:21,781 --> 00:28:23,280
We want to have that most of us share,

401
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:28,281
at least that death is bad by we'd be
able to retain that thought by rejecting

402
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,020
the existence requirement.

403
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,230
Well,
easy to save that,

404
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:44,620
but there are some implications
of rejecting the existence
requirement that may

405
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:49,400
be rather hard to swallow.
Think about exactly what it's saying.

406
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:51,890
It's saying something. For example, death.

407
00:28:51,891 --> 00:28:56,840
Not Existence can be bad for somebody
even though they don't exist.

408
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,600
That's why my death can be bad
for me even though I won't exist.

409
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,820
But if death can be bad for somebody,
even though they don't exist,

410
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:12,040
then death could be bad for somebody that
has to say not existence could be bad

411
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:16,240
for somebody who never exists.

412
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,840
Take somebody who is a possible person

413
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,380
but never actually gets born.

414
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,190
Sort of hard to think about
somebody like that. So let's,

415
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,570
let's try to get at least a little bit
more concrete. I need two volunteers.

416
00:29:35,571 --> 00:29:39,590
I need a male volunteer from
the audience. Good. Okay.

417
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:42,760
You'll be the male volunteer
and I a female volunteer

418
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:47,500
from the audience. Mine won't hurt.
You're the female volunteer. Okay.

419
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,720
What I'd like you to do after class
is go have sex and have the baby.

420
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,580
Okay.
Now

421
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,600
let me just suppose that this
isn't actually going to happen.

422
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:08,700
Sorry. And or sorry. I don't know. Uh,

423
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,483
let's,

424
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:15,490
let's consider though the possibility
never to be actual ISED the possibility

425
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,280
that they would have sex and have a baby.

426
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,293
You know,

427
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:27,320
his sperm join with her egg
form a fertilized egg. The,

428
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,500
the, the, the fertilized
egg develops into a fetus.

429
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,140
The fetus is eventually born.
It's,

430
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:36,170
it's the fetus that we got by mixing,
you know,

431
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,850
egg 37 with sperm 4 million,
309.

432
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,660
There's a person that
could have been born,

433
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,510
but let's suppose never does get born.

434
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,260
That particular person
who could have been born.

435
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:55,720
Let's call Larry.
Okay,

436
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,390
Larry is a possible person.

437
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:05,000
Could happen but won't happen.
Could exist,

438
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,470
but won't exist.
Now,

439
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:14,530
how many of us feel sorry for Larry?

440
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,940
Probably nobody after all,

441
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,850
Larry never even exists.

442
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,700
How can we feel sorry for Larry.

443
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:32,600
Now that made perfect sense when we
accepted the existence requirement.

444
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:37,040
A something can be bad
for you only if you exist.

445
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,160
Since Larry never exists.

446
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,500
Nothing can be bad for Larry,

447
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,790
but once we give up on
the existence requirement,

448
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,200
once we say something can be bad for you,
even if you never exist,

449
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,800
then we no longer have any grounds for
withholding our sympathy from Larry.

450
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,030
We can say,
oh my gosh,

451
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:05,210
think of all the goods in life that Larry
would have had if only he'd been born,

452
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,203
but

453
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:15,750
he never is born so he's deprived of all
those goods and if death is bad for me,

454
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:23,190
by virtue of being deprived of the goods
of life than nonexistence is bad for

455
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:27,220
Larry by virtue of his being deprived
of all the goods for of life.

456
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,280
Okay,

457
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,060
I got it bad, I'm going to
die. Larry's got it worse.

458
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,110
We should really feel
much Saria for Larry,

459
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,830
but I bet none of you
feels sorry for Larry.

460
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:47,030
This never to be born at all person.

461
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,180
That's important in thinking about this,

462
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,110
that we not slip back into
some version of the soul view,

463
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:59,230
especially some version of the soul view
where the soles are prior existence.

464
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:03,380
You know, you might imagine there's
a scene in homer I think where,

465
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:07,040
where uh,
some sort of sacrifices being made and,

466
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,960
and all the dead souls,

467
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:13,990
ghosts sort of hover around
longing to be alive again to,

468
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:19,250
to, to save her the, the, the food
and tastes and smells of life, right?

469
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:25,090
If you've got this picture
of the nonexistent merely
potentially possible but

470
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:31,121
never to be born individuals as somehow
really already existing in a kind of

471
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:35,930
ghost like state wishing they were born.
Maybe you should feel sorry for them,

472
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,990
but that's not what the story is at all.

473
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,200
I'm the physical list picture
that I'm assuming nonexistent.

474
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,950
People don't have a kind of
spooky wish I were alive.

475
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:51,830
Ghostlike existence.
They just don't exist full stop.

476
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:59,870
So once we keep that in mind about Larry,
it's very hard to feel sorry for him.

477
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,190
Of course.
Look,

478
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:04,250
since I've been going on about how he's
deprived of all the good things in life,

479
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,730
maybe some of you are
feeling sorry for Larry.

480
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So it's worth getting clear about just
what it would mean to take seriously.

481
00:34:15,111 --> 00:34:20,111
The thought that it's bad
for merely potential people.

482
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,280
Never to be born.

483
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:28,630
How many merely potential
people are there?

484
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,460
I need to get a sense of
just how many there are.

485
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,020
It's not just Larry,

486
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,980
the unborn person that would exist if
we mixed whatever it was, you know,

487
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:43,490
egg 37 and sperm 4 million in
29 whatever the number was,

488
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,570
not just Larry, who's a potential
person who never gets born.

489
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,520
That would have to be an
object of our sympathy.

490
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:54,700
There's a lot of merely
potential never to be born.

491
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,940
People. How many? A lot.

492
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,580
How many, well, I once
tried to calculate, well,

493
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,440
as you'll see, that calculation is
utterly off the back of the envelope,

494
00:35:12,441 --> 00:35:17,060
sort of rough, uh, and, and completely
inadequate in ways that I'll, I'll,

495
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:17,870
I'll point out,

496
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:22,870
but at least it'll give you a sense of
just how many potential people there are.

497
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,680
Let's start modestly and ask how
many possible people could we,

498
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,620
the current generation
produced. Now, as I say,

499
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:38,160
I made this calculation some years ago.
Doesn't really matter

500
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,950
how inaccurate it's
going to be as we'll see.

501
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,330
It's very rough,

502
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:51,020
but it makes the point
how many people are there?

503
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,430
How many possible people rather,
could there be well smells.

504
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:58,700
There were 5 billion people,
roughly half of them are men.

505
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,050
Half of them are women.

506
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:05,260
What we want to know then is how many
possible people could the two and a half

507
00:36:06,261 --> 00:36:10,130
billion men make out together with
the two and a half billion women.

508
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,280
And the crucial point in thinking about
this is to realize that every time you

509
00:36:15,621 --> 00:36:18,920
combine a different egg
with a different sperm,

510
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:22,270
you end up with a different person,
right?

511
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,920
If you combine an egg
with a different sperm,

512
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:27,620
you get a different genetic code that
develops into a different person.

513
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,740
You combine that sperm with a different
egg, you get a different person.

514
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:34,360
You know, if, if, if,

515
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:39,220
if my parents had had sex five
minutes earlier or five minutes later,

516
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,490
presumably some other sperm
would have joined with the egg,

517
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,420
that would have been not me being born,
but some sibling being born.

518
00:36:46,421 --> 00:36:51,310
Instead of me changed the egg, change
the sperm, you get a different person.

519
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,170
So what we really want to know is how
many sperm egg combinations are there with

520
00:36:56,171 --> 00:37:01,030
roughly 5 billion people in the world?
Well,

521
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:06,360
let's see.
It's 2.5 billion women,

522
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,650
okay,

523
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,540
billion women.

524
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,150
How many eggs can a woman have?
Well,

525
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,430
fertile periods,
round numbers,

526
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:24,110
not really going to matter
position roughly 30 years, roughly.

527
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:28,190
12 eggs a year.
That's how many eggs

528
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,520
actually I discovered some time after
having done this calculation that the

529
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:37,850
number of possible eggs is far greater.

530
00:37:37,851 --> 00:37:42,500
A woman actually oxalates and gives
off this many eggs roughly during her

531
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:44,180
fertile period,
but there's many,

532
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:48,020
many other cells I gathered that could
have developed into eggs touch a much,

533
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:50,300
much larger number of potential eggs,

534
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:54,830
but this will do 30 years.
12 eggs a year.

535
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,360
How many men? Roughly? 2.5 billion men

536
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:10,150
each man has. It has a much longer period
in which he's able to produce sperm.

537
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,270
Let's just be round numbers here.
50 years.

538
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:20,200
How many times a day can the man have sex?
Well,

539
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:25,000
certainly more than once, but let's be
a modest here and just say once a day,

540
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,240
so that's 365 times a day.
A year.

541
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:33,130
You want to 65 days a year.
65 days.

542
00:38:33,131 --> 00:38:34,090
I guess that should be.

543
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:47,070
I wrote a too big, I don't have
space left for the last number.

544
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,420
Each time demand ejaculates
he gives off a lot of sperm.

545
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,910
How much sperm?
A lot is.

546
00:38:56,911 --> 00:39:01,020
It happens, you know, look
this up. Once round numbers,

547
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:06,050
40 million sperm each time,
the and Jackie plates.

548
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,130
So this last number has got to be

549
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:15,900
times 40 million sperm.

550
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:19,611
Okay,

551
00:39:19,611 --> 00:39:24,611
so we took all the men that exist now
and all the women that exist now and ask

552
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,030
how many merely possible people,
you know,

553
00:39:29,031 --> 00:39:31,280
most of these people are never
going to be born of course,

554
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:35,840
but we're talking about possible people.
How many possible people are there?

555
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,460
It's two and a half billion times,

556
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:42,461
30 times 12 times two and a half billion
times 50 times 365 times 40 million.

557
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:48,200
That equals,
I'm going to round here.

558
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:55,030
That equals approximately 1.5

559
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,070
million
billion,

560
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,310
billion,

561
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,540
billion people.

562
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,920
That's 1.5 times 10 to the 33rd

563
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:26,390
that's how many possible people we
could have roughly speaking in the next

564
00:40:28,351 --> 00:40:33,351
generation of which obviously a
minuscule fraction are going to be born.

565
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:39,060
There's,
if you're going to feel sorry for Larry,

566
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:44,330
you've got to feel sorry for
every merely possible person,

567
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,900
every person who could have been born
that never gets born and there's 1.5

568
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,860
million billion,
billion,

569
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,790
billion such people as possible people,

570
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:04,740
and of course the truth of the matter is
we've barely scratched the surface here

571
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:11,630
because now think of all those people
and think about all the possible children

572
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:19,590
they could have.
We got this number starting with a mirror,

573
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,720
5 billion people.

574
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:27,290
Imagine the number we would get if
we then calculated how many possible

575
00:41:27,331 --> 00:41:30,210
grandchildren we could have.

576
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,580
I don't mean that we could actually
have of those people at the same time,

577
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,660
but for each one there is a possible
person that could have existed.

578
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:44,740
You quickly end up with
more possible people.

579
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,240
Then there are particles
in the known universe

580
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,540
and that was just two generations.

581
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,690
Three generations are going
to have more for generations.

582
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,700
You could have more as if we think
about the number of possible people,

583
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:09,080
people who could have
existed but will never exist.

584
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:14,470
The number of just boggles the mind and
then if we say we've gotten rid of the

585
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:20,240
existence requirement,
and so things can be bad for you,

586
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:22,550
even if you never actually exist,

587
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:28,240
then we have to say of each and every
single one of those billions upon billions

588
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,290
upon billions upon billions upon billions
of possible people that it's a tragedy

589
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:41,620
that they never get born because
they're deprived of the goods of life.

590
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,100
If we do away with the
existence requirement,

591
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:51,310
then the tragedy of the unborn
possible people is a moral tragedy.

592
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:57,290
That mirror that just staggers the mind.

593
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:02,460
The the worst possible moral horrors of
human history don't begin to even be in

594
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:10,331
the same ballpark as the
moral horror of the loss,

595
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,460
the deprivation for all of
these unborn possible people.

596
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,950
Now, I don't know about
you when I think about it.

597
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:27,220
All I can say is it doesn't strike
me as being a moral catastrophe.

598
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,200
I don't feel anguish and sorrow
and dismay at the loss at the LAC,

599
00:43:38,221 --> 00:43:43,110
at the deprivation for the untold
billion, billion, billion, billions.

600
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:52,650
But if we give up the
existence requirement and
explained the badness of my

601
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:57,550
death via the deprivation account,

602
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:58,920
okay,

603
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,510
we do have to say
this is a moral tragedy.

604
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,780
The fact that they,
the billions upon billions are never born.

605
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,450
Well, if we're not prepared
to say that's a moral tragedy,

606
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,470
well, we could avoid that by, by, by
going back to the existence requirement.

607
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,700
But of course, if we do go back
to the six inch requirement,

608
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,480
then we're back with
Epicurus his argument.

609
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:35,160
Something can bad for you only if you
exist when you're dead, you don't exist.

610
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,980
So see,
death can't be bad for you.

611
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:41,670
Okay?

612
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:44,250
And how we really got ourselves in
a philosophical pickle, don't we?

613
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,130
Okay.

614
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:49,940
If I accept the existence requirement,

615
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,990
we've got an argument that
says death isn't bad for me,

616
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:55,940
which is really rather surprising.

617
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:01,430
I can keep the claim that death is
bad for me by giving up the existence

618
00:45:01,431 --> 00:45:04,460
requirement. But if I give
up the existence requirement,

619
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,640
I've got to say it's a tragedy
that Larry and the untold billions,

620
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,980
billions, billions, billions,
it's a tragedy that they're
deprived of life as well.

621
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,560
And that seems unacceptable.

622
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:21,080
What should we do?
What should we say?

623
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,660
The suggestion is that the,

624
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:28,840
the key here is to think about the
claims that I'm using deprived in two

625
00:45:28,841 --> 00:45:32,830
different senses,
that when we worry about my death,

626
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,300
I'm losing something,
namely life that I've had,

627
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:42,610
but in the case of a Larry
and the untold billions,

628
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:47,470
they never had life and so
they're not deprived of it.

629
00:45:47,471 --> 00:45:49,630
In that same sense,

630
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:55,270
I think it's a very promising
suggestion and indeed I'm not 100% sure.

631
00:45:55,271 --> 00:45:57,760
I've got exactly where you
want to go with this in mind,

632
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
but I think there's a way of taking that
thought and sort of carving a middle

633
00:46:03,191 --> 00:46:08,160
path.
The problem effectively it was this,

634
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:12,780
if we don't throw in any
existence requirement,

635
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:16,590
we have to feel sorry for the
unborn billion, billion, billions.

636
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:21,750
That doesn't seem acceptable.
If we throw in the existence requirement,

637
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:24,990
a something can be bad
for you only if you exist.

638
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:30,510
We end up saying death isn't bad for me
cause I'm not existing when I'm dead,

639
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:37,370
but maybe there's a more modest way of
understanding the existence requirement

640
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:42,330
or to put the point in
slightly different terms.

641
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:48,110
Maybe we can distinguish between two
different versions of the existence

642
00:46:48,661 --> 00:46:49,494
requirement,

643
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,010
a boulder and a more modest version.

644
00:46:59,050 --> 00:46:59,940
Let's see.

645
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,050
Here's the modest version.

646
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,470
Something can be bad for you

647
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,190
only if you exist at
some time or the other

648
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,550
bolder claim.

649
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,820
Some things can be bad for you

650
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,640
only if you exist

651
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:24,490
at the

652
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:30,740
same time
as that thing.

653
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:38,930
All
right.

654
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:43,900
These are two different
ways of understanding what
the existence requirement

655
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,980
requires.

656
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:52,240
The modest version is called
modest because it's asking less.

657
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,790
It says something gave me dad for you.

658
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:58,720
Only if you exist at
some time or the other.

659
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:03,490
The bold existence requirement
adds a stronger requirement.

660
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:08,780
Says something can be bad for you only
if you exist at the very same time as the

661
00:49:08,801 --> 00:49:13,780
thing that's supposed to be bad for you.
There's gotta be a kind of simultaneity.

662
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:15,310
Something's bad for you.

663
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:19,600
You had better exist at the very same
time that that bad thing is happening.

664
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,190
That's bolder than the modest requirement.

665
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,660
The modest acquirement doesn't require
that you exist at the same time as the

666
00:49:27,661 --> 00:49:28,494
bad thing.

667
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:33,740
It only requires that you exist
at some time or the other.

668
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:42,680
One more minute we'll finish up.

669
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:44,310
Okay.

670
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:48,470
Suppose we accept the bold claim.

671
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:50,623
Okay.

672
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,090
For something to be bad for you,

673
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:55,480
you have to exist at the very
same time as the bad thing.

674
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:01,380
Then death can't be bad for you because
you don't exist at the time of death.

675
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,960
Suppose however that we accept the modest
requirement for something to be bad

676
00:50:10,861 --> 00:50:14,550
for you, you have to exist at
some time or the other. Well,

677
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:18,720
since I do exist at some time or the
other after all, I exist right now.

678
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,050
Yeah.

679
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,900
Death can be bad for me.
Admittedly,

680
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,320
I won't exist when I'm dead,
but that's okay.

681
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,340
The modest existence requirement,

682
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:31,970
does it require that I exist at the
very same time as the bad thing?

683
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,790
The bold one did,
but the modest one doesn't.

684
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:41,030
So the modest one allows us to say
that death is bad for me. But notice,

685
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:42,290
and this is the crucial point,

686
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:47,890
it does not say that non-existence is
bad for Larry because Larry never exists

687
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:52,460
at all.

688
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:58,040
And so he doesn't even satisfy
the modest existence requirement.

689
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,960
In short,
with no existence requirement,

690
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:07,370
we have to say the unexisting once
of the billions and billions is bad.

691
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:12,170
That seems unacceptable with
the bold existence requirement,

692
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:17,210
we have to say death isn't even bad
for me. That seems unacceptable.

693
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:21,830
But if instead we accept the
modest existence requirement,

694
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,000
we're able to say,
nonexistence is not bad for Larry,

695
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:28,910
but death is bad for me.

696
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:34,040
And so that's the view that it seems
to me we should be looking at. Okay.
