1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,900
Last time I sketched
the deprivation account.

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:08,901
That's a story or theory about what
it is about death that makes it bad.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,530
What's bad about death is the fact that
because you're dead because you don't

4
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:15,930
exist, you're deprived of
the good things in life.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,730
Being dead isn't intrinsically bad. It's
not like it's an unpleasant experience,

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,090
but it's,
it's comparatively bad.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,510
You're worse off by virtue of the fact
that you're not getting the things that

8
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:29,610
you wouldn't get, where you're
still alive. If I'm dead,

9
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:33,330
I can't spend time with my loved ones.
I can't look at sunsets.

10
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:35,820
I can't listen to music.
I can't discuss philosophy.

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,140
The deprivation account says what's
bad about death is the fact that you're

12
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:42,780
deprived of the good things in life.
Now,

13
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:47,010
that seems pretty plausible
as a basic story goes,

14
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:48,480
but as we also saw last time,

15
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:52,680
there are some philosophical
puzzles about how it could be.

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,230
There's questions when
his deck bad for you,

17
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:59,250
and even more importantly
and more essentially there's
the difficulty of asking

18
00:00:59,251 --> 00:00:59,551
ourselves,

19
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:03,210
do we really believe it's possible for
something to be bad for you when you

20
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:04,620
don't even exist?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,320
We saw what kind of series of difficult
choices if we don't throw in an

22
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:14,430
existence requirement, if we don't
say it, put it more positively.

23
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:19,320
If we say things can be bad for you,
even if you don't exist at all,

24
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,160
then we're forced to say that
things are bad for Larry.

25
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,550
You'll recall that Larry was
our name for a potential person.

26
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:31,551
Somebody who could have come
into existence but never
actually does or will come

27
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:34,320
into existence. Well, you know,

28
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,590
it's talking about people who are
deprived of the good things in life.

29
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,560
Larry's completely deprived
of the good things in life.

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,180
If we think it doesn't matter whether or
not you exist for things to be bad for

31
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:48,930
you, then we have to say, oh, things
are bad for Larry and not just Larry,

32
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,460
but all of the 1.5 million
billion, billion, billion,

33
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,100
never to be born people.

34
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,900
The number of potential
people is just staggering,

35
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:04,550
and if we throw away in existence
requirement, we have to say it's a,

36
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,910
it's a moral tragedy of
unspeakable proportions that
these people are never born,

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,670
that they never come into existence.
Now,

38
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:14,400
there are philosophers who
are prepared to say that,

39
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,360
but if you're not prepared to say that
it looks as though you've got to accept

40
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,550
some kind of existence requirement.
You know,

41
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,730
why don't we feel sorry for Larry and
his billions upon billions of never to be

42
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,910
born compatriots because
indeed they don't exist.

43
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,140
They're merely possible and we might say
you got to exist in order for something

44
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:36,660
to be bad for you.
But once we say that,

45
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,350
it seems we're running towards
the position that in that case,

46
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:45,000
death can't be bad for me because of
course when I'm dead, I don't exist.

47
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,320
So how can you think me bad for me?

48
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,360
I proposed at the end of class last time
that we could try to solve this problem

49
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:55,740
by distinguishing between two
versions of the existence requirement,

50
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,040
a more modest version,
and the bolder version,

51
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,970
the bolder version says,
in order for something to be bad for you,

52
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,770
you got to exist at the very time
that it's happening. If we say that,

53
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,700
then indeed we can say it's not bad that
Larry doesn't exist because he doesn't

54
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:14,740
exist now.
So there's nothing there.

55
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,830
Even if we wanted to think that there
are good things he could be having that's

56
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:21,970
not bad for him to not have it and
he doesn't exist now, but it also,

57
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:25,270
if we go all the way to the of the bold
existence requirement, we have to say,

58
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:29,550
look, when I'm dead, that won't
be bad for me because, oh,

59
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,790
I won't exist then, but instead of
accepting the bold existence requirement,

60
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,310
we might settle for something
a little bit less demanding.

61
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,310
The thing I dubbed the
modest existence requirement,

62
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,830
in order for something to be bad for you,
there has to have been a time,

63
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,030
some time or the other when you exist,

64
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,650
you've got to,
as it were,

65
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:55,030
exists at least briefly in order to
get into the club as we might put it,

66
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,100
of those creatures,

67
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:00,880
those possible creatures that we care
about and are concerned about morally,

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,530
you have to have gotten into the club by
at least having existed for some period

69
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:08,620
of time,
but once you're in the club,

70
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,810
things can be bad for you even if you
don't happen to exist at that particular

71
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,760
moment. If we accept the
modest existence requirement,

72
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:23,560
then we can say it's not bad
that Larry doesn't exist because,

73
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,221
well,

74
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:27,010
Larry doesn't get into the club he had
in order to get into a club of things

75
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:28,030
that we feel sorry for,

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,510
you have to have existed at least
some moment of the other Larry and the

77
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:35,800
billions upon billions upon billions of
potential people who never actually come

78
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:36,634
into existence.

79
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,730
They don't satisfy the requirement of
having existed at some time or the other,

80
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,870
so we don't have to feel sorry for them,

81
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,260
but we can feel sorry for somebody who
died last week at the age of 10 because

82
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,940
we can say, well, they existed,

83
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,560
albeit very briefly,

84
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,750
and so they're in the club of beans that
we can feel sorry for and say, look,

85
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,850
it's bad for them that
they're not still alive.

86
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,520
Think of all the good things in life
they would be getting if they were still

87
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:07,300
alive.

88
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,300
So the modest existence requirement
allows us to avoid both extremes.

89
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,880
Maybe then that's the position
that we should accept.

90
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,960
It may be on balance.
The best possible view here,

91
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:23,860
but I just wanted to emphasize that even
the modest existence requirement is not

92
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:28,060
without its counter intuitive
implications. Consider somebody's life.

93
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,000
Suppose that somebody has got a
nice long life comes into existence,

94
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:34,721
leads,

95
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:39,340
lives 10 2030 405060708090 years.

96
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,450
Nice life.

97
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,370
Now imagine that we bring it about
that instead of living 90 years,

98
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,170
they have a somewhat shorter life.
10 2030 40 50 years.

99
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,680
We've caused them to die after 50 years
as opposed to the 90 years they might

100
00:05:56,411 --> 00:06:00,170
have otherwise. Well, we
can say, look, that's,

101
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,380
that's worst for them to live nearly
50 years instead of the full 90 or 100

102
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:06,614
years.

103
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,320
Okay.

104
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,110
And if we accept the modest
existence requirement,

105
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:13,660
we can say that because after all,

106
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,190
whether you live 50 years or 90 years,
you did exist at some time and the other.

107
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,090
So the fact that you lost the 40 years
you otherwise would have gotten, well,

108
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,450
that's bad for you. Fair, fair enough.
That gives us the answer we want.

109
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:29,770
That's not counterintuitive. Now
imagine that instead of living 50 years,

110
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:33,340
the person who lives only 10
20 years and then dies, well,

111
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:37,930
that's more still think of all the extra
goods they would have gotten if only

112
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:42,931
they hadn't died then and if I caused
them to die after 20 years instead of 50

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,490
or 90 years,
I've made things worse and worse.

114
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,940
Imagine that I caused them
to die after one year.

115
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,130
We're still all this is perfectly
intuitive. The shorter their life,

116
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,200
the worst it is for them, the more they're
deprived of the good things in life.

117
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,010
So 90 year life, not bad, 50 year life,

118
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,730
worse 10 year life.
We're still one year life.

119
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,990
Worst still one month life,
worst still one day,

120
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:15,700
life worth Stitt worse.
Still one minute life worse.

121
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,850
Still one second life worse still.

122
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,420
Now imagine that I bring it about that
the person never comes into existence at

123
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:25,480
all. Oh, that's fine. See,

124
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,800
that's the implication of accepting
the modest existence requirement.

125
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,740
If I shortened the life,

126
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:37,741
they would have had so completely
that they never get born at all,

127
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,090
that they never come
into existence at all.

128
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,680
Then they don't satisfy the requirement
of having existed at some time or the

129
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:45,514
other.

130
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,570
So although we were making things worse
and worse and worse and worse and worse

131
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:50,410
as we shortened the life,

132
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,500
when we find the snip out that
last little fraction of a second,

133
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,110
it turns out we didn't
make things worse at all.

134
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,000
Now we haven't done
anything objectionable.

135
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,720
That's it seems what you got to say.

136
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:04,870
If you accept the modest
existence requirement,

137
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,930
of course if we didn't have an existence
requirement at all, we could say, oh,

138
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:14,960
worst of all, never to have
been born at all. Fair enough.

139
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,990
But if you say that,
then you've got to feel sorry for Larry.

140
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,670
You've got to feel sorry for the 1.5
million billion, billion, billions.

141
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,500
So which view is it
that on balance is the,

142
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,020
I don't want to say most plausible.

143
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:31,820
I think when we start
thinking about these puzzles,

144
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,360
every alternative seems
unattractive in its own way.

145
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,950
Maybe the most we can hope for is,

146
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,030
which is the least
implausible thing to say.

147
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:43,880
Here I am not altogether certain.

148
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,240
Let me turn to one more trouble or problem
or puzzle for the deprivation account

149
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,550
and this particular puzzle arises,

150
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,320
whether not we accept an
existence requirement,

151
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:02,610
whether or not we accept a bold existence
requirement or a modest distance

152
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,090
requirement or no existence requirement
because we've got a deal with somebody

153
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,200
who actually does exist
at some time or the other,

154
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,060
namely you or me.

155
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,790
This is actually a puzzle that some
of you may have written your paper on

156
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:22,170
because it's the puzzle about Lucretia.
The puzzle that Lucretia's gives us.

157
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:27,090
It's not a direct quote, but Lucretia
is basically says, look, most of us are,

158
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,230
are upset and anxious at the
fact that we're going to die.

159
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,940
We think death is bad for us.

160
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,750
There'll be this period after my
death in which I won't exist. And,

161
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,280
and, and the deprivation account
helps say why that's bad.

162
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,050
Because during this
period of nonexistence,

163
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,640
you're not enjoying the good
things in life. Fair enough.

164
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,470
Says Lucretia's but wait a minute.

165
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,830
The period after you die isn't the only
period during which you don't exist.

166
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,040
It's not the only period in which
if only you were still alive,

167
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,410
you could still be enjoying
the good things in life.

168
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,620
There's another period of nonexistence.

169
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,810
It's the period before my birth. I think
I've just switched the timeline here,

170
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:12,600
but all right, imagine this
is the period before my birth,

171
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:19,430
just like there'll be an infinite period
after my death in which I won't exist,

172
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,090
and realizing that fills us with
dismay. There wasn't, of course,

173
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,810
an infinite period before
I came into existence.

174
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,960
Well, if not existence is so bad
and by the deprivation account,

175
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,650
it seems that we want to say that it is.

176
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:40,010
Shouldn't I be upset at the fact that
there was this eternity before I was born,

177
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,040
but says, well, Kesha, you
know, that's silly, right?

178
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:49,041
Nobody's upset about the fact that there
was an eternity before they were born,

179
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:55,250
in which case it doesn't make any sense
to be upset about the eternity after you

180
00:10:56,011 --> 00:11:00,060
die of nonexistence.
Well,

181
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,330
Lucretia's doesn't offer this as a puzzle.

182
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,550
Lucretia's offers this as an argument
that we should not be concerned about the

183
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:09,750
fact that we're going to die.

184
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,020
Most philosophers aren't willing to go
with Lucretia's all the way to the end of

185
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:18,210
the bus bus route.
Most Lucretia,

186
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,230
most most philosophers want to say
there's gotta be something wrong with that

187
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:26,880
argument someplace. There's
gotta be some. Well,

188
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:27,960
what are the possibilities here?

189
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,720
One possibility is indeed to just
agree with him. You're right.

190
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,740
Nothing bad about the
eternity before I was born,

191
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,190
so nothing bad of the
eternity of nonexistence,

192
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,330
so nothing bad about the eternity
of nonexistence after I die. Well,

193
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:47,190
that's one possibility to agree with
Lucretia's. Second possibility is to say,

194
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,960
look,
Lucretius you're right.

195
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,560
We really do need to treat these to
eternities of nonexistence on a par,

196
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,280
but we could turn it around instead of
saying with Lucretia's nothing bad about

197
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:06,370
this one.
So nothing bad about this one.

198
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Maybe we should say instead something
bad about the one after we die and so

199
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,300
something bad about the
one before we were born.

200
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,510
Maybe we should just stick
to the deprivation account
and not lose faith in it.

201
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,020
The deprivation account says it's bad
that there's this period after we die

202
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,250
because we,
if we only we weren't dead,

203
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:33,040
then we would still be able to
enjoy the good things in life.

204
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:38,290
Maybe we should say look similarly then
when the deprivation account tells us

205
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,430
it's bad that there's this period
before we come into existence,

206
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:45,250
when we don't exist because
of only we had existed,

207
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:47,770
then we'd be able to enjoy
the good things in life.

208
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,200
Maybe Lucretia's was right.
We have to treat both periods the same,

209
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,100
but he's wrong in thinking we
shouldn't think either period is bad.

210
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,630
Maybe we should think both periods
are bad. Oh, that's a possibility.

211
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,430
What other possibilities? Are there
other possibilities to say, Lucretia?

212
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,330
You're right,
there are two periods of nonexistence,

213
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,340
but there's a justification
for treating them differently.

214
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,760
They're asymmetrical in a way that makes
sense from the point of view of what we

215
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:25,630
should care about.
Well,

216
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:30,631
it's easy to save that the puzzle that
most philosophers want to take that last

217
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:35,980
way out. They want to say.
There's something that
explains why it makes sense,

218
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:40,390
why it's reasonable to care about the
eternity of nonexistence after my death,

219
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,880
but where that doesn't apply to the
eternity of nonexistence before my birth,

220
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,810
and then the puzzle is to point to a
difference that would justify that kind of

221
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,940
rationally asymmetrical
treatment of the two periods.

222
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,970
It's easy to say it's okay.
It's reasonable to treat them differently.

223
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,470
The philosophical challenges to point
to something that explains or justifies

224
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:06,304
that.

225
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,950
Now a very common response is
to say something like this,

226
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,900
look,
consider the period after my death.

227
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,050
I'm no longer alive.

228
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,650
I have lost my life.

229
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,900
In contrast, the period before
my birth, although I'm not alive,

230
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,050
I have not lost my life.

231
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,480
I have never yet been alive,

232
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:39,481
and so of course you can't lose
something you've never yet had.

233
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,560
So what's worse,

234
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,860
this answer suggests about the period
after death is the fact that death

235
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,760
involves loss.

236
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:54,270
Whereas prenatal does not involve loss.

237
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:59,690
And so the conclusion comes and now we
see why it's okay to care more about that

238
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,870
one. Then this one, the one after
death than the one before birth.

239
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,760
Because the one after death involves
loss and the one before birth does not.

240
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,700
It's very,
very common response,

241
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,910
but I'm inclined to think that
can't be an adequate answer.

242
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,550
It's true of course,

243
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,820
that this period involves loss because
the very definition of loss is you don't

244
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:30,950
have something that at an
earlier time you did have.

245
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,290
So this period involves loss,

246
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,190
but the period before birth
does not involve loss.

247
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,480
Because although I don't have life, I
haven't previous to this period had life,

248
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,420
so I haven't lost anything.
Of course,

249
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:50,430
there's another thing that's true
about this prenatal period, two width,

250
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,230
I don't have life and I'm going to get it.

251
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,850
So I don't yet have something
that's going to come in the future.

252
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,220
That's not true about the post
life period. I've lost life,

253
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,520
but it's not true of this period that I
don't have life and I'm going to get it

254
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:12,540
in the future.
So this period involves loss,

255
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,730
interest in fat.

256
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,970
We don't have a name for this other
state where you don't yet have something

257
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,880
that you'll get later.
But you don't yet have it.

258
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,940
Let's call that not loss.
Let's call it Chammas.

259
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,533
Okay,

260
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,830
so during this period
there's a loss of life,

261
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:41,270
but no small slice of life and in
this period there's no loss of life,

262
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:47,270
but there's a small loss of life and
now we need to ask as philosophers,

263
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:53,030
why do we care more about loss
of life then Schmaltz of life.

264
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,380
What is it about the fact that we
don't have something that we use to,

265
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,820
that makes it worse then not having
something that we're going to,

266
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,093
yeah,

267
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,470
it's easy to overlook the symmetry here
because we've got this nice word loss

268
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:17,550
and we don't have this word smalls,

269
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,800
but that's not really explaining anything.

270
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,180
It's just pointing to the
thing that needs explaining.

271
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Why do we care more about not having what?

272
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,610
Once upon a time we did,

273
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,400
then we care about not having what.
Once upon a time we will.

274
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,750
Well, there are some other
proposals that we might make.

275
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,010
A couple of them have actually been
sketched in some of your readings.

276
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,320
For example, Tom Nagel in his
essay on death says, look here.

277
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,330
Here's the difference.

278
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,760
It's easy enough to imagine and indeed
for their w for the actually be a

279
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:03,450
possibility of my living longer.

280
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,760
Suppose I die at the age of 80 and if I
didn't die then I'd continue living 90 a

281
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:12,270
hundred what have you there it is.
It's still me.

282
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,890
When you imagine me with an
earlier rather with you know,

283
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:20,220
living longer,
you're imagining me living longer

284
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,890
to use the vocabulary that we introduced
in thinking about some of Plato's

285
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,750
arguments we might say,
although it's supposed to,

286
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:30,420
I died at age 80 that's a fact about me.

287
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:32,850
It's a contingent fact about me.

288
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's not a necessary fact about me that
I died at 80 suppose at 80 I get hit by

289
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,780
a car, not unnecessary truth
about me that I got hit by a car.

290
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,070
I could have not gotten hit by a car
and live to the ripe old age of 90 or a

291
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,080
hundred when you die is not
an essential feature of you.

292
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:57,120
So it's easy for us to think about the
possibility in which I live longer but

293
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:58,080
says Nagel.

294
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,940
When I tried to imagine what would the
alternative be if I'm going to be upset

295
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:07,941
about the prenatal nonexistence we
have to imagine my being born earlier.

296
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,530
I was born in 1954 should I be upset
about the fact that you know, I,

297
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:18,550
I was born in 1954 instead of 1944 I mean
that's the analog of being upset about

298
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,210
the fact that I dying whatever it is,
you know,

299
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,270
2044 instead of living to 2054

300
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,890
natal says,
but look,

301
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:33,390
when you try to think about
the possibility in which
instead of being born in

302
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:37,220
1954 I was born in 1944 and
four. You know, the rest of you,

303
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:41,910
you got to sort of plug in your own
birth dates. Nagle says you can't do it.

304
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,140
The date of my death is a
contingent fact about me,

305
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,960
but the date of my birth is not a
contingent fact about me and my birth.

306
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:57,420
We don't really mean, you
know, when I came out of the
womb that could be changed,

307
00:19:57,421 --> 00:20:01,500
you know, perhaps by having been
delivered prematurely or who says area.

308
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:05,070
And what have you really mean that the
time at which I come into existence,

309
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,550
let's suppose it's the time
when the egg and the sperm join.

310
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:13,500
That's not a contingent
moment in my story.

311
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,800
That's an essential
moment in my life story.

312
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,990
How could that be?
We said,

313
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:23,940
couldn't my parents have had sex earlier
10 years earlier? Sure they could have,

314
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,800
but remember if they had
had sex 10 years earlier,

315
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:33,240
it would've been a different egg and
in different sperm coming together,

316
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,660
so it wouldn't be me.

317
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,910
It would be some sibling of mine
that as it happens, never got born,

318
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,120
but it had,
they had sex 10 years earlier.

319
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,990
Some sibling would have been born.
That's not me being born earlier.

320
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,100
Different sperm, different egg
makes for a different person.

321
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,900
So you can't, you can, you can save the
words if only I'd been born earlier,

322
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,540
but it's not actually
metaphysically possible. Well,

323
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,100
it's an intriguing suggestion but I
think it can't quite be right or at very

324
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,520
least it can't be the complete
story about how to answer.

325
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,580
Lucretia says puzzle as suppose as we've
got a fertility clinic that has some

326
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:24,010
sperm and on on hold and
has some eggs on hold,

327
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,010
you know in the, in the sperm
bank and the and the egg bank,

328
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:29,170
what have you and they keep them here,
you know,

329
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:34,030
frozen until they're ready to use them
and they thaw them out in whatever it is,

330
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,410
2020 and then the person's born,

331
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,560
of course he could go back,

332
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:46,561
he could look back and say if only they
had put my sperm and egg together 10

333
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:51,700
years earlier, that would still
be me after all, very same sperm.

334
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,310
Very same egg makes for
the very same person.

335
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,600
So if only they had combined my
sperm and egg 10 years earlier,

336
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:01,750
I would have been born 10 years earlier.
Well,

337
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:07,350
so Nagle's wrong and saying it's not
possible to imagine being born earlier in

338
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:11,800
at least some cases it is. Yet,
if we imagine somebody like that,

339
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:14,770
somebody who's an offspring of this
kind of fertility clinic and we ask,

340
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,010
would they be upset that they
weren't born earlier? No.

341
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:21,100
Again still seems as though most
people say no, of course not.

342
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,230
So the Nagel answer doesn't seem
to me to be an adequate one. Well,

343
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,190
there's another possible answer.

344
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:30,760
This is Fred Feldman's answer also in
one of the papers that you've read,

345
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,200
Fred Feldman says,
Nagle's a contemporary philosopher for it.

346
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:39,670
Feldman's and contemporary philosopher
Feldman says, when I imagine, you know,

347
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:44,671
suppose I get killed by the busing in
2044 and if I imagine if only I hadn't

348
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:46,661
died,

349
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:51,661
then what is it that we imagine we imagine
instead of living 80 years living 90

350
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,940
or 95 or more,
we imagine a longer life.

351
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,160
But what is it that happens when I
say if only I'd been born earlier,

352
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,840
well says Feldman,

353
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:09,070
you don't actually imagine a longer life.

354
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:13,810
You just shift the entire life
and started earlier. I mean,

355
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:15,340
after all supposedly just said,

356
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,460
especially if I'd asked you this
question before setting all this up,

357
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,360
but if only you had been born in 1800

358
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,400
nobody thinks, oh, if only I'd been
born in 1800 I'd still be alive. I'd be,

359
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:32,380
you know, 200 years old. You Think, Oh, if
I'd been born in 1800 I would have died,

360
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:35,470
you know,
86018701880 whatever it is.

361
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,590
When we imagine being born earlier,

362
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,080
we don't imagine a longer life,

363
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,920
nothing better about having a life earlier
according to the deprivation account.

364
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,020
But when we imagine not
dying when we actually die,

365
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:56,340
who say if only I died in 2015 instead
of 2040 it's not that we imagined having

366
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:59,810
been born later.
We don't shift the life forward.

367
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,670
We imagine a longer life.

368
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,030
So Feldman says no wonder,

369
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:10,180
no surprise that you care about
the non existence after death.

370
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,730
Because when you imagine that being
different, you imagine a longer life.

371
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,380
But when you start thinking about the
nonexistence before birth and you imagine

372
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:24,650
that being different,
you don't imagine more goods in life,

373
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,620
you just imagine them taking
place at a different time.

374
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:33,230
Well that's an interesting possibility,
I suppose.

375
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,720
Doesn't seem to me again that
it's gotta be, it's gotta be,

376
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,100
maybe it's part of the story.

377
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,610
It doesn't seem like it's
going to be the complete story.

378
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,580
Yeah.

379
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,410
Because we could imagine cases
where the person just thinks, look,

380
00:24:47,411 --> 00:24:51,280
if only I'd been born earlier,
I would have had a longer life.

381
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,460
Let's suppose that next week
astronomers discover the horrible fact.

382
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:03,700
If there's an asteroid that's about to
land on the earth and wipe out all life.

383
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,270
Yeah.

384
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,470
So here it is. You know, it's
got to come on January 1st,

385
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,250
2008 and, and there you are at
whatever your age is, you know,

386
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,480
20 years old,

387
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:18,890
21 years old on January and December 31st,

388
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,770
2008 thinking I've only
had 20 years of life.

389
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:25,310
If only I'd been born earlier,

390
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,130
if onlys that have been born,
you know, whenever it was,

391
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:29,660
I had been born 10 years earlier,

392
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,200
I would have had 30 years of
life instead of 20 years of life.

393
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,020
That seems perfectly intelligible.

394
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,440
So it does seem as though
if we put our head into it,

395
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,370
we can get ourselves into thought
experiments where we say, yeah,

396
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,980
don't just ship the life,
make it longer.

397
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:51,070
But instead of making it longer
in the post death direction,

398
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:56,070
make it longer in the pre birth direction.
Well,

399
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:58,830
again, you can imagine somebody
saying, yeah, and when we do that,

400
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,870
we should feel the same.
W you know,

401
00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:02,610
it doesn't really matter
which direction it goes.

402
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,200
So symmetry is the right
answer after all wouldn't date.

403
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,120
When I think about the asteroid
example, I find myself thinking, Huh,

404
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:13,080
maybe symmetry is the right way to
way to go here. Maybe Feldman's right?

405
00:26:13,081 --> 00:26:17,490
That normally we just shift instead of
extending. But if I'm careful to extend,

406
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,020
maybe that really is bad that I didn't
get started sooner and have a longer life

407
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:25,150
in that direction.
Well,

408
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:27,190
here's one other answer
that's been proposed.

409
00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:31,810
This is by yet another contemporary
philosopher, Derek Parfitt. Parfitt says,

410
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:37,590
it's true that when I think about
the nonexistence after I die,

411
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:44,100
that's loss.
Whereas the nonexistence I'm born,

412
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:46,160
that's not lost,
that's near Schmall sauce.

413
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:51,470
And it's true that we need an explanation
about why loss is worse than small Os.

414
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:57,590
But we can see that this is not an
arbitrary preference on our part

415
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:06,000
because in fact it's part
of a quite general pattern
we have of caring about the

416
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:10,740
future in a way that we
don't care about the past.

417
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:16,580
This is a very deep
fact about human caring.

418
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:22,790
We are oriented towards the future and
concerned about what happens in it in a

419
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:27,000
way that we're not oriented and concerned
about what happened in the past.

420
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,560
Perfect. Got a very nice example to
sort of bring the point home. He says,

421
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,620
imagine that you've got
some sort of a conditioned,

422
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:38,220
some sort of medical condition that will
kill you unless you have an operation.

423
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,930
So fair or not,
if you're going to have the operation,

424
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:42,840
this will allow you to live your life.
Unfortunately,

425
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:47,100
in order to perform the operation,
they can't have you anesthetized.

426
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,180
You have to be awake perhaps in
order to, uh, tell the surgeon. Yeah,

427
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:52,920
that's where it hurts.
You know, whatever it is,

428
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,170
sort of like when the dentist pokes
and says, you know, does this hurt?

429
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:56,004
Does that hurt?

430
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:00,720
So you've got to be awake during the
operation and it's a very painful

431
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,680
operation.

432
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,540
Can't give you a painkiller because then
you won't be able to point out it does

433
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,430
this hurt,
does that hurt and so forth and so on.

434
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,310
Since we can't give you painkiller, all
we can do is this after the, so you'll,

435
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:16,800
you'll be awake during this
basically being tortured.

436
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:17,970
You'll be awake being tortured.

437
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,640
It's still worth doing it because this
will cure the condition and then you'll

438
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:25,430
have a nice long life.
Since we can't give you painkillers sends,

439
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,400
we can't put you out. All we're going to
do is, but we, what we will do is this,

440
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,350
after the operation is over,

441
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:36,351
we'll give you this very powerful
medication which will give you short term.

442
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,030
It's sort of very localized amnesia.

443
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,310
You won't remember anything
about the operation itself,

444
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,530
so you won't have to at least to dwell
upon these horrible memories of having

445
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:53,850
been tortured. Those will be completely
wiped out. Okay, so painful operation.

446
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:56,100
You're awake during it.
After the operation,

447
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,010
you're given this thing that makes you
forget whether you've had the operation,

448
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,900
you know anything about the operation
at all. The preceding 24 hours,

449
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:06,750
we'll be completely wiped out.
So you're in the hospital, uh,

450
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:10,140
and you wake up and you ask yourself,

451
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,540
have I had the operation yet?
Or not? Don't know. Right.

452
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:18,390
Because of course if I haven't had it,
no wonder I don't remember it.

453
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,440
But if I had had it,

454
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,110
I would've been given that
temporary sort of localized amnesia.

455
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,440
So of course I wouldn't know whether or
not I've had it. So you asked the nurse,

456
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,810
have I had the operation yet
or not? She says, I don't know.

457
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,460
We have a couple people on the,
on the hall today who are,

458
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,430
some of them have had it and some of
whom are hat I was scheduled to have it

459
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,250
later today.
I don't remember which one you are.

460
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,550
Let me go look at your file.
I'll come back and I'll tell you.

461
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,700
So she's wanders off. She's going to
come back in a minute or two. And as,

462
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,560
as you're waiting for her to come back,
you ask yourself,

463
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,320
what do you want the answer to be?

464
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:59,370
Are you indifferent or do you care
whether you're one of the people who's

465
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,710
already had it or somebody
who hasn't yet had it.

466
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,070
Now if you're like Parfitt and for that
matter like me, then you're going to say,

467
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,030
of course I care.
I want it to be the case that I,

468
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:13,390
one of the people who's
already had the operation.

469
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:19,110
I don't want to be one of the people who
hasn't yet had the operation might say,

470
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,330
how can that make any sense?

471
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,310
Your life's going to have the operation
sooner or later at some point in your

472
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:28,330
history,
life history,

473
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,710
that operation is going to have occurred
and so there's the same amount of pain

474
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:36,250
and torture regardless of whether you're
one of the people that had it yesterday

475
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,290
or one of the people.
It's going to have it tomorrow,

476
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,380
but for all that says Parfitt the fact
of the matter is perfectly plain that we

477
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:48,700
do care.
We want the pain to be in the past.

478
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,510
We don't want the pain
to be in the future.

479
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,710
We care more about what's happening in
the future than we care about what's

480
00:30:59,351 --> 00:31:03,820
happening in the past.
That being the case,

481
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,320
no surprise.

482
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:10,240
We care about the nonexistence in the
future in a way we don't care about the

483
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:14,620
nonexistence in the past.
Well,

484
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,070
that may be right as
far as explanation goes,

485
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:22,360
but we might still wonder whether or
not it's any kind of justification.

486
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,240
The fact that we've got this deep seeded,

487
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:30,241
asymmetrical attitude towards time doesn't
in any way as far as I can see yet.

488
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,830
Tell us whether or not
that's a justified attitude.

489
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:41,050
Maybe evolution built us to care about
the future in a way that we don't care

490
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:43,750
about the past and it
shows up in lots of places,

491
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,910
including parfaits hospital case,

492
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,800
including our attitude towards loss
versus small costs and so forth and so on.

493
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,390
But the fact that we've got this attitude
doesn't yet show that it's a rational

494
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,370
attitude. How could we show that
it's a rational attitude? Well,

495
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:04,240
maybe we'd have to start doing some
heavy duty metaphysics if what we've been

496
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:06,310
doing all so far.
It hasn't yet heavy duty enough.

497
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,030
Maybe we need to talk about the difference
between the metaphysical difference

498
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:14,230
between the past and the future.
The past is fixed.

499
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,350
The future is open,
the direction of time.

500
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,470
Maybe somehow we can bring all of these
things in and explain why our attitudes

501
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,230
towards time make sense.

502
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,750
I'm not going to go there.

503
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,080
All I want to say is it's not altogether
obvious what the best answer to

504
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,450
Lucretia pieces puzzle is.

505
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,920
So when I say,
as I had said,

506
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:45,920
and I'm going to say it many times
over the course of the remaining weeks,

507
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,160
that the central thing that's bad about
death is the fact that you're deprived

508
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:54,530
of the good things in
life. When I, when I,

509
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,140
when I make use of the
deprivation account,

510
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,670
I don't mean to suggest everything is
sweetness and light with regard to the

511
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:02,750
deprivation of cod,

512
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,900
I think there are some residual puzzles
about how it could be that death is bad

513
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:13,970
and in particular how it could be that
the deprivation of comp puts its finger

514
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:17,480
on what's bad about death.
But for all that,

515
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:19,940
it seems to me the right way to go.

516
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,650
It seems to me that the deprivation of
cow does put its finger on the central

517
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,280
bad thing about death most centrally.

518
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,970
What's bad about death
is that when you're dead,

519
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,390
you're not experiencing
the good things in life.

520
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:40,810
Death is bad view because you don't have
what life would bring you if only you

521
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:46,730
hadn't died. All right. If that's right.

522
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,890
Should we conclude?
In fact,

523
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:53,390
do we have to conclude if death is
bad because of it's a deprivation,

524
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,510
then if I wasn't dead,
I wouldn't be deprived.

525
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,900
So doesn't it follow then that the best
thing of all is never to die at all to

526
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:07,100
it in mortality?
If it's bad,

527
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:10,730
you're supposed to get hit by
a truck next week. That's bad.

528
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:12,200
Because if only I hadn't
gotten hit by a truck,

529
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,690
I might've lived another 2030 years,
whatever.

530
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,620
We've gotten the good things in life,
that would have been better for me. Ah,

531
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,900
but when I die, whatever it is, you know,

532
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:24,950
some heart disease at age 80 that's bad
for me because of only they didn't have

533
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:27,380
heart disease. I could have
lived another 10 15, 20 years,

534
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,700
gotten more good things in life.

535
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,880
If only I hadn't died at a hundred
would've gotten more good things in life,

536
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,970
only hadn't died at 500 would have
gotten more thing. Good things in life.

537
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,790
Whenever it is,
I die.

538
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:41,690
Won't it always be true if we accept
the deprivation account that if only I

539
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:44,630
hadn't died then I would've
gotten more good things in life.

540
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,560
And so whenever it is you die,
death is bad for you.

541
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:53,740
So the best thing for you would
be never to die in mortality.

542
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,623
Yeah.

543
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,580
Two questions really that we need to ask.
One is,

544
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,880
does consistency,

545
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,240
does logic require somebody who
accepts the deprivation account?

546
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:15,020
Does consistency required that if
you accept the deprivation account,

547
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,960
you believe in mortality is a good thing?

548
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,783
Yeah.

549
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,780
Second question.
Even if logic doesn't require that,

550
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,660
is it true that immortality
is a good thing?

551
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,270
Let me start with the first one cause I
think that's the easier one. Logic alone,

552
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,540
logic plus the consistency
requirement could either the uh, uh,

553
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:41,620
deprivation couch logic alone doesn't
require us to say mortality is a good

554
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:43,800
thing.
Why?

555
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:49,050
Because strictly speaking what
the deprivation accounts says,

556
00:35:49,051 --> 00:35:54,051
his death is bad in so far as you're
deprived of the good things in life by

557
00:35:56,461 --> 00:35:59,820
virtue of not existing,
if only hadn't got hit by that truck,

558
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,040
you would have gone onto an exciting life,

559
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:06,720
has your career as a professional dancer,
he would've had a family what happened,

560
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,321
whatever it is,

561
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:10,080
you would have traveled around the world
like it would've given you a lot of

562
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:13,230
great things and you get
deprived of those great things.

563
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,180
That's why it's bad that
you got hit by the truck.

564
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,260
That is to say death is bad when it's bad
by virtue of the fact that it deprives

565
00:36:22,561 --> 00:36:24,180
you of the good things in life,

566
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:29,010
but suppose we don't yet know
whether this could actually happen,

567
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:30,870
but he'll just talking
about logical possibilities.

568
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:36,020
Suppose that there is no more
good things for life to give you.

569
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,020
Then when you're deprived
of life by death,

570
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:44,730
you're not being deprived of any good
things and so it's not bad for you to be

571
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:46,200
dead at that point.

572
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,660
Death is only bad according
to the deprivation account.

573
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:56,670
When there are good things that would
have come your way. When I was new,

574
00:36:56,671 --> 00:36:57,840
I put it on balance.

575
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,590
The life you would have had would
have continued to be good for you.

576
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,390
When that happens,
then to lose that good bit of life,

577
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,650
that's bad for you.

578
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,380
But if it should turn out that what life
would have had here after instead of

579
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:17,850
being good would have been hellish.
It's not bad for you to avoid.

580
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:20,310
That might actually be
good for you to avoid it.

581
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:25,950
So even if we accept
the deprivation account,

582
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,810
we're not committed to the
claim that death is always bad.

583
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:35,930
We have to look and see what would
life actually hold out for us.

584
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:42,830
Logic alone plus the deprivation account
doesn't force us to say in mortality

585
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,110
would be a good thing.
After all,

586
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:51,890
this is really a crucial point to
understand things that are good for you in

587
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:58,581
limited quantities can become bad for
you if you get more and more and more and

588
00:38:00,871 --> 00:38:02,820
more of them.
But I love chocolate.

589
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:06,510
So I suppose somebody comes up to me with
a box of Godiva chocolate offers me a

590
00:38:06,511 --> 00:38:08,370
couple of chocolates and say,
wonderful,

591
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:13,371
I loved the dive of chocolate and then
you give me some more and some more 20

592
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:16,470
pieces of chocolate. Well, you know by
the time I got 20 pieces of talking about,

593
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,680
I'm not sure right now I
really want the 21st piece,

594
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,430
but you keep giving me some more 30 pieces
of chocolate, 40 pieces of chocolate,

595
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,700
a hundred pieces of
chocolate at some point. Not,

596
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:28,980
never act actually had as much talk.
I don't know what the point is,

597
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,170
but at some point I'm going to say,
you know,

598
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:36,010
although the first 10 2030 pieces
of chocolate, those were good,

599
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,740
but giving me the 21st piece of
chocolate or the 50th piece of chocolate,

600
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:45,310
no longer good.
Logically,

601
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:47,740
at least it could happen logically.

602
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:51,970
It could happen that although
in quantities, small quantities,

603
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,210
50 years, 60 years, a
hundred years, life is good.

604
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,870
At some point maybe life
would turn bad for us.

605
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,050
Just like being forced fed
more and more chocolate,

606
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,220
and if it didn't turn bad for us, the
deprivation account would allow us to say,

607
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,500
Oh,
at that point dying is not bad for you.

608
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,980
Well,
that's all that logic tells us.

609
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:19,981
Logic simply tells us we don't have to
believe in mortality is a good thing,

610
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:25,210
but for all that it could still be a good
thing. So that's question number two.

611
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,140
Let's ask,

612
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:31,060
what should we think about the
prospect of living forever?

613
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:35,860
Would in fact be better and
better and better? You know,

614
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,710
somebody dies at age 10
by some horrible disease,

615
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:42,850
better if they'd made it up to 40 somebody
dies at age 40 better if they made it

616
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:44,300
up to 80 somebody dies.

617
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:48,940
They pay at age 80 better if they made
it to a hundred 120 is it true that life

618
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:51,970
would get better and better
and better the longer it is?

619
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:54,800
Yeah.

620
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,480
Now in asking this question,

621
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:01,810
we have to be careful to be clear
about what exactly we're imagining.

622
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,430
Here's one way to try
to imagine that story.

623
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:11,730
Imagine that life is sort of
the way it works now with you.

624
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:18,181
So kind of the kinds of changes that
bodies undergo as they get older,

625
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:23,740
but instead of sort of those changes
basically killing you at 80 90 or a

626
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:27,580
hundred, they don't, you get
more and more of those changes,

627
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,230
but they never actually kill you.

628
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:31,283
Okay.

629
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,670
This is the thought sort of
thought experiment that, uh,

630
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:39,670
Jonathan Swift undertakes in the passage
from Gulliver's travels that I've had

631
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:40,420
you look at,

632
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:45,420
he imagines Gulliver coming to a country
where a subset of the people live

633
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:51,010
forever immortals. And at first
Gulf says, oh, isn't this wonderful?

634
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:56,100
But he forgot to think about the fact
that if the kinds of changes that we

635
00:40:57,131 --> 00:41:00,280
undergo continue to accumulate,

636
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,480
then you're getting older,
not just older,

637
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,800
but weaker in more and more discomfort.

638
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,280
Senility sets in with a vengeance until
eventually you've got these creatures

639
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,640
that live forever,

640
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:23,850
but their mind is gone and they're sort
of in pain and they can't do anything

641
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:27,460
because their bodies utterly
infirmed and diseased and sick.

642
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,330
That's not a wonderful thing to have.

643
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,030
If in mortality was that says swift,

644
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,450
that would be horrible for
an immortality like that.

645
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:40,670
Death would be a blessing.

646
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,860
And Montana in the essay that
I've had you look at says indeed

647
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:52,570
death is a blessing because it puts an
end to the pain and suffering and misery

648
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,470
that afflict us in our old age.

649
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,810
Well all of that seems right,
but I suppose we'd be forgiven by.

650
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:06,500
Thank you for thinking.
Look when we want it to be a mortal,

651
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,520
we didn't want this kind of life
going on and on and on with the same

652
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:15,620
trajectory,
the same downward trajectory.

653
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,840
We sort of want it to live forever.
Hale and hearty and healthy.

654
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,880
So even if the real world
wouldn't allow us that,

655
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:30,910
let's just ask science fictiony whether
or not in fact living forever would be

656
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:35,990
good. Isn't it? At least
true that in principle,

657
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,360
living forever could be good.

658
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:44,330
You got you gotta imagine sort of changing
some of the facts about what it would

659
00:42:44,331 --> 00:42:48,410
be like to live forever.
So instead of asking the question,

660
00:42:48,411 --> 00:42:49,650
the question I started with,
you know,

661
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,790
would it be good to live
forever if you're not careful?

662
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,010
This is going to be one like one
of those horror stories, right?

663
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:58,730
Where the where the what you will.
You've got a couple of wishes, you know,

664
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,270
and you weren't careful about how exactly
you state the wish and so you get what

665
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,600
you want, but it ends up
being a nightmare, right? If
you just tell the, you know,

666
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:08,150
the, the ferry, I want a, you
know, it gives you three wishes.

667
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,350
I want to live forever and you forgot
to say and be sure to keep me healthy.

668
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,630
Well, that's going to be a
nightmare. That's what swift
told us. So let's, let's,

669
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,920
let's be careful.

670
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,380
Let's throw in health and
anything else you want. Throw it.

671
00:43:23,381 --> 00:43:27,200
Throw in enough money to make
sure you're not poor for eternity.

672
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,620
Wouldn't that be horrible to be
healthy but impoverished forever?

673
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,110
Throw in whatever you want.

674
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,620
All we need to ask at this point is,

675
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:41,810
is there any way at all
to imagine in mortality?

676
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:46,280
We're in mortality of that
sword would be a good thing.

677
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:51,170
Is there any way to imagine existing
forever or that would be good for you

678
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:56,150
forever. Now it's very
tempting at this point to say,

679
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,580
look,
of course nothing could be easier.

680
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:03,670
Just imagine being in heaven forever,

681
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,870
right? You're done, right? You got
heavenly bliss. Isn't this incredible?

682
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,150
When we all love to be in heaven forever?

683
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:17,470
The trouble is we were a little bit
vague about what exactly life is like in

684
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,240
heaven.
It's,

685
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,440
it's a striking fact that even
those religions that promise us,

686
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,800
you know, an eternity in
heaven are rather shy on the

687
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,580
why because one might worry if you
actually tried to fill in the details,

688
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,840
this wonderful eternal existence ends
up not seeming so wonderful after all.

689
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:48,660
So, you know, imagine that what's
going to happen is that, you know,

690
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:53,520
we all become angels and we've gone
to spend eternity singing psalms.

691
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,900
Now I like psalms and I actually enjoy it.

692
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:01,170
Rather it's singing psalms
at services. I, I, uh,

693
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:06,050
on Saturday mornings I sing psalms
in Hebrew and I rather enjoy it. Uh,

694
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:11,090
but if you ask me what about the
possibility of an eternity of doing that,

695
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,630
that doesn't really seem so desirable?
Uh,

696
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:22,200
um, the dazzled, uh, not, not the remake,
haven't seen the remake, but the original,

697
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,450
uh, in, in the original,
um, uh, there's a,

698
00:45:25,451 --> 00:45:29,460
a human character who hooks up
with, uh, uh, the, the devil.

699
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,920
And he asked the DEA meat's
the devil and ask the devil,

700
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:35,470
so why did you rebel against God? And the
devil says, well, I'll show you. You know,

701
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:40,350
you sit here on the, on whatever
it was, the, um, uh, a mailbox,

702
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:44,820
I think it was, uh, um, uh, I'll set
up here in the mailbox. The devil says,

703
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:49,020
and you dance around me and say, oh,
praise the Lord. Aren't you wonderful?

704
00:45:49,021 --> 00:45:51,960
You are so magnificent. You so glorious.
And the human does this for a while.

705
00:45:51,961 --> 00:45:56,190
And he says, this has gotten
really boring. Can't we
switch? And the devil says,

706
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,570
that's exactly what I said.

707
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,740
Now when you try to imagine heaven
singing psalms for eternity,

708
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:09,270
that doesn't seem so attractive.
All right,

709
00:46:09,271 --> 00:46:11,910
so don't imagine heaven
singing psalms for eternity.

710
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,260
Just imagine something else.
But what?

711
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,090
Imagine what,

712
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:23,310
this is sort of the thought experiment
that I invite you to participate in.

713
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,880
What kind of life can you imagine such
that having that life forever would be

714
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:36,210
good, not just for another 10 years,
not just for another hundred years,

715
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:40,890
not just for another thousand years
or a million years or a billion years.

716
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:45,780
Remember eternity is a very,
very long time.

717
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,560
Forever goes on forever.

718
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:55,010
Can you describe an existence that you
would want to be stuck with forever?

719
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:58,400
Now,

720
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,920
it's precisely at this point that Bernard
Williams and another one had papers

721
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:05,760
that are had you take a look at burden.
Williams says no.

722
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:11,030
No kind of life would be one that would
be desirable and attractive forever.

723
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,930
No kind of life at all.

724
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,010
In short says Williams,

725
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,540
every life would eventually
become tedious and worse.

726
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,390
Excrutiatingly painful.

727
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:32,870
Every kind of life is a life you
would eventually want to be rid of.

728
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:39,580
Immortality far from being a wonderful
thing would be a horrible thing.

729
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:46,120
Suppose for the moment that we
were to agree with Williams,

730
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:51,190
what then should we say? We might say,
look, at least when we're being careful.

731
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,190
If we agree that in
mortality would be bad,

732
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:59,280
we can't say then that
death per se is bad.

733
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:04,480
The very fact that I am going to die,

734
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:08,320
it turns out not to be a
bad thing because after all,

735
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:13,321
the only alternative to
dying is in mortality and if
in mortality would be a bad

736
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:18,940
thing, then death is not a bad
thing. Death is a good thing.

737
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:24,030
We might say if we accept Williams's
thought the fact of our mortality is good

738
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:32,560
rather than bad,
if in mortality would eventually be bad.

739
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,650
Now of course crucial to notice
that even if we say this,

740
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:40,090
that doesn't mean that when you get
hit by a car tomorrow that that's good.

741
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,700
You don't have to say that.

742
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:48,160
You can still say it's a bad thing that
I got hit by a car tomorrow because

743
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:51,310
after all,
if I hadn't gotten hit by a car tomorrow,

744
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,160
it's not as though I would have
then been condemned in mortality.

745
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:58,930
I just would have lived another 10 or 20
or 30 years and those years would have

746
00:48:58,931 --> 00:49:03,220
been good ones for me and
maybe even when I die.

747
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,050
Let's suppose I lived to the ripe old age
of 100 when I die at a hundred I could

748
00:49:08,051 --> 00:49:13,051
perhaps still say it's a bad thing for
me that I die at the age of a hundred

749
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,390
because if I hadn't died now,

750
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:21,070
I might've lived another 10 2030
years and still enjoy things in life,

751
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:24,370
enjoy playing with my great grandchildren,
whatever it is.

752
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:29,290
To save it in mortality is bad,

753
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:34,350
is not to say it's a good
thing that we die when we do.

754
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:40,350
You can still believe consistency
consistently that we die too soon.

755
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:48,010
Even if in principle,
eventually, sooner or later,

756
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,930
death would no longer be bad.

757
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:55,020
It could be that it comes
too soon for all of us still.

758
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,470
The question we want to ask is,

759
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:04,860
is there any way even to imagine an
immortal life that will be worth having in

760
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:12,190
principle, could immortality be a good
thing or is Williams right that no,

761
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:17,220
even in principle goal is fantastic and
science fiction is you want in principle

762
00:50:17,411 --> 00:50:20,080
and a mortal life could not be desirable.

763
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:25,030
So until next time I invite you
to to think that question through.

764
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:27,880
If you're attracted to the
prospect of immortality,

765
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:32,020
what would the best kind
of immortal life be like?
