1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,990
Last time we talked about how you should
live your life in light of the fact of

2
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:10,350
our year mortality.
How does the fact that we will die,

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,010
how should that affect the way that we
live? What we're going to turn to now?

4
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:17,640
Our final topic for the semester is the,
it's the flip side.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,320
The fact of our mortality
raises the question as to
whether or not we should put

6
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:24,270
an end to our life.
Strictly speaking,

7
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:27,450
I suppose it's not the fact
that we're mortal per se.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,570
It's one of those extra features of
death that I've discussed previously.

9
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:35,571
The variability of death and more
particularly still the fact that we can

10
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:38,370
control how long we live,

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,180
we faced the possibility of ending our
life earlier than it would end otherwise.

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,100
That's suicide of course.

13
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:51,960
And so our final topic is under
what circumstances, if any,

14
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:55,350
does suicide make sense under
what circumstances, if any,

15
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:57,630
is it inappropriate thing to do now?

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,050
It's a fairly widespread feature of our
culture that suicide is looked upon with

17
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:07,980
such a mixture of sort of disdain,
fear,

18
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,020
uh,

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,010
finding it sort of offensive that it's
very hard often to think clearly and

20
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:15,630
discuss the topic.
Clearly.

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,530
Most people think it's either that
you've got to be crazy to kill yourself.

22
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:24,180
The very fact that you are contemplating
suicide is evidence that you're crazy.

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,140
And if you're not crazy, then it
shows that you're a moral. Uh,

24
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:32,340
so suicide is clearly never, uh,
never right the right thing to do.

25
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,440
So what I want to propose is that we take
some time and look at the questions on

26
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:41,760
both sides, uh, with a fair bit of
care. And the very first thing to do,

27
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:46,650
I think in thinking about the topic of
suicide is to distinguish questions of

28
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:51,651
rationality from questions of morality
that is wanting us to take a look at

29
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,260
initially the question under
what circumstances, if ever,

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,630
would suicide be the rational thing to do?

31
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,470
And then later turned to
the question when if ever,

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,000
would suicide be a morally legitimate
or morally permissible or morally

33
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:11,001
acceptable thing to do in posing a this
distinction have obviously presupposing

34
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:17,610
that these questions can come apart
or at least they need to be examined

35
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,983
separately.

36
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,280
Questions of rationality on the one hand
and questions of morality on the other.

37
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,990
These are both questions about arts
as we might put it there evaluative

38
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:32,250
questions but at least most people are
inclined to think that we are drawing on

39
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:36,510
different evaluative standards when we
raised the ones that have questions as

40
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:39,240
opposed to when we raised
the other in many cases,

41
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:44,241
no doubt rationality and morality go
hand in hand and there are philosophical

42
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:50,160
views about the nature of rationality
and the nature of morality according to

43
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:52,230
which they always go hand in hand,

44
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,580
but many of us are inclined to
think that they can come apart.

45
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,560
Take for example, given the the
season of the year that it is,

46
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,030
consider doing your income taxes or
more particularly still cheating on your

47
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:05,690
income taxes.
The,

48
00:03:05,691 --> 00:03:10,330
the rate at which income tax
forms get audited is very,

49
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:12,610
very slight and so,

50
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,560
and the fines tend to not be especially
egregious even if you do get caught.

51
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,960
So that from a rational point of view,

52
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:24,760
many of us might think it might well
be a rational decision to cheat,

53
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,890
not likely to get caught. Even if you do
get caught, how bad's the fine anyway.

54
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,040
But even if we were to agree
that it was rational to cheat,

55
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,360
most of us would then immediately go
watch or follow that remark up by pointing

56
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:43,890
out that doesn't at all mean that it's
morally acceptable to cheat on your

57
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:44,720
income tax.

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,780
There is a case perhaps where you're
morally required to do something that

59
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:53,781
you're not rationally required to do or
take a choice from the other point of

60
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:57,420
view.
There you are trying to decide between,

61
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,803
okay,

62
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,690
there you are trying to decide
between uh, your, uh, various, uh,

63
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,960
choices of college, uh,
and you've gotten into,

64
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,500
well Yale on the one hand and
perhaps some crummy school, you're,

65
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:15,840
you're second rate backup school,
uh,

66
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,990
on the other and you're trying
to decide what to do. There.

67
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,180
Well,
you might think to yourself morally,

68
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:27,960
I have no obligations here.
There's no particular obligation,

69
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,680
a moral requirement to go to the better
school rather than the worst school.

70
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,060
But for all that, it would be irrational
of me perhaps to go to the worst school.

71
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:38,670
So there's a case where there
is no moral requirement,

72
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,560
but there's a rational requirement.
Again,

73
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,380
we could debate the details
of the two examples,

74
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:47,220
but the point is just to show that in
principle, at least on the face of it,

75
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,080
these two questions can come apart.

76
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,310
Sometimes it's rationally acceptable
to do something, but it's a moral.

77
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,820
Sometimes it's morally acceptable to
do something, but it's irrational.

78
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,350
So I'm thinking about suicide.

79
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,280
We need to pose the two
questions one after the other.

80
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,020
So let's start with the question about
the rationality of suicide. When,

81
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:12,021
if ever is suicide a
rational decision to make.

82
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,381
Once again,

83
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:19,160
the first thing I want to do and thinking
about the rationality of suicide is to

84
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:23,390
distinguish two different issues
are two different questions.

85
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,650
First question is going
to be this. When, if ever,

86
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,860
would it be true that
you are better off dead?

87
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,650
Could it be the case that you know so
many of your life is going so badly that

88
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:41,000
you'd be better off dead?
Second question,

89
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,260
assuming that the answer to the first
question is under a such and such

90
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,350
circumstances, you would be better
off dead. We still have to ask,

91
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,800
could it ever be rational for you to
trust your judgment that this is one of

92
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:58,730
those cases in you're better off dead?

93
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,040
Could it ever be rational for you
to kill yourself? Conceivably,

94
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,800
the answer to the second might be no.

95
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,900
All right,
so the question was this.

96
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,500
It's conceivable that you might
have the thought like the following

97
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,250
in those circumstances in which life has
gotten so horrible that you'd be better

98
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:24,260
off dead.
He can't think clearly,

99
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,680
and the very fact that you can't think
clearly would entail that you shouldn't

100
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:34,550
trust your judgment that you
are in one of those cases.

101
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,910
Whether that's a good
argument or not or not.

102
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:39,350
It's something we'll
have to turn to later.

103
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:42,380
But it's because of the possibility
of that argument that I wanted to

104
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:44,540
distinguish the initial question.

105
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,400
Could it be true that you're better
off dead from the secondary question,

106
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,650
even if it could be true
that you're better off dead,

107
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,180
could it ever be a reasonable or
rational decision for you to believe that

108
00:06:56,181 --> 00:07:00,710
you're in one of those situations?
Unless we've got the two things in place,

109
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,340
it doesn't seem likely that it's ever
going to be rational to commit suicide.

110
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,300
So the very first topic we have to look
at is could it ever be true that you'd

111
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:15,851
be better off dead and immediately
there's a kind of logical worry that may

112
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:23,171
occur to some of you certainly has
been raised by various philosophers and

113
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:26,840
that's to say that the very judgment,

114
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,430
the very claim that Jones
would be better off dead,

115
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,520
can't make any sense on
the assumption that look,

116
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,940
in order to make comparisons better off,

117
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:43,580
worse off here he is in
such and such a situation,

118
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,650
he'd be better off in
that other situation.

119
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,990
You've got to be able to talk about on
the one hand what condition or state the

120
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:55,991
person is before and what condition or
state the person would be in afterwards

121
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:03,860
if they were to make that choice.
Call this the two state requirement.

122
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:08,450
Normally when we make judgements about
whether something would leave you better

123
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:12,230
off or worse off,
we satisfy the two state requirement.

124
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,410
You're trying to decide whether or
not to lose some weight and you think,

125
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:21,680
well, here's how well are off.
I am now being overweight.

126
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,970
Here's how well off I would be
later if I were to lose that weight.

127
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,890
I can compare the two states, say the
second states better than the first state.

128
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,100
That's what makes it true that I'd be
better off trying to decide whether or not

129
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:42,881
to marry the person or or break up with
the person or or pick this career or

130
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:45,380
change careers.

131
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,910
You've got the state you're in and you
compare it to the state you wouldn't be

132
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:54,650
in. You compare the two states.
That's what allows us to say, yeah,

133
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,210
I'd be better off or no,
I'd be worse off.

134
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,440
But when we're talking about
cases of suicide cases where,

135
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,060
well, here I am now the the before
state requirements in place.

136
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,283
But

137
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,060
if we contrast that with
the after state requirement,

138
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,190
well that part's not met right?

139
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:25,110
When you on the assumption that death
is the end that you won't exist.

140
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,690
Non-Existence isn't a
state that you will be in.

141
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,350
It's not a condition of
you because you know,

142
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,090
states and conditions
presupposes existence. We
can talk about are you happy,

143
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:41,940
are you sad, are you
bored, are you excited?

144
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,970
All those things presuppose
you're just even,

145
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,770
are you sleeping is a state or condition
you can be in because you exist.

146
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,880
But if I kill myself,
I won't exist.

147
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,380
There is no second state to compare.

148
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,620
So how can we possibly
say the objection goes,

149
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,700
how could we possibly say
that I'd be better off dead?

150
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,540
That seems to presuppose that there is
a second state that we can compare to my

151
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,840
actual state.
Since there isn't one the judgment,

152
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,860
I'd be better off dead,
can't even get off the ground and it it,

153
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,240
it's got a logical mistake
built right into it.

154
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,380
Well,
that's the objection and as I say,

155
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:28,680
there are a number of
philosophers who are drawn to it.

156
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:32,430
Maybe some of you are drawn to it as well.
It seems to me that it's mistaken.

157
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,750
Consider what we wanted to say.

158
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:38,710
When we talked about
the deprivation account,

159
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,580
the central account of
what's bad about death.

160
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
For most of us dying would be bad because
it would deprive us of the good things

161
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,970
in life that we would get
if only we didn't die.

162
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,090
That seemed like a natural thing to say.

163
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,890
It seems like an appropriate thing to say.

164
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:05,130
Of course we might ask if we believe
in the two state requirement,

165
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,750
how could we have said that after all
given the two state requirement to say

166
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:11,880
that death is bad for me,

167
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,740
I'd be better off staying alive if we
believe in the two state requirement,

168
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:19,890
we've got to say, oh, so had I died,

169
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:23,940
I would have been in some state that I
could compare to my current state and say

170
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:27,150
that it's worse.
But of course death isn't a state.

171
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,530
So the two state requirements
not met. Well, they might say,

172
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:35,980
this doesn't give us some pause if
the two state requirement, you know,

173
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,500
it'd be one thing if, if all of the two
state requirements said was, you know,

174
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,720
we can't ever say it'd be better off dead,

175
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,870
but it turns out the two
state requirements got
more implications in that.

176
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:50,250
It's got the implication that you can't
even say you're better off staying alive

177
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,060
and that's very,
very hard to believe.

178
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,870
Imagine that you've got some happy person,

179
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,960
some incredibly happy person
with old wonderful life.

180
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:06,400
It filled with whatever goods you
think are worth having in life,

181
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,580
love and accomplishment and
knowledge and whatever it is.

182
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:18,150
He's walking across the street and
he's about to get hit by a truck.

183
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,010
And so at some risk to yourself,

184
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,890
you leap into the way
pushing him out of the way,

185
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,890
saving his wife and happily
you don't get hurt either.

186
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,370
Okay?

187
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,720
He looks up and realizes he was
this close from death and he says,

188
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,690
thank you,
thank you for saving my life.

189
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,040
And now what you have to say is I'm
spread you rather confused because to say

190
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:48,171
thank you for my saving your life is to
presuppose I've benefited you in some

191
00:12:48,211 --> 00:12:48,990
way.

192
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,790
To presuppose I benefited you in
some way is to assume that you're,

193
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,910
it's a good thing that your
life has continued, but you see,

194
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:58,380
given the two state requirement,

195
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:02,220
we can't say it's a good thing that
your life continued because to sue state

196
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:05,820
requirement says we can only make that
kind of remark when there's a before

197
00:13:05,821 --> 00:13:09,360
state and an after state and the after
state would have been nonexistent.

198
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,170
So you see,

199
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,220
you're really rather philosophically
confused in thinking that I've done you

200
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:16,530
some sort of favor by saving your life.

201
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,750
I can't take that argument seriously.

202
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,850
It seems to me that,

203
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,960
and I hope that none of you
would take it seriously either.

204
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:34,650
Of course you are doing somebody
a favor when you save their life,

205
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,580
given the assumption that their life has
been ad would continue to be wonderful

206
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,630
and what that shows is not that.

207
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,690
So nonexistence really is a kind of
spooky super thin state or condition.

208
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,940
No, of course it isn't. Not
Existence is not existence.

209
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,280
It's no kind of condition or state at all.

210
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,460
What it shows is the two state
requirement isn't a genuine requirement.

211
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,370
I'm these sorts of evaluations.

212
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:11,350
We don't have to say that if you had
died when your toe pointed a person whose

213
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:16,280
life you said,
we don't have to say that had you died,

214
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,400
you would have been in
some inferior state.

215
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,520
We simply have to say the life you would
have had had I saved you and indeed

216
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:33,620
we'll have given that I have
saved you is a great life

217
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,380
since it's good to lose.

218
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:43,381
It would be bad since
losing it would be bad.

219
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,610
Saving it for you is benefiting you.

220
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,900
It's doing you a favor.

221
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,633
Okay.

222
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,640
To state requirements says otherwise
the two state requirements got to go,

223
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,740
but having gotten rid of it,
we can say the same thing in principle.

224
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,760
On the other side,

225
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,680
I imagine there was somebody
whose life was horrible,

226
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,600
full of pain and suffering and misery.
Now whether there could be such a person,

227
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:14,550
again, that's a question
we'll turn to in a second.

228
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,620
But if there were such a person,

229
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,370
then we can say for their life
to continue isn't good for them.

230
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,180
It's bad for them.

231
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:31,690
Their life is full of misery and suffering
and frustration and disappointment

232
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,160
and the more and more of that,

233
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:39,161
the worst and worst of life is to lead
a life of a hundred years where every

234
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:44,951
moment is torture and pain is worse than
a life of 30 years where every moment

235
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,460
is torture and pain.

236
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,880
So if you had such a person for
their life to go longer would be bad,

237
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,980
in which case for their life to be
going shorter would be better for them.

238
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,570
And that's all we mean when we
say they'd be better off dead.

239
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,540
Not that there's some spooky,

240
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:13,570
super thin and hard to describe condition
that they'd be in if they were dead.

241
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:20,020
But simply we look back at
the two possible lines they
could have just with the,

242
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,850
with the person whose life we saved,
the first person we, we compare the,

243
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,360
the great life that lasts a hundred years
versus the great life that only lasts

244
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:33,140
20 years because you didn't
save their life. We say, ah,

245
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,630
the life of a hundred years better life.

246
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,040
And so saving their life
is a good thing for them.

247
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,310
Similarly,
we compare the lives of misery,

248
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:46,760
the long life versus the short
life of misery. And we say, ah,

249
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,830
the long life of misery is a worse life
to have than the short life of misery.

250
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,320
And that being the case, we simply
can say you'd be better off dead,

251
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,770
not that you'd be in some condition.
That's a good one.

252
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,000
It's simply you'd avoid this condition,
which is a bad one.

253
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,750
And if a two state
requirement says otherwise,

254
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,690
so much the worse for the two
state requirement. All right,

255
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,120
so this was by way of the,

256
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,020
the logical worry that we can't even
get off the ground in talking about the

257
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:19,880
possibility that you'd be better off dead.

258
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,590
I think if we believed in the two state
requirement, maybe we'd have to say that,

259
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:29,620
but the cost of accepting the two state
requirement is so implausible that the

260
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:35,100
person's dying of a heart attack
and you perform CPR, right?

261
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,490
Instead of saying thank you,
they say, Oh, you know, I'm,

262
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,740
no really no better off than
I would have been if I died.

263
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:41,930
Even though I'm having a wonderful
life to stem requirements,

264
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:46,820
just so implausible, we should let it
go. Now, having done that, of course,

265
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,970
doesn't yet tell us that it could in fact
be the case that somebody's life could

266
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:56,010
be so bad that they'd be better off dead.

267
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,100
That the existence that they've got
is worse than not existing at all.

268
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,910
All we've done so far
is leave open the door,

269
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:09,750
open the door to a possibility
of saying that coherently.

270
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,450
But that doesn't mean it's true. Whether
or not they're couldn't be such lives.

271
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Depends on your view about what's
the correct account of wellbeing.

272
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:28,550
What is it that goes into making
somebody's life worthwhile?

273
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,590
Now, as we've seen previously,
this is a controversial topic.

274
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:39,770
People disagree about the ingredients
of the best kind of life and because of

275
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:43,950
these differences,

276
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:49,020
you're going to get
philosophical differences of
opinion with regard to whether

277
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:53,310
or not a life could be so bad,

278
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,040
that'd be better for it to come to an end.

279
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,500
I'm not going to try to rehearse all the
possible theories there are or for that

280
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:04,170
matter, even all the theories that
we've talked about previously.

281
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,080
But to give you an illustration
of how it couldn't be true,

282
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,460
imagine go back to our
simplest theory of wellbeing.

283
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,490
Hedonism according to which your quality
of life is a matter of adding up all

284
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:22,401
the pleasure and subtracting all the
pain and we need to take into account how

285
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:26,800
long the pleasures and the pains last
and how intense the pleasures and the

286
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:29,140
pains are.
But still we,

287
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,150
we add up this the total amount of
pleasure at if the total amount of pain,

288
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,740
subtract the pain from the pleasure and
look to see what our grand total is.

289
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,660
If it's positive, your life's worth
living and the greater the number,

290
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:45,990
the greater the positive number,
the more your life is worth living.

291
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,710
If it's negative though,

292
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,770
if your life is filled with pain and
suffering or at least so much pain and

293
00:19:56,881 --> 00:20:01,881
suffering that it outweighs
whatever pleasures you may
have in your life so that

294
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,230
your balance is a negative one,

295
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,360
then your life's not worth living
to having that go longer and longer.

296
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:12,060
It's just more and more negative balance.

297
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,480
That's a life that's bad for you to have
and you'd be better off not having it.

298
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,920
You'd be better off having your life
come to an end. You'd be better off dead.

299
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,490
And of course, the more and more
negative the grand total is,

300
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:31,770
the worse your life is.

301
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,360
And so the more it's true that
you'd be better off dead. Well,

302
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,270
that's what he knows him says.
If we're not hitting this,

303
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,910
and of course previously I've argued
that we shouldn't be hardness,

304
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,860
then we need a more complicated theory
of the good we need to throw in other

305
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,231
things.

306
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,260
Perhaps certain external goods that just
a matter of getting the insides right,

307
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,170
the pleasure and the pain
and the other mental states.

308
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,180
They're very facts about your objective
hookup with the rest of the world.

309
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:02,770
Are you really climbing Mount Everest?
Are you really accomplishing things?

310
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,200
Do people really love you
and so forth and so on.

311
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,160
Whatever your list is of
those other objective goods,

312
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,360
well you'll probably also want to have
a list of other objective bads besides

313
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,470
pain and but still the same basic
idea is going to be in place.

314
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:25,471
We're going to water somehow add up
all of the various objective goods,

315
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,880
add up all the various objective bads and
see where the balance lies to the good

316
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,860
outweigh the bad. If the goods
out weigh the bad, that's great.

317
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:40,000
Your life's worth living,
but if the bad outweigh the good,

318
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:45,090
then your life is not worth
living or not worth continuing.

319
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,360
Now,
as we've noted before,

320
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,280
there are philosophical theories
which go on to claim, pessimists,

321
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:58,570
various versions of pessimistic
views which say for everybody in all

322
00:21:58,571 --> 00:21:59,950
circumstances,

323
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,300
life is so bad that
they'd be better off dead.

324
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,040
Life's so full of suffering and misery
that whatever pleasures there are and

325
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:12,790
other goods they may be in the life they
get outweighed by the objective bads.

326
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,910
There are philosophical views like that,

327
00:22:15,911 --> 00:22:20,830
but I suppose the common sense view is,
well,

328
00:22:20,831 --> 00:22:25,480
even if some lives may be so bad
that the person's better off dead.

329
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,460
That's not true of all lives.

330
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:31,630
It depends on the facts of the case,

331
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,340
so let's focus on that possibility.
Of course.

332
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,540
Even here we still have to
return to another issue that
we've considered before.

333
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:45,630
Namely is life itself worth having is
the very fact that you're alive itself a

334
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:51,400
good thing?

335
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:56,620
These are the valuable container theories
which I've previously contrasted with

336
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:58,000
the neutral container theories.

337
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,560
You'll recall that according
to the neutral container
theories in thinking about

338
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:06,100
the quality of someone's life,
you just look at the contents.

339
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,420
Life itself is only a container,
good or bad,

340
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:11,860
depending on what it's filled up with,

341
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,530
but opposed to the neutral
container theories.

342
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:19,650
We had valuable container theories which
say the very fact that you're alive add

343
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:26,410
some positive value above and beyond
whatever's going on in your life.

344
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,090
Now, even the valuable
container theories came in.

345
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:35,560
Different versions that were more
modest versions were in principle,

346
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,920
the positive value of being
alive could be outweighed.

347
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:43,921
If the contents got bad enough and we
contrast that with fantastic container

348
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:48,470
theories according to which
being alive is so valuable,

349
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,050
then it doesn't matter
how bad the contents get.

350
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,830
The grand total is always a positive one.
Now look,

351
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,030
if you accept a fantastic
container theory,

352
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:04,810
then pretty clearly it's never true
that somebody could be better off dead

353
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,280
because no matter how
bad the contents get,

354
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:11,670
okay,

355
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:15,720
the fact that they're alive
per say is so valuable,

356
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:20,721
it outweighs that subtotal
giving us a positive grand total.

357
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,533
Okay,

358
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:27,630
so pretty clearly from the perspective
of fantastic container theories,

359
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:32,770
suicide will never be rational because
it's never true that you're better off

360
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:38,771
dead because it's never true that your
life overall taking everything that's

361
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:41,540
relevant into consideration
gives us a negative.

362
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,003
Yeah.
Question.

363
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,560
What's
intrinsically good

364
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,900
question was on the
fantastic container theories.

365
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,200
What's so incredible about life itself?

366
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:03,400
Are we saying it's intrinsically valuable
and yes, the answer is precisely right.

367
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,520
The fans of the valuable container
theories are saying being alive itself is

368
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:13,090
valuable. You may recall that I previously
said, although people talk that way,

369
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,850
they probably don't actually mean
it, right? If you talk to them, okay,

370
00:25:15,851 --> 00:25:19,210
you can be alive as a blade of
grass, they wouldn't say, oh,

371
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:20,021
wouldn't that be wonderful?

372
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:25,021
That's worth having most fans of the claim
that being alive per say is valuable.

373
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:27,550
Don't really mean life per se.

374
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:32,290
They mean something more
like life as a person,

375
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:33,580
you know,

376
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,320
being the kind of entity who can think
and plan even if the it what your,

377
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:40,060
your plans go wrong.

378
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:44,380
At least you were a person
able to experience things,

379
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:45,730
know things and so forth.

380
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,450
Of course,

381
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,260
if that's the reason for accepting the
fantastic container theory that we might

382
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:54,651
wonder,

383
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:59,651
what should we say about those cases where
the p functioning has decayed and the

384
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,910
person is no longer able
to continue as a person,

385
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,080
but perhaps can still
feel pain in that case?

386
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:12,920
Perhaps life could cease to be worth
living though you know whether or not we

387
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:14,240
should describe it in that way.

388
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:17,480
Also too depends on these complicated
issues that we've discussed previously

389
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:20,390
about would that still be you?
Would you still exist?

390
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:22,670
Would you still be alive
under those circumstances?

391
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:27,970
So the basic idea behind
valuable container theories
is that life or the life of

392
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:33,320
a person or something like that has
intrinsic value above and beyond the

393
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:35,930
question of what's going
on within your life.

394
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,690
If we accept the fantastic
container theory,

395
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:45,900
maybe nobody's life is ever so bad,

396
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:50,580
grand total because that's so that
suicide would be the rational thing to do

397
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:55,470
because the value of life per se, so
incredible that it outweighs the contents,

398
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:58,560
it has to outweigh the contents.
That's, that's a philosophical view.

399
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,460
At the opposite end of the pessimists.
The pessimists said,

400
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,500
as a matter of philosophical reflection,

401
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:07,230
we can see that everybody's
life is worse than nothing.

402
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,830
The fantastic container fans are saying,

403
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:12,390
it's a matter of philosophical reflection.

404
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:15,960
We can see that everybody's
life is better than nothing.

405
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:21,180
Most of us, I imagine, find
ourselves somewhere in between.

406
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:25,530
Either we believe in the neutral container
theory and think it's a contingent

407
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:28,320
matter whether the contents
are sufficiently good or bad,

408
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:33,560
or we may accept the modest version of
the valuable container theory and that

409
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:39,030
theory. Of course, life
has some intrinsic value,

410
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,780
but it's got a finite intrinsic value.
And in principle,

411
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:47,280
even that could be outweighed if the
contents get bad enough. And so again,

412
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:51,060
it will be an empirical question.
We have to take a look and see.

413
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,050
In which cases do the
contents get bad enough?

414
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,570
Now, I guess I'm one of
these people in the middle.

415
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,370
I'm inclined to think it's not true that
everybody's life is worse than nothing.

416
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,580
Nor is it true that everybody's
life is better than nothing.

417
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,760
It varies from person to person and
indeed not just since we're thinking about

418
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:15,810
suicide, we're not talking
about their life as a whole,

419
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:19,770
but really what does life
promise from here on out?

420
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,790
Sadly to enough sad to say,

421
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,900
it seems to me there are
cases and probably most of
us are familiar with cases

422
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,380
where the correct
description given the your,

423
00:28:31,381 --> 00:28:36,381
your favorite theory of wellbeing is
going to be that for this person here on

424
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,980
out what life has to offer is
sufficiently bad so that the contents are

425
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:48,621
sufficiently negative as to outweigh
whatever value life itself might have.

426
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,240
We could imagine somebody in the terminal
stages of some illness where their

427
00:28:58,411 --> 00:29:03,411
cancer perhaps is causing them a great
deal of pain and the pain is so bad that

428
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,620
they can't really do
much of anything else.

429
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,620
It's not as though they can
continue working on their,

430
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,330
their novel or continue talking with the
members of their family because they're

431
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:20,331
just distracted by the pain and wishing
it would come to an end horribly enough

432
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:26,270
in many degenerative diseases leave the
person less and less capable of doing

433
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:29,580
the things that give life value.

434
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,460
And the very realization that you're
in that situation and no longer able to

435
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,180
spend time doing things or
hanging out with your family or,

436
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,710
or talking with them or whatever it is,

437
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,890
may itself be a source of
more frustration and pain.

438
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:51,620
There are medical conditions were horribly
enough infants get born where they're

439
00:29:53,641 --> 00:29:57,840
just in, in, in continual pain and
they never develop cognitively.

440
00:29:57,841 --> 00:30:01,110
Their brain doesn't develop and then
they die and you look at these lives and

441
00:30:01,111 --> 00:30:02,400
you say,
these are lives.

442
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:07,430
I want to say these are lies
that were not worth having.

443
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:12,570
These children would have been better
off never having been born at all.

444
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:17,190
Certainly not any kind of favor
for them to continue their lives.

445
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:18,810
Well,

446
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:23,810
let's focus on some case like the the
terminal patient persons got a disease.

447
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,290
At least that would be a nice easy
example. Not Easy to live through,

448
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:32,820
but easy philosophically easy example to
think about some terminally ill patient

449
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,440
whose disease is getting worse and worse
and so there are fewer and fewer of the

450
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:41,370
good things in life that the
future holds for them. Instead,

451
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:44,430
what the future holds
is more and more pain,

452
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,670
suffering incapacity and frustration.

453
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,720
When it gets bad enough,
it seems to me in some of those cases,

454
00:30:51,721 --> 00:30:55,410
the person can correctly say,
oh,

455
00:30:55,411 --> 00:31:00,150
we at least can correctly say of them.
They'd be better off dead.

456
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,443
All right,

457
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:07,170
let me try to draw some examples.
Again,

458
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,700
we're bracketing the question,

459
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:13,440
can the person think clearly about
their case? That'll come later.

460
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:18,590
Let's just try to talk about
when would suicide make sense,

461
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:24,030
when would it be sort of a rational
thing to do to end your life.

462
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,660
Couple of different cases

463
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,330
going to draw graphs.

464
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,690
ELEKTA x axis represent time

465
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,853
and

466
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:49,310
the y axis represents how good
or bad your life is at that time.

467
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,540
For those of us who are fans of
the neutral container theory,

468
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,340
the thing to say is this represents the
overall goodness of your contents or the

469
00:32:01,341 --> 00:32:04,880
overall badness of your contents. The
higher up, the better the contents,

470
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,350
the lower down,
the worst.

471
00:32:06,351 --> 00:32:11,351
The contents for those who are fans
of the modest container theory,

472
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,600
this represents the grand balance,

473
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:19,690
so it's contents plus the extra
bit you get from being alive.

474
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,570
But of course if you're a fan
of the modest container theory,

475
00:32:23,571 --> 00:32:27,110
then even if the contents are negative,
the grand belts might still be positive.

476
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,860
But this represents the
overall bottom line,

477
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,610
whether you accept the neutral container
theory or the modest container theory.

478
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,680
So here's an example of
what a life look like.

479
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:45,100
It's going along pretty well and then
things get worse and things sort of

480
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:48,230
deteriorate.
And let's suppose

481
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,070
this point represents when you would
die of natural causes, natural death.

482
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:00,740
So towards the end lives not as great as
it was when you were young and vigorous

483
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:03,890
and healthy and adults, all sorts of
opportunities and accomplishments,

484
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,290
but still till the very end,

485
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:11,050
it stays positive.
Well,

486
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,080
if that's what your life line
would look like pretty clearly,

487
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,810
suicide doesn't ever make any sense.

488
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,950
In particular. You wouldn't
want to say, oh look,

489
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:27,910
here's the place where I
should kill myself because
here's where things start to

490
00:33:27,911 --> 00:33:32,050
get worse. Yes, things are
beginning to get worse,

491
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:36,520
but they never get so bad
that you're better off dead.

492
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,120
So suicide wouldn't make any sense at all

493
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,650
for suicide to make sense.

494
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:51,250
It's gotta be the case that your
life takes a turn for the worse,

495
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,530
not just any old turn for the worst,

496
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,680
but it turns so much for the worse
that for some chunk of your life,

497
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,110
okay,

498
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:05,250
your life has worse than non
existence. The zero line, the x axis.

499
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:11,190
All right. I imagine that's
what's happened. You know
here you are, you're healthy,

500
00:34:11,191 --> 00:34:12,900
you're vigorous,
you're accomplishing things,

501
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:17,340
but you've got some degenerative disease
that's going to make things worse and

502
00:34:17,341 --> 00:34:17,611
worse.

503
00:34:17,611 --> 00:34:22,611
Here's the period which is getting worse
and then after a while your existence

504
00:34:22,831 --> 00:34:24,240
is going to be worse than nothing.

505
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,230
Here we can at least broach the
question in an intelligible way.

506
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,210
Might suicide makes sense.

507
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,990
Suppose this is the point
where the downturn begins.

508
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:39,660
Should you kill yourself at that stage?
No,

509
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:44,130
because after all,
even though there's a downturn,

510
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:49,080
things are getting worse. There's still
going to be another period of life,

511
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:53,100
another chunk of whatever it is, year,
five years, six months, whatever it is,

512
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:57,810
where although life isn't as
good as it had been before,

513
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,450
it's still better than nothing.

514
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,090
Yeah.

515
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:07,090
Killing yourself at this earlier
moment is we might say premature.

516
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,310
It's throwing away a chunk of life
that would still be worth having.

517
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,940
It's not the right thing to do.
It doesn't make sense. Rationally,

518
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,770
well, if not that moment.
What about this moment?

519
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:30,930
Here's the precise point at which your
life is becoming worse than nothing.

520
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,370
For some initial stretch of that,
it won't be very much worse than nothing,

521
00:35:36,371 --> 00:35:39,690
but still overall it's a negative.

522
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:45,620
Up to that moment your life was worth
living from that moment on your life is

523
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:47,460
worse than nothing.

524
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,960
If you've got complete control
over when to kill yourself,

525
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,210
well that would be the time to do it.

526
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,410
Suppose you don't have complete control.

527
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,300
I mean it's straight forward
enough to say if you've,

528
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:10,090
if your life is going to become worse
than nothing and you have complete control

529
00:36:10,091 --> 00:36:13,840
over when you kill yourself,
seems pretty plausible to say.

530
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:17,590
The precise moment at which suicide would
become rational would be exactly that

531
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:21,710
moment at which your life became
not worth having,

532
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:26,360
but you might not have
that kind of control.

533
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:32,910
Suppose that what you've got is a
degenerative disease that is going to

534
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,530
progressively strip.
You have the ability to control your body.

535
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:44,030
So your mind works for a much longer time.
And so for a period of time you're,

536
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:49,180
you're basically stuck in your hospital
bed being fed by somebody else,

537
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,980
but perhaps you're able to listen to
your family, talk about things, uh,

538
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,780
have books read to you.
Maybe you can engage in conversation,

539
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,610
even though you can't use
your arms and so forth,

540
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,110
your life is still worth living.

541
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:04,940
But the time's gonna come when
your life won't be worth living.

542
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,100
And at that point,

543
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:12,340
you'll no longer have the ability to
kill yourself because you won't have

544
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:14,120
control over your body.

545
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:16,450
Yeah,

546
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,550
raises the question,
I'm sure you can all see at this point,

547
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:23,080
the question I'm suicide also turns into
or comes up against the question about

548
00:37:23,081 --> 00:37:25,210
euthanasia or mercy killing.

549
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,380
Under what circumstances is it ever
rational to ask somebody else to kill you?

550
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:34,510
Under what circumstances, if ever, is it
morally legitimate to kill somebody else?

551
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:39,520
But let's continue to focus
on the case of suicide.

552
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:44,580
Suppose you will live in a society which
is so unenlightened as to have ruled

553
00:37:45,701 --> 00:37:48,250
out euthanasia.
In fact,

554
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,200
you live in our society and so what
we don't allow is the possibility of

555
00:37:53,201 --> 00:37:57,490
somebody else coming along and
killing you when the time comes.

556
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:03,270
So you know that time is going to come
at which you'd be better off dead,

557
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:08,500
but once you're there, once you're
here, it's too late. You can't do it.

558
00:38:08,501 --> 00:38:11,680
You won't have the ability
to kill yourself and nobody
else will be able to do

559
00:38:11,681 --> 00:38:14,290
it for you.
In that case,

560
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:19,300
killing yourself earlier
might still make sense.

561
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,400
Take this earlier point.
For example

562
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,290
here,

563
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:29,940
if you kill yourself now you're throwing
away some life that's worth living,

564
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,860
but if this is the last moment at
which you're going to be able to kill

565
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,703
yourself,

566
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,400
it might still make sense rationally
because your choice is not ended here or

567
00:38:42,911 --> 00:38:44,140
ended there.

568
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:49,290
We're assuming you don't
have the possibility of
ending it here at the precise

569
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:52,960
moment at which life became
no longer worth having.

570
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:58,290
Your choice instead is really just this
ended here and throw away this whole

571
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:01,300
last bit or not.

572
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:05,680
And it and then continue until
you die from the disease.

573
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,100
So your question is only,

574
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:14,460
what do I think about the value
of this last bit on the whole,

575
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:17,200
it's got a good part
and it's got a bad part.

576
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,270
Is it better to have the good part and
the bad part or better to have none of

577
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:26,260
it? And the answer of course is, well,

578
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:28,930
if the bad part is going
to continue long enough,

579
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,840
it's better to have none of it.

580
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:37,410
The bad outweighs the good so that the
rational thing to do would be to decide

581
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,920
to end your life then when you still can,

582
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:47,040
rather than condemn yourself to
the long final stretch of life,

583
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,430
not worth living.

584
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,913
Well,

585
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,700
what if the last time that you could
actually control it was way back here,

586
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:06,480
but for whatever reason it is
here,

587
00:40:06,481 --> 00:40:09,990
you've got access to the means of killing
yourself and you won't have access

588
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,340
later.
Your life still gone.

589
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:17,360
It'd be great for a very long time and
then inevitably it will be bad for a

590
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:23,130
period of time. But at least if I've drawn
it right, if not, we can shorten this.

591
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,690
And I'm supposed to death would come here.

592
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,300
Here's a case where if
you don't kill yourself,

593
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:36,500
now you're condemning yourself
to the whole rest of the story.

594
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,290
But it might say,
alright,

595
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,250
although admittedly the end of
the story is going to be negative.

596
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,400
The only way to avoid that negative last
part is to throw away this very long,

597
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,620
great initial part that
doesn't make sense.

598
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,350
Although your life and now still going
to be a mixture of good and bad and you

599
00:41:00,351 --> 00:41:03,800
wish thorough way to end it here,

600
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,530
you don't have that choice.

601
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,210
It's throw away the good and the bad
or keep them both. And in this story,

602
00:41:11,211 --> 00:41:12,080
obviously enough,

603
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:16,730
the good is enough to outweigh the bad,

604
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,230
so suicide doesn't make
sense in that situation.

605
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:27,790
Here's a rather different,
wait, the story might go,

606
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,010
suppose

607
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,730
your life's going along really great
and it takes a turn for the worse,

608
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:43,580
but then it's going to get better.
Told ends here.

609
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,830
Death by natural causes.

610
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,430
Good suicide.
Make sense here?

611
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,823
Yeah.

612
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,540
Does it make sense to say,
look,

613
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,260
I'm going to kill myself in order
to avoid the downturn or indeed,

614
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,730
even if there were,
the recovery wasn't so long a recovery.

615
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:11,390
Good suicide make sense here because
you're about to take this big dip down and

616
00:42:11,941 --> 00:42:16,560
be condemned to most of the rest of your
life being significantly worse than it

617
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:18,540
was before.
No,

618
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:23,930
suicide doesn't make sense in this
situation because even though what you're

619
00:42:25,471 --> 00:42:30,471
going to have during this period is a
life worse than the life you had before.

620
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:35,700
The life you've got here
is still above the x axis.

621
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,530
It's still a life worth living.

622
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:41,580
This point I think is probably crucial
enough that it's worth taking a moment to

623
00:42:41,581 --> 00:42:46,581
reflect on the fact that your life
is less good than it had been.

624
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,600
Less good than indeed maybe all the lives
around you are having all the people

625
00:42:53,911 --> 00:42:57,870
around you are having lives that are
better than yours still doesn't mean that

626
00:42:57,871 --> 00:43:02,871
your life is so bad that
you're better off dead.

627
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,040
It's easy to lose sight of that.

628
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,040
Right here we are sliding down and all
we see is sort of the fact that we're

629
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,900
moving down. It's natural to
get caught up in the thought,

630
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,710
I'm better off dead,
but it's a mistake.

631
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,760
You're not better off dead.
This situation I suppose is probably,

632
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,400
I always worry when I spent,

633
00:43:26,401 --> 00:43:29,550
when I end this class teach talking
about suicide because look, you know,

634
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:32,760
what's the major cause of death
among teenagers? Well, it's suicide.

635
00:43:32,761 --> 00:43:35,130
That's not really saw that
surprising because you know,

636
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,940
teenagers are pretty healthy
as people go, ah, and so the

637
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:43,680
[inaudible] get killed by an accident or
you're going to kill by doing it to do

638
00:43:43,681 --> 00:43:44,514
yourself.

639
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:51,020
The kind of mistake that I think leads
most teenagers into killing themselves is

640
00:43:52,321 --> 00:43:56,940
something like this. No, they've
broken up with their girlfriend.

641
00:43:56,941 --> 00:43:59,010
They flunked out of school.

642
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:03,180
They didn't get into medical school
or law school or what have you,

643
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:08,280
and they think to themselves, ah, from
here on out, my life's not worth living.

644
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:12,150
The answer is no.
That's actually as an objective matter,

645
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,400
probably not the case.

646
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,840
Even if your life would be less worth
living then you had hoped it would be.

647
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,020
It's still better than nothing,
of course. And the typical case,

648
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,050
I suppose what it really
looks like is this

649
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,490
small dip thing continues wonderfully,

650
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,100
but you sight of all the good stuff yet
to come while you're in the middle of

651
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:35,963
the dip.

652
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:41,070
So although I'm taking time
now to talk about the question,

653
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,390
under what circumstances might
suicide be a rationally justified one,

654
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:50,540
I should hasten to add the remark that
I'm fairly confident that for nobody in

655
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:55,260
this class would suicide,

656
00:44:55,261 --> 00:44:58,170
in fact be a rational decision.

657
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:03,590
That doesn't mean it couldn't turn out
to be a rational decision later in your

658
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:06,390
life,
but that very likely,

659
00:45:06,391 --> 00:45:09,990
overwhelmingly likely is not one now.

660
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,130
Well, a couple of other cases that
I still want to have us consider it,

661
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:15,690
but I think that's
probably enough for today.

662
00:45:15,691 --> 00:45:17,130
So we'll take it up there next time.
