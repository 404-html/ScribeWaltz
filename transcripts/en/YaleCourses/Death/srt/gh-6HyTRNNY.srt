1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,880
First question we want her discuss
has to do with the possibility of my

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:09,120
surviving my death.
Is there life after death?

3
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:13,620
Is there a possibility that I might
still exist or survive after my death?

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,430
Now at first glance,

5
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:20,250
and in fact I think at second glance
is going to turn out to be true.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,900
You might think that the answer to
this question would depend on two basic

7
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:28,770
issues. You know, do I survive my
death? Do we survive our deaths?

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,990
You think first thing we'd have to
get clear on is, well, what am I,

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,020
what kind of a thing am I?

10
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:41,370
Or generalizing what kind of a thing
is a person? What are we made of?

11
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:43,260
What are our parts?

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,150
It seems plausible to think that
before we can answer the question,

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,020
you know, do I survive? We
need to know how I'm built.

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,580
And so the first thing we're going to
spend a fair bit of time on is trying to

15
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:58,680
get clear on what's up person.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,610
What are the fundamental fundamental
building blocks of a person?

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,840
Second question that you might think
we'd want to get clear on is what's the

18
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:11,720
idea or what's the concept of surviving?
So we need to get it task, you know,

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,020
do I survive?

20
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:17,010
We need to get clear on what
am I and what is it to survive?

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,960
What is it for something that
exists in the future to be me.

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,880
Now this question can be discussed
philosophically and quite general terms.

23
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:31,860
What's the nature of persistence
of identity over time?

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,050
But since we're especially
interested in beans like us people,

25
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,590
uh,

26
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,120
this topic is sort of sub specialized
version of the question of identity gets

27
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:46,050
discussed under the rubric of the topic,
personal identity.

28
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:51,000
What's the key or the nature or the basis
of personal identity as we might put

29
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:51,300
it?

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,300
What is it for somebody who's here
next week to be the same person as me?

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,730
What's the nature of personal
identity? So as I say, at first glance,

32
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:06,420
you might think, well, to
get clear on the answer,

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,890
do I or might I or could
I survive my death?

34
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,370
We need to know what am I,
what's a person?

35
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,000
What's the metaphysical composition
of people on the one hand?

36
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,720
And we need to get clear on the nature
of identity or persistence or more

37
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:24,480
specifically personal
identity. Now, as I say,

38
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,730
I believe that when push comes to shove,

39
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,970
we do need to get clear about
both of those questions.

40
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:33,090
And so that's going to take the
first several weeks of the class.

41
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:37,950
We're going to spend a couple of weeks
talking about what's a person and then

42
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:39,180
we're going to spend several weeks,

43
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:43,410
or at least a week or so talking
about the nature of personal identity.

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,140
But before we can even get started,
there's a question,

45
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:52,340
really an objection to the
whole enterprise. You know,

46
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,410
so we're about to spend a lot of time
asking the philosophical question,

47
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:58,500
is there life after death? Could
there be life after death? Uh,

48
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,070
might I survive my death?

49
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,790
But there's a philosophical
objection to the entire question.

50
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,760
And the objection is fairly simple.
It says,

51
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,540
the whole question is misconceived.
It's,

52
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,550
it's based on a confusion.

53
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,180
Once we see the confusion,

54
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,750
we can see what the
answer to our question as,

55
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:22,750
could I survive my death?
The answer has got to be,

56
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:26,980
this is what the objection
says. The answer's got to
be, obviously not. All right.

57
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:27,280
So here,

58
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,570
here's the objection and I should
mention that the very first reading that

59
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:35,620
you're going to be doing a as a
couple of pages from Jay Rosenberg,

60
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,930
a contemporary philosopher,

61
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,290
and he gives us a version
of this objection.

62
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,480
So I'll give you one version. You'll have
another version in your readings. The,

63
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:48,070
the, the objection basically says, look,

64
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,710
what does it mean to say that somebody
died? You know, we're asking, you know,

65
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,410
is there life after death? What does it
mean to say that somebody has died? Well,

66
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:58,270
a natural,
uh,

67
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,470
definition of death might be
something like the end of life.

68
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,320
All right, so then if
that's right, then to ask,

69
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:08,110
is there life after death is just asking,

70
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,860
is there life after the end of life?

71
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,060
And the answer to that ought
to be pretty obvious. Well,

72
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:20,890
obviously the answer to that is
no. After all, if we're saying,

73
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,300
once you've run out of life,
is there any more life?

74
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,940
Well, Duh, the answer that's, that's,

75
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,560
that's like asking when I've eaten up
all the food on my plate or is there any

76
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:37,561
food left on my plate or what happens
in the movie after the movie ends?

77
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,830
These are stupid questions because once
you understand what they're asking,

78
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,710
the answer is just built in.
It follows trivially.

79
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,060
So although it has seemed to people over
the ages that the question is there,

80
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:54,400
life after death is one
of the great mysteries.

81
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:59,401
One of the great philosophical things to
ponder the objection says that's a kind

82
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:03,940
of illusion. In fact, once you think
about it and not all that long,

83
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,550
you can see the answer's got to be no,

84
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:09,160
there couldn't possibly
be life after death.

85
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:12,760
There couldn't possibly be
like after the end of life.

86
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,970
Or suppose we ask the question
in a slightly different way,

87
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,100
might I survive my death?
Well,

88
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:25,360
what does the word survive
mean? Well, you know, survive.

89
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:28,150
It's something like we say
that somebody who's a survivor,

90
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:32,980
if something's happening,
they haven't, uh, they haven't
died. They're still alive.

91
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,730
Uh, you know, when there's a
car accident, you ask, you know,

92
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,700
so and so died so and so's
survived. Uh, you know,

93
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:41,830
this person survived to
say that they survived.

94
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:44,290
It's just saying that they're still alive.

95
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,940
So might I survive my death?

96
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,560
Is like asking,

97
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,930
might I still be alive
after? Well, what's death?

98
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:57,100
Death is the end of life.

99
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,670
So might I still be alive
after I've stopped living?

100
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,950
Uh, might I be one of the people
who didn't die when I died? Oh Gosh.

101
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,890
The answer that is, again, Duh. No,

102
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,180
you couldn't possibly survive your death
given the very diff that this should

103
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:17,030
remind us of a,
I don't know.

104
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:20,840
At least it reminds me of this joke that
you probably told it seemed hysterical

105
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:23,780
when you were were seven, right? The, um,

106
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:29,350
plane crashes a exactly on the border
of Canada and the United States.

107
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,390
Exactly. On the border. And there
there's dead people everywhere.

108
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,920
Where do they bury the survivors?
And the answer is, well,

109
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,900
you don't bury the survivors, you know,
so when you're 70 you think, I don't know,

110
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:47,170
do they buried them in Canada and they
buried America, right? The answer,

111
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,210
you don't bury the survivors because
survivors or people that haven't yet died.

112
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,720
So can I survive my death is like
asking could I not have yet died after?

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,850
And the answer is no.

114
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:05,510
Of course you have to have died if you
died and you haven't survived if you've

115
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:10,070
died. Right? So the question
can't even get off the ground.

116
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,740
That at least is how the objection goes.

117
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,730
Now I don't mean to be utterly
dismissive of the objection.

118
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:19,310
That's why I spent a couple of
minutes trying to spell it out,

119
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,350
but I think there's a
way to respond to it.

120
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,430
We just have to get clear
about what precisely the
question is that we're trying

121
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:33,770
to ask. And it says something
that Rosenberg tries to
get clear on it as well.

122
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:38,690
So here's my attempt to make the question
both a bit more precise and a question

123
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,470
that's an open question,
a question we can legitimately raised.

124
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,720
Well now, as you'll hear on several
occasions over the course of the semester,

125
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:52,070
I'm a philosopher. What that means is I
don't really know a whole lot of facts.

126
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,160
Uh, and so I'm about to tell you a
story where I wish I knew the facts. Uh,

127
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,970
and I don't know the facts. If it was, you
know, if, if I could really do it right,

128
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:04,670
I know open the door and bring in,
uh,

129
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,680
our guests physiologist who would then
provide the facts that I am what I'm

130
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:13,760
about to go blue, you your
new job. But you know, we,

131
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:16,940
we'd have the physiologists come in and
pretend and he'd actually tell us these

132
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:20,030
things. I don't know. I don't know
them. I don't have that person.

133
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:24,970
But take a look at what
happens when a body dies. Uh,

134
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,520
now, no doubt you can kill
people and a lot of different
ways you can, you can, uh,

135
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:34,430
poison them. You can strangle them,
you can shoot them in the heart.

136
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,640
Um,
the,

137
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,670
the causal paths that result
in death may start differently.

138
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:40,961
But,

139
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:45,840
but I presume that they converge
and you end up having a set,

140
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,000
a set of events take place. Now
what are those events? This is,

141
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:54,560
this is exactly where, I don't really
know what the details, but I take it,

142
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:57,870
it's something like, because of
whatever the original input was,

143
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,020
eventually the bloods no
longer circulating and
oxygen isn't making its way

144
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,410
around the body.

145
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,620
And so the brain becomes oxygen starved
because of the lack of oxygen getting to

146
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:10,734
the cells.

147
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,860
The cells are no longer able to carry
on their various metabolic processes

148
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,921
because of this.

149
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:21,870
They can't repair the various kinds of
damage they need or create the amino

150
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:23,880
acids and proteins they need.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And so as decay begins to set in and
the cell structures begin to break down,

152
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,800
uh, they don't get repaired
as they would normally do.

153
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,490
And so eventually we have breakdown of
the crucial cell structures and boom,

154
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,930
the body's dead. Now just say, I don't
really know whether that's accurate,

155
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:44,040
the little rough story I just told about
some story. Like that's probably right.

156
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,800
And in typical philosophical fashion,

157
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,120
I've drawn that story for you
up here on the board, right?

158
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,200
So the events that I don't
really know the details of,

159
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,290
we can just call B one B
two B three up through B n.

160
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,780
So you know before be one begins,
you got, you know, the body working,

161
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,610
functioning and it's bodily
way respirating reproducing
this sells and so forth

162
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:16,170
and so on. And at the end of
the, of the process by Ben,

163
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,860
the body's dead.
So you know,

164
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:24,750
be for bodily B one through Ben.
That's what death is,

165
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,910
death of the body is. And as I say,
it's the sort of thing that uh,

166
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,520
somebody from the medical school or a
biologist or a physiologist or something

167
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,350
could, could describe for us.
So here's the question then.

168
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,680
Suppose we call that
process death of the body.

169
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,753
Okay.

170
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,930
Call what has occurred by the
end of that sequence of events,

171
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,640
bodily death.

172
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,120
Okay.

173
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,250
Now here's a question
that we can still ask.

174
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,920
At least it looks as
though we can still ask it.

175
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,940
Might I or do I still exist
after the death of my body?

176
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,970
Might I still exist
after bodily death now?

177
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,780
I don't mean to suggest in any way that
we yet know the answer to that question,

178
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,210
but at least that's a question that it
seems as though we can coherently raise,

179
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:26,140
there is no obvious
contradiction in asking,

180
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,290
might I still exist after
the death of my body

181
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,310
dancer club turn out to be no,

182
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:42,050
but at least it's not.
Obviously no.

183
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,740
If the answer turns out to be no,
it's going to take some,

184
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,670
some sustained argument to
settle it one way or the other.

185
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:54,671
The answer could turn out to be yes for
all we know at point they sort of just

186
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,340
brings us back to the thought that well,

187
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:01,750
whether or not I could still exist
after the death of my body looks like it

188
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:05,980
should depend on what I am and so in a
minute that's the question that I'm going

189
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:10,840
to turn to, but it's a bit
cumbersome to constantly be asking,

190
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:11,230
you know,

191
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:16,230
might I still exist after the death
of my body and so no harm is done.

192
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:21,100
Once we've clarified the question
that we're trying to ask,

193
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,020
if we summarize that question
in a bit of a jargon or slogan,

194
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,250
we say instead of asking might I survive
and why they continue to exist after

195
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:33,370
the death of my body, we might
ask, we might put it this way.

196
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,740
We might say for short,
will I survive the death of my body,

197
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,480
no harm done or will I survive my death?

198
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,490
Because what we were just stipulating,

199
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:49,480
we mean when we talk about my death in
the context of this question is the death

200
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:53,120
of my body no harm done. We can
just say for short, you know,

201
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:58,290
will I survive my death or might I
survive my death or for that matter,

202
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,120
no serious harm. John, if we ask,

203
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,240
is there life after death?

204
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,190
As long as we understand that we're not
asking about there is life of my body

205
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,860
just to know they're familiar way of
trying to ask will I still be around after

206
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,740
my death?
Will I still exist after my death?

207
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,930
So I think there's a perfectly legitimate
question and that's the question we

208
00:13:22,931 --> 00:13:25,990
now want to turn to now.
As I said,

209
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,690
it looks as though to answer the question,
you know,

210
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,670
could I continue to exist after the death
of my body? Is there life after death?

211
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:37,210
Could I survive my death for short?
To answer that question,

212
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:41,890
we need to get clearer about, well, what
exactly is it for something to be me?

213
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,410
That's a question we'll turn
to in a couple of weeks.

214
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:50,380
First we've got to get clear
about, well, what am I,

215
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,610
what kind of an entity am I?

216
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,530
What am I made of in philosophical jargon?
This is a question from metaphysics,

217
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,050
so we'll ask him the
metaphysical question.

218
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,520
What kind of a thing is a person does?

219
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:11,521
It seems plausible to think that whether
or not a person can survive or continue

220
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:17,860
to exist after the death of his or her
body should depend on how he's built,

221
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:21,220
what he's made of,
what his or her parts are.

222
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:27,630
So let me sketch for you to
basic positions on this question.

223
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:36,370
What is a person to basic positions?
They're both,

224
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:37,330
I imagine,

225
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,480
fairly familiar and what we're going
to have to do is try to decide between

226
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:43,270
them.

227
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:47,350
They're not the only possible positions
on the question of the metaphysics of

228
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:51,220
the person. But there I think
the two most prominent positions,

229
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,860
definitely the ones with both, most
worth taking seriously for our purposes.

230
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,530
So first possible position is this.

231
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:04,090
A person is a combination of
a body and something else,

232
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,420
a mind.

233
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,320
But the crucial thing about this first
year that we wanted to talk about is that

234
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:17,321
the mind is thought of as something
separate from and distinct from the body.

235
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,830
So it's, well, to use a common
enough word, it's a soul.

236
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,960
So people are,

237
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:31,961
or people have or people
consist of bodies and souls.

238
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,210
The soul is something, as I
say, distinct from the body.

239
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:40,760
I take it the idea of the
body's a familiar one. It's,

240
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,770
it's this lump of flesh and
bone and muscle, you know, that,

241
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,380
that that's sitting here in front of you.

242
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,040
And then each one of use or drags around
with you, that sort of thing that,

243
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,240
you know, we can put on a scale and
pride with, you know, with a stick. Uh,

244
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:58,280
and the biologists can study,

245
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,780
presumably made up of various kinds of
molecules. Atoms and so forth. All right,

246
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:07,070
so we've got the body,
but on this first view,

247
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,850
we also have something that's not body,

248
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,000
something that's not a material object,

249
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,040
something that's not composed of
molecules and atoms. It's a soul.

250
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,280
It's the the house of or
the seed of or the basis of,

251
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,190
of consciousness and
thinking perhaps personality.

252
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,690
But the crucial point for this view
is that the proper metaphysical

253
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:37,691
understanding of the mind is to
think of it and nonphysical terms,

254
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,830
nonmaterial terms. That is, I say,

255
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:46,070
is the first basic view. I'm going
to say something more about that.

256
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,890
If you have a fair bit more about that
view over over the next couple of weeks.

257
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,460
But first, let me sketch the
other basic view. So, so,

258
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:57,461
so this first view we can call
the dualist view dual list.

259
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:00,980
Of course,
because there's two basic components,

260
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,300
the body and the soul,
and although I may occasionally slip,

261
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,020
I'm going to try to
preserve the word soul.

262
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,520
When I used the word soul,

263
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,640
I'm going to have in mind this dualist
view according to which the soul is

264
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:20,860
something immaterial,
nonphysical, some other kind,

265
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,090
you know the body's a material substance.

266
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,330
The soul is an immaterial substance.

267
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,310
It's the dualist view.

268
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:33,670
The alternative view that we're going
to consider is not dualist button,

269
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,880
but Moonest.

270
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:40,030
It says there's one basic kind of
thing and only one basic kind of thing.

271
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,620
There are bodies,
so what's a person?

272
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,950
A person is just a surgeon
kind of material object.

273
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,620
A person is just a body.
Of course,

274
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,720
it's a very fancy material object.

275
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,290
It's a very amazing material object.

276
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,600
That's what this second view says.

277
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:11,810
The person is a body that can do things
that most other material objects can't

278
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:18,510
do.
So on the Mona's view,

279
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:23,511
which we'll call physicalism because
it says that what people just are these

280
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:26,820
physical objects on
the physical list view,

281
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,480
a person is just a body that
can now you fill in the blank.

282
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:37,830
All right? You, you point out the kinds of
things that we can do. Well, we can talk,

283
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,270
we can think, we can sing, we can
write poetry. We can fall in love.

284
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:47,070
We can be afraid. Uh, we can make plans,
we can discover things about the universe.

285
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,160
Well,
according to the physical list view,

286
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,230
a person is just a body that can do
all of those things, can reflect,

287
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,090
can be rational, can communicate,
can make plans, can fall in love,

288
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,920
can write poetry. That's the
physicalist you. So as I say,

289
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,960
we've got two basic positions.
There's the dualist view people,

290
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:12,930
our bodies and souls.

291
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,470
And there there's the physicalist view
according to which there are no souls.

292
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,890
There are no in material
objects like that.

293
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,210
There are only bodies though when you got,
you know,

294
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:29,160
a functioning body like ours.

295
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:32,940
So there's physical says these bodies
can do some pretty amazing things.

296
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:37,020
The kinds of things that we all
know, people can do. Two basic views.

297
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,040
Now from a logical point of
view, I suppose you might
have a third possible view.

298
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,550
You know, if we've got the Moaners
who says, oh yeah, there's bodies,

299
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:49,320
but there's no souls. You could imagine
somebody who says there are souls,

300
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,630
but there are no bodies.
Uh,

301
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,980
this would roughly be a view
according to which there are mines,

302
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,960
but there aren't really physical objects.

303
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Physical objects are kind of allusion
perhaps that we fall into or thinking

304
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:06,960
about them in materialistic terms might
be greatly, uh, confused or mistaken.

305
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,630
This view is sometimes known in
philosophy as idealism. You know,

306
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,520
all that exists,
our minds and their ideas.

307
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,590
Physical objects is just a way of
talking about the ideas the mind has or

308
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:20,580
something like that.

309
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:26,280
Idealism is a position that's got a
very long history and philosophy and you

310
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:28,530
know, for many classes would
be worth taking, you know,

311
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,900
a fair bit of time to
consider more carefully.

312
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,390
But for our purposes I
think it's not a contender.

313
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,370
So I'm just gonna put it aside.

314
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,130
The positions that I'm going to end our
other possibilities as well. You know,

315
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:41,310
there,

316
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:46,310
there are views where mind and body are
just two different ways of looking at

317
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,140
same underlying reality where the
underlying reality is neither physical nor

318
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:57,250
mental. That view is also worth
taking seriously metaphysics class.

319
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,580
Uh, but for our purposes I
mentioned it, put it aside,

320
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,570
the two views we're going to
focus on are on the one hand,

321
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,920
the dualist view,

322
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,640
people have souls as well as bodies
and the physical list view all we have,

323
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:16,000
all we are our bodies.

324
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,603
Yeah.

325
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,700
Well let me say something more than
about the dualist position coordinator to

326
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,370
dual list. The mind is this
immaterial substance and we could,

327
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,220
if we could call it by different
names, we could, no harm will be done.

328
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:36,010
If we call it a mind though.

329
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,340
The reason I will typically talk about
a soul is to try to flag the, the,

330
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:44,950
the crucial point that on the
dualist view, the mind is based in,

331
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:49,120
or he just is something nonphysical,
something non material.

332
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,960
We could call it a mind. We could call
it a soul. We can call it a psyche.

333
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:56,230
They say, I'll typically try
to call it, uh, the soul.

334
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:01,530
The soul can direct and give
orders to the body on the one hand.

335
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,010
And on the other hand,
the body sort of

336
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,600
generates input that eventually
gets sensed or felt by the soul.

337
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,070
Yet.

338
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:20,070
Yet you take a pen and Ja stick it through
my flesh of my body and I feel pain

339
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,560
in my soul,
in my mind.

340
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:33,210
So two way interaction. And as
always in with philosophy, there's,

341
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,810
there's more complicated
versions of dualism, uh,

342
00:22:36,811 --> 00:22:39,000
where maybe the interaction
doesn't work both ways,

343
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:43,770
but let's just limit ourselves
to a good old fashion.

344
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,900
Two way interaction. [inaudible]
dualism. All right, so my,

345
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,630
my mind controls my body.

346
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:56,550
My body can affect my mind in
various ways. But for all of that,

347
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:59,250
they're separate things.
Still.

348
00:22:59,251 --> 00:23:02,070
There's this very tight connection

349
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:10,160
and we sometimes put it the
soul is in the body though,

350
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:14,420
of course, talking about
spatial location here, maybe,

351
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,020
maybe somewhat
metaphorically a an intended,

352
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,020
it's not as though we think that
if you start opening up the body,

353
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:23,720
you'd finally find the particular spot.
Okay,

354
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,390
here's the place where
the soul is located.

355
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:32,270
So it does seem from this duelist
perspective is all souls are located.

356
00:23:32,271 --> 00:23:34,520
I'm sort of viewing the world from here,

357
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,820
just like each of you is viewing the
world from a particular location.

358
00:23:37,821 --> 00:23:42,200
So maybe your soul is located more
or less in the vicinity of your body.

359
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:48,460
Crucial point. Of course, the
attraction of the dualist view from,

360
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,470
from our point of view is that if there's
a soul as well as the body and the

361
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:58,910
soul is something in material,
then when the body dies,

362
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:03,110
when we have B one through Ben and the
death of the body occurs, you know,

363
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:06,680
so at the end of BN near the
body stops repairing itself.

364
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,130
Decay sets in. You know, we
all know the sad stories,

365
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:12,290
the worm crawling and the worms crawl out.

366
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,930
The end of the day we'll make
it takes longer than a day.

367
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,890
Know the body has decomposed.
Yes,

368
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,150
all that bespeaks the end of the body.

369
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,600
But if the soul is something immaterial,

370
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:31,810
then that could continue to exist even
after the destruction of the body.

371
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,400
That's, that's the, that's the attraction.

372
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,940
At least one of the attractions
of the dualist view.

373
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:45,941
The belief in the soul gives you something
to continue to exist after the end of

374
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:51,140
your body. You know?
So what's death? Well,

375
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:57,850
if normally there's this super tight
connection between my soul and my body,

376
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,200
death might be the severing of that
connection and so the body breaks and no

377
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:12,170
longer is able to give
input up to the soul.

378
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:17,260
The soul longer is no longer able to
control the body and make it move around,

379
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:23,500
but for all that the soul might
continue to exist and so at least the

380
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:29,171
possibility that I'll survive my
death is one worth taking very,

381
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:33,050
very seriously.
If we are dualists.

382
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,020
Couple of things to point
out about this view.

383
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:46,310
One is I've been talking as
though a person is a combination,

384
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:53,450
kind of are a soul and body sandwich,

385
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,640
so a person has two basic building blocks,

386
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,010
the bodily part and the sole part.
It's natural to talk that way,

387
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,400
but if we want belief in the soul to
help us hold out the possibility at least

388
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:14,110
that there might be life after death,

389
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,640
then I think we need to actually
say that strictly speaking,

390
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:23,530
it's not that a person
is a soul plus a body.

391
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,180
Strictly speaking,

392
00:26:25,181 --> 00:26:30,010
I think we need to say the
person just is the soul.

393
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,900
After all.
If the person is the combination,

394
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:37,480
if the person is the pear sole,

395
00:26:37,481 --> 00:26:42,040
plus the body destroys the body,
you've destroyed the pair.

396
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,440
If the person the pair and
the pair no longer exists,

397
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,420
the person no longer exists.

398
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,490
So if we want belief in
a soul to help us leave,

399
00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:58,491
open the door to the possibility that
I survive the destruction of my body,

400
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,110
it better not be that the
bodies and essential part of me,

401
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,970
it's simpler,

402
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
more straight forward to
say instead what I am,

403
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,700
strictly speaking is a soul.

404
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,120
As long as the soul exists,
I exist.

405
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,140
Of course my soul,
me,

406
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:27,580
I have a very tight connection
to a particular body.

407
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:33,890
But still you could in
principle destroying the body
with d without destroying

408
00:27:33,891 --> 00:27:37,970
me. Look, I have a particularly close
connection to the house I live in,

409
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,040
but for all that,

410
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:44,210
you can destroy my house
without destroying me.

411
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,370
So that's I think the position that
we ought to ascribe to the dualist.

412
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,580
The person is strictly speaking the soul.

413
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,520
The soul has a very intimate
connection with the body,

414
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,660
but the person is not the soul and
the body. The person is just the soul.

415
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,860
So even have that intimate connection
gets destroyed. The person,

416
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,300
the soul could continue to exist.
Second point to clear,

417
00:28:08,301 --> 00:28:13,301
clear up is that there's really three
different issues that might interest us.

418
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,920
One,

419
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,920
metaphysically our bodies and souls
distinct is there is the mind to be

420
00:28:22,761 --> 00:28:27,170
understood in terms of
this in material object,

421
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,850
the soul, so are there two kinds of
things? That's the first question.

422
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,550
Our souls and bodies distinct.

423
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,860
Second question though is does the soul,

424
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,760
even if it exists,

425
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:45,790
does the soul survive the
destruction of the body?

426
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,980
It could be something
separate without surviving.

427
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:55,700
That's why I've tried to
say if there are souls,

428
00:28:55,701 --> 00:29:00,701
at least that opens the door to the
possibility that we will survive our debt

429
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,650
but doesn't guarantee it because
absent further argumentation,

430
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:11,770
who is no guarantee that the soul
survives the death of the body,

431
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,300
even if it's separate,

432
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,480
it could be that it gets killed at the
very same time or destroyed at the very

433
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:21,380
same time the body's being destroyed.

434
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:25,400
Maybe when you know
these physical processes,

435
00:29:25,401 --> 00:29:28,220
B one through B n take place,

436
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,650
they set into motion. Remember after
all, we're interaction as dualists.

437
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:38,000
There's this very tight causal connection
between the body and the mind and the

438
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:40,400
soul and the body,
the body and the soul.

439
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,840
Just like when you prick my body,

440
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:48,520
that bodily process sets up certain
things taking place in my soul.

441
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,200
Maybe when B one through Ben take place,

442
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:58,300
they set up some other
processes in my soul.

443
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:03,570
Call them s one through s n and maybe
s one through s n results in the

444
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:10,300
destruction of my soul.

445
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:15,130
So simultaneously with my body dying,

446
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,970
my soul dies.
Okay.

447
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:23,740
This one's going to be a little bit
trickier to draw this. So the first part,

448
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:26,770
your s one. Dot. Dot, dot,
dot. Dot. That's easy. S.

449
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:31,430
N the question is how do I draw
the soul? I don't really know. Uh,

450
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,853
yeah.

451
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,490
So the mere fact that we decide if we do
ultimately decide that there is a soul,

452
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:49,330
something nonphysical,
separate and distinct from the body,

453
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,130
doesn't guarantee that we
survive our physical death.

454
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,700
That's going to be a separate question.

455
00:30:57,701 --> 00:31:01,540
We'll have to turn to first question's
going to be, are there any Sol's?

456
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,120
Next question is going to
have to be if there are,

457
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,320
do we have any good reason to think
that they survive the death of the body?

458
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:14,890
Third question that might interest us,
it does interest us is this,

459
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,900
if it survives,
how long does it survive?

460
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,660
Does the soul continue to exist
after the death of the body?

461
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,750
Does it continue to exist forever?

462
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,530
Yeah.

463
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,280
Are we immortal?

464
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,800
Most of us would like that to be true.

465
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:42,950
We want there to be souls so that we can
be a mortal and so the question's got

466
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:47,550
to be not only is the sole distinct,

467
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:50,130
does it survive the death of my body,

468
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,640
but does it continue to exist forever?

469
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,753
Okay.

470
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,410
Those questions,
hang on one sec.

471
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,190
Those questions are ones that
especially interest Plato,

472
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,760
so in about a week or so,
we'll start reading Plato's Fito.

473
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:10,850
The purpose of that dialogue of that
philosophical work is to argue for the

474
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,080
immortality of the soul. So that's a
question we'll be turning to. Yeah,

475
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,150
that's the

476
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,520
question that you are going to
consider a different version.

477
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,540
Like the nature of the soul inosine
material. We know that for sure.

478
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:32,060
But then the very word material means
that not going to be by and material

479
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,650
position process such as the body.

480
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,070
Okay, so, so the question is this.

481
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:48,450
So if the very idea of soul that we're
working with here under the doulas

482
00:32:48,451 --> 00:32:53,070
picture is the soul is an immaterial
substance. It's not made of ordinary,

483
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:56,880
you know, atomic matter.
If the soul is in material,

484
00:32:56,881 --> 00:33:01,881
doesn't it follow automatically trivially
that this soul cannot be destroyed by

485
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,100
material process after all
there was death in the body,

486
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:11,880
B one through B and that's a
material process, a physical process.

487
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,300
Doesn't it follow that?
A soul,

488
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:20,390
an immaterial entity can't be destroyed
by a material physical process.

489
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,940
What I want to say,
it's great question.

490
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,620
What I want to say is sort of the short
answer for now is I don't think it

491
00:33:28,621 --> 00:33:33,240
follows automatically.
It doesn't follow trivially.

492
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,280
It may follow.

493
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:40,430
Plato's actually going to give us some
arguments for pretty much that same clean

494
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,030
plane is going to argue once we understand
the sort of metaphysical nature of

495
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:49,110
the soul.
We'll see why it couldn't be destroyed.

496
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,170
That's going to take some fancy arguments.

497
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:57,180
The reason I think it doesn't
follow trivially is because,

498
00:33:57,181 --> 00:34:01,380
remember I said we're in dealing
with interactions, just dualism.

499
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,980
We've already admitted that bodies
are able to affect the soul,

500
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,210
right? You know, the,

501
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,280
the body is having all sorts of light
bounce off my eyes of various wavelengths

502
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,290
and because of that,

503
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,320
my soul is having various
visual sensations about the
number of people in front

504
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:23,790
of me,
colors and so forth and so on.

505
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:27,120
I gave the example of pricking my body.

506
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:32,180
That's a physical process that causes
some sorts of changes in the mental

507
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:35,070
processes occurring in my soul.

508
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,010
Okay.

509
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:42,010
Once we've admitted that on this kind
of dual is picture the material body can

510
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,110
influence what happens
in the immaterial soul,

511
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,010
then it doesn't seem that we have any
grounds for shutting the door to the

512
00:34:52,011 --> 00:34:55,190
possibility that the
right physical process,

513
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:00,340
B one through Ben might set up
this horrible mental soul process,

514
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:06,140
s one through s and resulting
in the destruction of the
soul. It's a possibility.

515
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,650
It's going to take more
arguments to rule it out. Yeah.

516
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,380
My soul is somewhere.

517
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,940
Is that reasonable when
you're talking about,

518
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,680
yeah, so that was another great
question. The question was,

519
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:38,250
I said seems plausible in the same as
soul is locate soul is located more or

520
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:40,830
less here, cause I sent him seem
to view the world from here,

521
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,680
but maybe that's not right.

522
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,570
Maybe we shouldn't talk about
the location of the soul at all.

523
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:52,230
After all,
if the soul is an in material object,

524
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,520
can in material objects have locations,

525
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:03,330
I don't know. I mean the short
answer is I don't know. Uh,

526
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:08,310
I know very little about how in
material objects are supposed to work.

527
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,550
So although I'm trying to
sketch the dualist position,

528
00:36:13,591 --> 00:36:15,960
as I explained on Tuesday,

529
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,020
I don't myself believe in souls.

530
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,200
I don't actually think that
the dual list view is correct.

531
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:30,260
Mike say I'll leave that problem our souls
spatially located or not to be worked

532
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:36,570
out by those who believe in it.
For our purposes,

533
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,580
I think it doesn't really matter if
you want to say souls have location,

534
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:45,900
where are they located located more or
less where my body is at least as long as

535
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:48,630
my body's working.
Maybe at death,

536
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,650
the soul gets liberated from the body
and is able to wander more freely.

537
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,410
Sometimes people talk about, in fact,
we'll be reading about this, you know,

538
00:36:55,411 --> 00:37:00,180
out of body experiences. Uh, and so
maybe during those unusual times, the,

539
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:04,530
the sole wanders from the body and
comes back to it. Or alternatively,

540
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,080
maybe the soul doesn't
have any location at all.

541
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:12,081
Maybe that's just an illusion created
by the fact that I'm getting this visual

542
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:16,710
input from my body.
My body certainly has a location,

543
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:21,360
maybe, maybe the right way to, you know,
imagine somebody who was in a room with,

544
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,930
you know, remote controlled television
set up and so forth and so on. And,

545
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,350
and he's seeing what's
happening in Chicago,

546
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,040
even though he's sitting in
a room in new haven. Well,

547
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:35,610
you could understand why he might fall
into the trap of thinking of himself as

548
00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:40,410
located in Chicago, if all the
visual inputs coming from Chicago.

549
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,300
So maybe that's how it
works with the soul.

550
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,290
We get lulled into thinking that
we are where our bodies are,

551
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:48,120
but that's really a metaphysical illusion.

552
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,450
Don't really know for our purposes.

553
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:54,480
I think it's not crucial
because it's a great question,

554
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,830
but I'm not going to try to
pursue it any further. All right,

555
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,040
so one question,
is there a sole second question,

556
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,900
does it survive the death of our
body? Third question, if it does,

557
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:10,620
does it live forever? Does it continue
to exist forever? Is the sole immortal?

558
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,510
We will initially think
about the first question,

559
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,900
do we have any good reason to believe
in souls at all and only after a while

560
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:24,990
where we turn to the second and
third question, does it survive?

561
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,590
And more particularly,
is it a mortal? Alright,

562
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,430
that's the first basic view
about the nature of a person.

563
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:36,340
Person is a soul,
something immaterial and not a body.

564
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:42,550
I take it at the views of familiar one.
Many of you probably believe in it.

565
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,160
Those of you who don't believe in it
had probably at least been tempted to

566
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:48,970
believe in it. I'm sure you all
do know people who believe in it.

567
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,090
It's a very familiar picture,

568
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,200
but of course the question we're going
to have to ask ourselves is, is it right?

569
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,450
Is the reasons to believe it's correct.

570
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:04,240
Let's turn now to the second basic view.
The view,

571
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:09,241
the physical list view according
to which a person is just a body.

572
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,510
This is a materialist view.

573
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,420
People are just material objects,

574
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:20,380
the sorts of things biologists
poke and prod and study.

575
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,650
Now it's important.

576
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:28,710
I think this is the crucial point that
when we say a person is just a body,

577
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,600
we don't understand that.

578
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:36,600
To me the physical is doesn't mean
that as a person is just any old body.

579
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:44,530
It's not as though there aren't important
differences between different physical

580
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:45,364
objects.

581
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:50,490
Some physical objects can do things have
a far more interesting sort than other

582
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:54,970
physical objects.
Here's a piece of chalk.

583
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:00,790
It's a physical object. It's
just a body. What can it do?

584
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,810
Well, not a whole lot. I can
write on the board with it.

585
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:08,620
I can break it into, you know,
you let go of, it drops down.

586
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,190
Not a very interesting physical body.

587
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:16,930
Here's a cell phone.
It's just a body.

588
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,200
It's not the most interesting
physical object in the world,

589
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,010
but it's a whole lot more
interesting than a piece of chalk.

590
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,840
It can do all sorts of things
a piece of chalk can't do.

591
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,570
If the physicalist is right,

592
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,830
then here's another
physical object for you.

593
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,440
Me,
Shelly Kagan,

594
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,280
I am a pretty impressive physical object.

595
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,770
Now arrogant is,
I may be,

596
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:49,120
I don't mean to suggest on any
more impressive than you guys are.

597
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,270
Each one of us,
according to the physical list,

598
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:57,510
is just a body that can
do some amazing things.

599
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:04,240
We are bodies that can think we,

600
00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:09,100
our bodies that can plan.
We are bodies that can reason.

601
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,530
We our bodies that can feel,

602
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:16,650
we are bodies that can be afraid
and be creative and have dreams and

603
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:21,220
aspirations. We our bodies that
can communicate with each other.

604
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:25,090
We are bodies that are,
or here's a word for it.

605
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,940
We're bodies that are people,

606
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,700
but on the physicalist view,

607
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:36,060
a person is just a body and that's
where we'll take it up next time.
