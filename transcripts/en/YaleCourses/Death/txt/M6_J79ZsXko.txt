Speaker 1:          00:01          The end of last class, we started sketching an argument that comes from Descartes, the Cartesian argument that says merely by the process of thinking and the basis of thought alone attempt to show that the mind. We all agree that though our minds, what the, what the argument attempts to show is that this mind must be something separate from my body and what's, what's amazing about the argument is that it works on the basis of pure thought experiment. The thought experiment you'll recall was one in which I imagine I tell myself a story in which what I'm doing is I'm imagining my mind existing without my body. It doesn't seem especially difficult to do that, but then we add this extra philosophical premise. If I can imagine one thing without the other, then it must be that those are two things, so my mind must not be my body.

Speaker 1:          01:02          My mind must not be the same thing as my body or way of talking about my body because of course if my mind just was tosca bi, I'm a mom talking about my mind just was a way of talking about my body. Then to try to imagine my mind without my body. It would be trying to imagine my body without my body. That obviously can't happen, but suppose we try to imagine a world in which Shelly exists, but Kagan doesn't. Well, you can't, right? Because of course there's just a single thing, Shelly Kagan and so if you've imagined Shelly existing, then of course you're imagining that single thing. Shelly Kagan existing and if you imagine nene Kagan not existing, then you're imagining that single thing. Shelly Kagan not existing, so you can't even imagine a world in which Shelly exists, but Kagan doesn't. Now it's important not to be confused about this.

Speaker 1:          02:02          We can easily imagine a world in which you know, I don't have the last name Kagan or perhaps to switch it around. Shelly's not my name. Supposedly my parents had named me Bruce. Nothing would be easier. Imagine a world in which Kagan exists, but Shelly doesn't exist because nobody in the world, his name's Shelly. The question is not, can you imagine me with a different name, Bruce instead of Shelly. Easy enough. It's rather, can you imagine a world in which the very thing that you really are picking out, when you refer to me by the name Shelly, namely, you know this thing, can you imagine a world in which that thing exists but the war. But the thing that you're picking out when you use the word Kagan does not exist and that you can't do because in the real world, of course, Shelly and Kagan pick out just two different names of this very same thing.

Speaker 1:          02:53          This thing right here. So imagining a world in which Shelly exists, but Kagan doesn't, or Kagan exists. Shelly doesn't. That's trying to imagine a world in which you know I exist, but I don't. And that's of course incoherent. So if you can, I'm going to hand contrast. Can I imagine a world in which my left hand exists but my right hand doesn't easy. Why is it so easy? Because of course there's two different things. Of course, that doesn't mean that in the real world one of them does exist in the other one doesn't. But it does show that in the real world there are two different things. That's why I could imagine a world with one but not the other.

Speaker 2:          03:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:31          Try to imagine a world in which somebody smile exists but their body doesn't. You can't do it. You can't have the smile without the body and of course no mystery about that. That's because the smile isn't really some separate thing from the body. Talking about smiles, as we've noted before, it's just a way of talking about, you know, either what the body can do or what a certain area of the body can do. You can try to imagine it. You know, in Alison Wonderland, the Cheshire cat disappears and all we have left. The last thing that disappears is the smile. But of course when you imagine the Cheshire cat only having the smile there, you're still imagining the cat's lips, teeth, maybe tongue, whatever it is. If you try to imagine a smile with nobody at all, can't be done. Why? Because the smile isn't something separate from the body. Try to imagine. My mind says, day card without my body easy from which it follows that my mind and my body must not be one thing. They must in fact be two things. That's why it's possible to imagine the one without the other. So this Cartesian argument seems to show us that the mind is something separate from distinct from not reduceable to not just a way of talking about my body.

Speaker 2:          05:12          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:13          So it's gotta be something extra above and beyond my body. It's a soul. That's what Descartes argued. As I say to this day, philosophers disagree about whether this argument works or not. I don't think it does work. And in a second I'll give you a conjurer example and then having given the counter example, I mean that is what I'm going to give is an example of an argument just like it or at least an argument. It seems to be just like it where we can pretty easily see that that argument doesn't work. And so something must go wrong with Descartes' argument as well. Well, here's the counter example.

Speaker 2:          05:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:52          Some of you, I'm sure most of you, maybe all of you are familiar with the evening star. The evening star is the roughly speaking first heavenly body that's visible in the sky as it gets dark, at least at certain times of the year. And I'm sure you're also familiar. Then with the Morningstar, the morning star is that heavenly body, which is the last heavenly body that's still visible as dawn comes in and begins to get light. So as a first pass, it's the evening stars, the first star that's visitable. And uh, the morning star is the last star that's visible, you know, at the right times of the year.

Speaker 2:          06:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:36          The world that we live in has both in the evening star and the Morningstar. Uh, but try to imagine a world in which the evening star exists, but the Morningstar does not seems fairly straight forward. Right. You know, I get up in the morning, uh, at dawn's approaching, I look around in the Morningstar is not there. There is no star where the Morningstar had been or where people have claimed it would be or something. But the evening star still exist. When I go out as, as sunsets and dusk falls, there is the evening star. So it's, it's a, it's a trivial matter to imagine a world in which the evening star exists in the Morningstar does not. And so we've got a, we could imagine that a, uh, a day cart like argument saying, if I can imagine the evening star without the morning star that shows the evening star in the Morningstar must be two different heavenly bodies. But in fact, that's not so the evening star and the morning star are the very same heavenly body. In fact, it's not a star at all. So it's a planet. It's a venous, if I recall correctly.

Speaker 1:          07:46          So look, there's only one thing. The evening star is Venus. The Morningstar is Venus. So they couldn't be a world in which the evening star exists. But the morning star doesn't cause that would be a world in which venous exists and Venus doesn't exist. And obviously that's not possible. Of course, what you can imagine is a world in which venous isn't visible in the morning. Still that's not a world in which the Morningstar doesn't exist. Given that what we mean by the Morningstar is that heavenly object, whatever it is that in this world we pick out, you know, at that time in the morning and looking up at the sky.

Speaker 2:          08:29          Okay?

Speaker 1:          08:29          So when I refer to the morning star, I'm talking about Venus, whether or not I realize it's Venus. When I talk about the evening star, I'm referring to Venus, whether or not I realize that Venus is the evening star. So as long as Venus is around, well there's the evening star, there's the Morningstar, there's Venus can't have a world in which the Morningstar doesn't exist. But the evening star does. Although you could have a world in which Venus doesn't show up in the morning,

Speaker 1:          09:05          still from the fact that I can imagine the world in which you know, I look around for the morning. There it isn't. I look around for the evening star. There it is. You might've thought that showed, didn't Descartes prove to us that that shows the evening star in the Morningstar are two different things? Well, no, obviously it didn't. So let's think about what that means. So, so we've got this argument that they cart puts forward. I can imagine my mind without my body and Descartes says that shows that in fact, my mind is something separate from my body.

Speaker 1:          09:41          Well, I can imagine the evening star without the Morningstar. So son of Descartes, you know, they Cartson uh, has to say, oh, so that shows that the morning starting the evening star two different things, but they Cartson would be wrong when he says that the morning starting the evening star are two different things there. Just one thing, namely Venus. In fact, the sentence, they are one thing slightly misleading, right? It's just one thing. Venus, if that argument, if the argument, if trying to run the Cartesian argument for astronomy fails yet it seems to be an exactly analogous argument, we ought to conclude that the argument for them, the distinctness of the mind and the body must fail as well. Now that seems to me to be right. I think the Cartesian argument does fail. And I think the example of the evening star in the morning star, which is not at all original to me, that this example shows this Kadra example shows that Descartes' original argument doesn't work either.

Speaker 1:          10:52          At least that's how it seems to me. Well, as I, as I say, there are philosophers are say, no, no, that's not right. Maybe somehow we've misunderstood how the argument goes and it doesn't. Exactly, although these two arguments seemed parallel, they're not in fact parallel there, there there's some subtle differences that if we're not looking carefully, we'll, we'll, we'll overlook. But God, as I said, the debate goes on. One of the reasons for thinking it's not clear whether the argument fails or not is because it's hard to pin down where exactly did it go wrong? Look, take, take, uh, take the argument of the, uh, the of the planets. You know, the, the Morningstar in the evening star example, I take it that we all agree that when we attempt to run the Cartesian argument in terms of the morning star, the evening star, it fails.

Speaker 1:          11:47          But it's harder to say what went wrong. How did it go wrong? Why did it wrong? What are the possibilities? Well, we said, look, first claim, first premise. I can imagine a world and with in which the evening star exists, but the Morningstar doesn't. Well, I suppose one possible response would be, you know, you couldn't really do that. You thought you were imagining a world in which the evening star exists and the morning star doesn't, but you weren't really imagining a world in which the evening star exists in the morning star. Doesn't you miss describe what it is you've imagined? Well, that's, that's a silly thing to say about the astronomy case. Maybe that's the right diagnosis. Could we similarly say, I didn't really imagine a world in which my mind exists, but my body doesn't. That little story I told last time I thought I was describing a world in which my mind exists. My body doesn't, but it wasn't really imagining. A world like that doesn't seem so persuasive over there did seem as though I was imagining it.

Speaker 1:          13:01          What else could go wrong with the uh, astronomy example? Well, maybe I did imagine a world in which the Morningstar exists and the evening star doesn't exist. But maybe imagining, does it mean it's possible? Normally we think if we imagine something, it means it's possible here. I don't mean of course empirically Po, yeah, I can imagine a world with Unicorns. It doesn't mean I think unicorns are physically possible. All we mean here is logically possible. I can imagine a world with Unicorns seems to follow that Unicorns are logically possible. Imagination seems to be a guide to possibility, but maybe not always. Maybe sometimes we can imagine something that's really impossible. Hmm. Try to imagine what can you do that? Can't you not do that? Try to imagine a round square.

Speaker 1:          13:54          Can you imagine it? Can you not a man in certain moods? I sort of feel I can just begin to imagine it in. Of course it doesn't really mean it's possible. It seems like it's impossible. So maybe imagination is a flawed guy de possibility. So maybe that's what we should say about the mind body case. Yeah. I can imagine a world in which my mind exists, but my body doesn't. But that doesn't show that it's really possible, logically possible to have a world in which my mind exists is my body doesn't. Maybe that's where the argument goes up wrong or the hand isn't imagination. Our best guide to logical possibility isn't the reason. I think unicorns are logically coherent just because I can imagine them so easily. Another possibility. Maybe we should say the mere fact that it's possible for a and B to be separate for a to exist without beef, for that's clearly where they're separate. The mere fact that it's possible for them to be separate doesn't mean that in the actual world they are separate. Maybe the argument goes wrong by assuming that identity when when a is equal to B, it's always equal to be, no matter what, maybe identity as philosophers like to put it. Maybe identity is contingent.

Speaker 2:          15:17          Maybe

Speaker 1:          15:19          a could be the same thing as B in this logically possible world, but we could imagine a completely different logically coherent world in which a was not the same thing as B.

Speaker 2:          15:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:33          If that's right, then maybe the conclusion should be, well, you know, uh, yeah. The, the Cartesian thought experiment shows that there could be a world in which there are mines that are not identical, the bodies, but that doesn't mean that in this world the mind is not identical to it. To my body. Maybe in this world, minds and bodies are identical. Even though in other logically possible worlds, the identity comes apart. Identity is not necessary but contingent as the philosophers put it.

Speaker 1:          16:08          It's not clear that that's right either. The notion of contingent identities very puzzling after all, if if a really is B, how could they come apart? There's only one thing there. There's nothing to come apart. There's just a equals B, that single thing. What's to come apart, so, so where exactly does the argument breakdown? Is it that I'm not really imagining, I'm just thinking, I'm imagining, is it that imagination is not really a good guide to possibility? I just often it is, but not always is it that identity is contingent. The interesting thing about Descartes' argument is that it's easy to see something God has gone wrong in the case of the morning star in the evening star, but it's difficult to pin down what exactly went wrong. Different philosophers agree that something's gone wrong in the Morningstar Morningstar in the evenings, dark case, but disagree about the best diagnosis of where the mistake went in.

Speaker 2:          17:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:12          Armed with your pet diagnosis of where the argument goes wrong there, you got to ask, does it also go wrong in the mind and body case?

Speaker 2:          17:21          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          17:21          well, we could spend more time, but I'm not going to. I think Descartes' argument fails. I think the Morningstar evening star case shows us that arguments like this at the very least, can't be taken at face value just because it looks as though we can imagine it and just because it's seems as often the fact that we can imagine one without the other. It just won't necessarily fall that we really do have two things that are separate and not identical in the real world.

Speaker 2:          17:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:56          I'd be happy to discuss with you, you know, outside class at greater length. My favorite theories as to where the argument goes wrong and why I think it goes wrong and Descartes' case as well. But I, but I suggest that the argument goes wrong. It's not, it's not. It's not right. And so Descartes' attempt to establish the distinctness of the mind, the than the immateriality of the mind on the basis of this Cartesian thought experiment. I think that's unsuccessful. Well, we've spent, let's, let's, let's step back and think of where we've been. We spent the last week and a half or so, maybe a bit more, two weeks talking about arguments for the existence of the soul. And unsurprisingly, since I announced this was going to be the result before the class had barely gotten started, I don't think any of these arguments work. I believe the attempts to establish the existence of a soul and in material object, that house of consciousness separate and distinct from the body.

Speaker 1:          19:00          I think those arguments fail. But I recognize that this is something that reasonable people can disagree about. And so this is as well be many times the case over the course of the semester. Something that I invite you to continue to reflect on for yourself. If you believe in a soul, what's the argument for it? Well, what we're about to turn two is Plato's discussion of these issues in the dialogue. The Thedo, which as I told you last week, purports to lay out the final days discussion with soccer. Socrates before he is killed by bee kills himself by drinking, uh, the hemlock in accordance with the, uh, the punishment that's been given to him.

Speaker 2:          19:56          Okay?

Speaker 1:          19:57          Now in the course of this discussion, Socrates and his disciples argue about not so much the existence of the soul, but the question really is the immortality of the soul after all, even if you believe in a soul, as I remarked previously, that doesn't give us yet any reason to believe the soul continues to exist after the death of your body. The kind of dualist position that we are considering in this class is an interaction just position where the sole commands the body. That's what makes my fingers move right now. And the body can affect the soul. If I poke my body, I feel it in my mind. So the mind, the soul and the body are obviously very tightly connected and so it could be even if the soul is something separate from the body, then when the body dies, the soul dies as well. That's the question that's driving the discussion in the Fito. Do we have any good reason to believe the soul survives the death of the body and more particularly still do we have good reason to believe it's immortal?

Speaker 2:          21:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:21          Soccer. Socrates believes in the immortality of the soul, and so he tends to defend this position justify to his disciples who are worried that it may not be true. It's important too, to realize as you, as you read the dialogue, it becomes fairly apparent that there isn't so much any defense of the belief in the soul. There's some of it, but it's not the primary goal. For the most part, the existence of the soul is just taken for granted in the dialogue. Plato's a dualist portray Socrates as being a dualist, and that's just taken for granted. The question that the philosophical discussion turns on is not is there a soul, but rather does it survive the death of the body? Is it immortal? Now, as I said, this is Socrates, his last day on earth,

Speaker 1:          22:19          and you'd expect him to be pretty bummed. You'd expect him to be sad, and one of the striking things is that Socrates is in a very happy indeed, jovial mood, joking with his, his friends. Why is that? Well, of course it's because he thinks, first of all there's a soul and it will survive and it's a mortal, but more importantly still. Oh really? Yeah, those are all crucial, but there's an extra ingredient as well. He thinks he's got good reason to believe when he dies, he's going to go basically what we call heaven. He thinks there's a realm you're populated by sort of good, God's and maybe other philosophical kindred souls and, and if sort of you, if you got your stuff together here on life, you'll get to go to that when you die. And so he's excited, he's pleased. Why does he think he's going to go? Well, in thinking about Socrates is belief in the existence of a soul. It's important to understand is important to notice that his take on which stuff gets assigned to the body. You know what have a bodily things versus what are the sole like things is rather different from the way I think most of us nowadays would draw the line.

Speaker 1:          23:44          When I talked about arguments for the existence

Speaker 2:          23:46          of a soul, I said, look, here's one possible argument. I see colors. No physical object could, no purely physical Africans could see colors. I can taste tastes and have this and the smell of coffee and so forth, but Socrates thinks all those bodily sensations, that's all stuff that the body takes care of. So unlike those modern dualist who think we need to appeal to something immaterial in order to explain bodily sensations, Socrates thinks, no, no. The body takes care of all the bodily sensations, all the desires and the wanting things and the emotions and the feelings and the cravings. That's all. That's all bodies stuff. What the soul does. Socrates thinks there's soul thinks. This soul in its essence is rational. It takes care of the thinking side of things.

Speaker 1:          24:50          What does the soul think about? Well, it's all things about all sorts of things. Doubtless, you know, but one of the things that it can do, one of the things that sort of provides the underpinnings as we'll see for Plato's arguments for the immortality of the soul, it's the soul can think about, well, here I have to introduce a word of philosophical jargon. Sometimes the idea that sometimes the term is called ideas. Sometimes the term is called forms, but the thought is that the soul can think about certain pure concepts or ideas like justice itself or beauty itself or goodness itself or hell itself. So to explain all this we need now, I'll sort of crash course in Plato's metaphysics.

Speaker 2:          25:54          Okay.

Speaker 1:          25:55          Obviously this will be rather superficial. Those of you who would like to know more about it, I recommend reading more platonic dialogues or taking a class in ancient philosophy. But here's the basic idea. There's all sorts of beautiful objects in the world. Objects can vary in terms of how beautiful they are. The Plato's got the idea that there is nothing in this world that perfectly beautiful and yet for all that we can think about beauty itself. Well, we might put it this way. You might say ordinary humdrum everyday physical objects are somewhat beautiful. They're partially beautiful as sometimes Platonists put it, they participate in beauty, they partake of beauty to varying degrees, but none of them should be confused with beauty itself or take justice.

Speaker 1:          27:01          There are various arrangements, social arrangements that can be just or unjust to varying degrees, but we don't think anywhere in the world there any society that's perfectly just yet for all that the mind can think about. Perfect justice and and notice how ordinary empirical social arrangements fall short of perfect justice. So whatever perfect justice is, it's not one more thing in the empirical world. It's something we can think about. It's something that things in the empirical world can participate in or partake of to varying degrees, but we shouldn't confuse the physical things, which can be just the people who can be virtuous to one degree or another with perfect virtue or perfect justice. That's something that only the mind can think about that we don't actually have in the world. The empirical world itself or take being round the mind can think about perfect circularity.

Speaker 1:          28:08          No physical object is perfectly circular. They're only thing that are circular to a greater or lesser degree. So by thinking about it, by thinking about these kinds of issues, we can see that the mind has some kind of handle on these. Perfect. Well, we need a word, and as they say, Plato gives us the word ideas. Sometimes it's translated as ideas or forms. These things that we can think about that are the sort of the template or at least the standard or or, or maybe at the very least, it's that which the ordinary humdrum things can participate in to varying degrees. Perfect justice, justice itself, beauty itself, goodness itself, circularity itself, health itself. All of these things are well as as plus goes nowadays, call them platonic forms.

Speaker 2:          29:07          Oh,

Speaker 1:          29:07          ordinary material objects of this world can partake of the various platonic forms, but they should not be confused with the platonic forms. But we still, even though we don't bump into the platonic forms in this world, we can think about them. Our mind has a kind of grasp of them. Of course. The problem is we're, we're distracted by the comings and goings, the hurly burly of the, of the ordinary everyday world. And so we don't have a very good grasp of the platonic forms were able to think about them, but we're distracted.

Speaker 1:          29:56          What the philosopher tries to do, this is Socrates is thought or Plato's thought that he puts in Socrates. His mouth with the philosophy tries to do is free himself from the distractions that the body poses, the desire for food, the craving for sex, being concerned about pain. All this stuff get, you know, dry Hungary and after pleasure, all this stuff gets in the way of thinking about the platonic forms. What the philosopher tries to do then so as to better focus on these ideal things is to sort of disregard the body, put it aside, separate his mind as much as possible from it. That's what Socrates says he's been trying to do. And so because of that, he's got a better handle on these ideal forms. And then he believes when death comes in, the final separation occurs of the mind and the body. His mind gets to go up. His soul gets to go up to this sort of heavenly realm. Philosophers nowadays called Plato's heaven. Let's go to Plato's heaven where he can sort of have more direct contact with these things with the forms.

Speaker 2:          31:27          Now

Speaker 1:          31:30          I don't have the time here to say enough to try and make it clear why this platonic metaphysical view is a view that not only is worth taking seriously, but you know to this day, many, many philosophers think that at least in its basic strokes, must be right, but let me at least give you one example that may give you a feel for it. Think of math, I think of some simple mathematical claim like two plus two equals four. When we say that two plus two equals four or are we a two plus three equals five we're saying something about numbers that our mind is able to grasp, but what are numbers anyway? They're certainly not physical objects. It's not as though some day you're going to open up an issue of national geographic and where the cover story is going to be at long last explorers have discovered the number two, right? It's not as though the number two is something that you see or hear or taste or could bump into whatever the number two is. It's something that our mind can grasp but isn't actually in the physical world.

Speaker 2:          32:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:56          That is the platonic take on mathematics. There are numbers. The mind can think about them. Things can sort of partake of them. If I were to hold up two pieces of paper, there's a sense in which they are participating in two hood, but of course this is not the number two here. If I were to rip these pieces of paper, I wouldn't be destroying the number two. So the number two, the number was three, whatever it is, whatever they are, are these platonic abstract entities that don't exist in space and time yet for all that the mind can think about them. That's the idea and it's not a silly idea. I mean it's, it's, it seems like a very compelling account of what's going on in mathematics. What mathematicians are doing is using their mind to think about these platonic ideas of mathematics to Plato's thought was everything is like that. It's not just math, but justice itself is like that. There are Josta unjust things in the world. The mind can think about them, but justice itself, this sort of perfect I this idea of being perfectly just, that's something the mind can think about, but it's not here in the world. It's another abstract platonic form.

Speaker 1:          34:26          So that's the picture. Plato's idea is that if we start doing enough metaphysics, we can see there must be this realm of platonic ideas, platonic forms, and we can see that we are able to grasp them through the mind. This can't be a job the body does because the body's only got it's bodily capacities, right? It's able to do the five senses thing. It's the soul that thinks about the platonic forms.

Speaker 2:          35:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:03          And as Plato's than glad to go on to try to argue, given this picture of what the mind can do, he thinks he can persuade us that the mind, the soul not only survives the death of your body, but will last forever. It's, it's, it's perfect. It's immaterial, and, and, and, and can't be destroyed. It's a mortal. So he offers a series of arguments for that conclusion, uh, for that position. And starting next time, you know, we'll work our way through those arguments.
