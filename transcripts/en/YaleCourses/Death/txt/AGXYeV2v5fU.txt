Speaker 1:          00:00          We've been talking about the question, what arguments might be offered for the existence of a soul and a family of arguments that were considering initially our arguments that get known as inference or inferences to the best explanation. The thought is that there's something about us that needs explaining. We can't explain it in terms of impure Lee physical terms. And so we need to appeal to, we need to posit the existence of a soul. Now, I'll come back to that sort of argument in just a minute, but, uh, let me, let me bracket that for a moment and say something about Plato a starting next week, we're going to be looking at Plato's dialogue, the Fito. And so although I'll be saying a great deal about the fetal, once we turned to it, I want to just take a minute or two and say a couple of introductory remarks. I don't know how many of you have not read any Plato before, but for those of you who haven't, I actually think you're in for a treat. Plato's not only one of the greatest philosophers in history, he wrote his philosophy, uh, in the form of dialogues. Uh, that is to say plays a in which various characters sit around or stand around and argue about philosophical positions.

Speaker 2:          01:16          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16          The particular dialogue that we're going to be reading the Fito is set at the death scene of Socrates. Socrates's I'm sure you know, Socrates was put on trial, condemned to death for corrupting the youth of Athens. Uh, perhaps among other things for arguing philosophy with them. Uh, and, uh, the, he's given hemlock a poison and he drinks it and he dies. Now this is a historical event. Amman, Socrates had a, a circle of friends and disciples that he would argue philosophy with. One of his disciples was Plato. Plato then, uh, you know, grew up and wrote philosophical works. Plato does not typically appear in his own dialogues, or if he does, he's only, there is a minor character. In fact, if I recall correctly, Plato's mentioned as not being there on the day that Socrates dies.

Speaker 2:          02:23          MMM.

Speaker 1:          02:25          So how do we know if you've got this play, whose position is Plato's position? And the answer to the short answer is soccer cheese. The character Socrates in the play represents playdough, the author of the plays philosophical views. Now in fact, if this were a class in ancient philosophy, we'd have to complicate that picture because it's fairly clear that by late in Plato's career, Plato is, has philosophical views that are very much unlike the views of his teacher Socrates. And yet Plato continues to not appear in the dialogue. Socrates continues to be sort of the hero. And so scholars debate, you know which of the s the view is put forward by Socrates in which ones have the dialogues represent views that belonged to the actual historical figure soccer teas. And which of the views put forward by the character of Socrates in which of the dialogues represent views that are actually not held by the historical Socrates, but were instead held by the historical Plato.

Speaker 1:          03:38          And we're merely put in the mouth of the character of Socrates, no scholars distinguished between the early platonic dialogues that so called Socratic dialogues where the thought is those are the views of Socrates, the actual historical figure. And then there's the late dialogues where even though Socrates appears, most scholars believe those are probably not the views that the historical Socrates actually believed. You have middle dialogues where you have to worry about whose views are who's, but, but we're not going to worry. We, this is not a class in an ancient philosophy, and so for our purposes, we don't have to ask ourselves when soccer teams in the dialogue says something, is this a view that the dead man Socrates actually would have held or is this simply a view that the dead man Plato put in the mouth of the character Socrates? For our purposes, it won't really matter.

Speaker 1:          04:32          I'll take every view that soccer t's puts forward as a view of Plato's though, I'll talk, I'll, I'll typically sort of run back and forth sort of in a, in a careless fashion. I'll say Plato holds or Socrates argues because for our purposes it's all the same. But there's one other complication that you've got to be warned about, which is this because these are dialogs and they take the form of philosophical arguments, people put forward views and then over the course of the discussion changed their minds about things and and they, and they take them back and, and maybe something similar is going on when soccer gs said something because after all it says isn't Plato saying, you know, here's what I believe explicitly. He's just writing a dramatic play about philosophy. And so sometimes we'll find ourselves thinking, you know, there's an argument here that Socrates is putting forward but maybe it's not a very good argument and it will at least be worth pausing periodically to ask ourselves.

Speaker 1:          05:38          Maybe Plato realized it wasn't a very good argument. We can often better understand the dialogues by seeing Socrates as putting forward certain positions that he does not think are all together adequate and he modifies them, revises them, or introduces new positions to deal with some of the difficulties that he was setting himself up to be open to earlier. They say, don't worry about any of those details now, but it's a point to keep in mind as you read the dialogue. So that's all I really wanted to say. By way of introduction, you should start reading the Thedo for next week. We'll be talking about the fito starting sometime next week and we'll continue the discussion of the Fito, uh, for at least a bit of maybe all of the week after that. In the case of Plato, I'm going to make an exception. Normally I will mention our readings, but I won't spend a lot of time actually discussing them in detail.

Speaker 1:          06:41          That's why you have to think of the readings as complimenting the lectures or think of the lectures as complementing the readings. I'm not just giving, you know, the cliff notes as it were, uh, of, uh, of, of the readings. Nonetheless, in the case of of the Pheto, I am going to spend more time actually saying, here's what I think the first main argument is. Let's try to reconstruct it in terms of its premises, in his conclusions. Here are some objections I raised. Here's then the next argument that Plato offers. Let's try to get that up and premises even there. I won't be spending time reading out loud, long passages from the Fito, but in some sense I'll be giving a closer commentary of the Fito then I'll do for the other readings. So, so what you shouldn't do is start reading it from next week. The, that topic of the Fito.

Speaker 1:          07:35          As I say, it's, it's set on Socrates last day. You know, at the end of the dialogue he drinks to hemlock and, and he dies. And perhaps unsurprisingly, what he does with his friends up until that moment is he argues about the immortality of the soul. Quite strikingly, Socrates is not upset. He's not worried about the fact that he's going to die. He actually welcomes this in a certain way, uh, because he believes his, his soul is immortal. Uh, and so in addition to philosophical arguments for and against the existence and the mortality of the soul, uh, we end the dialogue with a, with a quite moving a death scene. One of the sort of, you know, great death scenes, if we could call it that, of, of Western civilization. As I said, that's all for next week. So let's return now to the question, how might we argue for the existence of the soul?

Speaker 1:          08:34          Initially, last time we considered a set of, or a subset of arguments that basically said, look, there's gotta be more to us than just material objects. People can't just be machines because machines can't reason machines can't think. And I said, that doesn't seem to be a compelling argument. After all chess playing computers, it seems can reason they have beliefs about what I'm likely to do next. They have desires about the goals that they're trying to achieve. They reasoned about how best to defeat me. And it's, and it's worth pointing out that it's a point that I didn't make last time. It's worth pointing out that what the computers, at least the best chess playing computers don't do. Indeed. No computer actually does this. You might, you might think that what a computer with a chess playing computer does is justice. It calculates every possible branch, you know, every possible game from here on out.

Speaker 1:          09:30          And then it sort of works backwards. Or these are the ones where or when. And so it only makes the moves where it can sort of look ahead, 20 moves, right? And see which branches have the computer winning. That is not the way chess playing programs work for the simple reason that the number of possible chess games is so huge that computers can't calculate it. They'd be busy for thousands of years. I mean, we can do that sort of thing. When you play Tic Tac toe with your, you know, seven year old nephew or niece, you just look ahead and work backwards. Well, if I do that, he'll do that. He'll do that and then he wins. So I won't do that. Right. But we can't do that with chess. There's just too many games. So how do chess playing programs in particularly the best chess playing programs?

Speaker 1:          10:18          How do they work? Well, they play chess the same way you do. They have various ideas about which pieces are more powerful and so they're more important to protect. They've got various ideas about which strategies tend to be successful, what sorts of dangers come along with them. If you're a serious chess player, you might study some of the Great Games of chess history and indeed when they program these things, uh, the programmers will feed in, you know, gain after game after game of the Great Chess Games in history and then arm. With all of that you sort of do your best and when you'll lose a game you kind of make a mental note to yourself that really screwed me up. Let me try something different next time. And you avoid those sorts of moves. That's how chess playing programs work as well. Jumping ahead and let me, let me just make a remark about this because there's going to be relevant for something I'll get to in a couple of minutes.

Speaker 1:          11:22          What this means, what this w that the implication is that if you're playing a great chess playing program, it's not as though the way to tell what it's going to do is to study its program and think it through. The the people who design these programs, presumably fairly decent chess players themselves, the people who designed these programs, when they're playing the programs, they're not thinking to themselves, let's see, I programmed this computer so that when I move a queen forward that to this space, it should come out with the bishop. That's hopeless because the program is constantly revising its strategies in light of what's worked and what hasn't worked in the past. When the programmers play these programs or indeed when anybody, a good chess player plays these programs, the best way to try to beat them as simply ask yourself, what's the best move to make right now? The odds are that computer's gone and make the best possible move. Treat the computer as though it were just a great chess player

Speaker 1:          12:40          and indeed the best programs are great chess players. And then there was a period of time in which although they were decent chess playing programs, couldn't beat the best chess playing humans. That ended some years ago when the best programs began to beat a grand masters. Uh, and now it's in fact the case of the best programs can beat pretty much anybody. Uh, in the, the current world champion of chess. I think Vladimir Kramnik was defeated in December by a chess playing program. So no crop chrom Nick's simply treating this as an awesome opponent and that's the best way to deal with these things. All right, so

Speaker 1:          13:30          bracket some of those thoughts for a moment. We'll come back to them a little bit later when we start talking about the question. Could machines be creative? No. Tipping my hand seems pretty clear that that seems like the right thing to say about these chess playing programs. So we had the question, couldn't machines, could machines reason? And although we don't have machines that can reason about a lot of subjects yet it seems pretty clear. It seems like the natural thing to suggest machines can reason or at least some areas. And so it doesn't seem plausible to suggest that we people must not be physical, merely physical. Because after all we can reason to no machine can reason. Nope. Machines could reason. But this prompts a different move on the part of the defender of souls. Perhaps the, the argument shouldn't be we have to believe in souls because no mere physical object could reason. Perhaps the argument should be we have to believe in souls because no mirror, physical object, no machine could feel no. We have emotions we love, we're afraid, we're worried.

Speaker 2:          14:38          Okay,

Speaker 1:          14:38          we'll get elated, we get depressed. So perhaps the arguments should go, yeah, yeah. Thinking that's the sort of thing I'm machine can do. You know, we call them thinking machines, but feeling that's the sort of thing no machine could do. No purely physical objects could feel anything, could have emotions. And so since we clearly do feel things, there must be more to us than a physical object. Now I think it is plausible to suggest that unlike the case of, you know, chess playing computers, we don't yet have machines that feel things. So, but the question isn't do we, the question is, could there be a machine that could feel something, could have an emotion of some sort. So let's go a little science fictiony and think about some of the robots that have been shown in science fiction movies, some of the computer programs that have been shown in science fiction movies, science fiction novels, or what have you. When I was a kid, there was a television show called lost in space. I'm afraid I've forgotten the name of, uh, the, the robot that was on that show. Uh, but as it was Katie, I was a TV show. And so, you know, sure enough, every single episode, some new dramatic danger would take place and the robot would start, you know, whizzing and binging and shout out, oh, danger, commander Robin. So danger will Robinson. That was a danger. Will Robinson. It seemed as though the robot was worried.

Speaker 1:          16:20          More recent example number of you have probably read some of Douglas Adams is books, the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. Uh, and, uh, the sequels to that. There's a robot, uh, in, in those books. Marvin, who's, uh, depressed, uh, I think is the simple word about it. He sort of, you know, he's very smart. He thought about the universe, thinks life is pointless. Uh, and uh, he asks depressed, he talks to another robot, depresses the other robot, the other robot commit suicide. Um, all right. Seems natural to ascribe depression to Marvin the robot. That's how he behaves.

Speaker 2:          16:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:58          Or my favorite example, uh, the movie 2001, a space odyssey. Now I've got to tell you, for those of you who've not seen this movie, I'm about to spoil it. All right? So you cover your ears in 2001, a space odyssey. We get some kind of indication that there's life on another planet. It's all various mysterious and we send off a us a spaceship to investigate, you know, the markings, the, the, the radio signals from the other place. This is a very important mission. And so there is a a computer program named howl that helps run the ship and takes a lot of the burdens off of the part of the human astronauts who are on the ship. How's got the goal in terms of reasoning, desires and so forth and so on. How's got the goal of making sure the mission is successful, but how thinks to himself fairly plausibly humans really screw things up. This is a very important mission. Let's kill the humans to make sure they don't screw things up.

Speaker 2:          18:11          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:12          One of the astronauts discovering the plot attempts to stop how and proceeds to do and the only thing he can do to defend himself against how, which is shut down the program basically killing if we can talk that way. Killing how meanwhile, as all this is going on, howl and Dave, the human, uh, astronaut are talking to each other. How realizes what's going on? How tries to stop Dave understandably enough. And how says as day begins to shut down house circuits, I'm afraid. I'm afraid. Dave, what's he afraid of? He's afraid of dying. Seems perfectly natural. Right? To a scribe. Fear to how, how is behaving in exactly the way you would expect him to behave or it to behave if it felt fear,

Speaker 1:          19:17          it's got reason to be afraid. It's behaving appropriately. It's telling us that it's afraid. It seems natural to say, how's afraid now you could continue to sort of fill in examples like this. As I say, of course they're all science fiction, but the fact that we can grasp and you know it says that we go running away saying, oh no, this was outrageous. Right. This then it makes no sense. I think the computer could have said, I'm afraid. It makes no sense to think that it could try to kill the people who are trying to shut it down and so forth.

Speaker 2:          19:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:49          Oh, that seems to me to be prejudice. As I said last time, the natural inclination here is to say these computer programs, these robots are feeling emotion.

Speaker 2:          20:01          Okay,

Speaker 1:          20:02          but there's no particular reason to think there's anything going on there. Then the circuits, they're just physical objects. Programs on machines.

Speaker 2:          20:12          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          20:12          If that's right, if that's the right thing to say, than what we have to say is we don't need to appeal to souls in order to explain emotions and feelings. Physical objects could have mere physical objects, could have emotions and feelings, so we have no reason to posit the existence of a soul. Now I think the best response on the part of the, the dual list to this reply is to distinguish two aspects of feelings to of emotions. There's the behavioral aspect of feeling fear. Let's say the, the behavioral aspect is when you're aware in the environment of something that poses a danger to you know, that will harm you or destroy you or in the case of a computer program turn you off. Then you take various kinds of behaviors in, in a, in the opposition to that to try to disarm the danger to try to neutralize it. This is just a matter of beliefs, goals, responses, planning, the sort of thing that we already saw. The chess playing computer can do that behavioral side of emotion.

Speaker 2:          21:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:37          Seems pretty plausible to think robots could do that. Physical objects could do that. And here's what, here's the crucial point of this objection. There's another side or another aspect to emotions and feelings. It's the, it's the sensation of what it's feeling like. That's why we call them feelings after all, what it's feeling like. I'm the inside as it were. While all this behavioral stuff's going on, when I'm afraid I have this certain sort of clammy feeling or my heart's going pounding Lee, you know your, your blood is racing, right? When you're afraid, you got this sinking feeling in the stomach when you're depressed. There are these, well, we could call them experiences though. The word experience is also somewhat ambiguous. So we'll use it for the moment. There's an experience that goes along with each emotion. There's what it feels like to you when you're afraid, what it feels like to you when you're worried or depressed or joyful or in low.

Speaker 2:          22:57          Okay?

Speaker 1:          22:57          And the thought, and I think this is a pretty powerful thought, is that even if the robots are behaving behaviourally, they've got the behavior side of the emotions down. They don't have the feeling side at all.

Speaker 1:          23:20          Now, once you start thinking these thoughts, there's no need to restrict yourself to emotions. The, the, the missing stuff. The missing thing is there in all sorts of familiar humdrum ways as well. So No, right now I'm looking at, you know, the chairs in the auditorium. There are some kind of shade of blue. Think about, you know, look at someplace in the room where the curtains with their red. Think about what it's like to see red, the sensation of seeing red. Now again, we've got to distinguish between the, what I'll continue to call the behavioral side of seeing red and the experiential side of seeing red. It's easy enough for us to build a machine that can tell red from blue, no, just checks and sees what kind of light frequencies are bouncing off the object. And so we can build a machine that could sort red balls from blue balls. My son has a little robot that can do that.

Speaker 1:          24:27          Still. When you think to yourself, what's the, what's going on inside the machine? What does it feel like to be the machine? While it's looking at, well, I've got this little light sensors, you know, pointed at the, the red ball. Does it have the sensation of seeing red? What I suppose you want to say? Certainly what I want to say is no, no, it doesn't have that sensation at all. The it, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's sorting things based on the light frequencies, but it doesn't have the experience of seeing red. You know, this is what we're trying to get at here is it can be very elusive, but I imagine most of you are familiar with it. It's the sort of thing you wonder about when you ask yourself if somebody was born blind, could he possibly know what it's like to see color? He might be a scientist and know all sorts of things about how light works. No. The such and such frequencies in which objects you hand them an apple and I'll say, oh, must be very red. Right? Maybe he points his little, his little light detector at, at and an, and it reads out. It says, you know, this is such and such a frequency. Says, oh, this is a very red apple.

Speaker 1:          25:44          Much better than that tomato or whatever. But for all that we've got the notion, not only is he not seen red, he can't even imagine what it's like to see red never having had these experiences and once you start to see this, we realized of course our life is filled with this aspect. Things have colors, things have sounds, things have smells. There's the qualitative aspect of experience.

Speaker 2:          26:16          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          26:17          and the point that I started with earlier about sort of the internal aspect of emotions is it's not just out there, but inside as well. We have certain kinds of sensations inside our body.

Speaker 2:          26:29          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          26:29          The characteristics, sensation of fear or joy or depression. All right, so they're suggesting there might be this what, what no physical object can get cause no physical object can get it all is the qualitative aspect of experience. That's the aspect that we're after. When we ask ourselves, what's it like to see red? What's it like to smell coffee or tea? Taste pineapple. Now it's pretty full. Philosophers sometimes qualities thing call these things [inaudible] because of the, the notion of the qualitative aspects of things. Our experiences have qualitative properties and the suggestion then might be no physical object. No mere machine could possibly have qualitative experience. But we've got it. So we're no mere physical object. We're no mirror machine.

Speaker 1:          27:43          All right now the, that's the objection. That's pretty good objection. And then the question is what can the physical essay in response, no, the best possible response would be for the physical list to say here's how to build a machine that can be conscious in this sense that is have a qualitative experience. Here's how to do it. Here's how to, just like we can explain in materialistic physicalist terms how to get desires and beliefs in the behavioral stuff down. Here's how to get the, the feeling qualitative aspect of things down too. It would be best if the physicalist could give us that kind of story. And I think the truth of the matter has to be, I think, I think the, the, the answer right now is we don't know how to give that story consciousness. If what we mean by consciousnesses, this qualitative aspect of, of our mental life consciousness remains a pretty big mystery. We don't know how to explain it in physicalist terms and it's because of that, that I think we shouldn't be dismissive of the dualist when the dualist says we've got to believe in souls in order to explain it.

Speaker 1:          29:13          We shouldn't be dismissive, but that's not to say that I think we should be convinced because it's one thing to say we don't yet know how to explain consciousness in physical terms. It's another thing to say we won't ever be able to explain consciousness in physical terms. If we had

Speaker 2:          29:42          the ladder, okay,

Speaker 1:          29:45          excuse me. If we had the, the bold claim,

Speaker 2:          29:51          okay.

Speaker 1:          29:51          That no physical object could see red taste, honey.

Speaker 2:          29:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:59          Then we'd have to conclude since we can do all that we're not a physical object or not merely a physical object.

Speaker 2:          30:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:05          But I don't think we're yet in a position to say that. I think the simple fact of the matter is we don't know enough about consciousness yet to know whether or not it can be explained in physical terms. When I think about this situation, I, an analogy always occurs to me. Imagine that we are somewhere in let's say the 14th century trying to understand life, the life of plants a, it is a living thing. And we ask ourselves, could it possibly be that life could be explained in material terms? It's going to seem very mysterious to us. How could it be when we think of the kinds of examples of material machines that we've got available to us in the 14th century? And I try to imagine what would somebody in the 14th century think to himself or herself when he entertains the possibility that a plant might just be a machine.

Speaker 1:          31:07          And, and then I have this little image of, uh, some, some plant made out of gears, right? And the gears begin turning and the bud opens dot, dot, dot, dot, and and the, and the person's just going to say, my God, that wouldn't be alive. So it's pretty obvious that no machine could be alive. No material object could be alive. In order to explain life, we have to appeal to something more than just Adams. He didn't have Adam's but you know more than just matter. Life requires something in material above and beyond matter to explain it. That would have been an understandable position to come to in the 14th century, but it would have been wrong. We didn't have a clue back then how to explain life in material terms, but that didn't mean it couldn't be done.

Speaker 2:          32:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:06          I am inclined to think the same thing's true right now for us and consciousness. I know that are, there are theories out there, but my best take is we're pretty much like in the 14th century, we don't really have a clue yet or not much of a clue as to how you could even so much as begin to it. It's not that merely that we don't have the details worked out. We don't even have the picture in broad strokes as far as consciousness is concerned. How it can be done in physical terms

Speaker 1:          32:39          but not seen how it's possible is not the same thing as seen that it's impossible. If the dualist comes and says, can't you just see that it's not remotely possible? It's not conceivably possible for a purely physical object to have experiences to have quality. What I want to say is no, I don't see that it's impossible. I admit I don't see how to do it, but I don't see that it's impossible, so I don't feel forced to posit the existence of a soul. Of course, the the, the fan of the soul could come back and say, but that's not fair. The question isn't, is this explanation impossible? The question is just, who's got the better explanation? You guys can offer any kind of explanation at all yet I can offer an explanation. How is consciousness possible? We have souls. Souls are really very different from physical objects and so they can be conscious.

Speaker 2:          33:59          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          34:00          But at this point I think it's crucial to remember the point that it's not just the question, you know, who's got an explanation, but who's got the better explanation? And before we say that the soul views got the better explanation, we have to ask ourselves just how much of an explanation is it to say, Oh, I can explain consciousness consciousness is housed not in the body but in the soul. Okay. How exactly is it that a soul can be conscious? We ask and then the sole theory says, well, um, er, uh, it just can, that's not really much of an explanation. I don't feel I've got any sort of account going here as to how consciousness works. Even if I become a dualist. If the dualist where to start off on us, you know, some elaborate theory of consciousness. Well, other z sorts of soul structures and those sorts of souls structures and these create these sensations and those create those sensations. And here's a theory. Well then I'll begin to take it seriously as an explanation. But if all the soul theorist is just saying is Nana, you guys can't explain it. And I can, because I say this is an explanation, then I find myself wanting to say that's not really any better. That's no improvement at all. There was a question or comment.

Speaker 2:          35:29          Yeah. Capabilities to explain the consciousness. Is it not also possible technological capabilities to detect soul.

Speaker 1:          35:45          So the question was, first was the accusation before the question that I'm holding on sort of double standard. I'm defending bar. I'm defending the physical list by saying, you know, don't blame us. We don't know how to explain it yet. Why aren't I allowing the sole theory to say don't blame us. We don't know how to explain it yet. Good question. And my answer is in some sense I think this one's a tie. All right. I think the sole theorists doesn't have an explanation. The physical theorist doesn't have an explanation as far as I can see right now, nobody's got a good explanation about how consciousness works. It's a bit of a mystery right now. So I don't mean, I hope I haven't been doing this. It's not so much a double standard is needed. It's a tie. But notice if it's a tie that doesn't give us what we were looking for. What we're looking for after all was some reason to believe in souls and if the best the sole theorists can say is, I can't explain it and neither can you, that's not a reason to believe this side. We already believe there are bodies.

Speaker 2:          37:04          Okay,

Speaker 1:          37:04          we all ready know bodies can do some pretty amazing things. The question we're asking is, is there a good reason to add to our list of things there are. Is there a good reason to add the soul, something immaterial, and if the best that the soul theorist has is, maybe we need this to explain something that I don't see how you guys can explain. Maybe this would help do, I can't quite see how either. That's not a very compelling argument. So what I'm, what I'm inclined to think with regard to this particular strand of this particular version of the argument is the jury's still out. Maybe at the end of the day we'll give it our best. We'll decide, you know, you can't explain consciousness in physical terms. We'll begin to work out some sort of alternative, immaterial theory.

Speaker 2:          38:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:01          Maybe at the end of the day we will decide we need to believe in souls, but right now I don't think the evidence supports that conclusion.

Speaker 2:          38:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:09          Still there's other possibilities.

Speaker 2:          38:15          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          38:16          Consider creativity. Here's another version of an argument that goes from inference to the best explanation. Creativity. It says people can be creative. Yeah. We, we write new pieces of music. We write poems, we prove things in mathematics that I've never been proven before. We, we find new ways to prove these theorems or what have you, and we can be creative. No mere machine can be creative, so we must be something more than a mere machine.

Speaker 2:          38:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:51          Well, again, the question's going to be, could it be the case that there could be a physical object that's creative and I'm inclined to think yes. In fact, I already suggested as much when I talked about the chess playing computers, that chess playing computer programs.

Speaker 2:          39:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:11          Think of moves. Think of strategies. No one's thought of before in the most straightforward, natural meaning of the term. We'd have to say no. When the, I think the program that the beat the world champion was called Deep Fritz. So in deep Fritz beat Kramnik, it was being creative and it made a move the chronic didn't think of and perhaps it nobody had perhaps no chess game before it had this move.

Speaker 1:          39:42          Computers can do other sorts of things of this sort. Uh, there are mathematical theorem proving programs. No, no. Some of these things can prove things that you know mathematically way over my head. But let's take something simple like the Pythagorean Theorem, which we all learned in high school and we learned how to prove the Pythagorean theorem in Euclidean geometry, starting with the various axioms of you'll clean look Euclidean geometry, you know, bump up, up, up, up, up, up a bomb. This proves Pythagorean theorem and it turns out there's a variety of proofs of the Pythagorean theorem. And in fact, computer program has come up with a proof that as far as was known, nobody in the world had ever come up with before. Well, other than prejudice, what would stop us from saying the program was being creative, not just any sort of mathematical things like chess or, or math. Uh, there are, as you know, programs that can write music and I don't just mean throw out some random assortment of notes, programs that, uh, you know, can produce music I have that we recognize as music that had, have melodic structure and develop themes, resolve music that nobody's heard before. Why not say the machine is creative? What other than prejudice would stop us from saying that?

Speaker 1:          41:14          So if, if the argument's going to be, we need to posit the existence of a soul in order to explain creativity. Again, that just seems wrong. Well, there's a question comment

Speaker 2:          41:32          this, just like a scientific way to make a machine produce something that pass hasn't been used before.

Speaker 1:          41:40          But the question was when I talk about creativity here, am I trying to build in some appeal to the feeling that we may have when we're being creative? And the answer is no. All I had in mind. As you notice just in talking about the creativity issue, I just have in mind producing something new, producing something that hasn't been around before and most particularly producing something that your programmers didn't go already have in mind. Remember, it's not as though the people who designed the chess playing programs can beat it. The chess playing program makes moves. These guys haven't thought of.

Speaker 2:          42:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          42:20          All right. The creativity argument may not work, but, but there's something that sort of immediately comes on. It's heels. Even if we could build a program, even if we have built programs that can be creative, they can do things that nobody's thought of before. Oh, the program is doing is following its program. Right? It's just a series of lines of code and and and the robot or the computer or what have you is just, you know, automatically mechanically following the code commands of the program. We might say even if we are smart enough to build programs that can buy mechanistically following the program, do things we've never thought of. Still all the computer can do. All the robot can do is automatically necessarily mechanically follow the program. It doesn't have free will, but we have freewill. So here's a new argument for the existence of the soul.

Speaker 2:          43:44          Okay?

Speaker 1:          43:44          People have freewill.

Speaker 2:          43:48          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          43:48          no, merely mechanical objects. No robot, no computer could have free will.

Speaker 2:          43:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          44:00          But since we've got freewill, we must be something more than a merely physical object. There must be something extra, something immaterial about us. The soul.

Speaker 2:          44:15          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          44:16          So maybe that's why we need to believe in souls in order to explain freewill.

Speaker 2:          44:24          Now

Speaker 1:          44:26          th th th the subject, freewill is a very, very common subject. Consciousness is a very complicated, no one could have an entire semester devoted to thinking about the philosophical problem of consciousness. And indeed as it happens in our department this very semester, there is such a class devoted all semester to the topic of consciousness. One could similarly have, uh, a course devoted to the problem of freewill.

Speaker 2:          44:57          Okay,

Speaker 1:          44:57          I'm going to spend all of, you know, two minutes on it. So it's by no means do I mean to suggest, oh, here's everything and you know, about the subject. I simply wanted to point out enough about the problem to help you see why I don't think free will's a slam dunk

Speaker 2:          45:12          for the soul.

Speaker 1:          45:16          So, so what's the argument? Well, the, the, the thought seems to be something like this

Speaker 2:          45:24          one

Speaker 1:          45:28          we have freewill.

Speaker 2:          45:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          45:34          To, let me say something about this. What is it about the thought that the computer is just following a program while there thought, I suppose is and philosophers jargon that the computer is a deterministic system. It follows the laws of physics and the laws of physics are deterministic. You know that if you're in this state you will necessarily given the laws of physics and the way the computer is programmed and built and so forth, these, these, you know, these wires will turn on, turn off, these circuits will turn on, turn off, boom. Suddenly you'll be in that state. You know, there are certain laws such a given that the computers in this state, it must necessarily move in that state when you've got a view about cause and effect that works this way for everything that happens. There's some earlier thing that caused it to happen such that given that earlier because the event had to follow. That's a deterministic picture and the thought of course is that the robot or the computer is a deterministic system and you can't have freewill if you're a deterministic system.

Speaker 2:          46:42          So

Speaker 1:          46:44          well number one we have free will

Speaker 2:          46:47          to nothing subject to determinism

Speaker 1:          47:00          has free will.

Speaker 2:          47:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          47:06          Put One and two together. It follows if nothing's subject to determinism has freewill but we have free will. It follows that we're not subject to determinism.

Speaker 2:          47:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          47:17          It's supposedly then add three.

Speaker 2:          47:21          All right.

Speaker 1:          47:22          Surely physical systems,

Speaker 2:          47:25          yeah.

Speaker 1:          47:31          Are subject to determinism. Well one and two gave us that we are not subject to determinism. Three says all purely physical systems are subject to determinism. What would follow them from one, two and three that we are not a purely physical system.

Speaker 2:          47:59          So conclusion for we are not a purely physical system. All right.

Speaker 1:          48:17          That's the argument from freewill.

Speaker 2:          48:20          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          48:21          Now the argument is valid. That's philosophers jargon. That is to say given the three premises, the conclusion really does follow.

Speaker 2:          48:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          48:32          The interesting question is, are the three premises true? And they've got to all be true. It's got to be that every single one of them is. So

Speaker 2:          48:45          yeah.

Speaker 1:          48:46          I'll just spend a minute more on this starting next time, but the point to think about for next time is just, is it really true that all three of the premises are true, or my one or more of them be false. All right. That's where we'll start next time.
