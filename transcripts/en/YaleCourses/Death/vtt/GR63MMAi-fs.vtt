WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.630
Today we're going to take up the discussion where we left it last time.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.370
We were talking about two main positions with regard to the question,

3
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:12.120
what is a person?
I'm the one hand we have the dualist view.

4
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:17.040
That's the view that we spent a fair bit of time sketching.
Uh,
last meeting.

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.070
The dualist view according to which a person is a body and a soul or perhaps

6
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:23.160
strictly speaking,

7
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:27.720
what we should say is the only part that's essential to the person is the soul.

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.710
Though it's got a rather intimate connection to a particular body.
Uh,

9
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:34.770
that's the dualist view.
And in contrast to that,

10
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:39.660
we've got the physical list view according to which,
uh,
there are just bodies.

11
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.590
A person is just a body as we might put it.
Now,

12
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.970
the crucial point here,

13
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:48.600
the point that I was turning to as we ended last time is that at all a person on

14
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.360
the physicalist view is just a body.

15
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.020
A person isn't just any old body.

16
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.440
A person is our body that can do a certain array of it has a certain set of

17
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.150
abilities,
can do a certain array of activities.

18
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.890
People are bodies that can think,
that can communicate,

19
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.020
that are rational,
that can plan,

20
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.730
that can feel things that can be creative and so forth and so on.

21
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.020
Now we might argue about what's the exact best list of those abilities for our

22
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:27.661
purposes.

23
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:32.661
I think that won't be crucial and so I'll sometimes talk about this set of

24
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:36.810
abilities without actually having a canonical list.
You know,

25
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:40.470
just think of them as the set of abilities that people have.

26
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:44.880
The things that we can do that well.
Other physical objects,
you know,

27
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.240
chalk radios,
cars,

28
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.510
those things can't do call those the the abilities that make something a person.

29
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.960
In fact,
to just introduce a piece of jargon,

30
00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:02.961
we could call those the p abilities p for person or we could talk about the

31
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:06.480
various kinds of ways.
This is the physical way of thinking about it.

32
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.750
According to the physical is the person who's just a body that has the ability

33
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:17.481
to fulfill the various p functions and we can talk then about a person as a p

34
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.660
functioning body.

35
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.260
Or we could say that a person is a body that is p functioning.

36
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.830
It's important to see that the idea is,
although it's a body,

37
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:35.220
it's not just any old body and indeed it's not just any old human body.

38
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:38.550
After all,
you rip out your gun,
shoot me in the heart.

39
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.320
I bleed to death while we still have a human body in front of us,

40
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.950
but we don't have a p functioning body.

41
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:51.660
We don't have a body that's able to think a body that's able to plan,

42
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:55.490
to communicate,
to be creative,
to have goals,
you know?

43
00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.500
So the crucial thing about having a person is having a p functioning body.

44
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.420
Now,
what's a mind on this view?

45
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.890
I'm the physical list view,

46
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.830
which it's still perfectly legitimate to talk about mines.

47
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.550
The point though is that from the physicalist perspective,

48
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:20.551
the best thing to say is talk about a mind is a way of talking about these

49
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:26.071
various mental abilities of the body away we nominalize it,

50
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:32.650
we talk about it using the noun,
the mind,

51
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.830
but talk of the mind is just a way of talking about these abilities that the

52
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:42.430
body has when it's functioning properly.

53
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.940
This is similar,
let's say to talking about a smile,

54
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.880
right?
Well,
you know,
we will eat it.
There are smiles.

55
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:55.750
Physical lists don't deny that there are mines just like we don't deny.

56
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:59.330
We all believe that there are smiles.
But what is a smile?

57
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.380
A smile is just a way of talking about the ability of the body to do something.

58
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.330
You know,
this characteristic thing we do with our lips,

59
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:15.280
exposing our teeth and so forth.
Him,
eh,
there's a smile whether dorky smile,

60
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:18.220
but there's a smile.
Now,

61
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.890
if you were listing the parts of the body,
you know,
you would list the teeth,

62
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.280
you would list the lips,
you would list the gums,
you would list the tongue,

63
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.340
but you wouldn't list the smile.
So you know,

64
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.420
should we conclude as dualists that whoa smiles are these extra nonphysical

65
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:42.400
things.
You know,
that,
that have a special intimate relationship with bodies.
Well,

66
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:43.750
you could imagine if you like that,

67
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:47.500
but when you rather a silly view talking of a smile,

68
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:52.501
talk about a smile is just a way of talking about the body's ability to smile.

69
00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.160
There is no extra part,
even though we have a noun,

70
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.840
thus smile that you know,
if you're not careful,

71
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:08.200
my low you into thinking there must be a thing.

72
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.220
Thus smile and then you'd have all these metaphysical conundrums.

73
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.780
Where is the smile located?
Well,
it seems to be in the vicinity of the mouth.

74
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.370
Right,
but,
but you know,
but the smile isn't the lips.
The smile isn't the teeth,

75
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:24.970
you know,
so it must be something nonphysical.
No,
that would just be,
you know,

76
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.150
a silly way to think about smiles talk a smiles is just a way of talking about

77
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.900
the ability of this,
of the body to smile,

78
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.040
to form a smile.
That's an ability that we have our bodies have.

79
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.950
Similarly then according to the physicalist talk of the mind,

80
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.870
despite the fact that we have a noun,

81
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.900
there is just a way of talking about the abilities of the body to do various

82
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:55.054
things.

83
00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.450
The the is just a way of talking about the fact that our body can think,

84
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.040
can communicate,
can plan,
can,
can deliberate,

85
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.720
can,
can be creative,
can write poetry,
can,
can fall in love.

86
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.500
Talk of all of those things is what we mean by the mind,

87
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.080
but there's no extra thing.

88
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.370
The mind above and beyond the body.
That's the physical list view.

89
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:27.371
So it's important in particular to understand that from the physicalist point of

90
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:28.394
view,

91
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.740
the mind is not the brain,
right?
You might think,
look,

92
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.450
according to physical lists,
minds are just brains and that'd be it.
You know,

93
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:43.040
that wouldn't be on a horrendously misleading thing to say because according to

94
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:45.080
the best science that we've got,

95
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.200
the the brain is the part of the body that sort of is the seat or house or the,

96
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.821
you know,

97
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:57.800
the underlying mechanical structure that gives us these various abilities.

98
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.450
These p functions are functions that we have by virtue of our brain.

99
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.540
So that might tempt you into saying the mind on the physicalist view is just a

100
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:09.434
brain.

101
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.780
But we probably shouldn't say that because after all,
you know,
you shoot me,

102
00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:18.560
there's my corpse line on the stage.
Well,
there's my brain,
you know,

103
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.290
my brain is still there in my head,

104
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.970
but we no longer have a person.
The person has died.

105
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:28.670
The person that seems,
you know,
no longer exists,

106
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.880
whether strictly that's the best thing to say or not as a question we'll have to

107
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:33.940
come to in a couple of weeks.
But you know,

108
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.660
it seems pretty clear that the mind has been destroyed even though the brain is

109
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:43.130
still there.
So I think at least when we're,
when there's the need to be careful,

110
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.230
maybe we don't normally have the need to be careful,

111
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.940
but when there's the need to be careful,

112
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:51.941
we should say talk of the mind is the way is a way of talking about the p

113
00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:56.090
functioning of the body and our,

114
00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:01.150
and our best science suggests that a well functioning body can perform these

115
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:02.331
things,

116
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:06.740
can think and plan and fall in love by virtue of the fact that the brain is

117
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.940
functioning properly.
All right,
that's the physicalist view.
Now,

118
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.330
if we take this,
do you know,
we thought,
look,
I'm the,
I'm the dualist view.

119
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.530
What was death?

120
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.640
Death is presumably the separation of the mind and the body with the destruction

121
00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:23.210
of the,
perhaps the permanent separation with the destruction of the body.

122
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.550
What's death on the physicalist view or there is no extra entity.

123
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.720
The soul,

124
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.920
the mind is just the proper functioning of the body,

125
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.400
so the mind gets destroyed when the ability of the body to function in that way

126
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.280
has been destroyed.

127
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:48.460
Death is roughly the end of this set of functioning.

128
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.130
Again,

129
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:57.130
this probably should be cleaned up and in a couple of weeks we'll spend a day or

130
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.270
half period trying to clean it up and make it somewhat more precise,

131
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.590
but there's nothing mysterious about death from the physical list point of view,

132
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:09.591
at least about the basic idea of what's going on in death and I've got a stereo,

133
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.600
I suppose I hold up my boombox for you and it's playing music.

134
00:09:14.601 --> 00:09:18.240
It's one of the things that can do and I drop it on the ground,

135
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:22.920
smashing it well,
no longer can function properly.

136
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.750
Yeah,
it's broken.

137
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.260
It's no mystery why it can't function once it's Grocon death is basically just

138
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:37.250
the breaking down of the body on the physicalist point of view so that it no

139
00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:39.510
longer functions properly.

140
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.800
One other point worth emphasizing and sketching the physical list views this.

141
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.040
So as I said,
physical lists don't deny that there are minds,
you know,

142
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:51.780
even though we say we're just bodies,

143
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:54.480
that doesn't mean that we're just any old body.

144
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.880
It's not as though the physicalist view is we're bodies that you know,

145
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.670
have some illusion of thinking.
No,

146
00:10:00.671 --> 00:10:05.640
we're bodies that really do think so.
The really our minds,

147
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.600
we could on the physicalist point of view,

148
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:14.601
call those souls just like there's no danger in talking of a mine from the

149
00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:16.440
physical list perspective,

150
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.830
there wouldn't be any serious danger and talking about a soul.

151
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:24.890
And so in certain contexts I'm perfectly comfortable and my physical,

152
00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:28.080
his moods,
I'm perfectly comfortable talking about,
you know,

153
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.840
this person's soul,
he's got a good soul,
a bad solo,

154
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.220
how the sole source when I read Shakespeare or what have you,

155
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:40.430
that there's nothing upsetting or improper about the language of the soul,

156
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:44.760
even on the physical,
his point of view.
But in this class,

157
00:10:44.761 --> 00:10:48.270
just to try to keep us from getting confused.
As I indicated before.

158
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.410
Now I want to remind you,

159
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:54.710
I'm going to save the word soul when I always try to save the word soul for when

160
00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:59.280
I'm talking about the dualist view.
So we might put it this way.

161
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.880
The neutral term is going to be mined.

162
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.780
We all agree that people have mine's sort of the house or the seed of our

163
00:11:09.451 --> 00:11:11.670
personalities.
Uh,

164
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.170
and the question is what is a mind and the dual,

165
00:11:16.171 --> 00:11:21.171
his position is that the mind is a soul and the soul is an immaterial object.

166
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.280
So when I use the word soul,

167
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:31.281
I will try to reserve it for the metaphysical view according to which souls are

168
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:35.400
something immaterial.
In contrast to that,

169
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.870
we've got the physical list view.
Physical assault also believe in mines,

170
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:44.310
but minds are just a way of talking about the abilities of the body.

171
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.430
And so they do not believe physical lists do not believe in any,

172
00:11:47.431 --> 00:11:51.360
in material object above and beyond the body.

173
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.270
That's part of a person.
And so just to keep things clear,

174
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.300
I will say that physical lists,

175
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:03.330
materialists do not believe in souls because for the purposes of this class,

176
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:08.610
I'm going to reserve the word soul for the immaterialist conception of the mind

177
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.190
though in other contexts,
no,

178
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:17.780
no harm in talking about souls.
All right,
so,

179
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.620
so this is the,
these are the two basic positions,

180
00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:24.550
the dualist view on the one hand,
the physical list view on the other.

181
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.660
And the question we need to turn to,

182
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.940
I take it that just as the dualist view is a familiar one.
So the,

183
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.300
so it's true that the physical,
his view is that it's a familiar one.

184
00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:35.890
You know whether or not you believe it,

185
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.510
you are familiar with the fact that you know,

186
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:40.720
some people believe it or at least you wonder whether it's true.

187
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.400
Does science or choir that we believe in the physical list view or not.

188
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.510
The question we want to turn to then is,

189
00:12:51.511 --> 00:12:56.190
which of these two views should we believe the dualist position or the physical

190
00:12:56.191 --> 00:12:57.024
list position?

191
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.770
And the crucial question presumably is,
well,

192
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.230
should we believe in the existence of a soul?

193
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:09.410
I mean both sides believe in bodies,
right?
As I say,
the,

194
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.020
the dual list position is we're understanding it is not a view that says there

195
00:13:13.021 --> 00:13:14.130
are only minds.

196
00:13:14.131 --> 00:13:18.000
There are no bodies dualist belief that through our bodies they believe that our

197
00:13:18.001 --> 00:13:22.740
souls as well as bodies physical believe that our bodies,
but no souls.

198
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.450
So there's an agreement that there are bodies.
No.
Here's one.
You know,

199
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.450
each one of you is sort of dragging one around with you.

200
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.020
There's agreement that there was bodies.
The question is,

201
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.310
are there anything beyond bodies?
Is there anything beyond the body?

202
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.650
Is there a soul?
Are their souls?

203
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:46.380
So that's the question that's going to concern us for a couple of weeks.

204
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.570
Well,
if we asked ourselves,
no,

205
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.580
what reasons do we have to believe in a soul?

206
00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:59.110
We might start by asking what reasons do we have to believe in anything?

207
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.560
How do we prove the existence of things?
Now,

208
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:07.210
for lots of familiar every day objects,

209
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.180
the answer is fairly straight forward.

210
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:15.160
We prove their existence by using our five senses.
We just see them,

211
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.930
right?
How do I know that there are chairs?

212
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:24.340
Well,
you know,
there are some chairs in front of me,
opened my eyes.
I see them.

213
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.570
How do I know that there is a lectern?
Well,
I,
I see it.

214
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.360
I can touch it.
I feel it.

215
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.140
How do I know that there are trees?
I see them.

216
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.780
How do I know that there are birds?
I see them,
I hear them.

217
00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.980
How do I know that there are apples?
I see them,
I taste them.
So forth and so on.

218
00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:49.420
But that approach pretty clearly isn't going to work for souls because a soul,

219
00:14:52.281 --> 00:14:54.410
and again,
we got in mind this metaphysical view corn,

220
00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:58.580
which is something immaterial isn't something we see.

221
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:04.090
It's not something we taste or touch or smell or hear.

222
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:09.220
We don't directly observe souls with our five senses.

223
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.481
Might wonder,

224
00:15:12.481 --> 00:15:16.290
well why don't I sort of directly observe it in myself that I have a soul.

225
00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.410
And although I guess there have been people who've,

226
00:15:19.411 --> 00:15:22.350
who've made that sort of claim,
it's seems false to me.

227
00:15:22.351 --> 00:15:25.860
I can only ask each of you to sort of introspect for a second,
you know,

228
00:15:25.861 --> 00:15:28.830
so turn your mind's eye inward and ask,

229
00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:32.220
do you see a soul inside you?

230
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:38.340
I don't think so.
I mean,
I,
I,
I see no things outside me.

231
00:15:38.341 --> 00:15:40.830
I feel certain sensations in my body,

232
00:15:40.831 --> 00:15:45.000
but it doesn't seem as though I observe a soul.
Even if I believe in a soul,

233
00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:49.240
I don't see it.
Well,

234
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:53.650
how do we prove the existence of things we can't see or hear or taste and so

235
00:15:53.651 --> 00:15:58.430
forth.
The,
the usual method,

236
00:15:58.431 --> 00:16:02.300
maybe not the only method,
but the usual method is something like this.

237
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:07.840
Sometimes we posit the existence of something that we can't see,

238
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:16.570
so as to explain something else that we all agree takes place.

239
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

240
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.910
<v 0>Why do I believe in the existence of atoms?</v>

241
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.240
I don't see individual atoms.

242
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.710
Why do I believe in the existence of atoms so small that I can't see them?

243
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.920
Because atomic theory explains things when I pause it.

244
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.240
The existence of atoms with certain structures and certain sort of ways of

245
00:16:44.311 --> 00:16:48.030
interacting and combine it and building up.
When I pause it,

246
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:53.390
Adam's suddenly I can explain all sorts of things about the physical world and

247
00:16:54.811 --> 00:16:59.811
so I infer the existence of atoms.

248
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

249
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:08.010
<v 0>Based on the fact that doing that allows me to explain things that need</v>

250
00:17:08.351 --> 00:17:09.184
explaining.

251
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:15.410
This is a kind of argument that we use all the time.
Yeah.

252
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.120
How do I pause it?
You know why?

253
00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:21.940
Why do I believe in X-ray's even though I don't see them?

254
00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:25.000
Because doing that allows me to explain certain things.

255
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:29.860
Why do I believe in,
you know,
certain planets,

256
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:34.120
you know too far away to be observed directly through a telescope?

257
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:39.420
Because positing them allows you to explain certain things about the rotation of

258
00:17:39.671 --> 00:17:42.580
the star,
the gravitational fluctuations,
what have you.

259
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:48.300
We make inferences to the existence of things we can't see when doing that helps

260
00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:54.060
us to explain something we can't otherwise explain.

261
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.250
This pattern of argument,

262
00:17:56.251 --> 00:18:01.251
which is ubiquitous is called inference to the best explanation.

263
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:09.750
Now I want to emphasize this bit about best explanation.

264
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:14.850
What we're justified in believing are those things that we need,

265
00:18:14.851 --> 00:18:18.780
not simply when they would offer us some kind of explanation,

266
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.760
but when they offer us the best explanation that we can think of.

267
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.860
So look,
why am I justified in believing in germs,

268
00:18:28.861 --> 00:18:32.850
various kinds of viruses that I can't see because of bacteria?
What have you.

269
00:18:32.851 --> 00:18:37.851
Because doing that allows me to explain why people get sick.

270
00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.520
Oh,
but there's other things that would allow me to explain that as well.

271
00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:46.500
How about demons?
Alright,
I could believe in demons and say,
Oh,

272
00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:48.730
you know,
why did the person gets sick and die?
We're all,
you know,

273
00:18:48.731 --> 00:18:49.920
it was demonic possession.

274
00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:56.650
Why are anti justified in believing in the existence of demons?

275
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.410
It's a possible explanation.

276
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.620
But what we've seen to be justified in believing,

277
00:19:02.621 --> 00:19:04.900
it's not just any old explanation,

278
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:10.120
but the best explanation.
So we've got two rival explanations.

279
00:19:10.121 --> 00:19:14.110
We've got roughly germ theory and we've got demon theory and we'd have to ask

280
00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:14.830
ourselves,

281
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:19.830
which of these does a better job of explaining the facts about disease?

282
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.980
Who gets what kinds of diseases,
how diseases spread,

283
00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.820
how they can be treated or cured.
When they kill somebody.

284
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.480
And the fact of the matter is demon theory doesn't do a very good job of

285
00:19:34.751 --> 00:19:39.751
explaining disease where wild germ theory does do a good job.

286
00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.250
It's the better explanation.

287
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:47.800
And so we're justified in believing in germs but not demons.

288
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:52.720
So it's a matter of inference not just to any old explanation,

289
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.870
but inference to the best explanation.
All right,

290
00:19:55.871 --> 00:19:59.050
so what we need to ask ourselves then is,

291
00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:03.100
what about the soul can't observe souls,

292
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:06.760
but here's a possible way of arguing for them.

293
00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:12.210
Are there things that need to be explained that we could explain?

294
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:19.200
If we posited the existence of a soul and immaterial object above and beyond the

295
00:20:20.141 --> 00:20:24.550
body,
are there things that the existence of the soul could explain

296
00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.680
and explained better?

297
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.720
Then the explanation that we would have if we had to limit ourselves to bodies?

298
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:38.961
My put it this way,

299
00:20:38.961 --> 00:20:42.230
there's sort of the easiest version of this kind of argument for our purposes.

300
00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.560
Are there things about us that the physicalist cannot explain?

301
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:53.730
Are there mysteries or puzzles about people that the physical is just draws a

302
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:59.020
blank?
But if we become lists,

303
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.020
we could explain these features.

304
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.910
Suppose there was a feature like that feature f,

305
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:11.320
then we'd say,
look,
although we can't see the soul,

306
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:16.350
we have reason to believe in the soul because positing the existence of a soul

307
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:22.360
helps us to explain the existence of feature F,
which we all agree.

308
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:23.200
We've got.

309
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:29.910
Suppose it was true that you couldn't explain love from the physicalist

310
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.390
perspective,
but we all know that people do fall in love,

311
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:35.540
but souls would allow us to explain that.
Well,
boom,

312
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.890
we'd have an argument for the existence of a soul.

313
00:21:39.891 --> 00:21:42.950
It would be an example of inference to the best explanation.

314
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.690
Now the,

315
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:51.690
the crucial question of course is what's the relevant feature?

316
00:21:52.121 --> 00:21:53.660
F Yep.

317
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:58.660
Is there some feature that the physicalist can't explain?

318
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.770
And so we need to appeal to something extra physical to explain it.

319
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:08.440
Or The physical list can only do a rotten job of explaining.

320
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:09.810
And if we were to repeat like,

321
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.930
like demon theory did you know if we have appeal to something nonphysical,

322
00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:15.880
we do a better job of explaining

323
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:22.500
if we could find the right eth and make off the argument.

324
00:22:23.021 --> 00:22:27.340
The physicalist can't explain it or does a bad job of explaining it and the

325
00:22:27.341 --> 00:22:29.380
dualist does a better job of explaining it.

326
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.870
We'd have reason to believe in the soul,

327
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.710
like all arguments in philosophy.

328
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:40.050
It would be a tentative argument.
It would be.
It would we,
we,

329
00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:44.020
we sort of have some reason to believe in the soul until we sort of see what's

330
00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:45.820
next.
Argument comes down the road.

331
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.490
But at least it would give us some reason to believe in the soul.

332
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:56.470
So what I want to do is ask what might feature F B

333
00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:03.130
is there any such feature f and it's probably also worth underlining the fact

334
00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:08.080
that what I'm really then doing is running through a series of arguments.

335
00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:13.410
Inference to the best explanation is not a single argument for the soul.

336
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.020
It's rather the name for a kind of argument.

337
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:21.700
And depending on what f you fill in the blank with,
you know,

338
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.800
what pet feature or fat you're trying to explain by appeal to the soul,

339
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.790
you get a different argument.
All right,
so let's ask ourselves,

340
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:35.110
are there things that we need to appeal to the soul in order to,

341
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:39.940
to in order to explain these things about us?
Well,

342
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.200
here's a first try.

343
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:47.080
Actually let me start by saying I'm going to distinguish two broad families of,

344
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.250
of characteristics we might appeal to that might,

345
00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:54.251
we might say one set of approaches focus on ordinary familiar every day facts

346
00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:04.190
about us.
The fact that we love the fact that we think the fact that uh,
you know,

347
00:24:04.191 --> 00:24:05.990
we experience emotions,
what have you,

348
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.440
these just sort of ordinary features of us.

349
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:14.540
And then I'm going to start with those and then I'll turn eventually to another

350
00:24:14.541 --> 00:24:17.240
set of possible things that might need explaining,

351
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.950
which we might think of as extra ordinary supernatural things.
You know,

352
00:24:21.951 --> 00:24:25.460
maybe there are certain supernatural things about communication from the,

353
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.110
from the dead or near death experiences that need to be explained in terms of

354
00:24:30.111 --> 00:24:32.240
the soul.
So,
so we'll get to those,

355
00:24:32.241 --> 00:24:37.241
but we'll start with sort of ordinary everyday humdrum facts about us.

356
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.710
Even though they're ordinary and familiar,

357
00:24:39.711 --> 00:24:43.730
it still could turn out that we need to appeal to souls in order to explain
them.

358
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:44.870
So to start,

359
00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.013
<v 1>how about this,</v>

360
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:52.190
<v 0>start with the familiar faculty have already drawn your attention to a couple of</v>

361
00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:56.900
times that you know,
you could have a body that's dead.

362
00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:02.120
You know,
you can have a corpse and that's clearly not a person.

363
00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:07.010
It's not a living being.
It's not a person,
it doesn't do anything.

364
00:25:07.011 --> 00:25:10.730
It just lies there.
Whereas your body,

365
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.970
my body is animated,
right?
I'm,

366
00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:18.350
I move my hands around,
my mouth is going up and down.

367
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:22.040
It walks from one part of the stage to the other part of the stage.

368
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.880
Maybe we need the to appeal to the soul in order to explain sort of what

369
00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:34.940
animates the body.
And the thought would be,

370
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.610
you know,
when the soul and the body had been separated,

371
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:42.670
that's the dual list explains the soul has lost its ability to give commands to

372
00:25:44.211 --> 00:25:47.570
the body.
And so the body's no longer animated.

373
00:25:47.571 --> 00:25:52.220
So we've got a possible explanation of the difference between an animated and an

374
00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:57.270
on animated or inanimate body to it is the soul in contact of the right sort

375
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:02.960
with the body.
There's a possible explanation.
Might say,
look,

376
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:07.100
the physicalist can't tell us that because all the physical parts are still

377
00:26:07.101 --> 00:26:09.280
there.
When you've got the corpse Elise,

378
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.370
if it's all a fresh corpse before the decay has set in.

379
00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:19.680
So we need to appeal to the existence of a soul in order to explain the

380
00:26:19.681 --> 00:26:23.130
animation of bodies.
Like you know,
the ones that you and I have.

381
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:25.573
<v 1>Well,</v>

382
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.270
<v 0>I said I was going to run through a series of arguments,</v>

383
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:35.310
but that doesn't mean it doesn't mean that,
uh,
that license just turned off.

384
00:26:35.311 --> 00:26:37.800
I don't know why.
It doesn't mean that the,

385
00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:39.243
<v 1>okay</v>

386
00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.370
<v 0>[inaudible] it doesn't mean that I think the arguments all work right now.</v>

387
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.120
I had noticed on the first day of class that I don't myself believe in the

388
00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:50.460
existence of a soul.
And as such,

389
00:26:50.461 --> 00:26:53.880
it shouldn't be any surprise to you that what I'm going to do as we run through

390
00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:58.740
each of these arguments and say,
I'm not convinced by it,
and here's why.
Now,

391
00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.310
since since I think that the argument I'm about to sketch and I just started

392
00:27:02.311 --> 00:27:07.020
sketching,
the first off is fails.
No,
I hope you'll,

393
00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:09.420
you'll think it over and you'll eventually come to agree with me.
Yeah.

394
00:27:09.421 --> 00:27:11.370
These arguments don't really work after all,

395
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:16.580
but what's more important to me is that you at least think about each of these

396
00:27:16.981 --> 00:27:21.630
arguments.
Is this a convincing argument for the existence of a soul?

397
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.780
If,
if,
if,
if,
if,
if you think so,

398
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.440
what response do you want to offer to the objections that I'm giving?

399
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:31.020
If this argument doesn't work,

400
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.620
is there another argument for the existence of a soul that you think's a better

401
00:27:34.621 --> 00:27:37.920
one?
All right,
so first argument,

402
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:43.340
you need the sold order to explain the animation of the body from the physical,

403
00:27:43.341 --> 00:27:47.370
his point of view.
Of course the answer's going to be too quick

404
00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:53.560
to have an animated body.
You need to have a functioning body.

405
00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.660
And it's true that when you got a corpse,

406
00:27:58.661 --> 00:28:00.610
you got all the parts there,

407
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.360
but clearly they're not functioning properly.

408
00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:10.000
But all that shows us is the parts have broken.

409
00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:14.440
Remember my stereo,
I dropped my stereo,

410
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.840
it falls on the stage.
It doesn't work anymore.
It stops giving off music.

411
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.270
My boombox stops giving off music.

412
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:28.600
That's not because previously,
you know,
we had a,
we had a CD inside of it.

413
00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.420
We have some batteries.
We dropped the whole thing.

414
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:36.510
It's not as though previously there was something nonmaterial there.

415
00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:42.790
You've got all the same parts there,
but the parts are now broken.

416
00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:45.970
They're not connected to each other in the right way.

417
00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.010
The energy is not flowing from the batteries,
uh,

418
00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:51.820
through of the wires to the CD component.

419
00:28:55.310 --> 00:29:00.290
There's nothing mysterious from the physicalist perspective about the idea that

420
00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.990
a physical object can break.

421
00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:08.920
And so although we need to offer a story about what makes the parts work when

422
00:29:11.091 --> 00:29:13.820
they're connected with each other and interacting in the right way,

423
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:18.270
there's no need to appeal to anything beyond the physical.
Well,

424
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.420
supposedly tried to refine the argument.

425
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.720
Suppose we say you need to appeal to the soul in order to explain that.

426
00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:29.721
Just that like the body moves around flails but the body sort of act

427
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.180
purposefully.

428
00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:38.740
We need something sort of to be pulling the strings to be directing the body.

429
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.233
That's what the soul

430
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.660
so says the blue dualist and response.

431
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:49.060
The physicalist is going to say yes,

432
00:29:49.061 --> 00:29:53.350
it's true that bodies don't just move around in random patterns.

433
00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:57.190
Human bodies don't do that,
so we need something to direct it,

434
00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:02.370
but why couldn't that just be one particular part of the body plays the part of

435
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:07.750
the command module.

436
00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:14.650
Suppose I've got a heat seeking missile,
you know which

437
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.210
tracks down the the plane

438
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:25.480
as the plane tries to dodge it,
the missile corrects its course.

439
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.680
It's not just moving randomly.
It's moving purposefully.

440
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:35.400
The better be something that explained that's controlling the motions of the

441
00:30:35.471 --> 00:30:36.304
missile,

442
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:41.650
but for all that it could just be a particular piece of the missile that does
it.

443
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.053
<v 1>Okay.</v>

444
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:45.750
<v 0>More gloriously.</v>

445
00:30:45.751 --> 00:30:50.751
We could imagine building some kind of a robot that does a variety of tasks and

446
00:30:54.211 --> 00:30:55.740
it's not moving randomly,

447
00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.920
but the tasks for all that are controlled by the CPU within the,

448
00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:03.323
the robot.

449
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:08.750
So the physicalist says we don't need to appeal to anything as extravagant as a

450
00:31:08.911 --> 00:31:13.260
soul in order to explain the fact that bodies don't just move randomly,

451
00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.970
but they move in purposeful ways and are controlled now.
No,

452
00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.030
no.
For each objection there's a response,
right?

453
00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:24.660
You could imagine the doulas coming back and saying,
look,

454
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:30.330
in that case of the heat seeking missile,
uh,
the or the robot for that matter,

455
00:31:30.331 --> 00:31:31.350
although it's doing things,

456
00:31:31.351 --> 00:31:36.351
it's just obeying orders and the orders were given to it from something outside

457
00:31:37.711 --> 00:31:42.300
itself,
something programmed the robot or the missile.

458
00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:47.660
So don't we need there to be something outside the body that programs the body

459
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:50.160
and that could be the sole,

460
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.190
that's a harder question.

461
00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:58.910
Must there be something outside the body that controls the body?
Well,

462
00:31:58.911 --> 00:32:01.900
look,
one possibility of course is,
well,

463
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.680
why not say that people are just robots as well?

464
00:32:05.681 --> 00:32:10.330
And we get our commands from outside.
I mean,
I know familiar religious view,

465
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:15.010
God builds Adam out of dirt,
uh,
out of dust.

466
00:32:15.011 --> 00:32:17.350
Adam is just a certain kind of robot.

467
00:32:17.351 --> 00:32:22.060
Then God sort of breeze into Adam that sort of turning it on and gets out.

468
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:27.490
Maybe people are just command.
I would just robots commanded from outside by God.

469
00:32:27.491 --> 00:32:30.100
But that doesn't mean that there's anything more to us than there is to the

470
00:32:30.101 --> 00:32:30.934
robot.

471
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.840
That's one possible response.

472
00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:42.170
Different response of course is couldn't we have robots that just build more

473
00:32:42.171 --> 00:32:43.010
robots?

474
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:49.150
And then if you ask where did the command's come from the answer as well,

475
00:32:49.371 --> 00:32:50.420
when they were built,

476
00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.980
they were built in such a ways to sort of have certain instructions that they

477
00:32:54.981 --> 00:32:56.540
begin to follow up,
follow out,

478
00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.980
just like people have a genetic code perhaps that gives us various instructions

479
00:33:00.981 --> 00:33:04.580
that we begin to fall out or certain innate psychology or what have you.

480
00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:11.300
Well look,
we argument quickly becomes very,
very messy and,
and,
and,

481
00:33:11.301 --> 00:33:15.620
and the,
the soul of the fan of the soul begins to want to protest.
But look,

482
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:18.720
we're not just robots.
You know,

483
00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:22.550
we're not just robots with some sort of program in our brain that we're

484
00:33:22.551 --> 00:33:26.540
following.
We've got freewill and,

485
00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.790
and robots can't have freewill.

486
00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:30.920
And so there's gotta be something more to us than robots.

487
00:33:30.921 --> 00:33:32.240
We can't just be physical things.

488
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:39.400
This is an interesting argument,
but I think it's a new argument.
So,

489
00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:44.390
so we started with the idea you needed to appeal the souls in order to roughly

490
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:47.300
explain why human bodies move,

491
00:33:47.301 --> 00:33:50.480
why were animated or why are we moving non random ways.

492
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:56.020
And I think it's fairly clear that you don't need to appeal the souls in order

493
00:33:56.871 --> 00:34:01.250
to do that.
Appeal to a physical body suffices.

494
00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:06.580
I think to have an explanation as to the difference between an animated and an

495
00:34:06.651 --> 00:34:10.990
inanimate body.
How bodies will move in non random ways that,
you know,

496
00:34:10.991 --> 00:34:15.640
if the brain is our CPU,
then you know,

497
00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.780
we'll,
we'll behave in,
in deliberate purposeful ways.
Just like a robot behave,

498
00:34:19.781 --> 00:34:21.320
behaving deliberate,
purposeful ways.

499
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:26.150
So this initial argument thinks not compelling
still.

500
00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:30.350
We might wonder what about this new argument?
Yeah.
What about the fact that,

501
00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:35.210
you know,
so we said,
look,
there's a,
there's a family of arguments,

502
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:38.450
all of which have the general structure inference to the best explanation.

503
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:41.660
You need souls in order to explain feature F,

504
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.290
plugging a different feature f and you get a new argument.

505
00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.460
The one we started with,
you need the body to explain the,
the animation.

506
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.940
It needed the soul to explain the animation of the body that that argument I

507
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:54.830
think doesn't work.
But now we've got a new one.

508
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.610
You need the soul in order to explain freewill.

509
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:04.110
Let me come back to that argument later.
It's a good argument.

510
00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:07.610
It's an argument well worth taking seriously,
but it's come back to it later.

511
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.270
First,

512
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:13.270
let's run through some other things that might be appeal to as candidates for

513
00:35:13.491 --> 00:35:16.490
feature F.
Suppose somebody says,
look,
yeah,
yeah,

514
00:35:16.491 --> 00:35:21.440
it's true that we don't need to appeal to souls in order to explain why bodies

515
00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:23.660
move around in a non random fashion.

516
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:28.930
But people have a very special ability and so the argument goes that mere bodies

517
00:35:30.501 --> 00:35:32.750
couldn't have physicalist can't explain.

518
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.690
That's the ability to think.

519
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:41.260
It's the to reason people have beliefs and desires and based on their beliefs

520
00:35:45.661 --> 00:35:50.220
about how to fulfill their desires,
they,

521
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:54.750
they,
they plant,
they make plans,
they have strategies.

522
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:59.490
They reason about what to do.
This,
this,

523
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:04.470
this tightly connected set of facts about us,
beliefs,

524
00:36:04.471 --> 00:36:07.980
desires,
reasoning,
strategizing,
planning.

525
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:12.960
You need to appeal to a soul.
So the argument goes,

526
00:36:12.961 --> 00:36:17.961
you need to appeal to a soul to explain that no mere machine could believe no

527
00:36:22.411 --> 00:36:25.140
mirror machine has desires.

528
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:28.950
No Mirror machine could reason.

529
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:35.790
Now it's easy to see why you might think that sort of thing.

530
00:36:35.791 --> 00:36:39.660
When you stick to sort of simple machines,

531
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:43.320
it's pretty clear that there are lots of machines that it doesn't seem natural

532
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:48.380
to ascribe beliefs or desires or goals or reasoning to my lawn mower for

533
00:36:48.871 --> 00:36:49.704
example,

534
00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:55.020
doesn't want to cut the grass.
Um,

535
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.740
even though it does cut the grass,
it doesn't have the desire.

536
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.300
It doesn't think to itself.

537
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:05.040
How shall I get that blade that's of grass that's been alluding me.

538
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.171
So it's,

539
00:37:07.171 --> 00:37:12.171
it's easy to see why we might be tempted to say no mere machine could think or

540
00:37:13.471 --> 00:37:15.990
reason or have beliefs or desires.

541
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:22.110
But that argument is much less compelling nowadays then I think it would have

542
00:37:22.111 --> 00:37:27.111
been 20 or 40 years ago in an era of computers,

543
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:33.480
it seems with,
with quite sophisticated computer programs,

544
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:38.720
it seems at least at the very least natural to talk about beliefs,

545
00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:45.210
desires and reasoning and strategizing.
So I suppose for example,

546
00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:50.460
we've got a chess playing computer and my computer at home,

547
00:37:50.461 --> 00:37:53.670
I've got a program that allows my chest to play computer.

548
00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:58.740
I myself stink at chess.
This,
uh,

549
00:37:58.741 --> 00:38:00.750
this program can beat me,
you know,
blind.

550
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:06.330
So I move,
you know,
my,

551
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:11.250
my bishop,
the computer moves,
it's queen.

552
00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.070
What do we say about the computer?

553
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:18.510
Why did the computer move it's queen or it's virtual queen.

554
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.820
Why did the computer move it's queen?
Well,

555
00:38:20.821 --> 00:38:25.821
the natural thing to say is it's worried about the fact that the king is exposed

556
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:33.620
and it's trying to block me by capturing my bishop.

557
00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:40.670
That is
what we say about computer playing programs.
Stop.

558
00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.110
Think about what we're doing.

559
00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:47.560
We're ascribing desires to the program or saying it's got an ultimate desire to

560
00:38:48.981 --> 00:38:53.390
win the game.
Certain subsidiary desires to protect its king.

561
00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:56.440
To capture my king certain other subsidiary desire,

562
00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.000
no doubt to protect its various other pieces along the way.

563
00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:04.240
It's got beliefs about how to do that by blocking certain paths or by exposing

564
00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.750
make it other pieces on my side vulnerable.

565
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:13.810
It's got beliefs about how to achieve its goals and then it puts those

566
00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:19.280
combinations of beliefs and desires into action by moving in a way.

567
00:39:19.281 --> 00:39:22.910
That's a rational response to my move.

568
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:29.200
So it looks as though the natural thing to say about the chess playing computer

569
00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:33.710
is it does have beliefs,
it does have desires,

570
00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.420
it does have intentions,
it does have goals,
it does reason.

571
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.700
It does all of this.

572
00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:45.310
It's rational to this limited extent,

573
00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:46.850
the only able to play chess.

574
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:51.830
But to that extent it's doing all these things and yet we're not tempted to say,

575
00:39:51.831 --> 00:39:56.060
are we that the computer has a nonphysical part.

576
00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:01.480
We can explain how the computer does all of this in strictly physical terms.

577
00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.950
And of course once you start thinking of it this way,

578
00:40:06.951 --> 00:40:11.570
it's natural to talk this way and across of course,

579
00:40:11.571 --> 00:40:16.571
of variety across a variety of things that the computer may be trying to do.

580
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:21.220
Now,
of course,

581
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:25.990
it's perfectly open to you as a dual list to respond by saying,

582
00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:27.521
yeah,

583
00:40:27.521 --> 00:40:32.260
although we personify the computer,

584
00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:37.530
we treat it as though it was a person as no it had beliefs and desires and so

585
00:40:40.001 --> 00:40:40.834
forth.

586
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:46.350
It doesn't really have the relevant beliefs and desires because it doesn't have

587
00:40:47.021 --> 00:40:51.700
any beliefs and desires because no physical object could have beliefs and

588
00:40:51.701 --> 00:40:55.860
desires.
And,

589
00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.470
and in response to that,
I just want to say,

590
00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:03.330
isn't that just prejudice?
Of course,

591
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.600
it is true that if we simply insist,

592
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:12.080
no physical object could really have beliefs or desires,

593
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.060
then it will follow that.

594
00:41:15.061 --> 00:41:20.061
When we are tempted to ascribe beliefs and desires to my chess playing computer,

595
00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:26.360
we're falling into an illusion that will follow once we assume that no physical

596
00:41:28.921 --> 00:41:32.390
object has beliefs or desires.
What?

597
00:41:32.391 --> 00:41:34.370
What reason is there for

598
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:38.300
<v 1>saying it has no beliefs or desires?</v>

599
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:43.690
What grounds is there for withholding a scriptions of beliefs and desires to the

600
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:51.080
computer?
That's far from obvious.

601
00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.960
<v 0>Well,
here's a possibility.</v>

602
00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:01.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

603
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:05.560
<v 0>Desires at the very least seem to be,</v>

604
00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.540
at least in typical cases,

605
00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:12.730
very closely tied to a series of emotions.

606
00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:18.360
You get excited when you're playing chess at the prospect of crack capturing my

607
00:42:20.741 --> 00:42:25.570
queen and crushing me.
You get worried

608
00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.560
when you're a pieces are threatened

609
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:33.450
and of course more generally,
you know,

610
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:38.650
you get excited when you know your heart goes pitter pat when your girlfriend or

611
00:42:39.981 --> 00:42:43.050
boyfriend says they love you.
Yeah,

612
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:45.380
your stomach six,

613
00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.590
you've got that sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach.

614
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.930
You know when you get a bad grade on a test,

615
00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:58.920
maybe what's really going on is the thought that there's an aspect of desire

616
00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:08.640
that has a purely behavioral side that's,

617
00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:09.670
you know,

618
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:14.080
moving pieces around in a way that would make sense if you had this goal.

619
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.870
But there's an mat.
Machines can do that,

620
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.810
but there's an aspect of desires.

621
00:43:19.811 --> 00:43:24.811
The emotional side that machines can't have,

622
00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.190
but we clearly do have.

623
00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:32.400
And maybe we want to build that emotional side into talk of desires.

624
00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:39.330
So maybe if we want to say machines don't have a mental life and couldn't have a

625
00:43:39.641 --> 00:43:40.330
mental life,

626
00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:45.330
what we really mean is no machine could feel anything emotionally.

627
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:50.830
So let's distinguish,

628
00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:56.130
let's say there's a way of talking about beliefs and desires,

629
00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:00.870
which is just gone to be captured in terms of,
you know,

630
00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:05.590
responding in a way that makes sense given the environment.
Right?

631
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:09.790
And maybe computers and robots could do that,

632
00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.740
but there's clearly,
aside of our mental life,

633
00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:20.770
the emotional side,
well we might really worry,
could a robot feel love?

634
00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:23.350
Could it be afraid of anything?

635
00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:26.500
So again,

636
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:30.970
our question was do we need to appeal the souls to explain something about

637
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:34.410
physical says no.

638
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:39.470
Doula says yes if what we need is the mental,

639
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:45.110
but that the aspect of behavioral aspect of the mental where even a chess

640
00:44:46.321 --> 00:44:51.060
playing computer probably has it.
And that's not a very compelling argument.

641
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:55.200
Physicalist we'll say look,
that aspect of the mental,
it's pretty clear.

642
00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:59.850
We can explain in physical terms,
but let's just switch the argument.

643
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.270
What about emotions?

644
00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:08.460
Can a robot feel emotions?

645
00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:14.480
Could a purely physical being fallen love?

646
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:20.460
Could it be afraid of things?
Could hope for something.

647
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:21.750
The,

648
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:26.750
the latest version of our argument then is people can feel emotions,

649
00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:35.760
but if you think about it,
it's pretty clear.
No robot could feel emotions.

650
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:39.150
No merely physical thing could feel emotions,

651
00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:44.160
and so there must be more to us than a merely physical thing.

652
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:46.860
That's the argument.
We'll start with next time.
