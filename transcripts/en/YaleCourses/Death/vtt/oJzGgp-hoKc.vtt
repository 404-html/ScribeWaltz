00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.980
We've been looking at Plato's arguments for the immortality of the soul and so

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:09.360
forth.
So far I have to say I haven't found them very compelling arguments.

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.480
In a minute I'm going to turn to an argument that at least strikes me as more

4
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:15.810
interesting.
It's more difficult to pin down where it goes wrong.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.570
But before we do,

6
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.210
I want to make the last couple of comments about the argument we were

7
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:25.200
considering at the end of last class.
That was the argument from recollection.

8
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.150
You recall,
the basic idea was that although objects in the ordinary,

9
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:35.151
familiar empirical world are not perfectly just perfectly round what have you,

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.430
they're able to remind us of perfect justice,
perfect roundness and the like.

11
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.620
And when Plato asked himself,
how could that be the answer he gives us?
Well,

12
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:51.510
it's gotta be that we were previously acquainted with the forms before our life

13
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:52.500
in this world,

14
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.300
and that shows that the soul must be something that existed prior to the

15
00:00:57.301 --> 00:00:58.290
creation of the body.

16
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.520
That's the argument from recollection and what at the very end of class I

17
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.610
suggested that look,
even if we were to grant to Plato,

18
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:09.240
that in order to think about justice,

19
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.000
circularity,
what have you,

20
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.090
we had to somehow grasp the forms and even if we were to grant to Plato that

21
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.360
nothing in this world is perfectly round or perfectly just,

22
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.840
it's not necessarily correct to say so.

23
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:29.010
The only possible explanation of what's going on is that these things in the

24
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.070
empirical world remind us of our prior acquaintance with the forms.

25
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.630
It couldn't be that what goes on is when we bumped up against something that's

26
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:48.141
partially just or partially beautiful or partially round in perfectly round,

27
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.110
what happens is those things sort of trigger our minds in such a way that we

28
00:01:55.411 --> 00:02:00.411
begin to think about the forms for the very first time.

29
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.230
So it might be in order to think about justice and roundness,

30
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.180
we have to grasp the forms,

31
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.510
but it couldn't be that we only grasp the forms in this life for the very first

32
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.603
time.

33
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.850
Exposure to the things that participate in the forms may nudge our minds or our

34
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:26.490
souls in such a way that at that point,
given that exposure,

35
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.670
we begin to grasp the forms.

36
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.070
It's as though the,

37
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.130
the ordinary earthly objects we bump into them or they bump into us and they get

38
00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:44.040
us to look upwards to the heavenly platonic realm.

39
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.720
I don't mean literally upwards.

40
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:49.050
It's not as though these things and the number three is up there,

41
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.350
but if you accept the metaphor sort of running into things in the empirical

42
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:55.404
world,

43
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.950
get our minds to start thinking about for the first time the heavenly realm of

44
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:07.951
the platonic forms and ideas that would be just as likely a possibility as the

45
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:14.170
alternative explanation that what's going on is the ordinary empirical objects

46
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:16.270
are reminding of us,

47
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.110
reminding us of our prior acquaintance.

48
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.520
Perhaps these ordinary objects act like letters of introduction,

49
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.740
getting us to,

50
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.600
helping us to think about the forms for the very first time.
Well,

51
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:32.201
if that's right,

52
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:37.201
then of course we don't have any good reason to follow Plato when he says it

53
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:43.351
must be the case that the soul existed prior to the prior to birth.

54
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.150
Now the objection I've just raised is not an objection that Plato raises in the

55
00:03:51.151 --> 00:03:55.590
Fito,
but he does raise a different objection.
Remember,

56
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.820
our concern isn't strictly speaking with the question,

57
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.160
did the soul exists before our birth?

58
00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:05.880
Did the soul exists before our bodies but rather is the sole immortal?

59
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.900
And so having now given the argument from recollection,

60
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.770
Plato envisions two of Socrates disciples,

61
00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:18.270
Sindhis and cvs responding objecting by saying,
look,

62
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.140
even if the sole existed before birth,

63
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.500
it doesn't follow that it exists after death and that's after all what we really

64
00:04:27.661 --> 00:04:28.770
want are wondering about,

65
00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:33.570
we want to know will we survive our deaths is the sole immortal and you haven't

66
00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:38.571
yet shown that Socrates they object could be that it existed before but won't

67
00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:42.090
exist afterwards,
but very nicely.

68
00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:44.160
It's quite elegant structure at this point.

69
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.280
Socrates puts together the two arguments that we've just been rehearsing the

70
00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:53.220
argument from recollection and the argument that came before that.

71
00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:55.890
The one that I dubbed the argument from recycling.

72
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.570
I remember the argument from recycling says when when you build something,

73
00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:04.470
you build it out of parts and when that thing falls apart you go back to the

74
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:05.304
parts.

75
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

76
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.350
<v 0>All right.
So the prior parts get recycled.</v>

77
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.090
This soul,
we now say based on the argument from recollection,

78
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.140
the soul is one of our prior parts.

79
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.850
You know the sole existed before we were put together before we were put

80
00:05:25.851 --> 00:05:26.990
together with our bodies.

81
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.400
If you then combine the argument from recycling and say the parts that existed

82
00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:34.100
before are going to exist to afterwards,

83
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.850
it must follow that if the sole existed before,

84
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.300
it will exist afterwards at all afterwards as well.

85
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.720
So we've got the immortality of the soul after all.

86
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.843
<v 1>Now</v>

87
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.030
<v 0>bracket the fact that as I just explained,</v>

88
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.780
I don't myself find the argument from recollection persuasive.

89
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.720
I don't think we've got any good reason believe based on the sort of things that

90
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:01.190
play those drawing our attention to.

91
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.760
I don't think we've got any good reason to believe that the soul existed before

92
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:05.594
we were born.

93
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

94
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.130
<v 0>But even if we grant him that we shouldn't be so quick to conclude on the basis</v>

95
00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:21.630
of combining the argument from recollection and the argument from recycling that

96
00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:26.631
the soul will continue to exist after the death of our bodies after all,

97
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.060
take take a more familiar humdrum example.
Um,

98
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.880
cars are built out of non cars,

99
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.420
right?

100
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.300
Cars get built out of engines and tires and steering wheels and you know,

101
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.850
the engine's not a car,
the steering wheel's not a car.

102
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.260
So you build the car out of its parts.

103
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.190
Now the engine's a prior existing part.

104
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.970
So can we conclude then that from the fact that sort of argument from recycling

105
00:06:59.521 --> 00:07:02.310
parts get reused,
get rebuilt when cars get destroyed,

106
00:07:02.311 --> 00:07:03.510
it's parts are still around.

107
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.720
Can we conclude from the argument from recycling and the fact that the engine is

108
00:07:08.911 --> 00:07:12.030
a prior existing part from which the car was built,

109
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.480
that the engine will continue to exist forever after the destruction of the car?

110
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.110
No.
Obviously you can't conclude that at all.
Sometimes when cars get destroyed,

111
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.030
the engine gets destroyed right along with it.
And of course,

112
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.150
even if in many cases the engine continues to exist for a while after the

113
00:07:37.441 --> 00:07:38.970
destruction of the car,

114
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.450
it certainly doesn't follow that the engine is immortal,

115
00:07:42.451 --> 00:07:44.160
that it continues to exist forever.

116
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.930
Engines will eventually decompose and turn back into Adam's.

117
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:55.190
So from the mere fact that the engine was a part that existed before the car

118
00:07:56.371 --> 00:08:00.600
existed,
and the further fact that when the car breaks down,
sort of,

119
00:08:00.601 --> 00:08:02.910
it decomposes back into parts,

120
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:08.010
it certainly doesn't follow that all of the parts that existed prior to the

121
00:08:08.011 --> 00:08:12.120
existence of the car will be around forever.
That will just be false.

122
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:13.840
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.840
<v 0>So even if we were to give Socrates the assumption that the,</v>

124
00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:19.780
the,
the,

125
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.780
the thesis that the soul existed before we were put together before we were

126
00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:26.524
born,

127
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:31.770
it's still wouldn't follow that the soul will continue to exist afterwards that

128
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:34.030
have taken back apart.

129
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.250
The soul might eventually decay,

130
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.670
just like the engine will eventually decay.

131
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:48.870
What we need to really become convinced of the immortality of the soul is not

132
00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:53.650
the mere suggestion.
Even if it was even if we were convinced,

133
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.260
is not the mere suggestion.
The soul was around before our birth.

134
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.160
We need to believe that the soul,

135
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.560
unlike an engine,

136
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.740
can itself be destroyed,

137
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.250
can't itself decompose,

138
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.920
can't fall apart.

139
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.120
That's what we need if we're really going to become convinced and the

140
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:19.380
immortality of the soul.

141
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.910
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

142
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:26.830
<v 0>Now as every mark previously,
one of the amazing things and that not amazing.</v>

143
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.910
So what are the really attractive things about Plato's dialogues is you raise an

144
00:09:30.911 --> 00:09:34.210
objection and it often seems as though Plato himself,

145
00:09:34.211 --> 00:09:39.211
whether or not he explicitly states the objection seems aware of the objection

146
00:09:40.991 --> 00:09:45.520
because he'll go on to say something that is responsive to it.

147
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.960
And again,
that makes sense.

148
00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:51.100
If you think of these dialogues is a kind of pedagogical tool to help you get

149
00:09:51.101 --> 00:09:52.570
better at philosophizing.

150
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.570
So the very next argument that Plato turns to can be viewed,

151
00:09:58.571 --> 00:10:03.250
I think as responding to this unstated objection,
why stated it?

152
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.110
But Plato doesn't state it.
And the dialogue,

153
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.710
the worry that even if the soul was one of the parts,

154
00:10:08.711 --> 00:10:11.080
even if the soul was already around before we're born,

155
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.290
how do we know it can't come apart?

156
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.520
How do we know the soul cannot be destroyed since what we want to know is

157
00:10:18.521 --> 00:10:21.700
whether the soul is immortal.
How do we know it can't break?

158
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:28.410
Plato's next argument then tries to deal directly with this worry and it's a

159
00:10:30.041 --> 00:10:33.490
quite interesting argument.
I'll give it another,
a new label,

160
00:10:33.491 --> 00:10:36.010
I'll call it the argument from simplicity.

161
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

162
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:43.550
<v 0>Socrates turns to a discussion of what kinds of things can break and what kinds</v>

163
00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:50.460
of things can't break,

164
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.540
what kinds of things can be destroyed and what kinds of things can't be

165
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:57.120
destroyed.
He,
he thinks about examples,

166
00:10:57.121 --> 00:11:01.890
he surveys examples and tries to extract a kind of metaphysical principle from

167
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:03.300
this and then as we'll see,

168
00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:06.600
he's going to use this principle to convince us or to try to convince us that

169
00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:09.810
the soul is immortal.
Indestructable well,

170
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.670
lots of things can be destroyed.
Here's a piece of paper.

171
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.920
It can be destroyed.

172
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.850
Why was it that this was a sort of thing that could be destroyed?
Well,

173
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.880
the straightforward answer is the piece of paper had parts and and in breaking

174
00:11:32.581 --> 00:11:37.581
it and repeat it when I literally did was I ripped one part from another to

175
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:43.740
destroy the piece of paper.
I take it parts apart.

176
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.513
<v 1>Okay,</v>

177
00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:49.840
<v 0>it's piece of chalk.</v>

178
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.040
The piece of chalk can broken.

179
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.840
What am I doing?
Taking its parts apart?

180
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.980
The kinds of things that can be destroyed,

181
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.020
have parts,

182
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.400
they are composite,

183
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.880
they are composed of their parts.

184
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.600
Bodies can be destroyed because you can take a sword to it and go,

185
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.620
you know,
sweep,
sweep,
sweep and chop it into pieces.

186
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:24.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

187
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.350
<v 0>Composite things can be destroyed.</v>

188
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.660
Things that have parts can be destroyed.

189
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.980
Now what kinds of things can't be destroyed?
Well,

190
00:12:33.981 --> 00:12:38.200
it won't surprise you that when Plato looks for an example of something that's

191
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.220
eternal and indestructable,

192
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:44.180
his mind immediately starts thinking about the platonic forms.

193
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.600
Take the number three,

194
00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.070
the number three can't be destroyed.

195
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Even if nuclear explosion took place and everything on earth got atomized and

196
00:12:59.181 --> 00:13:01.550
destroyed through some,
you know,

197
00:13:01.551 --> 00:13:05.030
bizarre science fiction chain reaction.

198
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:06.710
If they're always doing and movies,

199
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.670
the number three wouldn't be touched.

200
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.800
The number three wouldn't be phased.

201
00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.920
It would still be true that three plus one equals four yet can't hurt the number

202
00:13:19.851 --> 00:13:21.110
three.
Right?

203
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:26.470
You can't alter or destroy perfect circularity.

204
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:33.530
Why not?
Well,
doesn't have any parts.

205
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.720
That's the,
that's the thought.

206
00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:41.140
Things like the platonic form are eternal and their eternal changeless

207
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:49.450
indestructable because they are simple,

208
00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.990
simple here being the metaphysical notion that they're not composed of anything.

209
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.690
Anything that's built up out of parts,

210
00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:01.370
you could at least in principle worry about the parts coming apart and hence the

211
00:14:01.371 --> 00:14:02.600
thing being destroyed.

212
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:08.230
But anything that's simple can't be destroyed in that way,

213
00:14:08.661 --> 00:14:10.550
has no parts to take apart.

214
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:19.780
So the kinds of things that can be destroyed are the things with parts and those

215
00:14:21.051 --> 00:14:25.550
are the sorts of things that change,
right?
Even if they're not destroyed,
sort of.

216
00:14:25.551 --> 00:14:30.050
What's a,
what's a tip off to something being composite?
The fact that it changes.

217
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.760
Suppose I take,
uh,
uh,
a bar of metal and I bended,
I haven't destroyed it,

218
00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.020
but I've changed it.

219
00:14:36.021 --> 00:14:41.021
I'm able to change it by rearranging the relationships between the various

220
00:14:41.361 --> 00:14:42.194
parts.

221
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:47.290
My body is constantly changing because the relationships between my arms and my

222
00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:52.310
head and so forth.
You know my,
my muscles are moving you,
the parts,

223
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:55.160
the thing changes all,
but that means it's got parts and could be destroyed.

224
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.950
So we've got some nice generalizations.

225
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.740
Things that change have parts,

226
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.990
things with parts can be destroyed.

227
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:11.260
What are the kinds of things that you can change and destroy those and the

228
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:15.320
familiar empirical objects that we can see,

229
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.210
pieces of paper bodies,
pieces of chalk,
bars of metal.

230
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.470
In contrast on the whole other side,
you've got

231
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.280
things that are invisible like the number three.

232
00:15:30.281 --> 00:15:35.210
Nobody sees the number three things that are invisible that never changed.

233
00:15:35.211 --> 00:15:37.540
And number three never changes,
right?

234
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:42.850
The number three is an odd number.
It's not as though,
oh,

235
00:15:42.851 --> 00:15:45.490
today it's odd,
but maybe tomorrow it will be even.

236
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.700
It's eternally an odd number.

237
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:54.220
Three plus one equals four today,
yesterday and forever.

238
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:58.900
These facts about the number three will never change.
The number three is lists.

239
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.730
So the forms are eternal,
they're invisible,

240
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:08.650
they are changeless.
There are simple and simple things can't be destroyed.

241
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.690
Forms can't be destroyed.
You put all this together,

242
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.970
these are the sorts of thoughts that Socrates assembles,

243
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.880
and I've got the initial thoughts up there on the board.
All right,

244
00:16:21.881 --> 00:16:24.760
so premise number one,

245
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.700
only composite things can be destroyed.

246
00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:34.170
Premise number two,
only changing things are composite.

247
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.270
So if you put one and two together,
you'd get only changing.

248
00:16:40.271 --> 00:16:42.040
Things could be destroyed.

249
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:47.230
But now add three invisible things don't change.

250
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.330
Well,
if he got to be the kind of thing that can change in order to be composite,

251
00:16:52.331 --> 00:16:56.170
you gotta be composite in order to be destroyed.
Invisible things don't.
Change,

252
00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:01.350
follows for invisible things can't be destroyed.

253
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:06.750
That's the metaphysical thesis that Socrates comes to by thinking about cases.

254
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:14.820
And that's the crucial premise or sub conclusion for the immortality of the

255
00:17:15.941 --> 00:17:16.301
soul.

256
00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:21.301
Because then Socrates invites us to think about the soul is the sole visible or

257
00:17:24.041 --> 00:17:27.640
invisible?
He says pretty obviously it's

258
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.740
invisible,
but if invisible things can't be destroyed,

259
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.630
the soul cannot be destroyed.
So one,
two and three got us.

260
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.890
For invisible things can be destroyed,
but five,

261
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:45.790
the souls and visible,
so six,

262
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.040
the soul cannot be destroyed.

263
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.530
That's my best attempt at reconstructing.

264
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.020
The argument from simplicity.

265
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:59.820
It's not as though Plato himself spells it out with premises and conclusions

266
00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:00.420
like that.

267
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:05.040
But I think this is fairly faithful to the kind of argument he means to put

268
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:05.874
forward.

269
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:12.300
And in a moment I'll turn to evaluating whether that's a good argument or not.

270
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:14.430
But I think it's a pretty interesting argument.

271
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.220
It's an argument worth taking fairly seriously.

272
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.600
Except I gotta confess to you that Socrates doesn't quite conclude the way I

273
00:18:25.141 --> 00:18:27.860
would've thought he would've concluded.
So I've had the,

274
00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.080
the argument conclude six,
the soul cannot be destroyed.

275
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:36.330
But what Socrates actually says is his actual conclusion is,

276
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.190
and so the soul is indestructable or nearly.

277
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:46.220
So that's why they're an odd qualification or nearly.

278
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.263
So

279
00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.490
the conclusion that Socrates reaches from his examination of change and,

280
00:18:53.491 --> 00:18:57.360
and visibility and so forth and so on.
And composite newness versus simplicity,

281
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.080
is it the soul's indestructable or nearly.

282
00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:06.081
So now adding that qualification opens the door to a worry.

283
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.680
The worry gets raised by CBS who says,

284
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.620
even if we grant that the soul is nearly indestructible,

285
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:21.120
that's not good enough to get us in mortality.

286
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.350
And he gives a very nice analogy of,
of uh,

287
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.810
somebody who's a coat,

288
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.910
a which could outlast the owner but isn't immortal.

289
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.610
Or the owner could go through several coats,

290
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:40.800
but still at some point the owner is going to die as well.

291
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.970
The owner is far more immortal,
you know,
in that sense,

292
00:19:44.971 --> 00:19:48.720
closer to immortality and I've got too many coats in my life,

293
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:53.990
but for all that I'm not indestructable if all we've got is the mere fact that

294
00:19:56.521 --> 00:20:01.170
the sole is nearly indestructible,
it takes a whole lot more work to destroy it.

295
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.420
Maybe it lasts a whole lot longer.

296
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:08.510
Maybe it goes through a whole lot of bodies being reincarnated a half dozen or a

297
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.750
dozen or a hundred times before it wears out and gets destroyed.

298
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.540
That's not enough to give us the immortality of the soul.

299
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.280
That's the objection that CBS raises.

300
00:20:20.281 --> 00:20:24.420
And one of the oddities is that as far as I can see,

301
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:29.460
Socrates never responds to that objection.

302
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:34.860
Raises the objection that is played,
oh,
raises the objection in the voice of CBS.

303
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.480
But Socrates,
I'm Plato's behalf never answers the objection.

304
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.780
It's hard to say what exactly is going on.

305
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.620
It might be that Plato's worried that he hasn't really shown that the soul is

306
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:48.520
immortal afterwards.

307
00:20:48.521 --> 00:20:53.320
Maybe this argument from simplicity isn't really as good as it needs to be and

308
00:20:53.321 --> 00:20:58.321
maybe that explains why Plato then goes on to offer yet another argument after

309
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:02.230
all of this argument really did show the immortality of the soul.

310
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:05.020
Why would he need to offer a further argument?

311
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.380
The argument from essential properties,
which will be turned into later,

312
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:14.550
so maybe Plato just thought there wasn't a good answer to CBS objection,

313
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.120
but I want to say I'm Plato's behalf or on behalf of the argument.

314
00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:27.930
Socrates should never have concluded the argument with this odd qualifying

315
00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:33.601
phrase that the soul is indestructible or nearly so he should have just said the

316
00:21:36.851 --> 00:21:40.120
soul is indestructable full stop.

317
00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.670
After all.
If we have premises one,
two,

318
00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:49.120
and three only composite things can be destroyed.

319
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.920
Only changing things are composite.
Invisible things don't change.

320
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:55.450
If you put those together,

321
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.740
you get for invisible things can't be destroyed.

322
00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.640
You don't get the more modest conclusion.

323
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:08.440
Invisible things can't be destroyed or it's a whole lot harder to destroy them.

324
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:14.230
If we've got one,
two,
and three,
we're entitled to the bold conclusion.

325
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:18.580
Invisible things can't be destroyed,
period.
Full Stop.

326
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.890
And then if five is truth,
the soul really is invisible.

327
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.200
We're entitled to conclude six.

328
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.140
The soul cannot be destroyed,

329
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:34.030
not the soul cannot be destroyed or if it can be destroyed,
it's very,

330
00:22:34.031 --> 00:22:36.310
very hard and takes a very,
very long time.

331
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.100
We are rather entitled to the Boulder Conclusion.

332
00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.950
This soul cannot be destroyed.

333
00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:49.000
Full stop period.
End of the discussion.

334
00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:51.510
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

335
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:56.040
<v 0>So despite the fact that Socrates draws this weaker conclusion,</v>

336
00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:01.320
it seems to me that the argument he's offered us,
if it works at all,

337
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:05.250
entitles us to draw the boulder conclusion.

338
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.490
Not that the souls indestructable or nearly so,

339
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.560
but that their soul is indestructable.

340
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:14.023
<v 1>Well,</v>

341
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.670
<v 0>maybe play it or realize that maybe that's the reason why he doesn't bother</v>

342
00:23:18.671 --> 00:23:20.500
giving an answer to CBS.

343
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:25.540
Maybe it's an invitation to the reader to recognize that there's a better

344
00:23:25.541 --> 00:23:26.800
argument here.

345
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.630
Then even the characters in the drama have noticed.

346
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.423
Don't know.

347
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.923
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

348
00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:40.390
<v 0>Don't know what Plato had in mind,
but in any rate,</v>

349
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:45.450
all question shouldn't be what was Plato thinking but as the argument,

350
00:23:45.851 --> 00:23:46.684
any good?

351
00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:49.773
<v 1>Okay?</v>

352
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:53.450
<v 0>Do we now have an argument for the in mortality this all have after off,</v>

353
00:23:53.451 --> 00:23:55.910
the soul cannot be destroyed.
It's a mortal.

354
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.540
Is it a good argument or not?

355
00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:05.290
Sinneas raises a different objection.

356
00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.360
Symia says,

357
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:13.480
we can't conclude that the soul is indestructible or nearly soul or whatever

358
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:19.470
because we should not believe the sub conclusion for invisible things can't be

359
00:24:22.901 --> 00:24:26.680
destroyed.
Sibelius says

360
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:33.510
invisible things can be destroyed and if that's true,

361
00:24:34.151 --> 00:24:38.080
then of course we no longer have an argument for the indestructibility or near

362
00:24:38.081 --> 00:24:43.081
indestructibility of the soul because even if the soul is invisible,

363
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:47.050
five if nonetheless,

364
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:51.550
contrary to what Socrates was claiming,
invisible things can be destroyed,

365
00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.460
then maybe the invisible soul can be destroyed as well.

366
00:24:56.050 --> 00:25:00.700
Now Sydney has does it merely assert ball,
glean visible things can be destroyed.

367
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.760
He offers an example of an invisible thing that can be destroyed.

368
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:10.203
Harmony

369
00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:16.650
starts talking about the harmony that gets produced by a stringed instrument.

370
00:25:17.081 --> 00:25:20.710
Let's say a harp
back.
He says,

371
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:25.890
this is a very nice example for us to think about because some people have

372
00:25:25.931 --> 00:25:27.910
suggested,
Symia says,

373
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:33.030
some people have suggested that the mind is like harmony.

374
00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.450
It's as though the mind is like harmony of the body.

375
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.870
So to sort of spell out the analogy a bit more fully,

376
00:25:40.871 --> 00:25:42.730
and I'll say a bit more about it later,

377
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:48.990
harmony is to the harp as the mind is to the body.

378
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.870
All right?
He says that people who put forward views like this,

379
00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:58.590
<v 1>okay.</v>

380
00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:02.850
<v 0>And at any rate,
harmony can certainly be destroyed.
You,</v>

381
00:26:02.851 --> 00:26:06.090
you don't see harmony.
Harmony is invisible.

382
00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.230
But for all that you can destroy harmony.
You know,

383
00:26:10.231 --> 00:26:15.000
so there's the harp making its melodious,
harmani harmonious sounds,

384
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:19.350
and then you take an ax to the harp,
Bang,
Bang,
Bang,
chop,
chop,

385
00:26:19.351 --> 00:26:23.460
chop or a hammer or whatever.
Now the harmony has been destroyed.

386
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.480
So even though it's invisible,

387
00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:33.140
you can destroy it by destroying the musical instrument on which it depends.

388
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.030
And of course there was the worry,
right?
If the,

389
00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:42.900
if the mind is like the harmony of the body,
then you,

390
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.610
you could destroy the mind,

391
00:26:44.611 --> 00:26:49.611
the soul by destroying the body on which the mind depends.

392
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:53.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

393
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.640
<v 0>So the crucial point right now is that thinking about harmony is offered as a</v>

394
00:27:00.161 --> 00:27:05.161
counter example to the generalization that invisible things can't be destroyed.

395
00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.580
Harmonies,
invisible harmony can be destroyed.

396
00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:14.890
So invisible things can be destroyed.
So you're wrong.
Socrates,

397
00:27:14.891 --> 00:27:16.720
when you say invisible,
things can't be destroyed.

398
00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.330
So even if we grant the souls and visible as well,

399
00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.240
maybe the soul also is an invisible thing that can be destroyed.

400
00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.560
That's a great objection.

401
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:32.360
It's an objection worth taking very seriously.

402
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:40.070
And the oddity is Socrates doesn't respond to it in the way that he should have

403
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:47.520
in the way that he needed to.

404
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.980
Socrates instead spends some time,
Maureen,

405
00:27:52.981 --> 00:27:56.040
about the question,

406
00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:01.530
is the soul really like harmony or not?

407
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:07.550
Is this metaphor think about the relationship between the mind and the body as

408
00:28:07.711 --> 00:28:12.540
similar to the relationship between harmony and a harp.

409
00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.253
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

410
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:19.410
<v 0>Socrates.
Spend some time criticizing that analogy.</v>

411
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:27.350
Now.
If in a few minutes I'll turn to you and a few minutes I'll turn to the

412
00:28:27.351 --> 00:28:28.184
question.

413
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:33.050
What about Socrates criticisms of the analogy?

414
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.230
Are they good criticisms or not?

415
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:39.840
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

416
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.540
<v 0>but even if they are good criticisms,</v>

417
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:47.610
I want to say that's not good enough to help your argument.
Socrates,

418
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:49.770
even if we were to say,

419
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:54.690
you know what the mind is it very much like harmony at all.

420
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.300
That analogy really stinks.

421
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:04.070
So what all that sinneas needs to cause problems for Socrates argument is the

422
00:29:06.841 --> 00:29:11.790
claim that harmony is invisible and harmony can be destroyed.

423
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.360
As long as that is true,

424
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:19.740
we can't continue to believe that invisible things can't be destroyed.

425
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:21.863
<v 1>Okay?</v>

426
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:26.990
<v 0>So what Socrates means to do is to say either harmony can't be destroyed,</v>

427
00:29:28.801 --> 00:29:30.720
but pretty obviously a can.
The heart,
you know,

428
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:34.500
the melodia sounds coming out of an instrument can be destroyed.

429
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:40.020
So he would need to argue then perhaps that harmony is not really invisible.

430
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:45.340
If he could show us,
if he could convince us that harmony's not really invisible,

431
00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.900
then we would no longer have a counterexample to the claim that the invisible

432
00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:54.490
cannot be destroyed.
And the argument could still then proceed as it was before,

433
00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:00.670
so that's what Socrates should have done.
He should have said,

434
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:04.300
you know what,
harmony's not really invisible or can't be destroyed,

435
00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.220
but there's not a whiff of that,
at least in the dialogue as we've got it.

436
00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.380
Not a width of that.
As far as I can see.

437
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:18.430
Socrates never says send me as here's where your objection goes wrong.

438
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.790
Harmony's not really invisible.
Can't really be destroyed,
whatever it is,

439
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:26.350
so we don't really have a counter example and said he gets hung up on this

440
00:30:26.351 --> 00:30:28.570
question.
Is it a good analogy?

441
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:33.430
Is it a good way for thinking about the mind or not?
But even if it isn't,

442
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.140
that wouldn't save the argument.

443
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:41.880
Now I am going to take some time to think about whether or not harmony is a good

444
00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:44.950
analogy

445
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:51.200
because I actually think it is a good analogy.

446
00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:55.940
I think what's going on in the harmony,

447
00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.440
you the suggestion that we should think about the mind like harmony as low as

448
00:31:00.441 --> 00:31:00.910
the harmony,

449
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:05.910
the body isn't Uli attempt to to state the physical list view.

450
00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:14.620
Talk about the mind says the physicalist is just a way of talking about the body

451
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.980
or more carefully.

452
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:24.070
It's a way about talking about certain things the body can do when it's

453
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.030
functioning properly.

454
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:30.350
When it's well tuned as we might put it,

455
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:36.640
just like talk about the harmony or the melodious sounds or what have you of the

456
00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:44.290
harp are a way of is it these things are a way of talking about what things the

457
00:31:45.321 --> 00:31:46.760
harp can do.

458
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:51.680
It can produce melodious harmonious sounds when it's functioning properly.

459
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.890
When it's well tuned.
So the,

460
00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:00.940
the harmony analogy is I think an attempt and not a bad attempt at gesturing

461
00:32:03.441 --> 00:32:05.480
towards the question.

462
00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:10.540
How do physical lists think about the mind now when I tried to get you to grasp

463
00:32:14.931 --> 00:32:17.250
how physical is,
think about the mind.
Yeah.

464
00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:21.080
I use examples about computers and robots and the like.

465
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:26.590
Well it's not remotely surprising that Plato doesn't use those kinds of

466
00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:33.170
analogies.
It doesn't have computers.
He doesn't have robots still.

467
00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:38.260
He has physical objects that can do things and the ability to do things on the

468
00:32:40.221 --> 00:32:43.070
proper functioning of the physical object.

469
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:48.460
And so I think he can see that there's this alternative to his dualism.

470
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:54.290
He could see that you could be a physical list and say that the mind is

471
00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:55.970
dependent on the body.

472
00:32:56.090 --> 00:33:00.530
The mind is just a way of talking about what the body can do when it's working

473
00:33:00.531 --> 00:33:04.880
properly.
It's dependent on just the same way that,
well,

474
00:33:04.881 --> 00:33:08.990
for example,
harmony is dependent upon the physical instrument.

475
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:16.150
So I think it's a very nice attempt to discuss the physicalist alternative to

476
00:33:19.971 --> 00:33:24.971
Plato's dualism and that's why it'll be worth taking some time to ask ourselves,

477
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.220
well,
what about Plato's objections?

478
00:33:28.221 --> 00:33:33.140
Then if he can convince us at the soul's not like harmony of the body,

479
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.870
maybe there'll be some sort of problem for the physical list.

480
00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.770
So I'll come back to that in a few more minutes,

481
00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:45.650
but first let's worry about the point that I was emphasizing earlier.
Namely,

482
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:49.210
look,
even if the soul's not very much like harmony.

483
00:33:49.211 --> 00:33:54.211
So what if harmony really is invisible and harmony really can be destroyed?

484
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:57.560
Then invisible things can be destroyed.

485
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.313
<v 1>Okay.</v>

486
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.860
<v 0>Even just holds nothing like you know,</v>

487
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:06.050
that's not good analogy for thinking about the physical is positioned what have

488
00:34:06.051 --> 00:34:06.350
you.

489
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:11.350
So what if some invisible things can be destroyed and harmonies and example of

490
00:34:11.901 --> 00:34:14.720
that,
then by Golly it's going to follow that.

491
00:34:14.721 --> 00:34:18.590
We can't conclude from the visibility of the soul that the soul cannot be

492
00:34:18.591 --> 00:34:19.424
destroyed.

493
00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.380
So even though Socrates doesn't respond to that objection,

494
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:29.300
we need to ask on Socrates behalf,
is there a possible answer to this objection.

495
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.520
And I think there's at least the beginnings of one

496
00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:40.110
we have to ask,

497
00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:44.280
when we say invisible things can't be destroyed.

498
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:49.110
What did we mean by invisible?

499
00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:51.003
<v 1>Okay.</v>

500
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.170
<v 0>And I want to distinguish three different possible interpretations.</v>

501
00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.950
Three different claims.

502
00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.610
So invisible means,

503
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.850
<v 1>okay,</v>

504
00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.400
<v 0>one,
there's one possibility.</v>

505
00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.140
Can't be seen.

506
00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.090
Two different possibility

507
00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:25.810
can't be observed.

508
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.510
I've gotten mine the broader notion of all five senses.

509
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:35.293
<v 1>Census,</v>

510
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:43.250
<v 0>three different possible interpretation of invisible can't be detected.</v>

511
00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:51.603
<v 1>Okay,</v>

512
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:56.160
<v 0>well we have to ask ourselves is when Socrates pitches argument forward,</v>

513
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.990
which of these did you have in mind?
First,

514
00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:01.210
let's be clear on how these things are different.
All right?

515
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:06.980
Some things can't be seen but can be sensed some other way.

516
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.190
<v 1>So</v>

517
00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:16.540
<v 0>colors can be seen,
smells cannot be seen,</v>

518
00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:18.130
but of course smells.
You know,

519
00:36:18.131 --> 00:36:21.790
the smell of coffee can be sensed through the five senses.

520
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:24.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

521
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.860
<v 0>Sounds can't be seen.
They're not visible,</v>

522
00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:32.900
but for all that they can be synced.
You can hear them through your ears.

523
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:36.303
<v 1>So</v>

524
00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:40.840
<v 0>without getting hung up on,
what is the English word invisible mean?</v>

525
00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.770
Let's just notice that there's a difference between saying,

526
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:47.710
can't be seen through the eyes and can't be observed

527
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:51.860
through one sense or the other.

528
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:58.110
And then three is a different notion altogether.

529
00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:00.210
A stronger notion altogether.

530
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:05.670
There might be things that can't even be detected through any of the five

531
00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:10.290
senses.
The number three,
not only,
can't I see it,

532
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:15.570
I can't taste it,
I can't hear it,
can't smell it,
can't touch it.

533
00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:20.790
Right?
The number three is invisible in this much bolder way.

534
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.960
It can't be detected at all by the five senses.

535
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

536
00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.360
<v 0>Can't be detected in terms of its,</v>

537
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:34.820
it doesn't leave traces behind.
Right.

538
00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:40.040
I don't see dinosaurs,
but of course they leave traces behind and fossils,

539
00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.540
there's a way in which you can talk about it's being detected by its effects.

540
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:46.190
Right?
All right,
so again,

541
00:37:46.191 --> 00:37:49.190
don't get hung up on what does the English word invisible mean?

542
00:37:49.191 --> 00:37:53.390
Let's just ask ourselves what notion of invisibility,

543
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:56.420
if we'll use the word,
you know,
between these three ways.

544
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:59.990
What notion did Socrates argument turn on?

545
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:01.810
<v 1>Okay,</v>

546
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:05.530
<v 0>well,
the most natural way to start by interpreting him is with number one.</v>

547
00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:07.320
<v 1>Okay?</v>

548
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.600
<v 0>When he says invisible things don't change.</v>

549
00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:16.100
What he means is things that you can't see don't change.

550
00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.610
And so continuing to interpret invisible,
and number four,

551
00:38:20.611 --> 00:38:22.410
in the same way it visible,

552
00:38:22.411 --> 00:38:25.740
things can't be destroyed on that first interpretation.

553
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:29.700
What he'd be saying is if you can't see it with your eyes,

554
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.170
it can't be destroyed.

555
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:37.970
Have trouble is harmony shows that that's not so harmony is indeed invisible.

556
00:38:41.081 --> 00:38:45.550
Incense,
number one,
you cannot see it with your eyes,
but for all that,

557
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.200
it can be destroyed.

558
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.090
So if what Socrates means by invisibility,

559
00:38:52.091 --> 00:38:54.460
visibility is the first notion.

560
00:38:54.461 --> 00:38:58.300
Can't be seen with your eyes and the arguments,

561
00:38:58.301 --> 00:39:02.410
not any good harmony is a pretty compelling counterexample,

562
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:06.490
but maybe that's not what Socrates means by invisible,

563
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.090
maybe instead of one.
He means too,

564
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.530
when he talks about the soul being invisible and invisible things being

565
00:39:14.531 --> 00:39:15.550
indestructable,

566
00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:20.640
maybe he means things that can't be observed through any of your five senses.

567
00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

568
00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:29.420
<v 0>Now in point of fact,
I think that is what he meant.</v>

569
00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:32.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

570
00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.830
<v 0>We just give a quick quote.</v>

571
00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:36.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

572
00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:41.010
<v 0>In our edition,
this is a page 29</v>

573
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:46.530
some of you may have noticed that there is little standardized paginations in

574
00:39:46.531 --> 00:39:51.270
our edition as well,
so it's in the academy paginations number 79

575
00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.050
<v 1>okay.</v>

576
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:56.530
<v 0>He's talking about the difference between the visible and the invisible things,</v>

577
00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:01.740
chairs versus the forms and he says these ladder chairs,

578
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.370
trees,
stones.

579
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:08.610
You could touch and see and perceive with the other senses,

580
00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:11.980
but those that always remained the same.

581
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:16.840
The forms can only be grasped by the reasoning power of the mind.

582
00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.230
They are not seen but are invisible.

583
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.360
So I think it's pretty clear that when Socrates starts talking about what's

584
00:40:25.361 --> 00:40:28.840
visible versus invisible,
he doesn't mean to limit himself to vision.

585
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.350
He means to be talking about all of the five senses,

586
00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:34.170
<v 1>okay?</v>

587
00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:39.060
<v 0>So when we say,
when he says invisible things can't be destroyed,</v>

588
00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:44.210
he means the things that you can't see or touch or hear or feel,

589
00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:51.060
right?
Whatever it is,
see,
touch,
smell,
taste.
Those things can't be destroyed.

590
00:40:56.870 --> 00:41:00.440
Now notice that if that's the way we interpret his argument,

591
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:03.560
harmony no longer works.
As a counter example,

592
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:07.010
harmony was invisible when we met.

593
00:41:07.011 --> 00:41:09.710
Definition number one can't be seen,

594
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:12.350
but it's not invisible.

595
00:41:12.351 --> 00:41:16.340
If we mean definition number two can't be synced,

596
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.470
can't be observed.

597
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.070
Harmony can be sensed through the years,

598
00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:30.770
in which case it's not a counter example.
It's not a counter.

599
00:41:30.771 --> 00:41:35.771
Example to four four says invisible things can't be destroyed.

600
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.920
And what Socrates should have said is harmony is not invisible in the relevant

601
00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.560
sense of invisible,

602
00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:47.290
<v 1>okay?</v>

603
00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:50.490
<v 0>Since it can be sensed Bot,</v>

604
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:55.240
and this would be the crucial point.
Notice,
Socrates should have continued.

605
00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:00.220
The soul is invisible in that sense.

606
00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:06.220
You don't see the soul,
you don't taste the soul,
you don't touch the soul,

607
00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:08.500
you don't hear the soul.

608
00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:15.060
So if we understand the argument in terms of the second interpretation,

609
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:17.860
it looks as other invisible.

610
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:20.830
It looks as all the arguments still goes through sim.
He says,

611
00:42:20.831 --> 00:42:22.900
conjure example fails.

612
00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.500
Harmony's not invisible in the relevant sense.

613
00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:29.920
So it could still be true that invisible things can't be destroyed since the

614
00:42:29.921 --> 00:42:33.850
soul is invisible in that sense,
it would fall at the soul cannot be destroyed.

615
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:37.603
<v 1>However,</v>

616
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:42.060
<v 0>even if sinneas is objection,</v>

617
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:46.050
his particular counter example,
harmony fails,

618
00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:51.530
that doesn't mean that we should still accept the argument because there might

619
00:42:51.571 --> 00:42:55.170
be a different counter example.

620
00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:59.820
So here's my proposal.
Supposedly think not about harmony,

621
00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:02.790
but radio waves.

622
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:04.760
<v 1>Okay?</v>

623
00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.300
<v 0>Radio waves are not sense a bowl.</v>

624
00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:10.550
They are not observable.

625
00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:14.920
You don't see a radio wave,

626
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:19.780
you can't touch a radio wave,
you can't smell a radio wave.

627
00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:24.190
And interesting enough,
you can't hear radio waves.

628
00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.490
<v 1>Okay?</v>

629
00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:29.980
<v 0>But of course for all that,
they can be destroyed.</v>

630
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.920
So even if we grant that what Socrates meant by invisible was cannot be

631
00:43:39.531 --> 00:43:44.370
observed.
We still have to say with Sydney,
you know,
force,

632
00:43:44.371 --> 00:43:49.160
just not true.
Some invisible things can be destroyed.

633
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:54.430
Radio waves can be destroyed even though they're invisible in the relevant

634
00:43:54.441 --> 00:43:55.970
sense.
Yeah.
Question.

635
00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:05.790
<v 1>Perfect radio waves.</v>

636
00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:13.710
<v 0>Okay,
so the suggestion was radio waves are a bit like the forms.</v>

637
00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.660
They're not forums,
but they're perfect in that way.
Was that the thought?

638
00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.173
<v 1>They made those,</v>

639
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:24.830
<v 0>Oh,
okay.
I misunderstood.
The question is rather look,</v>

640
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:29.430
radio waves are not like forms
to which the answer is yes,

641
00:44:29.431 --> 00:44:30.630
that's exactly the problem.

642
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:35.040
They are invisible like the forms,

643
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:40.610
but unlike the forms they're destructible and that's precisely why we've got to

644
00:44:41.791 --> 00:44:44.250
worry about the soul.

645
00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:49.820
Is the sole invisible in the way the forms are being indestructable or is it

646
00:44:50.581 --> 00:44:54.600
invisible in the way that radio waves are distractible?

647
00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.060
And again,
my point here is not to say,

648
00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.630
oh you idiot played or why didn't you think of radio waves?

649
00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:03.070
Are Questions not,
you know,

650
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:06.510
was Plato overlooking something he should have thought of?

651
00:45:06.511 --> 00:45:09.000
It's does this argument work or not?

652
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:14.070
Is it true that the invisible things can't be destroyed?

653
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:18.090
And it seems to me that some things that are invisible in the relevant sense,

654
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.360
radio waves being an example of that can be destroyed.

655
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.750
So even though the soul is also invisible in the relevant sense,

656
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.880
maybe it can be destroyed as well.

657
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:31.560
Now the answer it seems to me the only answer I can imagine,

658
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:35.310
Socrates or played or giving at this point is to say,
look,

659
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:39.480
I need a different definition of invisible,
not two,

660
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.680
but three.

661
00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:45.180
Don't talk about what we can sense.

662
00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:48.150
Talk about what we can detect.

663
00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:51.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

664
00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:56.170
<v 0>Radio waves can be detected right after all radios do that.</v>

665
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.700
You turn on your radio,
radio waves passing by.
Boom,

666
00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:05.720
properly tuned you detect it turns it into any sounds that we can here.

667
00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:07.773
<v 1>Okay.</v>

668
00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:12.850
<v 0>We can detect radio waves on the basis of their effects on radios,</v>

669
00:46:14.811 --> 00:46:15.770
among other things,

670
00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:23.010
so maybe by invisible he should have moved to this stronger,

671
00:46:23.011 --> 00:46:26.820
bolder definition of invisible,
let's call something invisible.

672
00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.780
Not only if it can't be seen,
not only if it can't be observed,

673
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:33.450
but if it can't be detected at all.

674
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:37.410
The forms after all can't be detected.
There's no,

675
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:41.830
there's no radio for the number three that will tell you there's no,

676
00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.720
there is no Geiger counter and to tell you the number threes nearby or
something.

677
00:46:45.721 --> 00:46:49.680
Right?
So Plato could still insist.

678
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:55.070
Things that are invisible in the sense of in undetectable can't be destroyed,

679
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:57.990
but radio waves,

680
00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:01.560
they're detectable so they're not a counterexample.

681
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.830
Now that we interpret the relevant notion of invisibility is undetectable,

682
00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:12.050
so couldn't play Doh continue to claim things that are fully invisible,

683
00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:17.310
meaning undetectable.
Those things can't be destroyed.

684
00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:23.400
Radio waves under counter example of that,
I think maybe plateau could say that,

685
00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:28.640
but if we give him four where we've read invisible as meaning,

686
00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:36.180
honorly undetectable no longer were so clear to me that we can give him five is

687
00:47:38.141 --> 00:47:40.390
the sole invisible?
Well,

688
00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:45.130
it was when we're buying visibility mean we meant can't be seen.

689
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:50.910
It was when by in visibility we meant can't be tasted or touched or heard or

690
00:47:52.481 --> 00:47:53.320
smelled.

691
00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:59.640
But is it still invisible if by in visibility we mean can't be detected?

692
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:05.740
Is it true that the soul can't be detected?

693
00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:10.450
I've got to say,
I think it's no longer right.

694
00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.550
Once we interpreted visibility that way,

695
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:16.650
the sole is detectable in just the way on that,
literally just the way,

696
00:48:16.651 --> 00:48:19.720
but it's something similar to the way that radio waves are detectable.

697
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.770
If you hook a radio wave up with a radio,

698
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:28.480
you can tell the radio is where the radio wave was there because of what the

699
00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.820
radio's doing.
Giving off these sounds,

700
00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:35.290
if you hook a soul up to our body,

701
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.330
you can tell the soul is there by what the salt,
by what the body's doing,

702
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.850
discussing philosophy with you.

703
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000
You detect the presence of your friends soul through its affects on your

704
00:48:52.021 --> 00:48:53.190
friend's body,

705
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:59.380
but that means the soul isn't really undetectable,

706
00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:02.290
but if the soul is not really undetectable,

707
00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:05.170
it's not really invisible in the relevant sense,

708
00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:07.360
and if it's not really invisible,

709
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:11.140
then even if there is our notion of invisible such that things that are

710
00:49:11.141 --> 00:49:16.141
invisible in that sense can't be destroyed souls not invisible in that sense.

711
00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:23.090
I've gone over this argument at such length because I hope it's clear.

712
00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.670
I think it's a pretty interesting argument.

713
00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:31.250
The argument from simplicity is quite fascinating.

714
00:49:31.251 --> 00:49:35.360
The idea that you couldn't break the soul if it didn't have parts.

715
00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:40.270
And the way to tell that doesn't have parts is because it's invisible because

716
00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.630
they're miserable.
Things can have parts.

717
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:46.130
That's a quite difficult argument to pin down.
Does it work or does it not work?

718
00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:51.500
But I think as we think it all through,
we have to conclude it doesn't work.

719
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:52.520
Okay.
