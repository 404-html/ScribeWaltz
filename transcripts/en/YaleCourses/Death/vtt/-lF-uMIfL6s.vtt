1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.520
Last time I distinguished between two ways in which thinking about the facts

2
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:09.600
about the nature of death could influence our behavior.
On the one hand,

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.800
it could give us reasons to behave or respond differently.

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.970
And on the other hand,

5
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:19.750
it could merely cause us to behave differently,
uh,

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.280
in so far as it just happens to be some fact about human psychology that we

7
00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:26.220
behave this way or that way.

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.290
Perhaps the appropriate way to deal with the facts and death would be to simply

9
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:34.260
disregard them.
I'm inclined to believe however,

10
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:39.261
that there are ways in which thinking about the facts would not merely cause us

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.420
to behave one way rather than other,

12
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:46.650
but give us reason to behave one way rather than another.

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.520
And that's the question that I wanted them to explore,
uh,
from here on out.

14
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.590
In what circumstances or in what ways should we behave one way rather than than

15
00:00:56.371 --> 00:01:01.290
others.
So I'm not nearly going to draw on facts about how as it happens,

16
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.970
uh,
we behave.
I mean eight,
you know,

17
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.360
it could be that if you dwelled upon the facts about death,

18
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.260
you would scream interminably until the moment you died.

19
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.990
Taking a tip from Tolstoy,

20
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.110
but that doesn't itself showed that that's an appropriate response.

21
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:19.800
That might just be a mirror causal fact about how we're built.

22
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.020
Question I want to ask is how is it appropriate?
What it,

23
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.030
in what ways is there reason to react one way rather than another?
You know,

24
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.190
as I say,
the thoughts seems very compelling for most of us.

25
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:36.360
That there are ways in which it makes sense for the facts about death to

26
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:40.440
influence how we live,
what our attitudes are,
what our emotions are.

27
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.630
A Kafka,
for example,
said,
uh,
the,

28
00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:48.631
the meaning of life is the fact that it ends a nice little cryptic saying,

29
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.640
uh,
as is typical of,
of Kafka.

30
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.790
But the suggestion I suppose is a fairly common one,

31
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:57.810
that it's something deep about how we should live,

32
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.410
that we're going to die,
that our life will come to an end.

33
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.650
And the question we wanted an explorer is how should the fact,

34
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:09.450
how should recognizing the fact that we're going to die influence,
uh,

35
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.290
how we live.
How should we respond to that fact?

36
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.600
Now actually,
the very first kind of behavior,

37
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:23.040
quote unquote behavior that they want us to think about perhaps isn't strictly

38
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:24.960
speaking a form of behavior at all.

39
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.220
I'd rather have in mind our emotional response because indeed,

40
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.280
one of the most common reactions to death,

41
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:36.180
I suppose is fear of death.
Indeed,

42
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.240
fear May in many cases be two week a terma extremely strong form of fear.

43
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.650
Terror of death is I suppose,
a very,
uh,

44
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.630
common emotional response to death.

45
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.890
And what I want to do next is ask our Asco,

46
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.020
have us ask ourselves,
well,

47
00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.090
is fear of death and a rationally appropriate response?

48
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.900
Now look,
the crucial word here is appropriate,
right?

49
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:07.480
That I don't want to deny it all what I,

50
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.490
what I take to be the empirical fact that many people are afraid of death.

51
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.450
I mean,

52
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.220
how common a reaction that is and how strong the fear is.

53
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:21.790
I suppose that would be something for psychologists or sociologists to study and

54
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:23.040
I'm not interested in that question.
I,

55
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.000
I take it that fear of death is very common.

56
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.180
I want to know is fear of death and appropriate or reasonable emotion.

57
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.860
Now in raising that question,
I'm obviously presupposing the,

58
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.890
the larger philosophical a thesis that it makes sense to talk about emotions as

59
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:46.390
being appropriate or inappropriate.

60
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.790
We can ask not only what emotions does somebody have,

61
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.800
but we can also ask,
uh,
you know,
what emotions should they have?

62
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.610
Now this,
this point perhaps isn't an obvious one.

63
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.990
So maybe it's worth dwelling on for a moment or two before we turn to fear of

64
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:08.530
death per se.
What's another example of a,

65
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.930
of an emotion that's got some appropriate in this condition?

66
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:14.020
So in a moment I'll turn to asking what are the conditions under which it's

67
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:18.370
appropriate to be afraid of something,
but to make the more general point,

68
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.040
let's take something like pride prides in emotion.

69
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.520
Under what conditions does it make sense to be proud of something?

70
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.520
Well,
I suppose at least two conditions jump out.
First of all,

71
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.200
the thing that you're proud of has to be some kind of accomplishment.

72
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.200
I mean if you were to say to me right now,

73
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.060
I'm really proud of the fact that I'm breathing.
I look at you in a sort of,

74
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:43.300
you know,

75
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.980
non comprehending fashion because it doesn't seem to me that breathing is

76
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:52.870
difficult in any way.
It doesn't count as an accomplishment and as such,

77
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.080
I can't understand how or why you wouldn't be proud of the fact that you're

78
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:02.650
breathing.
You know,
maybe if if you suffer from asthma and you had to,

79
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:07.120
had gone through excruciating physical therapy in order to learn how to use your

80
00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:11.890
lungs after some,
some accident or something,
maybe if we told a story like that,

81
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:16.891
we could see how breathing naturally and normally wouldn't be an accomplishment.

82
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:21.940
Something to be proud of.
But for all of us,
I presume it's not an accomplishment.

83
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.200
Hence it's not something that it's appropriate to be proud of.

84
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.080
Even if we've got an accomplishment that may not be enough for something to be

85
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.080
something that makes sense for you to be proud of it.

86
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.230
It's got to be in some way and accomplishment that reflects well on you.

87
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:43.400
Now the,

88
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.320
the most straight forward cases are cases where it's your accomplishment.

89
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.270
And the reason that pride makes sense is because you're the one who did this

90
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.190
difficult thing.
So you know,

91
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:57.320
you got an a on your philosophy paper and you're telling me that you're proud.

92
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.040
And I understand that getting an ana philosophy paper is an accomplishment.

93
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:05.030
And if you wrote the paper,
then I understand why you're proud.
Of course,

94
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.210
if what you did was go on the Internet and go to one of those sites where,
uh,

95
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.990
you know,
somebody,
you pay money and somebody else writes a,
an a paper for you.

96
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.060
Well,
I understand why.

97
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:22.061
Maybe they should be proud that they've written a great philosophy paper,

98
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:26.540
but I don't see how this reflects a specialty positively upon you.

99
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.100
So again,
there's a kind of appropriateness condition for pride where,

100
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.880
where the,
the,
the object or the,
or the,
the,

101
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:39.881
the event or the activity that you're proud of or the feature has to somehow

102
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.270
reflect on you.

103
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.130
Now that's not to say that it's got to be your accomplishment.

104
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:50.090
At least not in any straightforward,
narrow sense.
Makes Sense.
For example,

105
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:54.710
to be proud of your children's accomplishments because there's the right kind of

106
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:57.590
connection between you and your children.

107
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:01.310
So in some sense it's connected to you.
And we can,

108
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.480
we can have cases where we wonder about whether or not the connection is tight

109
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:08.780
enough or what exactly the nature of the connection has to be.

110
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.770
Perhaps as an American,
you took pride,
uh,

111
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:17.600
when the Americans,
when some event at the Olympics or the,
you know,

112
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.350
the Tour de France or what have you,
and you say to yourself,
well look,

113
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.390
I didn't ride the bicycle,
but for all that I'm an American and American one,

114
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.480
I'm proud and,
and,
and that makes sense.

115
00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:33.040
We can understand how you think the connection there is tight enough that it had

116
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.040
to,
you say,
look,
uh,
the Germans won the,
uh,

117
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.270
an event in the Olympics and I'm really proud and I ask,
well,

118
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.730
are you yourself,
German?
Do you have German heritage?

119
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.900
Did you contribute to the German Olympic support team or something?

120
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.060
If none of that's true,
then again,

121
00:07:50.061 --> 00:07:52.970
the appropriateness condition doesn't seem to be satisfied.

122
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.940
It doesn't make sense to be proud.
All right,
look,

123
00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:01.280
we could spend more time worrying about the conditions under which it makes

124
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:04.790
sense to feel pride.
Of course,
that's not really my purpose here.

125
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:08.900
My purpose of bringing that in was just to try to make good on the thought that

126
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:12.050
emotions do have requirements,

127
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.320
not necessarily requirements for what you have to have in place in order to feel

128
00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:18.434
the emotion.

129
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.670
It's a harder question whether all these things need to be in place in order to

130
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:23.570
feel the emotion,

131
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:28.670
but at least these things need to be in place in order for it to make sense for

132
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.080
you to have the emotion in order for it to be rational or reasonable to feel the

133
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:37.430
emotion in order for that emotional response to be an appropriate response to

134
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:42.410
your circumstances or situation.
So let's ask ourselves then,

135
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.340
what are the appropriateness conditions for fear?

136
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.270
Because arm would that set of conditions.
We'll then be able to go on and ask,

137
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.560
is it appropriate to feel fear of death?
Now,

138
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:57.990
three conditions come to mind when I think about this question when I thought

139
00:08:57.991 --> 00:08:59.940
about this question over the years.
First is this,

140
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.510
and I suppose this first one's going to be fairly uncontroversial in order to be

141
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:04.530
afraid of something,

142
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.680
either I slipped in this talking about what you need to have in order to feel

143
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:11.550
fear.
What I really mean is in order for it to make sense to feel fear,

144
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.100
the thing that you're afraid of has to be bad,
right?

145
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.990
If somebody were to say to me,

146
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.450
I'm afraid that after class somebody going to give me an ice cream cone,
again,

147
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:28.050
I look at them and sort of non comprehension,
I'd say,

148
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:32.610
why are you afraid of that?
How could it make any sense to me?
Afraid?
Uh,
you know,

149
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.060
and if you know,
again,
it's not that somebody couldn't give you an answer.

150
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.250
They said,
oh,
I'm trying to lose weight,

151
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:40.920
but I'm so weak and if they give me an ice cream cone,

152
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.310
then I'll just eat it and that'll,
that'll ruin my diet for the week.

153
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.230
Well then I'd understand from that point of view,

154
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.300
an ice cream cone is a bad thing.

155
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.260
And so that first condition on fear would be satisfied.

156
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.180
But if you don't have a story like that,

157
00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:56.070
if you're like most of us most of the time,

158
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.290
and an ice cream cones a pretty good thing,

159
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.610
a source of some passing but at least genuine pleasure.
And he'd say,

160
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:07.670
how can you be afraid of having or getting or eating an ice cream cone?

161
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.300
It doesn't make sense to be afraid of something.

162
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.670
It's got to be bad.

163
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:19.790
It's one of the reasons why we sometimes look sort of askance at people who have

164
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.840
various kinds of phobias,
you know,
fear of spiders or,

165
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.520
or that or fear of dusts store or,
or what have you.
Fi fear of bunnies.

166
00:10:29.521 --> 00:10:33.570
And you think,
how does this make any sense?
It's this cute little bunny,
right?

167
00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:38.400
It's not dangerous.
Uh,
and maybe there are poisonous spiders,
but you know,

168
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:42.510
most of the spiders we run across here in Connecticut are not poisonous.

169
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.970
Fear of spiders doesn't seem appropriate.

170
00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:48.660
It's not that people can't have this kind of emotional reaction.

171
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.180
It's that it doesn't make sense.

172
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.600
Maybe it's another matter if you live in Australia,
right?

173
00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:58.540
Where there's poisonous snakes and spiders and other insects every place.

174
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.480
All right,
so condition number one,

175
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.250
fear requires something bad.

176
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.420
As the object of your fear.
I can fear,
uh,

177
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.630
getting a Migraine if I'm subject to migraines.

178
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.980
I can't fear the pleasure of looking at a beautiful sunset.

179
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.260
That's condition number one,
bad objects,
something harmful.
Number no condition.

180
00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:27.261
Number two is there's gotta be a non negligible chance of the bad state of

181
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:33.870
affairs happening,
of the bad object coming to you.

182
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.283
Uh,

183
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:42.950
it's not enough that it's a logical possibility for fear to be a reasonable

184
00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:45.210
reaction.
Look,

185
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.240
there's nothing logically inconsistent or logically incoherent about the

186
00:11:50.311 --> 00:11:55.311
possibility that I will face my death by being ripped to pieces by Siberian

187
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:58.750
tigers.
It's,

188
00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.980
it's not as though that's an inconsistent state of affairs.

189
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:05.290
It's certainly logically possible,

190
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.800
but it's so unlikely.

191
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.040
It's so negligibly small a chance that if anybody here is afraid that they'll be

192
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.710
ripped to pieces by tigers,

193
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.810
then I can only say the fear doesn't make any sense.
It's not appropriate.
Again,

194
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.510
we can tell special stories where that might be different.

195
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.680
Do you suppose you're telling me that,
oh,
when you're not a student though,

196
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.760
you know,
your work study program,
what you do is,

197
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.940
is you work as an animal trainer or you're planning to work in the circus where

198
00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:42.760
you'll be training tigers.
Uh,
then I'll say,
all right,

199
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.570
now I suppose there's a non-negligible chance you'll be mauled and killed by

200
00:12:46.571 --> 00:12:49.720
tigers.
I understand it,
but,
but for the rest of us,

201
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.790
I suppose the chance of being killed by tigers is,

202
00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:00.040
well,
it's not literally zero,
but it's close to zero.

203
00:13:00.041 --> 00:13:01.360
It's,
it's negligible.

204
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.450
And so fear of being eaten by tigers or mauled to death by tigers doesn't make

205
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:13.030
any sense.
And once you get the point,

206
00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:18.031
of course would be easy to talk about a variety of other things that the chances

207
00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:21.310
are so small,
you know,

208
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:26.790
the fear of being kidnapped by a space,

209
00:13:27.011 --> 00:13:31.270
creatures from Alpha Centaury where I'll be taking back to the lab and they'll

210
00:13:31.271 --> 00:13:35.560
prod me before they dissect me alive without anesthetic.
Right?
Yeah.

211
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:40.030
I suppose there's some possibility of that.
It's not logically impossible,

212
00:13:40.031 --> 00:13:40.841
but again,

213
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:45.841
it's so vanishingly small a chance at anybody who actually is afraid of that.

214
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:51.640
The appropriate thing for us to say is that their fear is not appropriate.

215
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:53.141
All right,

216
00:13:53.141 --> 00:13:57.160
so you need to have a chance of the bad thing and it's got to be a large enough

217
00:13:57.161 --> 00:13:59.590
chance and I suppose again,

218
00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:04.591
there'd be room for us to argue about how large your chances large enough,

219
00:14:05.051 --> 00:14:07.480
but when you have sort of vanishingly small chances,

220
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.520
then the fear doesn't make any sense.
That's condition number two.

221
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.940
Condition number three I think is somewhat more controversial,

222
00:14:15.941 --> 00:14:19.330
but for all that still seems correct to me and that's this.

223
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:25.050
We need to have a certain amount of uncertainty.

224
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.550
In order to have fear be appropriate,

225
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.260
you need to have some,
it's not clear how much,

226
00:14:35.261 --> 00:14:40.261
but at least you know some significant amount of uncertainty about whether the

227
00:14:40.991 --> 00:14:45.991
bad thing will occur and or how bad the bad thing will be.

228
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:52.130
Just to see the point to see the relevance of this third condition.

229
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.160
Imagine that a bad thing it was going to happen to you with a non-negligible

230
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.033
chance indeed.

231
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:03.040
Far from being so small that it's virtually not worth even considering.

232
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:09.560
Imagine that it's guaranteed that the bad thing is going to happen.

233
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:15.290
So there's a bad thing that's going to happen and you know precisely how bad it

234
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:15.740
is.

235
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.210
So you've got certainty with regard to the fact that the bad thing is going to

236
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:20.840
happen.

237
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.370
And certainty with regard to the size of the bad thing.

238
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.060
I put it to you that in circumstances like that,

239
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:33.350
fear is not an appropriate emotional response.

240
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.880
Suppose that what happens is this,
every day you come to uh,

241
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.340
uh,
to school or to the office,
whatever it is,

242
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.970
and you bring a bag lunch and you put it in the office,

243
00:15:43.971 --> 00:15:48.590
refrigerator and,
and you,
and you include along with your launch a dessert,

244
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.310
let's say a cookie.
And everyday at one o'clock,

245
00:15:52.311 --> 00:15:54.680
when you go to grab your lunch out of the refrigerator,

246
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:59.681
you look inside and you see somebody has stolen your cookie.

247
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.120
Oh,
it's a bad thing.
It's not the worst thing in the world,

248
00:16:05.121 --> 00:16:08.460
but it's a bad thing to have somebody steal your cookie.
And furthermore,

249
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.710
this is more than a negligible chance.
So we've got condition one,

250
00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:16.940
condition two in place,
bad thing and a non-negligible chance of it happening.

251
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.270
In fact,
not only is it not a negligible chance at us happening,

252
00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.330
guaranteed happens day after day after day after day,

253
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.260
bad thing guaranteed and you know precisely how bad it is.

254
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:33.020
I put it to you.
Fear in that case doesn't make any sense.

255
00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:34.310
Mind you,

256
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:38.750
there are other negative emotions that probably makes sense like anger and

257
00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:42.140
resentment.
Who does this?
Fif whoever it is,

258
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.350
think that he or she is to be stealing your cookie.

259
00:16:45.351 --> 00:16:50.210
They don't have the right to do that.
You can be angry,
you can be resentful.

260
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:55.240
You can be sad that you don't have a desert day after day after day,

261
00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.640
but you can't be afraid because there's nothing here that it makes sense for you

262
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.160
to be afraid of.
Again,
being a little sloppy,
maybe you are afraid,
but if so,

263
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:12.220
fear doesn't make sense when you know for a certainty that the bad thing is

264
00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:16.240
coming and how bad it is.
I mean,

265
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.160
suppose that the thief strikes at random,

266
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.350
taking different people's deserts from different bags at different times of the

267
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:29.270
week and you never know who he or she is going to steal from that he might be

268
00:17:29.271 --> 00:17:33.050
afraid that you'll be the person who who's uh,

269
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.670
no cookie got stolen off of cookies.
Seems to you to silly an example.

270
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.900
Imagine that what happens is somebody breaks into dorm rooms.

271
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.430
There's been a thief going around various dorms,
uh,

272
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.120
on campus and,

273
00:17:47.121 --> 00:17:51.960
and stealing the computer from the dorm room.
Well,

274
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:56.610
there fear makes sense.
You're afraid that they'll steal your computer.

275
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.620
Bad thing non-negligible chance and lack of certainty.

276
00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.240
On the other hand,

277
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.990
suppose what happens is this is one of those thieves like you always have in the

278
00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:11.991
movies where he's such a master thief or she such a master thief that they take

279
00:18:12.571 --> 00:18:15.000
pride in their work and so they announce it.

280
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:19.140
They take out an ad in the Yale Daily News and they say,
you know,

281
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:24.190
on Wednesday,
April 27th,
I show steal from,
you know,

282
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.240
I'll steal the computer from so and so's room.

283
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.410
And it doesn't matter what precautions you take,
right?

284
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.340
Something always happens and that person's computer gets stolen.
Well,
again,

285
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.330
you could be angry,
you can be pissed,
you can be annoyed,

286
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.420
you can feel stupid that you didn't take adequate precautions.

287
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:48.140
But when the ad appears with your name and that date and all year,

288
00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:55.860
the thief has always carrying through on the announced theft,

289
00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.480
I put it to you.

290
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.600
Fear doesn't make any sense because if you know exactly what the size of the

291
00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:09.240
harm is going to be and you'll guarantee that the harm is coming,

292
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.930
fear is no longer appropriate.

293
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.320
Suppose that I have a little torture machine,

294
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:20.670
little pain generator where I put your hand down and I hook it up to the

295
00:19:20.671 --> 00:19:24.930
electrodes and I and I crank the dial and I pull the switch and you feel an

296
00:19:24.931 --> 00:19:28.980
electric shock makes sense to feel fear,

297
00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:33.981
what the next shock is going to feel like if the shocks vary in their intensity.

298
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.580
But if the machine's only got,
you know,

299
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:42.590
one setting on and off and all the shocks feel exactly the same and I've done it

300
00:19:44.401 --> 00:19:47.430
for you.
So.
Okay,
let me show you what it feels like.
It feels like that,
oh,

301
00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.050
not comfortable.
I'm not sure what it feels like.

302
00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:53.010
It feels like that over and over a five,
six,
seven,
eight times.

303
00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.880
We're doing some sort of weird psychology experiment here.
Well,

304
00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:01.500
you know exactly that it's coming.
You know exactly what it's going to feel like.

305
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.340
Fear,
I put it to you doesn't make any sense.

306
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.570
I suppose the,
the experiment's over now and uh,
you think,
you know,

307
00:20:09.571 --> 00:20:12.810
you've got your $10 and I refused to let you go and I say,

308
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.360
I'm going to do it one more time.

309
00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.220
No worse than before.
Well,

310
00:20:20.221 --> 00:20:23.820
you might not believe me and that might introduce the element of uncertainty and

311
00:20:23.821 --> 00:20:25.890
then perhaps fear would be appropriate.

312
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.280
But if you believe me that one more pain.

313
00:20:29.281 --> 00:20:33.630
Exactly like the ones you felt before it's coming.
Fear.

314
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.230
Anger makes sense.
Resentment makes sense.

315
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:42.330
Sad this,
that you're going to feel this pain perhaps make sense,

316
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.770
but fear doesn't make sense.
So three conditions you need to have.

317
00:20:46.771 --> 00:20:51.771
If something bad you need to have on the one hand non-negligible chance that the

318
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:56.560
bad thing's going to happen and you have to have a lack of certainty.

319
00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.370
If you've got certainty as to the nature of the bad and certainty that it's

320
00:21:00.371 --> 00:21:03.040
coming,
then fear doesn't make sense.

321
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.890
One of the points probably worth mentioning in passing,

322
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.080
even when fear does make sense,

323
00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:13.260
there's a kind of proportionality condition that we need to keep in mind as

324
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:14.704
well.

325
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:19.840
Even if there's a non-negligible chance of the harm coming,

326
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:24.820
does it?
And so fear is appropriate.
It doesn't make fear appropriate.

327
00:21:24.821 --> 00:21:28.990
If it's obsessive fear,
horrendous fear,

328
00:21:28.991 --> 00:21:33.310
tremendous fear,
maybe some mild concern is all that's appropriate.

329
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.920
If the chances are small.

330
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.570
Similarly,

331
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:44.580
the amount of fear needs to be proportioned to the size of the bad.

332
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.830
That's perhaps why the cookie example,

333
00:21:46.831 --> 00:21:51.480
you might think a lot of fear there is not appropriate because even if it comes,

334
00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.660
how bad is it?
Loss of a cookie.
All right.

335
00:21:54.661 --> 00:21:58.710
So there are some conditions that need to be met before fear is appropriate at

336
00:21:58.711 --> 00:22:01.650
all.
And on the other hand,
even when fear is appropriate,

337
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:06.060
there's still a legitimate to ask how much fear is appropriate.

338
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:09.990
So armed with all of this,
let's now turn to the question,

339
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.610
is fear of death appropriate?

340
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.560
And if so,
how much?

341
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:18.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

342
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.910
<v 0>And immediately we see we need to draw some distinctions.
Well,</v>

343
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:27.340
what do we supposedly being afraid of when we are afraid of death?

344
00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:32.110
And two or perhaps three things need to be distinguished.
Well,

345
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:37.180
the first thing you might worry about is the process of dying.

346
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:43.590
Some people find that the actual process at the end of their life is a painful

347
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.040
and unpleasant one.

348
00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:52.130
I've given the example of being mall to death by tigers are eating the live by

349
00:22:52.601 --> 00:22:56.770
tigers.
Well,
I imagine that would be a pretty unpleasant way to die.

350
00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:03.390
And so in so far as there is some non-negligible chance that you will die a

351
00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:08.950
painful death,

352
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:14.520
then I suppose there's some room for some inappropriate amount of fear.

353
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.300
Of course we don't have to ask,
well,
what is the chance that you'll die?

354
00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:22.450
Painfully.
I've already indicated for people in this room,

355
00:23:22.451 --> 00:23:27.310
I rather imagine the chance of being mauled to death by tigers is vanishingly

356
00:23:27.311 --> 00:23:27.970
small.

357
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:32.970
So I think no fear of that form of painful death is appropriate.

358
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.160
And for that matter,
I've got a suggested.

359
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.400
I suspect that fear of dying through a painful operation by the aliens from

360
00:23:42.701 --> 00:23:46.520
Alpha Centaury is not appropriate either.

361
00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:48.490
<v 1>Okay.</v>

362
00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:49.061
<v 0>Still,</v>

363
00:23:49.061 --> 00:23:54.061
the sad fact of the matter is that there are people in the world who do suffer

364
00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.290
painful deaths in particular of course,

365
00:23:56.291 --> 00:24:01.180
because a number of diseases that might kill us off in their final stages are

366
00:24:01.181 --> 00:24:04.210
sometimes painful.
No.
One of the interesting thing,

367
00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:09.270
interesting facts is that we could of course minimize or eliminate their pain by

368
00:24:10.331 --> 00:24:13.420
giving people adequate pain medication.

369
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:18.870
And so a Commons is a rather unpleasant bit of news that most hospitals do not

370
00:24:19.781 --> 00:24:23.440
provide adequate pain medication in many,

371
00:24:23.441 --> 00:24:26.200
many instances at the end of life.

372
00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

373
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.810
<v 0>Why?
That's,
that's a whole other complicated question,</v>

374
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.840
but I suppose if somebody were to say to me that,
look,
you know,

375
00:24:34.841 --> 00:24:36.130
I read the newspaper,

376
00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:40.000
you are studies that go down periodically about whether or not there's adequate

377
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.860
pain medication at the end of life and this study suggest year after year that

378
00:24:44.861 --> 00:24:48.760
no,
we still don't as in general provide adequate pain medication.

379
00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.190
If you were to say to me in light of that,

380
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.330
I've got some fear that this may happen to me.
Well,
I'd understand that.

381
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.280
Again,
if you said to me,

382
00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.480
I can't sleep for fear that this is going to happen to me,
I'd want to say,
well,

383
00:25:01.481 --> 00:25:06.460
that sort of fear strikes me as disproportionate,
but at any rate,

384
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.730
I suppose that when people say that they're afraid of death,

385
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:14.650
although some of them in some moments might have in mind what they mean is that

386
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.410
they are afraid of the process of dying.

387
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.730
I take it that that's not actually the essential theory that people mean to be

388
00:25:21.731 --> 00:25:26.731
expressing people mean to suggest that they are afraid of death itself.

389
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.060
They're afraid of being dead.

390
00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.650
And with regard to that,
I want to suggest,

391
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:40.540
I don't actually think the relevant conditions are satisfied.

392
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.620
Look,
let's think about what they were.
Again,
there was,
you know,

393
00:25:44.621 --> 00:25:49.330
a certain amount of uncertainty.
Well,
of course with guard to being dead,

394
00:25:49.331 --> 00:25:51.310
there's no uncertainty at all.

395
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.760
You're guaranteed that you're going to die and indeed condition number one,

396
00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:02.890
that the bad thing to do for the,
for fear to make sense.

397
00:26:02.891 --> 00:26:05.680
The object of my fear has to be a bad thing.
Well,

398
00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:10.770
ask ourselves is being dead intrinsically a bad thing

399
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.140
doesn't seem to me that it is.

400
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:20.170
Of course this all presupposes the positions about the nature of death that I

401
00:26:21.441 --> 00:26:24.290
argued for in the first half of this semester.

402
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.130
There's nothing mysterious or unknown about deck.
Look,

403
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.780
suppose you thought there was,

404
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:34.870
suppose you believe in the afterlife or at least the possibility of an afterlife

405
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.810
and you're worried that you might go to hell.

406
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.100
Well then fear makes some sense.
If there's a possibility,

407
00:26:44.101 --> 00:26:49.101
not negligible in your mind that there'll be a painful experience after you die,

408
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.480
not guaranteed.
If you're bad enough center so that your surgeon,

409
00:26:54.481 --> 00:26:58.260
you're going to hell.
Then again,
I think condition number three isn't satisfied,

410
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:02.100
but if like most of us you wouldn't know or you're bad enough,
center or not,

411
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:07.800
and so there's some non-negligible chance of this bad thing without certainty.

412
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:11.100
Well somebody like that who says they're afraid of being dead for fear that they

413
00:27:11.101 --> 00:27:14.430
might find themselves in hell.
At least I understand that.

414
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:20.220
But on the physicalist picture where death is the end,

415
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:25.440
where when your body decays,
there's no experience at all.

416
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.540
I,

417
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:32.540
it seems to me that the first condition on fear isn't satisfied death.

418
00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:39.180
The badness of death after all according to the deprivation account is the mere

419
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:41.190
absence of a good,

420
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.240
and it seems to me the mere absence of a good is not the right kind of thing to

421
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:50.760
be afraid of.

422
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:55.800
I suppose I'd give you an ice cream cone and you'll like it.

423
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.610
You wish you could have a second ice cream cone,

424
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:03.390
but I don't have a second ice cream cone to share with you.

425
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:08.790
So you know that after the first ice cream cone is over,

426
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:12.660
you won't have a second ice cream cone.
That's a pity.

427
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:17.580
That's a lack of something good.
And now you're telling me,

428
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.840
I'm afraid.

429
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:24.230
I'm afraid of the fact that there will be this period after the first ice cream

430
00:28:24.811 --> 00:28:29.160
cone is done in which I'm not getting a second ice cream cone,

431
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:34.560
I'm afraid because of the badness of deprivation of ice cream.

432
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.900
I say to you,

433
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:42.440
deprivations per say are not the kind of thing to be afraid of.

434
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:47.310
They're not bad in the right kind of way.

435
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.820
So if death is bad,

436
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:55.850
only us most centrally in so far as it's a deprivation of the good things in

437
00:28:56.701 --> 00:29:01.500
life,
there's nothing bad there to be afraid of.

438
00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:04.480
<v 1>Well,</v>

439
00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.270
<v 0>it doesn't mean that there isn't anything here in the neighborhood.</v>

440
00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:10.440
<v 1>Okay?</v>

441
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.970
<v 0>After all,
we have to worry not just about the fact that we're going to die.</v>

442
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:18.510
We have to worry about when we're going to die.

443
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.580
We might be certain that death is going to come

444
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:25.720
<v 1>okay,</v>

445
00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:30.090
<v 0>but we're not surgeon.
That death is going to come,
you know,</v>

446
00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.520
a long time from now as opposed to soon.

447
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.650
<v 1>Okay?</v>

448
00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:40.650
<v 0>So perhaps the relevant thing to be afraid of is the possibility that you'll die</v>

449
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:46.420
soon.
Consider analogy.
Suppose that you're at a party.

450
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.890
It's a great party.
You wish you could stay in.
Stay in stay.
But this is it.

451
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.340
This is taking place back in high school and what's going to happen is your

452
00:29:54.341 --> 00:29:59.320
mother is going to call at a certain point and tell you it's time to go home.

453
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:04.540
Now,
let's just imagine there's nothing bad about being at home.
It's neutral.

454
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.930
You just wish you could stay.
But you know you can't.

455
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:12.400
If you know the call is going to come at midnight,

456
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.760
guaranteed.
And there's nothing to be afraid of,

457
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.720
you might resent the fact that your mother's going to call you at midnight.

458
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:23.350
Be annoyed at the fact that she won't let you stay out till one o'clock like

459
00:30:23.351 --> 00:30:28.270
your other friends.
But there's nothing to be afraid of.
You know they're,

460
00:30:28.271 --> 00:30:30.220
it's 11 o'clock and you're,
you're saying,

461
00:30:30.221 --> 00:30:33.430
I'm terrified at the fact that the call's going to come at midnight.
I know.

462
00:30:33.431 --> 00:30:38.431
What's going to come see fear there doesn't make sense because he doesn't have

463
00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:42.010
the relevant degree of uncertainty.

464
00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.810
You know exactly what's coming and you know for a certainty that it's coming.

465
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.480
Fear isn't appropriate.
Well,

466
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.900
I suppose instead of what happens is a guarantee that your mother's got a call

467
00:30:52.901 --> 00:30:53.470
at midnight.

468
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:58.470
What we've got is your mother's got a call sometime between 11 and one

469
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.140
no,
some fear makes sense.
Yeah.

470
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:09.990
Most of the time she calls around 12 1230 sometimes she calls it,

471
00:31:10.541 --> 00:31:13.870
won it for parties.
Quetsion Lee,
she calls at 11

472
00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:18.230
you're worried now there's a non-negligible chance.

473
00:31:18.231 --> 00:31:23.231
She'll call it 11 rather than sometime later 12 or one o'clock is a bad thing.

474
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.850
Some non negotiable chance and the absence of certainty.

475
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:33.750
Now some degree of fear makes sense and perhaps that's what we've got with

476
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:37.330
regard to death.
If so,

477
00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:42.480
we might say the crucial ingredient here by virtue of which death is something

478
00:31:43.241 --> 00:31:46.930
for us to be there is appropriate for us to be afraid of is because of the

479
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:48.280
unpredictability.

480
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:55.250
Even if we had variability,
we might not have unpredictability.

481
00:31:55.251 --> 00:31:57.650
That's a point that we touched upon previously.

482
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:03.920
It's the unpredictability that leaves you in a position of not knowing whether

483
00:32:04.531 --> 00:32:07.590
death will come soon or death will come late.

484
00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.590
Will you die at 20 well,

485
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.710
you die at 50 will you die at 80 or will you die at a hundred

486
00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:15.800
<v 1>okay.</v>

487
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.270
<v 0>It's seems to me that if it weren't for the unpredictability,</v>

488
00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:23.930
fear of death wouldn't make any sense at all.

489
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.710
Given that we do have on predictability,

490
00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.740
some fear of death might make sense.
Although again,

491
00:32:30.741 --> 00:32:35.741
it's important to be clear about what it is that it makes sense to be afraid of.

492
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:42.070
It's not being dead per I remain of the opinion that being dead per se is not

493
00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:47.210
the sort of thing it makes sense to be afraid of.

494
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.720
Once you concluded that death is the end,

495
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.600
the only thing that it might make some sense to be afraid of is that you might

496
00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:00.830
die too soon,
earlier rather than later.

497
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:06.680
Of course,
having noted that point,
we then have to ask,
well,

498
00:33:06.681 --> 00:33:09.740
how much fear is appropriate?

499
00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:15.410
How great is the chance the ill die too soon?

500
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:20.810
You're fear needs to be proportioned to the likelihood.

501
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:26.890
How likely is it that you will die in the next year or five years or for that

502
00:33:27.411 --> 00:33:31.850
matter,
10 or 20 years?
Fact of the matter is,

503
00:33:31.851 --> 00:33:34.790
for most of you,
almost all of you,

504
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.150
the chances are very unlikely,

505
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:41.570
indeed not quite negligible,

506
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:46.840
but rather small for a healthy 20 year old for example,

507
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:52.130
the chances of dying in the next five or 10 years are extremely small,

508
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
in which case even if some slight fear might be called for no significant amount

509
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.800
of fear seems called for.

510
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.210
So if somebody were to say to me,
look,

511
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:13.600
the facts about death are so l overwhelming that I'm terrified of death.

512
00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.260
All I can say in response is not,
I don't believe you,

513
00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:23.590
but for all that it seems to me terror of death is not an appropriate response.

514
00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:28.580
It doesn't make sense given the facts.

515
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.250
Now having said that,

516
00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.480
that doesn't mean that there may not be some other emotion,

517
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:39.890
some other negative emotion that is appropriate.

518
00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:45.400
Fear of death strikes me as for the most part,
overblown.
It's widespread,

519
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:48.800
I suppose,
but for the most part inappropriate.

520
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.530
But that doesn't mean that,
you know,

521
00:34:51.531 --> 00:34:53.930
as I suggested before and working through some of these examples,

522
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:58.910
sometimes anger makes sense.
Sometimes resentment makes sense,

523
00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:03.200
sorrow,
regret,
sadness.
That may make sense.

524
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:08.120
So in having argued that for the most part,
fear of death does not make sense.

525
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.020
I haven't yet given us any reason to think that there might not be other

526
00:35:12.021 --> 00:35:16.130
emotions,
negative emotions that do make sense.

527
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:21.170
So let's ask,
what about some of those other possible emotion?

528
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.670
What negative emotion,
if any,

529
00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:34.360
does it make sense to feel about death itself?

530
00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.710
The fact that you're going to die?
Well of course,
look,

531
00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:42.090
it's also worth bearing in mind since I've argued that in mortality would be
bad.

532
00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:46.320
The fact that you will die is not actually bad.

533
00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:51.350
It's good because it saves you from the unpleasant aspect of an eternal,

534
00:35:52.561 --> 00:35:56.010
dreary,
dreadful,
immortal existence.

535
00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:00.420
Still we might say most of us,

536
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:05.070
almost all of us die too soon.
So what about that?
What's,

537
00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:05.820
what's,

538
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:10.820
what's the we die before life has yielded up all the goods that are,

539
00:36:11.101 --> 00:36:12.480
could have given us.

540
00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:18.740
So what is the appropriate negative emotional response here?

541
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:21.240
Or is there one?
Well,
I suppose the,

542
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:25.460
the natural second suggestion is anger might say,
look,

543
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:30.620
maybe fear isn't right.
Isn't it appropriate but anger,

544
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:32.230
angry.

545
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:37.230
They sort of shake my fist at the universe and curse the universe for giving me

546
00:36:37.851 --> 00:36:42.851
only 50 years or 70 years or 80 years or even a hundred years when the world is

547
00:36:45.771 --> 00:36:47.630
such a,
a rich,

548
00:36:47.631 --> 00:36:52.631
incredibly fantastic place that it would take thousands of years or longer to

549
00:36:53.541 --> 00:36:57.230
exhaust what it has to offer.
So isn't anger,

550
00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:00.710
inappropriate response?
And again,

551
00:37:00.711 --> 00:37:05.711
I think the answer is not so clear that it is because like all the other

552
00:37:06.861 --> 00:37:07.580
emotions,

553
00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:12.580
anger itself has appropriateness conditions in order for anger to make sense.

554
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.970
Well here's condition number one.

555
00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:24.110
It seems to me it's got to be directed at a person.

556
00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:27.230
It's got to be directed at an agent.

557
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:32.530
It's got to be directed at some thing that had some choice over what it was

558
00:37:33.261 --> 00:37:37.340
doing to you.
So when your roommate,

559
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.160
<v 1>yeah,</v>

560
00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.420
<v 0>you know,
whatever it is,</v>

561
00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:44.650
spill coffee on your computer,

562
00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:49.830
destroying the hard drive or whatever it is because they were careless even

563
00:37:49.961 --> 00:37:54.820
though you told them previously to be more careful.
Anger makes sense.

564
00:37:55.180 --> 00:38:00.180
It's directed at your roommate who's a person who had some control over what

565
00:38:01.721 --> 00:38:03.970
they were doing.
Your your roommates and agent.

566
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:10.500
If you want to get angry at me for the grades that you receive in this class,

567
00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:15.190
well,
at least condition number one makes sense.
You're directing your anger.

568
00:38:15.191 --> 00:38:20.191
Add an agent at an individual person who has some control over how I behave,

569
00:38:20.381 --> 00:38:24.510
how they behave.
Condition number two,

570
00:38:24.511 --> 00:38:25.950
I suppose this may not be all the conditions,

571
00:38:25.951 --> 00:38:28.950
but at least the second one is anger.
Makes Sense.

572
00:38:28.951 --> 00:38:33.951
When and only when the agent has wronged you has treated you in a way that it

573
00:38:36.611 --> 00:38:40.030
was morally inappropriate for them to treat you.

574
00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:48.680
If your roommate has been,
uh,

575
00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:53.980
doing things that you don't like but they haven't done anything wrong,

576
00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:59.300
anger doesn't make sense.
When you are angry at them,

577
00:38:59.301 --> 00:39:04.301
you are revealing the fact that you think they've mistreated you.

578
00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:11.350
Miss Treatment requires the notion of they behave towards you in a way that

579
00:39:11.601 --> 00:39:14.290
morally they shouldn't.
All right.

580
00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:17.930
These strike me as to conditions that need to be in place in order for anger to

581
00:39:17.931 --> 00:39:22.850
be an appropriate emotional response.
Of course.
Again,

582
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:26.990
we no doubt feel anger in other cases,

583
00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:30.230
although typically when we're angry at inanimate objects,

584
00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.820
it's because we've personified them.
All right.
Your,
your,
your,
your paper is due,

585
00:39:34.821 --> 00:39:35.930
you're rushing off to class,

586
00:39:35.931 --> 00:39:40.640
you're about to print it out and your computer crashes and you got angry at the

587
00:39:40.641 --> 00:39:43.340
computer.
Well,

588
00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.400
what's going on there I suppose is you personified the computer.

589
00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.650
You have fallen into the trap.

590
00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:56.740
Understandable natural of viewing the computer as though it was a person who had

591
00:39:57.861 --> 00:40:02.861
deliberately chosen to fail right now letting you down yet again,

592
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:09.140
and I understand this order behavior,
I,
I do this sort of thing as well,

593
00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:13.340
but of course you can step back at least once your anger has subsided,

594
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:15.110
you can step back and say,
look,

595
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:20.200
getting angry at your computer doesn't really make sense because your computer

596
00:40:21.891 --> 00:40:25.700
is not a person.
Your computer's not an agent.

597
00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:29.240
Your computer didn't have any choice or control.

598
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:37.070
Suppose that a,
all right,
I'll kick,
kick,
kick,
pick those two conditions,

599
00:40:37.071 --> 00:40:37.904
and now we're asking ourselves,

600
00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:41.780
does it make sense then to be angry at the fact that we're going to die?

601
00:40:41.781 --> 00:40:44.360
And I suppose the,
the answer's going to be,
well,
look,

602
00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:49.900
who is it or what is it that you think is the cause of our mortality,

603
00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.810
when in fact that we only get our 50 or 80 years?
Here's,

604
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:57.590
here's too crude,
basic alternatives.

605
00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:00.350
You might believe in God,

606
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.560
a kind of classic fiesta conception of God according to which God is a person

607
00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:10.720
who makes decisions about what to do and God has well condemned us to death.

608
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:18.030
That's what happens in Genesis,
right?
God punishes Adam and Eve,
uh,

609
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:22.520
by making them die.
All right?
That's picture number one.

610
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:27.910
Picture number two is you just think there's this impersonal universe.

611
00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:33.200
Atoms swirling in the void coming together,

612
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:35.240
various combinations,

613
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:40.450
but there's no person behind the scene controlling all of it.

614
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:45.890
Let's,
let's consider the two possibilities.
Possibility number one,
God.

615
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:48.500
Well,
look,
if you've got the God view,

616
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.390
at least we satisfy the first of our appropriateness conditions.

617
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.520
We can say,
look,

618
00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:01.360
we can say I'm angry at God for condemning us to a life that's short.

619
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:09.470
That's so inadequate relative to Richard is that the world offers us.

620
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:14.960
That's condition number one.
But what about condition number two?

621
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:15.950
Condition number two,

622
00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:20.951
after all requires that God has mistreated us in giving us our 50 or 80 or a

623
00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:28.910
hundred years,
and is that the case?
Has God wronged us?

624
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:33.890
Has God treated us in some way that isn't morally justified?

625
00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:36.230
If not anger at God,

626
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:39.140
resentment of God wouldn't make sense.

627
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:43.940
Suppose your roommate comes into the suite and has a box of candy and it gives

628
00:42:43.941 --> 00:42:47.630
you a piece of candy and you enjoy it and it gives you a second piece of candy

629
00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:51.650
and you enjoy it and it gives you a third piece of candy and you enjoy it and

630
00:42:51.651 --> 00:42:54.710
you ask for a fourth piece of candy and he won't give it to you.

631
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:59.840
Has He wronged you?
Has He treated you immorally?

632
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.930
Does he owe you more candy?

633
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:07.520
It's not clear that he or she does,
but if not,

634
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:09.710
then being angry.
Again,

635
00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:14.030
I would certainly understand it if you got angry in the sense that it's a

636
00:43:14.031 --> 00:43:16.130
perfectly common enough response,

637
00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:20.930
but his anger and appropriate response to your roommate for giving you something

638
00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:22.730
and then not giving you more,

639
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:26.150
it's not clear that it is an appropriate response.

640
00:43:26.151 --> 00:43:30.260
The appropriate response actually seems to me to be not what of anger but

641
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:31.130
gratitude.

642
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:36.760
Your roommate didn't owe you any candy at all and they gave you four pieces or

643
00:43:37.491 --> 00:43:42.470
whatever it was.
The number just was you might wish you could have more.

644
00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:45.650
You might be sad that you can't have more,

645
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:50.810
but anger doesn't seem appropriate.
God doesn't,

646
00:43:50.811 --> 00:43:55.520
as far as I can see,
oh,
it to us to give us more life than what we get.

647
00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:00.350
Well,
suppose we don't believe in the God theory,
but the universe theory.

648
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:05.030
Well then of course even condition number one isn't satisfied.

649
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:09.140
The universe is not a person,
is not an agent,

650
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:13.400
has no choice and control and as such.
Again,

651
00:44:13.401 --> 00:44:17.090
it just seems to me that anger.
Then you know,
I can,

652
00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.270
I can lift my fist and curse the university.
Of course,

653
00:44:20.271 --> 00:44:22.790
what I'm doing then is I'm personifying the universe,

654
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:27.170
treating the universe as though it was a person that deliberately decided to

655
00:44:27.171 --> 00:44:28.820
make us die too soon,

656
00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:34.050
but however common that response might be,
it makes no sense.

657
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:38.940
Rationally,
if the universe is not a person,
it's just add and swirling,

658
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:42.360
forming various kinds of combinations.

659
00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:47.010
Anger at the fact that I'm going to die or die too soon.

660
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:51.510
Doesn't make sense either.
Well,
what about sorrow?

661
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:57.740
Maybe I shouldn't just be sad at the fact that I'm going to die too soon,

662
00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:04.220
and I think some emotion along that line does make sense.

663
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:09.330
The world's a wonderful place.
It would be better to have more of it.

664
00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:14.780
I'm sad that I don't get more that I'm not going to get more,

665
00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.330
but having had that thought,

666
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.200
I immediately find myself with another thought.

667
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:25.890
Although it's a pity I don't get more.

668
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:31.490
I'm extremely lucky to have gotten as much as I get is just this swirling mass

669
00:45:36.421 --> 00:45:40.500
of atoms forming clumps of various kinds of things and dissolving.

670
00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:46.160
Most of those atoms don't get to be alive at all.

671
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:52.790
Most of those atoms don't get to be a person falling in love,

672
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:59.550
seeing sunsets,
eating ice cream.

673
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:06.050
It's extraordinarily lucky of us to be in this select fortunate few.

674
00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:12.990
Let me close then with an expression of this thought.

675
00:46:12.991 --> 00:46:16.380
This is what I'm Kurt Vonnegut's book.
Cat's cradle.

676
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:19.980
This is,
uh,
uh,

677
00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:25.970
kind of prayer that one of the characters in the novel says it's supposed to say

678
00:46:26.491 --> 00:46:30.720
at,
at,
at the death bed,
God made mud.

679
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.390
God got Lonesome.
So God said to some of the mud,
sit up.

680
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:41.730
See,
all I've made said God,
the hills,

681
00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.860
the see the sky,

682
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:49.220
the stars and I with some of the mud that got to sit up and look around.

683
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:53.190
Lucky me.
Lucky mud.

684
00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:58.230
I mud sat up and saw what a nice job God had done.

685
00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:03.210
Nice going.
God,
no,
we didn't.
Nobody.
But you could have done it.
God,

686
00:47:03.211 --> 00:47:07.770
I certainly couldn't have.
I feel very unimportant compared to you.

687
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:13.800
The only way I can feel the least bit important is to think of all the mud that

688
00:47:13.801 --> 00:47:16.560
didn't even get to sit up and look around.

689
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.940
I got so much and most mud got so little.

690
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.210
Thank you for the honor.
Now,

691
00:47:24.211 --> 00:47:27.120
mud lies down again and goes to sleep.

692
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:30.730
What memories for mud have?
What?
Interesting.

693
00:47:30.731 --> 00:47:33.520
Other kinds of sitting up mud I met.

694
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.700
I loved everything I saw.

695
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:42.100
It seems to me that you're right.
Emotional response isn't fear.

696
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:43.660
It is an anger.

697
00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:47.260
It's gratitude that we're able to be alive at all.
