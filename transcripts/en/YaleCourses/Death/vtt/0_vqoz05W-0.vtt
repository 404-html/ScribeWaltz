00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.490
The end of last class,

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.290
I began to raise the question as to whether or not we should distinguish two

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.170
questions that we would normally be inclined to run together.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.300
We've been asking ourselves,
what does it take for me to survive,

5
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:19.680
for me to continue to exist,
but it's possible.
I suggested that we really don't,

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.740
shouldn't focus on the question,
what does it take for me to survive,

7
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:25.830
but rather what is it that I care about?

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.680
What is it that matters in survival?

9
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.480
Because it's possible logically speaking that there could be cases in which I

10
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:34.360
survived,

11
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.380
but I don't have what I normally have when I survive and so I don't have what

12
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:44.790
matters.
I don't have what I wanted when I wanted to survive.

13
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.930
It could be that in the typical cases of survival,
I've got that extra thing,

14
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.380
but we can think of cases in which I would survive,

15
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:56.640
but I don't have that extra thing and so I wouldn't have everything that matters

16
00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:58.170
to me.
So as as it were,

17
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.200
we might say it might be that mere survival or bare bones survival doesn't

18
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:05.850
really give me what matters.

19
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.210
What I want is survival plus something else.

20
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.860
And I tried to motivate this question by having you think about perhaps the

21
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:17.760
possibility that the soul view was the truth about personal identity,

22
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.970
but imagine a case of complete irreversible Amnesia while nonetheless it's still

23
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:29.220
your soul continuing but the soul is going to then having been scrubbed clean,

24
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:33.360
get a brand new personality,
new set of memories,

25
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:35.580
new set of desires,
new set of beliefs,

26
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.590
no chance of recalling your previous current personality.

27
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.160
And when I think about that case,
I find myself wanting to say,
all right,

28
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.420
I'll survive,
but so what?
I don't care.

29
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.520
It doesn't matter that it's me in that case because I don't just want it to be

30
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:58.260
me.
I want to have,
there'll be somebody that's me with my personality.

31
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.390
Similarly,

32
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.390
suppose we thought that the body of view was the correct view and we imagine

33
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:09.870
again,
some sort of case of complete amnesia.

34
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.820
And so then we get a new personality and he said,

35
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:19.740
well look that that's going to be you.
Your body,
your brain,
you're still around.

36
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:22.980
And I say,
oh,
could be true,
but so what?

37
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.340
It doesn't give me what I want.
When I want to survive.

38
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.310
What I want isn't just for it to be me.
I want it to be me with,
with,

39
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.610
with my personality.

40
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.390
So should we conclude therefore that what really matters is not just survival,

41
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:42.900
but having the same personality

42
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.840
with the expos.
The personality view of personal identity was correct.

43
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.010
Would that then give us not just personal survival,
but what matters?

44
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.650
I think that's close,
but no cigar.

45
00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:58.890
Not quite good enough to see that.

46
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.590
Recall the fact that according to the personality view,

47
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:04.480
as a theory of personal identity,

48
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.710
the crucial point isn't that my personality stay identical.

49
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.960
It's not that I have to keep all exactly the very same beliefs,
desires,
memories,

50
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.900
because of course if we said that,
then you know I die.

51
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:20.380
As soon as they got a new belief,
I die as soon as I forgot anything at all,

52
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:25.330
like what I was doing 20 minutes ago.
No,
according to the personality theory,

53
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.420
what personality would personal identity requires?

54
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:31.900
Isn't item for item the same personality,

55
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.470
but rather the same evolving personality.

56
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.370
I gained new beliefs,
new desires,
new goals.

57
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.440
I may lose some of my previous beliefs,
lose some of my previous my memories,

58
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.400
but that's okay.

59
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:50.401
As long as it's a slowly evolving personality with enough overlap.

60
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.810
Okay.
So now let's consider the following case.
I started off,

61
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.220
here I am,
I've got a set of beliefs,
a set of,
you know,

62
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:04.500
I believe I'm Shelly Kagan set of memories about growing up in Chicago,
uh,

63
00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:05.030
as such,

64
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.410
set of desires about wanting to finish my book and philosophy and so forth.

65
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.800
And I get older and older and older and I get some new memories and some new

66
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:20.020
desires and some new goals.
Suppose that I get very,
very,

67
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.160
very old.
I get a hundred years old,
200 years old,

68
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.280
300 years old,
somewhere around 200.

69
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.110
Suppose that my friends give me a nickname,
they call me Jojo.

70
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.240
Who knows why they call me Jojo.

71
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.150
And after a while somewhere and the name spreads.

72
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.450
And by the time I'm 250 years old,
everybody's calling me Joe.
Joe.

73
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:42.040
Nobody calls me Shelly anymore.

74
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.250
And by the time I'm 300350400 I forgotten anybody used to call me Jojo and I no

75
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:51.910
longer remember growing up in Chicago.

76
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.510
I remember things about my,

77
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.640
about my youth when I was a lad of a hundred but I can't go back to what it was

78
00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:01.330
like in the early days.

79
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.750
Just like you can't go back to what it was like to be four or three.

80
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.620
And suppose that ours,
all this is going on.
As I'm getting older and older,

81
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.550
my personality is changing in a variety of other ways.

82
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.620
I lose my interest in philosophy and,
and take up an interest in,

83
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.450
I dunno,
something that completely doesn't,

84
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.870
organic chemistry holds no interest to me whatsoever.

85
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.390
I think I'm fascinated by the details of organic chemistry and,

86
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.680
and my values change.
Now I'm a kind,

87
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.880
I mean now over here I'm a kind,
compassionate,
you know,

88
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.940
warm individual who cares about the downtrodden but around 300 I say then Donald

89
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.090
Trump and who needs them.

90
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.410
And by the time I'm 500 I think I'm completely self absorbed and I'm sort of a

91
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:49.180
vicious,
cruel,
vile person.
Here I am,
800 years old,

92
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:50.470
900 years old,

93
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.260
Macusa law in the Bible lives for 969 years.

94
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:58.910
He's the oldest person,
so okay,
here I am,

95
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.770
969 years old.
I'm like,

96
00:06:01.771 --> 00:06:06.230
Methuselah call this the Methuselah case and the crucial point about the case is

97
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:11.231
that we stipulate that at no point was there a dramatic change.

98
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.100
It was all gradual,

99
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.390
slow evolving and just the way it happens in real life.
It's just an ass.

100
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:20.450
Methuselah.
I live I very,
very,

101
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.930
very long time and by the end of it,

102
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:28.931
and indeed let's say somewhere around 600 or 700 I'm a completely different

103
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:32.720
person as we might put it.
I don't mean literally,

104
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.740
I mean in terms of my personality now member according to the personality theory

105
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:40.640
of personal identity,

106
00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:45.641
what makes it neat is the fact that it's the same evolving personality and I

107
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:51.470
stipulated that it is the same evolving personality,

108
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.180
so that still need,
that's going to be around 600 years from now,

109
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.380
700 years from now.
But when I think about that case,

110
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.580
I say,
so what?
Who Cares?

111
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.910
When I think about that case,
I say,
true.

112
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.290
We'll just stipulate that will be me in 700 years,

113
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.810
but it doesn't give me what I want.

114
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.680
That person is so completely unlike me.

115
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.660
Doesn't remember being Shelly Kagan doesn't remember growing up in Chicago,

116
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:24.291
doesn't remember.

117
00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:28.190
My family has completely different interests and tastes and values.

118
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.420
I say it's me,
but sort of so what?
It doesn't give me what I,

119
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.420
what I want.
It doesn't give me what matters.

120
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.790
When I think about what I want,

121
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.820
it's not just that there be somebody at the tail end of an evolving personality.

122
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.350
I want that person to be like me,

123
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.720
not just be me.

124
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.990
I want that person to be like me and in the Methuselah case I've stipulated ends

125
00:07:57.381 --> 00:08:00.770
up not being very much like me at all,

126
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.060
so it doesn't give me what I want.
When I think about what I want,

127
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:07.730
I'm just going to invite you to each one of you to ask yourself,

128
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:10.520
what is it that you want?
What matters to you in survival?

129
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.740
When I think about what matters to me,

130
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:17.770
it's not just survival is not just survival as part of the same ongoing

131
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:18.800
personality.

132
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.270
It's survival with a similar personality,

133
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.760
not identical item for item,

134
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.750
but close enough to be fairly similar to me.

135
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.480
Give me that and I've got what matters.

136
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:37.481
Don't give me that and I don't have what matters that I'm inclined to go a

137
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:42.470
little bit further once you give me that,
give me that.

138
00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:44.840
There's somebody there with my similar personality.

139
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.580
I think that may be all that matters.
Up to this moment I had been saying,
okay,

140
00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:52.010
survival by itself isn't good enough.

141
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:56.640
You need survival plus something else and I'm now that my own case at least

142
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.510
there's something else is some of the extra is same,

143
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.160
similar personality.

144
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.510
It might be that I get what matters to me even if I had as long as I have

145
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:10.500
similar personality,
even if I don't have survival,

146
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.140
suppose I don't believe in souls,

147
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.150
but suppose the really our souls and suppose the soul is the key to personal

148
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:23.151
identity and suppose the thing that Loc was worried about really does happen

149
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.930
every day at midnight.

150
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.960
God destroys the old soul and replaces it with a new soul that has the very same

151
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:37.380
personality as the one before midnight.
Similar personality,
same beliefs,

152
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:38.730
desires and so forth and so on.

153
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.960
If I were to discover that's what was happening metaphysically and the sole view

154
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:45.330
was the true theory of personal identity,
I'd say,

155
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.280
turns out I'm not going to survive tonight.
I'm going to die.

156
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.170
Who Cares?

157
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.880
There'll be somebody around tomorrow with my beliefs,
my desires,

158
00:09:56.881 --> 00:10:00.600
my goals,
my ambitions,
my fears,
my values,
good enough.

159
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.570
I don't really care whether I'm going to survive.

160
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.490
What I care about is whether there'll be somebody that's similar to me in the

161
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:10.680
right way in terms of my personality.

162
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:16.500
So it might be that the whole question we've been focusing on,

163
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.250
what does it take to survive me?

164
00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:21.750
It turned out to be misguided.

165
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.890
The real question may not be what does it take to survive,

166
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.870
but what matters?

167
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:33.290
And it might turn out that although normally having what matters goes hand in

168
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:37.440
hand with surviving,
logically speaking,

169
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.990
they can come apart and what matters or,

170
00:10:39.991 --> 00:10:44.400
so it seems to me at least isn't survival per se,

171
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.820
but rather having the same personality since I'm inclined to think that the body

172
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:55.470
view is the correct theory of personal identity.

173
00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.120
I want to say,
look,
somebody around tomorrow,
you know,

174
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:05.170
if overnight God replaces my body with some identical looking body and keeps the

175
00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:10.380
personality the same,
that won't be me.
But all right,

176
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.490
it's good enough.

177
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.560
What matters to me isn't survival per se.

178
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.440
Indeed.
Isn't survival strictly at all?

179
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.900
It's having the same personality

180
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.830
still.
What does that leave us?

181
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.660
That leaves us with the possibility that there could be cases where you die and

182
00:11:30.661 --> 00:11:35.070
you don't survive.
You know,
maybe God swooped me up upon death.
You know,

183
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:36.000
my body dies,

184
00:11:36.001 --> 00:11:39.930
but he's sort of swoops up my information about my personality and recreates

185
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.960
somebody up in heaven with the similar personality.

186
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:49.260
Won't be me.
If it's a different soul won't be needed.
It's a different body,

187
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.310
but still I want to say,
well,
give me what matters.

188
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.840
Well,
that's a possibility,
but I don't in fact think it's going to happen.

189
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.800
I believe I've told you I'm a physical list.

190
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.700
I believe that what's going to happen is at the death of my body,

191
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.020
that's going to be the end.
Now,

192
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.440
what I've been arguing is that logically speaking,

193
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:12.790
even if you are a physical list,

194
00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:15.460
that doesn't rule out the possibility of survival.

195
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.570
Suppose you believe in the personality theory,
your body's going to die,

196
00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:24.571
but your personality could continue or it might be even as a body theorist,

197
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.240
I'll cease to exist,
but what matters,
we'll continue.

198
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.830
These are possibilities,
but for what it's worth,

199
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:36.730
I don't in fact believe they're actually what's going to happen.

200
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.330
Of course,
these are also theological Madison,

201
00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:45.331
so I'm not trying to say anything here today to argue out of the theological

202
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:50.431
conviction that God will resurrect the body or God will transplant your

203
00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:54.270
personality into some new angel body.
But if you're the,

204
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.310
if you believe in the personality theory,
that will be you or what have you.

205
00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:58.330
I'm not,

206
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:03.330
it's not my goal here to argue for or against these theological possibilities.

207
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:07.750
Having at least taking the time to explain philosophically how we could make

208
00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:11.320
sense of them,
but I do want to report that I don't believe them.

209
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:16.390
I believe that when my body dies,
that's it for me.

210
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.980
There won't be anything that's me afterwards.

211
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:26.130
There won't be anything that even though what I want per se isn't survival.

212
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.250
Not only won't I survive,
I believe after my death.

213
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.470
What matters to me in that situation won't continue either.

214
00:13:35.471 --> 00:13:40.471
There won't be somebody with a similar personality to mind after the death of my

215
00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:44.350
body.
All right,

216
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:50.340
so having spent all this time getting clear about the nature of personal

217
00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:56.330
identity and getting clear about,
uh,
you know,
what,

218
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.560
what people are and the possibilities of survival and so forth,

219
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:04.960
having argued against the existence of souls and for a physical list view,

220
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:09.130
physicalism seems compatible with both the body of view and the personality
view.

221
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:14.020
Leave it to you to decide between them.
I myself currently favor the body view.

222
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:15.160
Let's ask,

223
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:20.730
so just what his death anyway on the physicalist view might seem as though it's

224
00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:25.120
fairly straightforward.

225
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:30.170
A person after all is just a body that's functioning in the right way so as to

226
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.240
do these person tricks.

227
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.680
It's p functioning as we've put it at one time or another.

228
00:14:38.681 --> 00:14:41.380
And so a person,
just a p functioning body,

229
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.340
whether you emphasize the body side there,
the personality side of that,

230
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.630
of that equation,
what exactly is it to die?

231
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:54.470
When do I,
let's,
let's turn to that question.
When do I die

232
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.780
and what is deck?
The,
roughly speaking the answer,

233
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:02.780
presumably I'm the physicalist view is going to be something like if you,

234
00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:06.020
if I'm alive when we've got a p functioning body,

235
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:11.150
roughly speaking,
I die.
When,
when that stops happening,

236
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.140
when the body breaks and it stops functioning properly,

237
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:21.310
that seems more or less the right answer from the physical host point of view.

238
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:25.820
Although I was,
we'll see probably later today.
We need to refine it somewhat,

239
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.410
but first let's ask a slightly different question.

240
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.940
Which functions are crucial in defining the moment of death?

241
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.060
After all,
we've got the idea that here's the body,
here's a function.
He body.

242
00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.930
Here's one in front of you.
Each one of you has got one.

243
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.180
You're a functioning body.

244
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.610
There's a variety of functions that your body's engaged in.

245
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.320
Some of them have to do with merely digesting food and moving the body around

246
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:59.180
and making the heartbeat and the lungs open and close and call those things the

247
00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:02.630
bodily functions.
And there's also,

248
00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:04.940
of course in each one of our cases,

249
00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:09.941
there's these higher mental cognitive functions that I'd been calling the person

250
00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:12.740
functioning.
The,
you know that there's,
that there's,

251
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.850
there's a B functions and there's The p functions.

252
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.400
Well,
roughly speaking,
I die when the functioning stops,
but,

253
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:26.270
but which functions is it the body functions or the personality functions?

254
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.590
So let's take a look at the normal situation.

255
00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.070
Or here's the existence of your body.

256
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.650
And during most of the existence of your body,

257
00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.790
it's functioning.

258
00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.950
It's the body functions.

259
00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.193
<v 1>Okay?</v>

260
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.330
<v 0>Over here it's no longer functioning.
The carps</v>

261
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.970
during some of the period when your body is functioning,

262
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:11.980
it's doing the higher cognitive stuff.

263
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.970
So it's personality functions.

264
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.153
<v 1>Okay?</v>

265
00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.210
<v 0>Yeah.
This is the very early stuff.
When your body's still developing and,</v>

266
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.720
and your brain hasn't turned on yet or your brain is turned on,

267
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.450
but it hasn't actually become a person yet.
Right?

268
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.420
That's at least in the case of the fetus.
It's not self conscious.

269
00:17:42.421 --> 00:17:46.590
It's not rational.
It's not able to communicate.
It's not creative and so forth.

270
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.220
That comes later.
All right,

271
00:17:50.221 --> 00:17:55.050
so there's phase a,
phase B,

272
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:56.940
phase c,

273
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.200
that's the normal situation.

274
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:06.780
The normal case,

275
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.860
the body existed functions for a while before the p functioning begins.

276
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.950
And then after a while,
the body and p functioning,

277
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.790
you're both going on and then after a while they stop.
In the normal case,

278
00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.960
you know,
I'm in a car accident or whatever it is and my body stops functioning,

279
00:18:26.961 --> 00:18:30.020
my personality stops functioning and you're left with a corpse.

280
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:38.190
When did I die?
Well,
the natural suggestion is to say,

281
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.750
I died here,

282
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.660
dropped my little star or an asterisk.

283
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:46.643
<v 1>Okay,</v>

284
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.930
<v 0>and the normal case,</v>

285
00:18:47.931 --> 00:18:52.931
I die when my body stops functioning in terms of the body functions and it stops

286
00:18:53.481 --> 00:18:55.700
functioning in terms of the personality functions.

287
00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.610
That's the normal case though.

288
00:19:00.611 --> 00:19:05.611
We can still ask the philosophical question since what we had here was

289
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.840
simultaneously losing,

290
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:12.870
losing both the ordinary body functioning and the special personality

291
00:19:13.031 --> 00:19:13.864
functioning,

292
00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:19.140
which loss was the crucial one in terms of defining the moment of my death.

293
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

294
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.080
<v 0>Let's come back to that question in a minute.
First,</v>

295
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.060
I want to ask a slightly different question.

296
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.040
When did I ceased to exist

297
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:35.580
or to put it slightly differently?

298
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.840
Do I exist during phase c when the body has stopped functioning,

299
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.800
both in terms of body functions and personality functions?
I'm just a corpse.

300
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.150
Do I exist now?

301
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:56.210
Let's suppose we believe the personality theory of personal identity according

302
00:19:57.791 --> 00:20:02.010
to the personality theory of personal identity.
For something to be me,

303
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:06.450
it's got to have the very same personality,
the same evolving,

304
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.620
but still the same set of beliefs,
desires,
goals,
so forth.

305
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.930
Now during periods,

306
00:20:12.931 --> 00:20:17.490
see there's nothing with my personality,

307
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.770
all right?
Nobody thinks they're Shelly Kagan.
Nobody has my memories,
beliefs,

308
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.940
exact desires,
goals,
and so forth pretty clearly.

309
00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:30.090
Then on the personality theory,

310
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.560
I don't exist at phase.
See,

311
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.430
that's why it's natural to point to the moment of star.

312
00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:42.510
When we say that's when my death occurs.
I don't exist at phase c,

313
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.880
but interestingly,

314
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:49.480
things look rather different if we accept not the personality theory,

315
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:54.250
but instead the body theory after all,

316
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.540
according to the body theory of personal identity,
for somebody to be me,

317
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:02.980
they got to have my body follow the body.

318
00:21:02.981 --> 00:21:06.560
Same body,
same person.
All right,

319
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:12.460
Harry are,
here's my corpse.
What is a corpse?

320
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.230
It's a body and indeed my corpse is my body.

321
00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:19.910
<v 2>Okay,</v>

322
00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:23.750
<v 0>so follow the body means follow the person.</v>

323
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.970
Carps is still around means my body's still around means I'm still around.

324
00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:34.400
It's like,
I mean I'm dead,
but I still exist.

325
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:38.240
It's like a bad joke.
Right?
So you know,
we'll,

326
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.360
here's the question we started in the class off with,
you know,

327
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.360
will you survive your death?

328
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.650
Will you still exist after death?
Well,

329
00:21:48.651 --> 00:21:52.670
there's good news and there's bad news since I believe in the body theory.

330
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.410
The good news is you will exist after your death.

331
00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.190
The bad news is you'll be a corpse.
Right?

332
00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:07.700
Seems like a bad joke.
But if the body theory is right,
it's not a joke at all.

333
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:11.660
It's literally speaking the truth.

334
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.510
I will exist.
Yeah.

335
00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:18.290
At least for a while and then eventually the body will decay,

336
00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:23.300
turn into atoms or whatever it is
decomposed.

337
00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:26.930
At that point,
my body no longer exists.
At that point,
I will no longer exist,

338
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.970
but at least for a while during periods,
see the body theorist should say,

339
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.150
yeah,
you will exist.
You will exist,

340
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.610
but you won't be alive.

341
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:39.720
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

342
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.760
<v 0>Just reinforces the point that I was trying to make a few moments ago that the</v>

343
00:22:43.761 --> 00:22:48.140
crucial question is not survival per se.

344
00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.980
The crucial question is what did you want out of survival?

345
00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:57.620
And one of the things I wanted out of survival was to be alive.

346
00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.430
All right,
so on the body view,

347
00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:06.350
I exist here but I'm not alive so it doesn't give me what matters and the

348
00:23:06.351 --> 00:23:10.310
personality view.
I don't exist when I'm a corpse.

349
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:15.830
Let's go back and ask the question.
Well,

350
00:23:15.831 --> 00:23:17.000
so which is it?

351
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:21.920
Which is the one that's the crucial for defining the moment of death,
right?

352
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.390
Even on the body view,

353
00:23:23.391 --> 00:23:25.910
the fact that I exist isn't good enough because I'm not alive.

354
00:23:25.911 --> 00:23:28.100
I want to know what am I alive,
what am I dead?

355
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:33.160
So what's crucial for defining the moment of death is a body functioning or

356
00:23:33.411 --> 00:23:34.970
personality functioning.
Well,

357
00:23:34.971 --> 00:23:39.971
you can't tell by thinking about the normal case because the be functioning and

358
00:23:40.881 --> 00:23:45.110
the p functioning
stop at the same time.

359
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.160
But suppose we draw the abnormal case.

360
00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:00.380
All right here,
see what the corpse again,

361
00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:08.180
here's a period when the body has been functioning and it goes like this.

362
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.190
Here's the period back here.
A way the body has been functioning,

363
00:24:15.191 --> 00:24:19.170
but the personality hasn't started yet and now imagine,

364
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.910
so this is personality

365
00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:30.140
over here we got body,
so we'll call this B again.

366
00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:37.490
What I've done is imagine a case in which the personality functioning stops

367
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.630
before the rest of the body functioning stops.

368
00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.040
Obviously the phases are no longer in alphabetical order,

369
00:24:47.041 --> 00:24:50.250
but I introduced d in the middle,
so as the other phases could keep the,

370
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:54.180
the other phases could keep their same labels.
Well,

371
00:24:54.181 --> 00:24:59.181
here's a case where when does the body functioning stop and the d,

372
00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:04.320
when does the personality functioning?
Stop,
end of B.

373
00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.930
So we got two candidates,

374
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.440
star one and star too.

375
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:18.110
Star one says death occurs when personality stops functioning.

376
00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.510
Star two says says,
no,
no.

377
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:28.530
Death occurs when bodily functioning stops.

378
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:30.810
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

379
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.300
<v 0>well then the question is what should we say?</v>

380
00:25:33.301 --> 00:25:36.360
And I think we've got to perhaps be drawn to different answers depending on

381
00:25:36.361 --> 00:25:39.240
whether we accept the body view or the personality view.

382
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:42.260
Suppose we accept the body view.

383
00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:45.341
Well,
look,

384
00:25:45.341 --> 00:25:50.341
if the relevant question is when do I die and I am a body,

385
00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.220
then presumably the straight forward answer,

386
00:25:57.221 --> 00:26:02.140
at least it's going to be I die when my body stops functioning.

387
00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:08.090
When is that
star too?

388
00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.160
During Period d?

389
00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:14.303
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

390
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.330
<v 0>I'm still alive,</v>

391
00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:21.970
but I'm no longer functioning as a person.

392
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:27.250
I am no longer a person.

393
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:34.280
That's interesting.
It's not just that I exist in,
see,

394
00:26:34.281 --> 00:26:38.810
I can exist without being a corpse or we want the right without being alive as a

395
00:26:38.811 --> 00:26:42.170
corpse in d,

396
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.620
I'm alive,
but I'm not a person.

397
00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:49.413
<v 2>Okay.</v>

398
00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:50.720
<v 0>You'll recall when we talked about Plato,</v>

399
00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:55.810
we introduced the notion of essential properties and it seems that if we accept

400
00:26:57.011 --> 00:26:57.940
the body view,

401
00:26:57.941 --> 00:27:02.941
we have to say being a person is not an essential property of being something

402
00:27:07.631 --> 00:27:12.340
like me.
It's not one of my essential properties that I'm a person.

403
00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.700
I am in fact a person.

404
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:17.220
<v 2>Okay,</v>

405
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:22.170
<v 0>but that won't always be true of me.
When I'm a corpse,</v>

406
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.960
I will cease to be a person,

407
00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:30.140
but I'll still exist and if we have this unusual case in which my,

408
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.480
my brain has a,
has a stroke,

409
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:38.540
loses its higher cognitive functioning so that the body continues to breathe,

410
00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:44.070
eat,
respirate and so forth.
The heart continues to pump,

411
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.990
but there was no longer anything capable of thinking,
reasoning.
We say,

412
00:27:48.991 --> 00:27:53.730
look,
I still exist.
Indeed I'm alive,
but I'm not a person.

413
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:59.150
Being a person is something new can go through for a period of time and cease to

414
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:06.831
be in the same way that being a child is a phase you can go through for a period

415
00:28:08.311 --> 00:28:10.110
of time and then cease to be,

416
00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:15.140
or being a professor is a phase you can go through and then cease to be,

417
00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:20.010
you can still exist without being a professor.

418
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:25.170
I can still be alive without being a professor.
Well,
on the body of view,

419
00:28:25.171 --> 00:28:27.870
we have to say the same thing about being a person.

420
00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:31.860
Being a person is something that I named me.

421
00:28:31.861 --> 00:28:35.130
My body can do for a while.

422
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:42.630
It wasn't doing it back here in a certainly won't be doing it and see and it

423
00:28:44.321 --> 00:28:46.120
won't be doing it in d either.

424
00:28:46.121 --> 00:28:51.121
Being a person is something on the body view that I am only for part of my

425
00:28:52.691 --> 00:28:55.780
existence and indeed only for part of my life.

426
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.120
Well that's what it seems we should say.
I'm the body view.

427
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.350
What if instead we accept the personality theory?

428
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:11.310
Then
actually one,
one more remark about the body view.

429
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.060
Notice that if you accept this,
uh,

430
00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.110
kind of what the body you should say about when death is,
you know,

431
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.690
my death is when I cease to be alive.

432
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:23.780
I am my body so my deck occurs at star to loss of bodily function and being a

433
00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:31.260
person who is just a phase.
Notice that if we say that,

434
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:36.290
then there's something somewhat misleading about the standard philosophical

435
00:29:36.451 --> 00:29:40.140
label for the problems we've been thinking about for the last couple of weeks.

436
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.050
We've been worrying about the nature of personal identity.

437
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.990
That is what is it for somebody to be me,

438
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.770
but notice that that label personal identity,

439
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.220
the problem of personal identity seems to have built into it.

440
00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:58.900
The assumption that whatever it is that's me is going to be a person.

441
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.020
Is it the same person or not?

442
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:08.000
Now it turns out that that assumption standardly built into the usual label may

443
00:30:08.001 --> 00:30:11.020
be false on the body view.

444
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.620
It could still be me without being a person at all.

445
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:18.970
So the problem of existence through time or persistence through time shouldn't

446
00:30:18.971 --> 00:30:23.230
be called the problem of personal identity,
but just the problem of identity.

447
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:28.660
Yeah.
Footnote Tony.
Now again to the personality theory,

448
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.700
if we accept the personality theory of personal identity,

449
00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.180
then for someone to be me,

450
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:42.870
they've got to have the same personality and so for something for me to exist,

451
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:50.110
my personality has to be around,
well,
that's why we set up here that in phase,

452
00:30:50.111 --> 00:30:52.600
see when there's a corpse,
I don't exist.

453
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.620
There's nothing with my personality as a corpse.

454
00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.390
I no longer exist.

455
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.340
What should we say about phase d on the personality theory?

456
00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:07.930
Here,
my body is functioning,

457
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.530
but my personality has been destroyed.

458
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:17.260
Nothing exists with my beliefs,
memories,
desires,
fears,

459
00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:20.380
values,
goals,
ambitions.
Well,

460
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:24.610
if I just am my personality,

461
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:31.020
then I don't exist in phase d because there's nothing there to be me.

462
00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.100
Nothing with my personality according to the personality theory.

463
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.030
Follow the personality,
the personality ended.
It's star one.

464
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:46.320
So I don't exist at phase d and the personality theory.

465
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.030
Okay,
good.
I don't exist,

466
00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:55.300
but what should we say?
Am I alive or not?

467
00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:01.420
Well,
my body still alive.
So should we say that I'm alive after all,

468
00:32:01.421 --> 00:32:05.440
my body's still functioning until star too.
During Phase D,

469
00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.830
my body seems to still be alive.
Should we say that I'm alive?

470
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:11.950
That's rather hard to believe,
right?

471
00:32:11.951 --> 00:32:13.780
Think about what it would mean to say that we'd be saying,

472
00:32:13.781 --> 00:32:15.160
I'm the personality theory.

473
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.970
I don't exist but I'm alive.

474
00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.860
That seems like a very unpalatable combination of views.

475
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:28.180
How can I be alive if I don't even exist?

476
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:34.590
So it seems we have to say I'm not alive during phase d.

477
00:32:34.781 --> 00:32:38.290
Not only don't I exist during phase d,

478
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:43.220
I'm not either yet.
My body is alive.

479
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.800
That's the whole stipulation.

480
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.370
So it looks as though the personality theorists is going to have to introduce a

481
00:32:49.371 --> 00:32:54.371
distinction between my being alive on the one hand and my body being alive on

482
00:32:57.291 --> 00:32:58.124
the other.

483
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:03.850
In the normal case up at the top goes to deaths occur simultaneously.

484
00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:14.390
My body stops being alive at the very same moment that I cease being alive.

485
00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.570
But in the ad normal case,

486
00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:22.850
the personality theorists needs to say or so it seems to me the two deaths come

487
00:33:22.851 --> 00:33:23.684
apart.

488
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:29.710
The death of my body occurs at star to my death occurs at star one

489
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:35.880
<v 2>yeah,</v>

490
00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:40.880
<v 0>notice that the body theorist didn't need to draw that distinction because if I</v>

491
00:33:41.161 --> 00:33:43.260
just am my body,

492
00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.770
then well I'm just my body.

493
00:33:46.771 --> 00:33:49.470
My death occurs at the death of my body.

494
00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.690
But still,
even the body theorist needs a different distinction.

495
00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:59.160
We already learned by thinking about the corpse case that existence wasn't good

496
00:33:59.161 --> 00:34:02.460
enough for the body theorist.
He wanted to be alive.

497
00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.930
And when I think about phase D,
I want to say something more,
you know,

498
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:11.460
it's not good enough that I'm alive.
I want to be a person,

499
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:17.090
so what matters to me isn't just being alive,

500
00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:20.840
but being back here during phase B,

501
00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.060
so we're going to need something like the same distinction,

502
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.850
not my death versus my body's death,

503
00:34:28.851 --> 00:34:33.440
but perhaps the death of the person if we could talk that way versus the death

504
00:34:33.441 --> 00:34:38.120
of the body.
My death for the body view occurs with the death of my body,

505
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:42.650
but in terms of what matters,
it's the death of the person and that star one,

506
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:44.000
not star too.

507
00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:50.830
Now I want to take just a couple of minutes and mentioned some other puzzles or

508
00:34:50.831 --> 00:34:55.831
at least questions worth thinking about in terms of the physical list picture.

509
00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.370
I'm only going to point to them rather than explore them,

510
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:04.300
but I've been focused on the question about the end of life.

511
00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.260
We might ask as well,
what about the beginning?

512
00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:15.240
What should we say about phase a when the body is turned on and functioning,

513
00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:17.530
developing,

514
00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:23.100
but the brain has not yet gotten to the stage at which it's turned on or perhaps

515
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:29.380
it hasn't yet become worth not doing person functioning.
It's not rash,

516
00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:32.560
it's not reasoning.
It's not.
Communicate is not thinking.
It's not aware.

517
00:35:32.561 --> 00:35:33.430
It's not conscious.

518
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.490
It's going to be some phase a like that.

519
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.820
What should we say about that phase?

520
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:46.230
Do I exist during that phase or don't I?

521
00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.950
<v 1>Well,
on the</v>

522
00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:57.700
<v 0>bodies you,
I suppose we should say I do exist.</v>

523
00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:59.760
Being a person's a,

524
00:35:59.761 --> 00:36:04.761
a phase we happen to have in phase a the stage of my existence before I become a

525
00:36:07.691 --> 00:36:08.524
person.

526
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

527
00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:12.430
<v 0>Of course,</v>

528
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:16.690
if we take the version of the body view that what I am essentially these crucial

529
00:36:16.691 --> 00:36:18.670
body part is my brain,

530
00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:24.130
then we really would have to sub divide a into two parts early a in late a,

531
00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:28.270
you know it very,
very early age.
The brain hasn't even developed yet.

532
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:30.850
It hasn't been constructed yet.

533
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:34.240
If I just am my brain in effect,

534
00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:38.470
then early Aa,
I don't exist yet.

535
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:45.270
Not until late a when the brain gets put together that I start to exist,

536
00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:51.820
there's something there.
It's my body,

537
00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.530
but it's not me.

538
00:36:53.531 --> 00:36:57.850
In early Aa seems sorta hard to believe,

539
00:36:57.851 --> 00:37:00.220
but maybe that's the right thing to say.
In any event,

540
00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:04.960
the fans of the personality theory shouldn't be laughing too hard cause they're

541
00:37:04.961 --> 00:37:06.850
going to have to say something similar.
Remember,

542
00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.190
if you accept the personality theory,

543
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:14.410
follow the personality.
Don't got the same personality.

544
00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.330
I ceased to exist.

545
00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:20.980
That's why we said on the personality theory as we went ahead in time,

546
00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:25.810
once the p functioning stops,
I don't exist anymore.

547
00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:27.820
That's what the personality theorists said,

548
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:30.880
but we can raise that same point going backwards.

549
00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:36.190
When did I begin to exist on the personality theory?

550
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:42.630
Not until my continuing evolving through time personality started and that

551
00:37:44.081 --> 00:37:48.730
certainly wasn't true.
Way Back at the start of a,
as the,

552
00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.750
as the fertilized egg first begins to us split,
multiply,

553
00:37:52.751 --> 00:37:54.730
sub divide and make organs.

554
00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:59.820
It's a good long time to any kind of mental processing occurs at all.

555
00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:02.613
<v 1>Okay,</v>

556
00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.720
<v 0>so on the personality theory,</v>

557
00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:10.020
I did not exist when that fertilized egg came into being when the,

558
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:16.810
when the egg and the sperm joint,
that's still not me on the personality theory.

559
00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:22.410
Clearly these issues are relevant for thinking about the morality of abortion.

560
00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.780
I'm not going to pursue them here,

561
00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:29.650
but you can see how they'd be be relevant if we want to worry about when,

562
00:38:29.651 --> 00:38:31.870
if ever is an abortion justified,

563
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:36.990
it might be worth getting clear on when do creatures like us start?

564
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:43.180
Well,
interesting question,
but having noted it,
let me put it aside.
Oh,
question.

565
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.690
<v 3>Is it possible that a,</v>

566
00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:50.620
especially in the very early stages of a embryo or fetus,

567
00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:54.370
you could say the body's functioning either because,
um,

568
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.810
it's completely dependent on the mother's body for its survival and it can use

569
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:04.340
it.
You can do anything on its own.
All its filing functions are just affects it.

570
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:09.620
<v 0>The question was,
would it be plausible to say that at the early phases of a,</v>

571
00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:11.751
strictly speaking,

572
00:39:11.751 --> 00:39:15.530
the body's not functioning because it's so utterly dependent on help from the

573
00:39:15.531 --> 00:39:17.710
mother's body?
It needs,
you know,

574
00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:21.950
the mothers for respiration,
for nutrients,
so forth and so on.

575
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:26.150
That's a great question and it's the sort of question that is the reason why I

576
00:39:26.151 --> 00:39:30.410
said I wanted to glance in this direction without really going there.

577
00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.060
That that's a nice example of it.

578
00:39:32.061 --> 00:39:37.061
We might wonder just when should we say the body functioning really does start,

579
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.140
how much independence does it take?

580
00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.090
No,
we could draw yet another picture of a different way.

581
00:39:47.091 --> 00:39:48.440
Life could come to an end.

582
00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:53.540
Imagine a body towards the end of life on life support machinery.

583
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:57.530
Do we want to say the body's functioning and not functioning well?
Hard cases.

584
00:39:57.531 --> 00:40:01.400
They're so similar.
Lou's going to be hard cases about the very,

585
00:40:01.401 --> 00:40:05.480
very early stages and all the other great questions and I'm happy to discuss

586
00:40:05.481 --> 00:40:06.410
them with you further.

587
00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:11.440
I don't want to pursue them here and now want a point to a different question

588
00:40:11.601 --> 00:40:15.730
that yeah,
I think it's a crucially important question.
My,
my,

589
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:18.890
my unwillingness to discuss them isn't a matter of my judgment that are

590
00:40:18.891 --> 00:40:22.820
unimportant.
Just trying to keep at least roughly on track.

591
00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:26.770
Come back to the end of life.

592
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:31.480
Think some more about phase d and ask,

593
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:35.410
all right,
so this is something that if,
if the,

594
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:40.060
if the personality function has been destroyed,
can't be recovered,

595
00:40:40.061 --> 00:40:42.820
can't be fixed,
but the rest of the bodily function,

596
00:40:42.821 --> 00:40:46.540
he's still going on the heart.
Breathe in,
the heart's pumping,

597
00:40:46.541 --> 00:40:50.200
the lungs are breathing and so forth.
Body is able to digest food.

598
00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:55.270
There we are in phase d in something like perhaps persistent vegetative state.

599
00:40:58.660 --> 00:40:59.250
<v 2>Okay?</v>

600
00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:04.250
<v 0>Now imagine that we've got somebody who needs a heart transplant or kidney</v>

601
00:41:06.921 --> 00:41:07.754
transplant,

602
00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:12.820
liver transplant and tissue compatibility tests reveal this body's compatible,

603
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.190
suitable donor.

604
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:21.290
Can we take it or not?

605
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:28.100
Well,
you might have,
fuck,
we answered it by asking,
am I still alive?
You know,

606
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:31.740
rip out the heart.
It's going to kill me,
right?
So if I'm still alive,

607
00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:36.070
you can't do that sort of thing.
It's killing me.
Well,

608
00:41:36.071 --> 00:41:40.990
if we take the personality theory,
we have to say,
my body's still alive,

609
00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:45.280
but I'm not still alive.
That's what we seem to,
we want it to say,

610
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.170
if I'm not still alive,

611
00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:51.040
all we'd be killing isn't me but my body.

612
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:57.500
So now we have to ask who or what has the right to life?

613
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Do I have the right to life or does my body have the right to life?

614
00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.780
Or we might say,
look,
certainly I have a right to life.

615
00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.110
But is it also true that in addition to me,

616
00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:15.540
my body has a right to life?

617
00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:21.530
Is there something immoral about removing the organs during phase g when the

618
00:42:22.951 --> 00:42:26.460
person is dead and the only thing that's still alive is the body,

619
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:32.910
don't be too quick to assume the answer and that's got to be yet still wrong.

620
00:42:32.911 --> 00:42:34.830
After all on the body view,

621
00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:38.010
I still exist when I'm a corpse,

622
00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.910
but of course there's nothing wrong about taking my heart even though I still

623
00:42:41.911 --> 00:42:44.190
exist.
After all,
I'm a corpse.

624
00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:49.710
Why not then say similarly,
even though my body is still alive,

625
00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:53.640
nothing wrong about removing the heart.
If the person is dead,

626
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:59.150
at least the personality view opens the door to saying that.

627
00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.030
<v 1>Okay,</v>

628
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:04.720
<v 0>what about the body view and the body view?
Of course I just am my body.</v>

629
00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:07.420
I'm still alive now is it wrong?
We're

630
00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.340
just like with the body view we wanted to say,
you know,

631
00:43:12.341 --> 00:43:14.950
being alive is not all it's cracked up to be.

632
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:18.130
The real question is not am I alive on the body of view?
They are.

633
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.280
An interesting question is,
am I still a person

634
00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.920
and indeed,
although I'm alive on the body view,
I'm not still a person.

635
00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:32.110
Maybe it's not so much that they have a right not to be killed.

636
00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:37.890
Maybe I have a right not to be deep personified to have my personality

637
00:43:41.021 --> 00:43:44.350
destroyed.
If that's the real right,

638
00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:49.000
then again there'd be nothing wrong with removing the heart in d.
Well again,

639
00:43:49.001 --> 00:43:53.470
clearly very,
very important and very,

640
00:43:53.471 --> 00:43:57.940
very complicated questions but having gesture toward them,

641
00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:02.350
I want to put them aside
stead.

642
00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:07.140
I want to
raise the following question,

643
00:44:07.141 --> 00:44:10.850
so look what I've just been talking about for the last half hour or so is the

644
00:44:10.851 --> 00:44:15.740
fact that we've got to get clear in thinking about the nature of death as to

645
00:44:15.741 --> 00:44:20.420
whether or not the crucial moment is the moment when the personality functioning

646
00:44:20.421 --> 00:44:24.350
stops or the moment when the bodily functioning stops.

647
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:28.040
As we saw by thinking about the abnormal case,

648
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.770
these things can come apart and we can have phase d,

649
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:34.800
but in the normal case that happened at the same moment,

650
00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.180
and I've drawn a lot of different distinctions about,
you know,

651
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:41.600
what would you say if you're a personality theorists to deal with this,

652
00:44:41.601 --> 00:44:43.940
what would you say if your body has to deal with this,

653
00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.370
having drawn all those distinctions,

654
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:51.550
I'm going to just ride rough shot over them and put them aside and let's just

655
00:44:53.871 --> 00:44:58.871
suppose that we're dealing with the normal case where the body functioning stops

656
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:04.070
at the same time as the personality functioning stomps.

657
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:09.330
So what is death?
What's the moment of death?

658
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:13.380
What is it to die on the physicalist view?

659
00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:19.080
Well,
at first glance you might think the answer is,
look you,
you exist,

660
00:45:19.081 --> 00:45:21.150
you're alive.
Whatever it is.
You know,
as I said,

661
00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:23.200
I'm going to sort of just be loose.
Now I'm going to put aside all other,

662
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:26.730
the careful distinctions.
I just drew,
I'm still around.

663
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:31.170
As long as my body is p functioning

664
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.700
and when my body's not functioning,
I'm not still around.

665
00:45:35.701 --> 00:45:38.310
Either I don't exist or I'm not alive or I'm not a person.

666
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:40.110
Whichever precise where we have to put it.

667
00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:42.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

668
00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:47.090
<v 0>That seems like the natural proposal for the physical list to make to be dead is</v>

669
00:45:47.091 --> 00:45:49.790
to no longer be p functioning,

670
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:54.910
but that can't quite be right because imagine don't just imagine just to

671
00:45:55.431 --> 00:46:00.431
remember what happened to you last night around 3:28 AM let's just suppose it

672
00:46:05.721 --> 00:46:10.721
had 3:20 AM you were asleep and indeed you weren't dreaming.

673
00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:18.260
You weren't thinking,
you weren't reasoning,
you weren't communicating.

674
00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:22.730
You want remembering,
you weren't making plans,
you weren't being creative,

675
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.690
you were not engaged in p functioning.

676
00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:32.110
If we take the simple straight forward view and say you're dead when you're not

677
00:46:32.421 --> 00:46:34.370
p functioning anymore,

678
00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:38.570
then you were dead on and off and on and off last night.

679
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:43.580
Oh,
I clearly doesn't seem to be the right thing to say,

680
00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:47.750
so we're going to have to revise the,

681
00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.580
the,
the p functioning or the,

682
00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.780
the end of p functioning theory of death.

683
00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.000
We're going to have to revise that theory.

684
00:46:56.001 --> 00:47:00.110
We're going to have to refine it to deal with the obvious fact that you're not

685
00:47:00.111 --> 00:47:03.980
dead all the times when you're unconscious and not dreaming,

686
00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:06.243
<v 1>but</v>

687
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:10.830
<v 0>refining it and just the right way.
He's going to turn out to be a surprisingly,</v>

688
00:47:10.831 --> 00:47:14.100
not straight forward matter,
or at least that's how it seems to me and right.

689
00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.080
That's the question we'll turn to next time.
