00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.870
Last time we turn to the question of what the metaphysical key to personal

2
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:09.960
identity might be.
What makes it be the case that one person,

3
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:13.140
some person that exists in the future is the same person as me.

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.950
The first approach to this that we considered was the sole theory of personal

5
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:22.590
identity.
The key to being the same person as having the same soul,

6
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.050
same soul,
same person,
different per different soul,
different person.

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.590
And the difficulty with that approach,

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.530
even if we bracket the question whether or not there are souls,

9
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:38.820
the difficulty with that approach was that it seems as though the soul could

10
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:43.821
constantly be changing a while the personality as we might call it,

11
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:49.530
stays the same.
Uh,
I,
I have the same beliefs,
memories,
desires,

12
00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:52.050
goals,
uh,
preferences and so forth.

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.610
But the sole underneath it all keeps being swapped every five minutes.

14
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.320
If the sole theory of personal identity,
we're,
we're right,
that would not be me.

15
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.370
I would be the per every five minutes that that person would die and we'd have a

16
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:08.190
new person despite having the same personality.

17
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.790
Most of us find that a rather difficult thing to believe that that the person

18
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:19.401
could be constantly changing in this way without having any way at all to tell

19
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.220
a,
and if we're not willing to accept that implication,

20
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:27.990
it seems as though we need to reject the sole theory of personal identity.

21
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.430
Now,
I use this cumbersome phrase because of course I'm not here talking about

22
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.890
rejecting the existence of souls.

23
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.140
What I'm considering right now is the question whether sameness of soul is the

24
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:43.460
key to being the same person,
and this is a,

25
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.990
there's a logical distinction here that's worth drawing.

26
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:48.540
Even if you believe in souls,

27
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.780
you don't have to say that having the very same soul is the key to being the

28
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:59.250
very same person
and trivially.
Of course,

29
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.000
if you don't believe in souls,
if you don't believe that souls exists,

30
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.870
then you certainly can't appeal to the existence of souls,

31
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.280
the continuity of soul,
the sameness of soul as the key to personal identity.

32
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.910
But we might then ask,
well,
what's the alternative?
Now,

33
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.150
the natural alternative is to say the key to being the same person is not the

34
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.280
sameness of the soul,
whether or not it exists,

35
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.720
but rather having the very same body.
And again,

36
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.270
although I'm not going to go on and on about this point,

37
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:33.870
it's worth noticing that even if you do believe that souls exist,

38
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.080
nothing stops you from accepting the body theory of personal identity.

39
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.210
Nothing rules out the possibility that having the very same body is the key to

40
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:49.410
being the very same person over time.
Even if you believe in souls,

41
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.510
you can accept the body theory and it certainly looks as though if you don't

42
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:59.350
believe in souls,
you have to accept the body theory of personal identity.

43
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.440
Now as it turns out,
that appearance is deceptive.

44
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.590
There are still other alternatives open to the physical list.

45
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.810
But let's come to that other alternative later.

46
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.310
Let's take a few minutes and consider the nature of the body theory,

47
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.850
the body theory of personal identity.
Oh,
I'm this theory.
Of course,

48
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.340
the secret to being the same person is having the same body.

49
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.110
So when we ask,

50
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.980
well you remember last lecture I was talking about how there'd be somebody here

51
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:31.630
lecturing to you philosophy on Tuesday.
Well,
here's somebody is,

52
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.040
is that the same person?
Is the,
is the person who's lecturing to,

53
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:40.600
you're now the same person as the person who was lecturing to you before

54
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.310
according to the body theory,
the answer is turns on the question.
Well,

55
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:47.440
is this the same body as the,

56
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.770
as the lump of flesh and bone that was here last week?

57
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.100
If it is and,
and by the by it is.

58
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.920
If it is then then that's the same person.

59
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.090
So Am I the person who was lecturing to you last week?
Yes I am.

60
00:04:05.091 --> 00:04:09.980
Because it's the very same body.
That's what the body theory says.

61
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.070
And unlike souls where it's all rather mysterious,

62
00:04:13.071 --> 00:04:17.390
how you could tell whether body,
whether sole swapping was taking place or not,

63
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.950
it's not all that mysterious.

64
00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:21.980
How we check out to see whether you know the same bodies been around.

65
00:04:21.981 --> 00:04:23.750
Even though you didn't do it,

66
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.410
you could have snuck into my house,

67
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.250
watched my body,
go to sleep,
get up in the morning,

68
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.810
followed the body around over the course of the day,
see it go to sleep again.

69
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.680
You could have tracked that body through space and time and say,
Hey,
look,
same,

70
00:04:39.681 --> 00:04:44.681
very same body in the same way that we are able to track in principle cars,

71
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.140
our earlier example and talk about,
yeah,

72
00:04:48.141 --> 00:04:53.141
it's the same hunk of metal and wire and rubber and plastic.

73
00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:58.580
This is the same honk,
same body.
All right.
Same body,
same person.

74
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.150
That's the body theory of personal identity.

75
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.970
Now,
if we accept the body theory,
then of course if we turn to the question,

76
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.640
could I survive my death?

77
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.930
Could I survive the death of my body?
At first glance,

78
00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:17.870
it looks as though the answer is going to have to be,
well,
of course not,

79
00:05:17.871 --> 00:05:21.140
because when my dad,
mom,
when my body dies,

80
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.730
then Oh,
eventually the body begins to decay.

81
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.900
It decomposes turns into molecules which get absorbed into the soil or what have

82
00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:35.090
you.
This may take years or decades or even centuries,
but you know,

83
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.040
my body no longer exists after death of my body.

84
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.970
And so how could I survive the death of my body if for somebody,

85
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.990
for me to survive the death of my body,

86
00:05:47.991 --> 00:05:50.860
there's gotta be somebody who's me and it'd be me,

87
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.770
requires to be in the same body.
My body would have to still be around,

88
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.160
but it's not.
That's it looks like at first glance,

89
00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:03.161
but at second glance we see that there's at least a possibility of a logical

90
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:08.150
possibility of surviving the death of my body.

91
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.310
All it takes is for my body to be put back together.

92
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.730
<v 1>Okay?</v>

93
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.770
<v 0>Bodily resurrection.</v>

94
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

95
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.220
<v 0>No,
I'm not going to hear,</v>

96
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.460
pursue the question of do we believe bodily resurrection occurs or will occur?

97
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.950
I'll note that there had been religious traditions that have taught and believed

98
00:06:31.951 --> 00:06:33.840
in this possibility.
In particular,

99
00:06:33.841 --> 00:06:38.841
it's probably worth mentioning that early Christians believed in something like

100
00:06:39.421 --> 00:06:44.421
the body theory of personal identity and believed in bodily resurrection.

101
00:06:44.611 --> 00:06:46.680
That would happen on Judgment Day.

102
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.720
We can certainly understand the possibility that God would perform a miracle,

103
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.780
put the molecules back together to return the body back on same body,

104
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.150
same person,
come judgment day

105
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.750
<v 1>that</v>

106
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.490
<v 0>the possibility,</v>

107
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.840
so it's at least worth emphasizing the fact that even if we don't believe in

108
00:07:09.841 --> 00:07:10.680
souls,

109
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.980
we could still believe in the possibility of surviving one's death,

110
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.590
the death of one's body.
If we're willing to believe in bodily resurrection,

111
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.713
<v 1>well,</v>

112
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.270
<v 0>that's how it looks.
Now let's take a harder look.</v>

113
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.870
Talking that way assumes that when you put the body back together,

114
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:39.590
when God puts the body back together on Judgment Day,

115
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.920
that that's still my body.

116
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.660
Is that right?

117
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.020
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

118
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.570
<v 0>I'm inclined to think it is.
Right?</v>

119
00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:54.490
If God gathers up all the various molecules that had composed my body,

120
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.220
reassembles them in the right order,
put putting in,
you know,

121
00:07:57.221 --> 00:08:01.450
this calcium molecule next to that hydrogen molecule and so forth and so on,

122
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.820
reassembles them in the right way.
Obviously,

123
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:07.930
if what he makes out of my body's molecules as a Cadillac,

124
00:08:07.931 --> 00:08:11.290
then that's not my body.
But if he puts them together in the right way,

125
00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:13.060
that seems like it should be my body.

126
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.230
So here's an analogy to give you a sense of what's going on.

127
00:08:17.231 --> 00:08:22.231
Suppose I take my watch to the jeweler because it stopped working

128
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.800
and in order to clean it and fix it,
repair it.

129
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.400
What the jeweler does is he takes it apart and he,
you know,

130
00:08:30.401 --> 00:08:35.260
he takes no rust off of the gears.
If there are still gears and watches,

131
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.850
imagine it's an old stopwatch and,
and he,

132
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.020
he cleans all the pieces and buffs them and policies them and then then

133
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.990
reassembles the whole thing in a week later I come back and ask,

134
00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:48.250
where's my watch and end?
He hands it to me.
Well all well and good.

135
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:53.320
Now imagine some metaphysicians saying,
wait a minute,
buster,
not so quick.

136
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.940
That's not my,
admittedly,

137
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
it's composed of all the very same pieces that made up my watch.

138
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.320
Admittedly,

139
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.940
all of these pieces are in the very same order as my watch,

140
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.140
but still that's not my watch.
On the contrary,

141
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.660
it seems to me the right thing to say about that example is no,

142
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.570
that is my watch.

143
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:24.090
My watch was disassembled for a period of time.

144
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:29.010
Perhaps we should say my watch didn't exist during that period of time,

145
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.130
but it got put back together.
Now that's my watch.

146
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.100
If that's the right thing to say about the watch and it does seem to me to be

147
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:39.690
the right thing to say about the watch,

148
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.380
then God could presumably do the same thing on Judgment Day.

149
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.680
He could take our molecules which had been scattered,

150
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.510
put them back together and say,
Huh,
that's your body.

151
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:56.580
And if the body theory of personal identity is right,
well that would be me.

152
00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.460
So it seems to me,

153
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.450
but there's a different example that we have to worry about as well,

154
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:08.630
which argues against this proposal that that the body could decompose and then

155
00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:10.890
be recomposed.

156
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.630
This is an example that's due to Peter Vaughan in Waukegan.

157
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.240
He's a contemporary metaphysician teachers at Notre Dame.

158
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:24.050
Suppose that my son builds a tower out of a wooden blocks.

159
00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.380
You have a set of wooden blocks at home.

160
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.290
Suppose that he builds some elaborate tower.

161
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.160
It's very impressive.
And he says,

162
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:39.650
please show it to mom when she comes home and he goes to bed.
Ah,

163
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.860
very good.
I'm cleaning up the house after he goes to bed and oops,

164
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.720
I knock over the tower.
Oh my God,

165
00:10:49.721 --> 00:10:52.810
he's gotta to be so angry.
He,
you know,
I promised him I'd be careful.

166
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.280
So what I do is I take the blocks and I put them back together building a tower

167
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.670
in the very same shape and the very same structure,

168
00:11:03.671 --> 00:11:07.450
the very same order as the tower that my son had built.

169
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:13.270
And in fact,
I'm so careful.
Perhaps the blocks are numbered.

170
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.360
I'm so careful that every block is in exactly the same position as in the case

171
00:11:19.181 --> 00:11:22.040
where my son built it.
All right?
I,

172
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.440
I rebuild or build this tower and,
and my wife comes home and he said,
and I say,

173
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.300
look what our son built.

174
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:30.070
<v 1>Okay,</v>

175
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:34.940
<v 0>this is the tower that our son built.
Eh,</v>

176
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.690
that doesn't sound right.

177
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.400
That's not the tower that our son Bill,

178
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.960
that's a tower that I built that this is a duplicate tower.

179
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.230
Sure.
If my son were to wake up and I didn't tell him,

180
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.310
he wouldn't know that it was a duplicate,

181
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.360
but when you take a wooden block tower apart

182
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.890
and then put the pieces back together piece for Pitt piece,

183
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.140
duplicate,
duplicate,

184
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:13.280
you don't have the very same tower that you started out with.

185
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.610
That's what von in Waukegan says and,

186
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.730
and I gotta admit sounds right to me,

187
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.210
if I would have pointed at tower and say are built that,

188
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:29.310
I'd be saying something false.
That's the very same tower that Ari built.
No,

189
00:12:29.311 --> 00:12:30.510
I'd be saying something false.

190
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.960
Vaughn in Waukegan concludes if you have an object and you take it apart and

191
00:12:40.321 --> 00:12:42.600
then put it all back together again,

192
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:47.760
you don't have the very same object that you started out with.

193
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:53.180
So even if Judgment Day were to come and God would reassemble the molecules and

194
00:12:53.551 --> 00:12:55.140
resurrect the body,

195
00:12:55.290 --> 00:13:00.290
it's not the very same body that you started out with.

196
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:05.910
And if Harry and having the very same body is the key to personal identity,

197
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:11.340
it's not the same person come judgment day.

198
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.520
We've got a duplicate of the but we don't have me.

199
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.360
That's what von and wagon would say if that's the way bodily resurrection would

200
00:13:21.361 --> 00:13:22.194
work.

201
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.500
Now I don't know if the theology aside,

202
00:13:28.501 --> 00:13:30.780
I don't know what to say about the metaphysical questions.

203
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.830
When I think about the tower case,

204
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.640
I do find myself inclined to say with Vaughn in Waukegan,

205
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.700
that's not the tower my son built,

206
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.880
but when I think about the watch case,

207
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.540
I find myself saying that is the very same watch.

208
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.130
Now all I can do is invite you to think about these two cases

209
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.250
and ask yourself,
well,
what should we say here?

210
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:05.320
Of course for those people who think it really is the same tower,
no problem.

211
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.790
Then we say the watch and the tower,
in both cases it's the very same object.

212
00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:13.750
When it's reassembled,
reassemble the body.
That'll be the very same body as well.

213
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.580
For those people who say,
yeah,

214
00:14:15.581 --> 00:14:19.600
Yvonne in Walden was right about the tower and the same thing would be true

215
00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:23.500
about the watch.
The reassembled watch isn't the very same watch.

216
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.900
Then we have to say bodily resurrection would not be the very same body,

217
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.320
so that wouldn't be me waking up on Judgment Day.

218
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:39.800
The alternative is to try to find some relevant difference between the watch

219
00:14:39.801 --> 00:14:42.140
case and the tower case.

220
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.130
Something that allows us to say that,
well,

221
00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.260
when you reassemble the watch,

222
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.710
it is the same watch when you reassemble tower,

223
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:53.330
it's not the same tower.

224
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.530
Here's the explanation of why those two things work differently in the

225
00:14:57.531 --> 00:15:02.510
reassembly cases and then of course we'd have to further investigate whether

226
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.160
when you reassemble a body,

227
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:07.790
is it more like the watch case or is it more like the tower case?

228
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.220
I just have to confess,

229
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:15.050
I don't know what the best thing to say about these cases is.

230
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.490
I find myself inclined to think reassembled,
watch,
same watch,

231
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.900
reassembled tower,
not same tower.
Maybe there's a difference there.

232
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:27.830
I don't have a good theory as to what the difference is since I don't have a

233
00:15:27.831 --> 00:15:29.390
good theory as to what the difference is.

234
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.890
I'm not in a good position to decide whether a reassembled body would be the

235
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:36.890
same body or different body.
I don't know.

236
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:43.060
So there's metaphysical work to be done here by anybody who's at least

237
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:48.680
interested in getting this theory of identity worked out properly.

238
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:53.360
Still at least the possibility that we could work this out,
it's still there.

239
00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:58.361
So I suppose there's still at least the possibility that bodily resurrection

240
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:04.100
would be coherent in such a way that would still be the same body.

241
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:09.080
So if we accept the body theory,
could there be debt,

242
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.230
a life after death,
could there be survival of the death of my body?

243
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:17.490
Seems like as far as I can tell,
it's still a possibility or the other.

244
00:16:17.491 --> 00:16:21.710
Some puzzles here that I don't know how to see my way through.
Mind you,

245
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.600
that's not that.

246
00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:28.220
Not to say that I myself do believe that there will be a judgment day and on

247
00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:31.220
that day God will reassemble the bodies,

248
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.410
but it at least seems like a coherent possibility

249
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:39.663
<v 1>that's</v>

250
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.860
<v 0>refine the body view.</v>

251
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.910
I've been suggesting that the key here,

252
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.060
the idea of whether it's the same person nod is whether it's the same body,

253
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.180
but of course as we know and thinking about familiar objects,

254
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:58.180
we don't need to have every single piece of an object of,
of,

255
00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.800
of an entity stay the same to have the same thing.

256
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:05.600
So I think I previously talked about the steering wheel and my car.

257
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:10.370
Every time I drive the steering wheel and my car,
I rubbed off some Adams.

258
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.590
But that's okay.
It's still the very same physical object.

259
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.740
The steering wheel is having the same steering wheels compatible with changing

260
00:17:18.951 --> 00:17:20.600
of a few pieces.

261
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:27.370
Same thing was true for bodies,
right?
You get sun burned,

262
00:17:27.371 --> 00:17:32.300
your skin peels,
you've lost some atoms in your body.
It doesn't really matter.

263
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.190
It's still the very same body.

264
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.430
So the body is the key to personal identity.

265
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.960
We don't have to worry about the fact that we're constantly gaining and losing

266
00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:43.490
Adams.
Yes.
Question.

267
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.740
<v 1>What about the lot of way I really heavy broken tonight.</v>

268
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.850
<v 0>People treat them different and they feel different about that.</v>

269
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:57.480
The question was what about somebody who loses a huge amount of weight?

270
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:02.850
They feel different.
People treat them different.
What about that case?
Well,

271
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.880
I think if we'd be doing metaphysics as opposed to sort of psychology psycho

272
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.870
psychologically we understand why losing weight might make a real difference to

273
00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:17.520
how you feel about yourself.
And we might even say loosely,

274
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.220
it's as though she's a whole new person.

275
00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:21.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

276
00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.170
<v 0>But strictly speaking,</v>

277
00:18:23.171 --> 00:18:28.150
we don't think it is literally a whole new person.

278
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:33.360
It's not as though we say poor Linda died when she entered the spa or you know,

279
00:18:33.941 --> 00:18:37.570
a week into the spa when she dropped those 50 pounds.

280
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:43.000
You know somebody else who remembers all of Linda's childhood.
You know some,

281
00:18:43.001 --> 00:18:46.270
some imitator came along.
We don't say different person.

282
00:18:46.271 --> 00:18:49.270
We say saint person lost a lot of weight.

283
00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.740
Now that's not a problem for the body view because on the body view the question

284
00:18:53.741 --> 00:18:58.720
is is it the same body and what we want to say of course is look just like it's

285
00:18:58.721 --> 00:19:03.090
still your body.
Even if you break your arm,
it's just,

286
00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:08.091
it's even though it's still your body after you've eaten a dinner and so now

287
00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.730
some molecules have been absorbed into your body that weren't there before.

288
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.920
It's still your body.
After you lose some molecules,

289
00:19:17.921 --> 00:19:19.450
even a lot of molecules,

290
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:25.710
there can be changes in your body that are compatible with it still being the

291
00:19:28.541 --> 00:19:29.920
same body.

292
00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:35.550
Now we might worry about the which changes are are all the changes.

293
00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.210
You know it's certainly not as though any change will do.

294
00:19:40.211 --> 00:19:45.190
I mean suppose what happens is Linda goes to bed and what we do in the middle of

295
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:49.510
the night is we will take away that body and put some new body there.

296
00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.930
Well that you know,
100% change.
That's clearly too much

297
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.430
change of some small percentage from eating.

298
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:05.040
Not a problem change from though somewhat larger percentage of losing a fair bit

299
00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:06.900
of weight doesn't seem to be a problem.

300
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:12.620
So which changes in bodies make four a different body and which changes in body

301
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:19.650
make for the same body and in particular,

302
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.670
how should we run that if we're thinking about the body as the key to personal

303
00:20:23.671 --> 00:20:28.020
identity,
I think if we have that question in front of our minds,

304
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.770
we're going to want to say not all parts of the body are equally important.

305
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.120
You'll lose a fair bit of weight,
some fat from your gut,
not a problem.

306
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:43.920
Here's one of my favorite examples in,
in,
you know,
the star wars movies.
Uh,

307
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.240
Darth Vader whips out his light saber and,

308
00:20:47.241 --> 00:20:51.940
and slashes off the uh,
uh,
the,
the,

309
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.830
the hand of Luke Skywalker,
right?
Luke,
I am your father.

310
00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.330
And then the hand goes right.
The very next scene,

311
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.010
there's always amaze me the very next scene.
Luke's got a,
an artificial hand.

312
00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:10.990
It's been attached to his body and I never even mentioned it again.
No one says,

313
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.370
Oh,
poor Luke,

314
00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:16.870
he died when Darth Vader cut off the hand.

315
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:22.890
It seems pretty clear that not all parts of the body matter.

316
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:27.070
You can lose a hand and still survive.

317
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.400
Same body except now without a hand.

318
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:36.750
Suppose Darth Vader had aimed a little higher and cut off Luke's entire arm.

319
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.480
Still be Luke.
Still be Luke's body.

320
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.150
Suppose even worse,

321
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.200
Darth Vader slices off both arms and both legs.

322
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.480
Still be Luke.

323
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:53.080
Still be Luke's body though now without arms and legs.

324
00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.013
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

325
00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:01.320
<v 0>What part of the body,
if any,
is essential?
Well,
here's a proposal.</v>

326
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.900
It seems to me we'd say something rather different if what happened was that

327
00:22:06.901 --> 00:22:10.140
what got destroyed was Luke's brain.

328
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.760
Suppose that Darth Vader users,
the force,
the dark side of the forest.

329
00:22:14.761 --> 00:22:19.761
Of course Darth Vader uses the dark side of the force to to destroy,

330
00:22:20.011 --> 00:22:24.450
to turn into pea soup.
Luke Skywalker's brain.

331
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.590
Now I think we might well want to say,
well look no more Luke,

332
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.460
and if what happens is they they,
they drag out some,

333
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.190
some replacement brain,

334
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.280
still not Luke.

335
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:43.910
At least that's a possible version of the body view.

336
00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.850
According to this version which I take to be the most promising,

337
00:22:47.851 --> 00:22:50.370
the the best version of the body view.

338
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.270
The crucial question in thinking about personal identities,

339
00:22:54.271 --> 00:22:57.660
whether it's the same body but not all parts of the body matter.
Equally,

340
00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:02.520
the most important part of the body is the brain.
Well,

341
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.600
why the brain?

342
00:23:03.601 --> 00:23:08.490
No surprise there because of course the brain is the part we now know.

343
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:13.380
The brain is the part of the body that is the house of your personal identity,

344
00:23:13.381 --> 00:23:17.550
your personality,
your your,
your,
your,
your beliefs,
your desires,

345
00:23:17.551 --> 00:23:21.030
your fears,
your ambitions,
your goals,
your memories.

346
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:26.180
That's all housed in the brain and so that's the part of the brain.

347
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.550
That's the key part of the body for the purpose of personal identity.

348
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:35.361
That's,

349
00:23:35.361 --> 00:23:40.361
that's what I'm inclined to think is the best version of the body view.

350
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.430
<v 1>[inaudible] with me,
we find</v>

351
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.690
<v 0>examples of this thought that the brain is the key in,</v>

352
00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:56.000
in odd places.
So let me actually share one with you.

353
00:23:56.001 --> 00:24:01.001
This was something from the Internet that my brother sent to me some years ago.

354
00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:04.820
It,
it purports to be from a transcript,

355
00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:09.230
from an actual trial in which all lawyers cross examining,
uh,

356
00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:12.970
the doctor.
Uh,
and anyway,
we'll just tall you'll,
you'll see.
I don't,

357
00:24:12.971 --> 00:24:14.480
I don't actually know whether it's true or not,

358
00:24:14.481 --> 00:24:18.950
whether it's just somebody made it up,
but the parts to be true.
Question,

359
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.310
doctor,
before you performed the autopsy,

360
00:24:22.311 --> 00:24:27.080
did you check for a pulse answer?
No question.

361
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.000
Did you check for blood pressure?
Answer,
no question.

362
00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:36.800
Did you check for breathing?
Answer,
no question.

363
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.920
So then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy.

364
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.240
Answer,
no question.

365
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.600
How can you be so sure doctor answer because his brain was sitting on my desk in

366
00:24:55.611 --> 00:24:58.190
a jar.
Question,

367
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.550
but could the patient has still been alive?

368
00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:06.640
Nevertheless answer it is possible that he could have been alive and practicing

369
00:25:07.971 --> 00:25:09.260
law somewhere.

370
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:16.670
Now the point that the reason this is funny,
other than of course then you know,

371
00:25:16.671 --> 00:25:20.150
the,
the obvious moral,
which is the lawyers are morons,
uh,

372
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.580
is that of course.
And why is it so click?

373
00:25:24.581 --> 00:25:28.700
The lawyers got to be a more on because of course we think,
yeah,
lose a hand.

374
00:25:28.701 --> 00:25:32.300
The guy could still be alive,
lose an arm,
lose a leg,

375
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:36.020
lose the brain.
He's not alive.

376
00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.430
So again,
this is,
you know,
it's hard to kind of philosophical proof,

377
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:45.290
but it shows that we're drawn to the thought that the key part of the body is

378
00:25:45.291 --> 00:25:48.830
the brain.
Think about what that implication,

379
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.060
the implication of holding that view.

380
00:25:50.061 --> 00:25:53.060
Suppose we adopt that version of the body view.

381
00:25:55.630 --> 00:26:00.340
If I get a liver transplant,
so,
so here I am.

382
00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:03.110
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

383
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:08.110
<v 0>and and we take out my liver and we put Jones his liver inside.</v>

384
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:12.710
I've gotten a liver transplant.
It's still me.

385
00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:18.550
Suppose we rip out my heart and put Jones his heart in here.

386
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.870
I've gotten a heart transplant.
It's still me.

387
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:28.940
Suppose we rip up my lungs and put in Jones.

388
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:33.410
As long as I've gotten a long transplant,

389
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:37.730
it's still me.
Suppose we rip out my grain,

390
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:43.250
put in Jones his brain.
Have I gotten a brain?

391
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:46.043
No.

392
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:52.220
What's happened is that Jones has gotten a body transplant or as we might put

393
00:26:55.861 --> 00:26:58.590
it,
a torso transplant.

394
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.990
If we accept this version of the body theory,

395
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:09.770
we say the crucial part of the body for personal identity is not sameness of

396
00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:12.390
torso.

397
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.370
The crucial part of the body is sameness of brain,

398
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:22.020
just like follow the soul was the answer.

399
00:27:22.021 --> 00:27:24.510
If we believed in the sole theory of personal identity,

400
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:29.040
if we believe in the brain version of the body,

401
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.200
theory of personal identity,

402
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.550
same person or not follow the brain,

403
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:41.010
same brain,
same person,
different brain,

404
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:45.990
different person.
As I've now been saying several times,

405
00:27:45.991 --> 00:27:48.120
I think that's the best version of the body view.

406
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.450
Although not all body theorists believe that.

407
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.200
As you know from reading your Perry,

408
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:58.860
the assigned reading his dialogue on personal identity and in mortality,

409
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.140
the heroine of that story.

410
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:06.470
Gertrude Gertrude actually thinks stick key part of the body is the torso.

411
00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:10.470
Follow the torso,
follow the person.

412
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:16.620
That's what she thinks I'm inclined to say no in,
in,
in those moods.

413
00:28:16.621 --> 00:28:21.540
When I accept the body theory,
I'm inclined to think no.
Follow the brain.

414
00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:28.190
Gertrude who presumably say you get a brain transplant,

415
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:32.120
you got a brain transplant because it's the same torso.

416
00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.650
I want to say as a fan of the brain theory,

417
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:38.900
you got a brain transplant.

418
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.590
What's really happened is somebody else has gotten a torso transplant.

419
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:48.140
Follow the brain.
How much of the brain do we need?

420
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.790
All of the brain.
Well,

421
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.970
just like we didn't have to follow the parts of the body that are essential for

422
00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.200
housing.

423
00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:01.850
The personality we might ask ourselves,

424
00:29:01.851 --> 00:29:06.470
do we need all of the brain to house the personality?

425
00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:09.243
<v 1>Okay.</v>

426
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:14.290
<v 0>Research suggests that there's a fair bit of redundancy in the brain.</v>

427
00:29:14.291 --> 00:29:19.291
You can lose portions of the brain and still have a perfectly functioning p

428
00:29:21.641 --> 00:29:23.680
functioning person.

429
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:26.023
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

430
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:31.340
<v 0>Some of you may know that there have been experiments in which for one reason or</v>

431
00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:32.130
the other,

432
00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:37.130
the two halves of the brain had been separated and you often end up there with

433
00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:41.470
sort of,
well,

434
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:46.471
something closer to two persons being housed within one skull because they can

435
00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:49.210
often still communicate in various ways.

436
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:53.560
We don't quite get that that I gathered the best research suggests we don't

437
00:29:53.561 --> 00:29:56.800
really have complete redundancy with hemispheres,

438
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.600
but suppose that we did.

439
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:04.140
Let's be science fictiony suppose that as kind of backup security.

440
00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:09.871
What evolution has done is produced so much redundancy in the brain that either

441
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:15.880
half of the brain would suffice.
All right,

442
00:30:15.881 --> 00:30:19.300
so think about our brain transplant example.
So,

443
00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.890
so there's an accident with Jones and Smith Jones.

444
00:30:23.891 --> 00:30:28.360
His
torso gets destroyed,

445
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.280
his brain is fine.

446
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:36.280
Smiths brain has gotten destroyed.
His Torso is fine.

447
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:41.590
We Take Jones,
his brain,
we put it in Smith's torso,

448
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.030
we hook up all the wires as it were.
The thing wakes up.

449
00:30:46.031 --> 00:30:49.210
Who is that Jones?
His brain.

450
00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.490
Smith's torso follow the brain.

451
00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:56.410
That's Jones that woke up version too.

452
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.780
Horrible Accident Jones.

453
00:30:58.781 --> 00:31:03.781
His torso has been destroyed and the left half of his brain has been destroyed,

454
00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:07.330
but the right half of his brain is still there.

455
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:11.980
Smiths Torso is fine,

456
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.170
but his entire brain has been destroyed.

457
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:17.950
We take the right half of Joneses,
brain,

458
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:21.310
put it into Smith's torso,

459
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:25.690
hook up all the wires the right way.
The thing wakes up.

460
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.710
Who is it?

461
00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:32.610
It's Jones follow the brain and more particularly follow however much of the

462
00:31:35.621 --> 00:31:40.621
brain it takes to have a enough of the brain there to still give you the

463
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:48.010
memories,
beliefs,
desires,
and so forth and so on.
If it were true,

464
00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:52.630
probably isn't true,
but if it were true that half the brain was enough,

465
00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.950
then half the brain would be enough.
That would be Jones.
That woke up question.

466
00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:05.650
Great.
The question was I on this day,

467
00:32:05.651 --> 00:32:08.920
what do we say about the case where we take the two halves of Jones,

468
00:32:08.921 --> 00:32:13.390
his brain split them,
put them in two different torsos they bake.

469
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.510
They both wake up without both be Joe.
Would they both be Jones?

470
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.730
That's a wonderful question.

471
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:23.560
It's a wonderful case to think about an indeed.
I am going to come back to it,

472
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:26.350
but I just want to bracket it for the time being.

473
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:32.500
But to great question is to keep in mind as you think about the plausibility of

474
00:32:32.501 --> 00:32:36.250
the,
of the,
of the body theory,
right?

475
00:32:36.251 --> 00:32:41.251
So I'm inclined to think that the best version of the body theory has to do with

476
00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:43.430
following the brain.

477
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:45.523
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

478
00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.960
<v 0>So one thing that,
a physical list who does not believe in souls,</v>

479
00:32:49.961 --> 00:32:54.250
one thing that a physicalist could say is what's the key to personal identity?

480
00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:56.590
The body.
Sameness.
A body.

481
00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:58.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

482
00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:03.490
<v 0>Um,
and then I'm inclined to think the best version of the body view is the brain</v>

483
00:33:03.491 --> 00:33:08.200
view.
So that's something that a physicalist can say.

484
00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.660
And for that matter,
it's something that is soul.

485
00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:13.540
Somebody who believes in souls could say as well,

486
00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:17.080
even though there are souls that may not be the key to personal data they may be

487
00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.300
sameness of is the key to personal identity.

488
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:26.420
That's something that a physical list or doulas can say,
but,

489
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.660
and this is not up to make good on a promissory note I offered earlier.

490
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:34.780
It's not the only view available to physical lists or for that matter dualist

491
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.730
<v 1>yeah.</v>

492
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.470
<v 0>Even if there are no souls,</v>

493
00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:44.770
we don't have to say that the key to personal identity is the sameness of the

494
00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:46.514
body.

495
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:52.300
We could instead say the key to personal identity is the sameness of the

496
00:33:54.621 --> 00:33:56.000
personality.

497
00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

498
00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.250
<v 0>After all,
go back to the,
the,</v>

499
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:05.080
the Lockian worries about the sole theory of personal identity.

500
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:10.590
It's in very hard to believe that it isn't the same person when the memories and

501
00:34:13.301 --> 00:34:18.301
beliefs and desires and goals and ambitions and fears are all the same.

502
00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.100
Even if a soul is constantly changing,

503
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.800
it seems as though we wanted to say same person.

504
00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:27.130
Why roughly speaking cause at the same personality

505
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.430
and with the body view.

506
00:34:30.431 --> 00:34:35.230
When I started arguing a few moments ago that the best version of the body view

507
00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:39.850
was the brain view.
Why did that seem plausible?

508
00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:43.930
Why didn't we say that Luke died when he lost his wrist?

509
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:49.230
Because the brain after all was the part of the body that houses the personality

510
00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.470
and enough of the brain was good enough.
I said,

511
00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.730
what counts as good enough on enough to keep the personality?

512
00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:02.080
Well,
if what we think is really important here is the personality.

513
00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:07.260
Why don't we just say the key to personal identity is the personality.

514
00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:14.820
Let's just say it's me provided that there's somebody who's got the same set of

515
00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.680
beliefs,
desires,
goals,

516
00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:27.400
memories,
ambitions,
fears,

517
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.210
take to coin a word,
the same personality.

518
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.950
So the secret to personal identity.

519
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.700
I'm this new proposal isn't sameness of body.

520
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.350
It's sameness of personality.

521
00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:58.300
Now it's important to bear in mind that this view is perfectly compatible with

522
00:35:59.361 --> 00:36:02.570
being a physical list after all.

523
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:07.430
We're not saying that in order to have personalities,

524
00:36:07.431 --> 00:36:12.431
you need to have something nonphysical as physical as we can still say that the

525
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:20.890
basis of personality is that there are bodies that are functioning in certain

526
00:36:21.231 --> 00:36:22.064
ways.

527
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:23.800
<v 1>Okay?</v>

528
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.180
<v 0>But for all that,</v>

529
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.600
the key to the same person could have to do with the personality rather than the

530
00:36:31.301 --> 00:36:34.390
sameness of bodies.
Of course.

531
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:39.600
Normally the way you get the same personality is by having the same body.

532
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

533
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:46.370
<v 0>Still,
if we ask what's doing the metaphysical work here,</v>

534
00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:50.330
what's the key to being the same person?

535
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:56.420
We can say same as the body gave us the same personality,

536
00:36:56.421 --> 00:37:01.421
but it was sameness of personality that made it be the very same person.

537
00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:10.050
Could there be some way to get sameness of personality while not having sameness

538
00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:12.220
of body?
Maybe.
I mean,

539
00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.460
suppose that we had some disease.

540
00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:19.390
The doctor tells me the horrible news that I've got to have some,
some,
some,

541
00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:23.260
some disease.
It's going to eventually turn my brain and to pea soup.

542
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.050
But luckily just before it does it,

543
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:31.200
they can take all of my personality and put it into an artificial replacement

544
00:37:31.991 --> 00:37:35.500
brain.
So there'll be this,
just like you have artificial hearts,

545
00:37:35.501 --> 00:37:38.140
artificial livers are gonna have artificial brains,
which,

546
00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:42.820
which will get imprinted with the same personality,
same memory,

547
00:37:42.821 --> 00:37:46.150
same beliefs,
same desires,
same fears,
same goals.

548
00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:50.200
We obviously can't do that.
This is a science fiction story,

549
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:55.120
but at least it allows you to see how the body and the personality could come

550
00:37:55.121 --> 00:37:55.954
apart.

551
00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.960
And so we could have same personality without literally the same brain if

552
00:38:01.211 --> 00:38:05.050
personalities,
the key to personally the entity that would still be me.

553
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.880
Hold off again for a few minutes at least on the question.

554
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:13.060
So what should we believe are the body view,
the personality view?

555
00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.840
Let's try to refine the personality theory.

556
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.861
So again,

557
00:38:18.861 --> 00:38:23.861
the point I was just emphasizing was even if we accept the personality theory,

558
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.920
this doesn't threaten our being physical lists.

559
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:32.390
We can still say the reason that we've got the same personality and the normal

560
00:38:32.391 --> 00:38:34.700
cases,
there's some physical explanation of where the person,

561
00:38:34.701 --> 00:38:37.450
what houses the personality.
But for all of that,

562
00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.830
the key to personal identity is same personality.

563
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:43.301
Notice by the,

564
00:38:43.301 --> 00:38:48.301
by that somebody who believes in souls could also accept the personality theory

565
00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:53.410
of personal identity.
Locke believed in souls.

566
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:58.960
He just didn't think they were the key to personal identity.
So you might think,

567
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:03.760
oh no,
the physical list is wrong.
When the physicalist says that personality,

568
00:39:03.761 --> 00:39:08.350
memory,
belief,
consciousness,
what have you is housed or based in the body.

569
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:12.490
It's based in an immaterial soul.
Dualis could say that.

570
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:14.710
And yet for all of that,

571
00:39:14.711 --> 00:39:19.711
the dualist could consistently say still same soul is not the key to personal

572
00:39:22.331 --> 00:39:26.620
identity.
Same personalities.
The key to personal identity.

573
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:31.090
If God replaces my soul every 10 minutes,

574
00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:35.740
as long as he does in such a way as to imprint the very same personality on the

575
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:40.420
soul,
it doesn't matter any more than it didn't matter whether or not put my body

576
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:41.500
parts were changing.

577
00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:46.830
So the personality theory of personal identity can be accepted by physical lists

578
00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:52.540
and it can be accepted by dualists.

579
00:39:57.070 --> 00:40:00.190
So just to sort of keep score right now,

580
00:40:00.191 --> 00:40:04.600
we've got three basic theories of personal identity on the table,

581
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:09.940
the sole theory,
key to personal identities,
the same soul,

582
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:12.850
the body theory,
key to personal identities,

583
00:40:12.851 --> 00:40:16.840
the same body where the best version I think is the brain version of the body

584
00:40:16.841 --> 00:40:21.841
theory and the personality theory key to purse be the key to personal identity

585
00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.330
is having the very same personality.

586
00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:33.070
Well again,
we gotta be careful about refining this.

587
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.440
Just like we all agreed.

588
00:40:35.441 --> 00:40:39.410
I suppose that you can have the very same body,
even though some of the,

589
00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:43.840
the parts come and go,
Adam's get added,
other atoms get knocked off.

590
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.980
We can say,
we'd better say that.

591
00:40:47.981 --> 00:40:52.981
You can have the very same personality even if some of the elements in your

592
00:40:54.611 --> 00:40:58.870
personality change.
After all,

593
00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.970
we define the personality in terms of it being a set of,
of uh,

594
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:07.960
of beliefs and memories and desires and goals and fears and so forth.

595
00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:10.990
But those things are constantly changing.

596
00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:17.420
I have all sorts of memories now that I didn't have when I was 10 I have

597
00:41:18.221 --> 00:41:21.460
memories of getting married.
For example,
I wasn't married when I was 10

598
00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:27.670
so does the personality theorists have to say,
oh,

599
00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:29.290
different personality,

600
00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:34.910
that kid no longer exists.
That person died,

601
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:39.710
got married,
new memories died.
We say that we have very,

602
00:41:39.711 --> 00:41:42.380
very short lives because after all,

603
00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:46.790
right now I've got some memories that I didn't have two hours ago.

604
00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.830
I have some memories I didn't have 20 minutes ago.

605
00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:56.890
If every time you got a new memory,

606
00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:02.040
you had a new personality and the personality theory said having the very same

607
00:42:03.881 --> 00:42:08.881
personality was the key to survival that none of us survive more than a few

608
00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:10.323
seconds.

609
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:11.503
<v 1>Well,</v>

610
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:16.790
<v 0>the answer presumably is going to be that the best version of the personality</v>

611
00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:21.791
theory doesn't require item for item.

612
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:26.720
Having the very same beliefs,
memories,
desires,
and so forth,

613
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:31.960
but instead requires enough gradual overlap.

614
00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:38.720
Your,
your personality can change and evolve over time.

615
00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:43.370
So here I am as a 10 year old child,
I've got certain desires,

616
00:42:43.371 --> 00:42:47.450
certain memories as the year goes by,
I get some new memories.

617
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:51.920
I guess some of my loose,
some of my goals.
I know longer.
When I was 10 I,

618
00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:55.100
when I grew up,
I wanted to be a trash collector.

619
00:42:55.101 --> 00:42:56.780
That was my first chosen profession.

620
00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.320
At some point I gave up that desire.

621
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:04.730
I didn't want to be a trash collector anymore.
I want it to be kid you not.

622
00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.640
I wanted to be a logician when I was a teenager.

623
00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:11.180
I wanted to study symbolic logic.
So you know,

624
00:43:11.181 --> 00:43:14.510
I guess at some point I gave that up,
right?
So my memories,

625
00:43:14.511 --> 00:43:16.700
my desires were changing,

626
00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:22.560
but they all changed gradually.
I lost some old memories.

627
00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:24.180
I don't remember everything I knew.

628
00:43:24.181 --> 00:43:28.320
I remembered when I was 10 when I was in 10 I had pretty vivid memories of

629
00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:32.940
kindergarten.
Now I have very sketchy memories of kindergarten.

630
00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.280
Still.
It wasn't abrupt.
It was gradual.

631
00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:42.090
There was this slow evolution of the personality,

632
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:47.070
and so when the personality theorists says the key to personal identity is the

633
00:43:47.071 --> 00:43:48.480
same personality,

634
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:53.930
they don't mean literally the very same set of beliefs and desires.

635
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:59.750
They mean rather the same slowly evolving personality.

636
00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:03.573
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

637
00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:04.820
<v 0>Here's an analogy.</v>

638
00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:10.060
Suppose I had a rope that stretched from that end of the room all the way across

639
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.700
<v 1>to this end of the room.</v>

640
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.180
<v 0>Very same rope.</v>

641
00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:21.740
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

642
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:25.460
<v 0>At that end,
as this end,
what makes up a rope?
Wells,
you know,</v>

643
00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.970
ropes are basically bundles of fibers,

644
00:44:28.971 --> 00:44:32.190
very thin fibers that have been woven together in a certain way.

645
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:38.460
But the interesting thing is the fibers themselves aren't actually all that
long.

646
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:43.850
They might be a couple of inches or at most a foot or so and so no single fiber

647
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:48.630
stretches all the way across the room.

648
00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:53.280
Or even if some fibers did,
most of the fibers don't.

649
00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.190
Does that force us to say,
oh,

650
00:44:56.191 --> 00:44:59.430
so it's not the very same rope at the end as at the beginning?
No,

651
00:44:59.431 --> 00:45:04.410
we don't have to say that at all.
What we want to say is it's the same rope.

652
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:09.270
As long as there's this pattern of overlapping fibers,

653
00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:13.470
certain fibers and,
but most of the fibers that are continuing,

654
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.070
some new fibers get introduced.
They continue for awhile,

655
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:19.230
eventually maybe those fibers and,

656
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.690
but some new fibers have been introduced in the meantime,

657
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:25.320
as long as it's not abrupt.
Right Madison,

658
00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:28.740
take my scissors and cut out a foot in the middle.

659
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.690
Then we'd say there isn't the right kind of pattern of overlap and continuity.

660
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.040
Now we really do have two ropes.
One rope here,
one rope there,

661
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:43.220
but if in contrast there is the right kind of pattern of overlap and continuity,

662
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:44.400
same rope,

663
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:49.380
even though even if no single fiber makes it all the way across,

664
00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:54.960
something analogous needs to be said by the personality theories.
Theorists,

665
00:45:56.670 --> 00:46:01.670
even if I have few or no memories identical to the ones that I had when I was 10

666
00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:06.480
that's okay.

667
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:10.530
We can still say it's the same personality,

668
00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:13.290
the same evolving personality.

669
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:18.410
So long as there's kind of a pattern of overlap and continuity,

670
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:23.820
new memories get added.
Some memories get lost.
New Goals get added.

671
00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:28.470
Some goals get lost,
new beliefs get added,
some beliefs get lost.

672
00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:31.530
There might be few beliefs,
desires,

673
00:46:31.531 --> 00:46:33.870
goals that made it all the way through,

674
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:38.880
but as long as the right kind of overlap and continuity,
same personality.

675
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:44.370
All right,
so what have we got?
Three views sold.

676
00:46:44.371 --> 00:46:46.170
You body view,

677
00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:51.590
personality view three rival theories about the key to personal identity.

678
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:56.220
Now which of these is right?
Well,

679
00:46:56.430 --> 00:47:00.240
I don't myself believe in souls.
It's hardly going to surprise you to learn that.

680
00:47:00.241 --> 00:47:03.660
I don't think the sole theory of personal identity is right.
For me,

681
00:47:03.661 --> 00:47:08.661
the choice boils down to the choice between the body theory,

682
00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:13.140
personal identity and personality theory of personal identity.

683
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:20.400
Of course in real life they go hand in hand in ordinary cases at least same

684
00:47:21.811 --> 00:47:23.790
body,
same personality,

685
00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:27.570
both theories are gone to say it's the very same person and if you believe in

686
00:47:27.571 --> 00:47:30.040
souls,
you're likely to think same soul as well.

687
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:34.360
In ordinary cases you have the same soul st bodies,
same personality,

688
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:35.380
same person.

689
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:41.350
To think about which one of these is the key to personal identity.

690
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:46.620
We need to think about cases may be somewhat fantastical science fictiony in

691
00:47:46.751 --> 00:47:48.100
which they come apart.

692
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:54.390
Cases in which bodies and personalities go their own ways as it were.

693
00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.233
<v 1>Okay,</v>

694
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:58.790
<v 0>so that's what I'm going to do.</v>

695
00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:04.610
I'm going to tell you a story in which

696
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:11.890
your body ends up one place and your personality ends up someplace else.

697
00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:23.350
And I'm going to invite you to think about which of these two resulting end

698
00:48:23.841 --> 00:48:25.850
products is me.

699
00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:29.870
If he could figure out which ones you,

700
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:35.470
that would tell you whether you think the body theory is the right theory or the

701
00:48:36.171 --> 00:48:41.100
personality theories,
the right theory.
Now,

702
00:48:41.101 --> 00:48:43.260
what's going to be our guide?

703
00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:45.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

704
00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:49.510
<v 0>I'm going to rather gruesomely not in real life science fiction story.</v>

705
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:54.750
I'm going to torture one of the two end products.

706
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:57.020
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

707
00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:02.020
<v 0>I'm going to ask you which one do you want to be tortured or to put the point</v>

708
00:49:04.791 --> 00:49:05.840
more properly.

709
00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:10.400
Which one do you want to not be tortured?

710
00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:14.840
Because I'm going to assume I'm going to take it,

711
00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:19.910
that it's important to you that you not be tortured.

712
00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:24.350
So by seeing who you want to keep safe,

713
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:29.510
this will help you see which one you think is you.

714
00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.060
Of course,
I've gotta be sure that you're thinking about this in the right way.

715
00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:40.320
Like some of you are probably good moral individuals and you don't want anybody

716
00:49:40.321 --> 00:49:43.170
to be tortured.
You know?
I said,
Oh,

717
00:49:43.171 --> 00:49:46.980
you know I'm about to torture Linda over there.
They know.
No,
don't torture Linda.

718
00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:52.920
Still,
if I were to say to you,
I'm about to torture you,
you'd say,
no,
no,

719
00:49:52.921 --> 00:49:57.720
don't torture me.
And it'd be some extra little something when you said that,

720
00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:58.410
right?

721
00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:03.410
So I want to invite you to keep that extra little something in mind when we tell

722
00:50:06.121 --> 00:50:08.430
the stories,
which we won't get till till next time.

723
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.250
When we tell the stories next time,
and I say,
okay,

724
00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.350
who do you want to be tortured this person or that person?

725
00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:18.530
The question is from that special egoistic perspective that we're all familiar

726
00:50:19.321 --> 00:50:23.010
with,
which is the one you really care about,

727
00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:28.370
that's going to be our guide to deciding what's the key to personal identity.

728
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:32.580
But to hear the stories got to come back next lecture.
