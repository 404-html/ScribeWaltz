00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.370
Tall stories.

2
00:00:03.371 --> 00:00:08.371
Ivan Ilitch is surprised to discover that he's going to die sort of thing.

3
00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:12.970
He's given lip service to no doubt over the course of his life,

4
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.320
but when he finally gets ill and comes up to the fact of his mortality that his

5
00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:20.020
body is going to sicken and eventually die.

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.310
The fact of his mortality seems to shock him,

7
00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:25.510
seems to surprise him.

8
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.260
We might say on one level he believes that he was mortal.

9
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.250
He's believed it all along,
but at another level,
at some deeper level,

10
00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:38.980
it comes as a surprise to him.
He never really believed it.

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.930
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.930
<v 0>Now I take it that we find Ivan Illich to perfectly believable example.</v>

13
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.230
That is we think it's conceivable that somebody could at some level not really

14
00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:53.770
believe they're going to die,

15
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.670
but I also take it to tall story means to be putting forward more than just the

16
00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:01.900
claim that there couldn't be such a person.
Look how bizarre here is.

17
00:01:01.901 --> 00:01:03.310
Let me describe him for you,

18
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:06.790
but rather suggestions meant to be that Ivan [inaudible],

19
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.210
Ivan Ilitch's case is rather typical.

20
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.330
Maybe all of us are in his situation,

21
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:17.440
or at least most of us are in his situation or at the very least many of us are

22
00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:19.210
in his situation.

23
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.430
That's a stronger claim though I think it's not the sort of claim that's unique

24
00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:28.780
to Tolstoy that all of us or most of us are.

25
00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:33.781
Many of us at the fundamental level don't really believe that we're going to

26
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:34.834
die.

27
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.840
You might ask what kind of evidence could be offered for that offering a

28
00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:43.270
realistic scenario.
Read a realistic description of such a person,

29
00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:47.230
Ivan Illich doesn't,
it doesn't give us any reason to think that most of us are,

30
00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:51.050
many of us are in his situation,
so is there any reason to,

31
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.120
to think that might ask what kind of argument could be offered for a claim like

32
00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:59.470
that?
What we've been looking for,

33
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.500
I take it would be some kind of behavior on our part that calls out for

34
00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:11.641
explanation and the best explanation is to be had.

35
00:02:11.861 --> 00:02:13.060
This is how the argument would go.

36
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.590
The best explanation is to be had by supposing that you know those people who

37
00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:20.740
behave this way.
Let's suppose many of us who behave this way.

38
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.550
The best explanation of that behavior is to be found by claiming that at some

39
00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:26.740
level,
at some fundamental level,

40
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.190
we don't really believe what we claim to believe.

41
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.890
We don't really believe what we give lip,

42
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.960
what we give lip service to take somebody who perhaps suffers from some sort of

43
00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:44.020
compulsion to wash his hands.
We ask him,
are your hands dirty?

44
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.730
He might say,
no,
of course not,
and yet there he is going back to the bathroom,

45
00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:50.740
washing his hands again,

46
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.160
we might say the only way to explain the behavior is to say that at some level

47
00:02:56.981 --> 00:03:01.981
he really does believe his hands are dirty despite the fact that he says they're

48
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:05.980
not well.
I'm the same way.

49
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:10.780
If we could find some behavior on our part that calls out for explanation at the

50
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:14.140
best possible explanation would be that at some level we don't believe we're

51
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:15.730
going to die.
Then we might say,
look,

52
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.220
this gives us some reason to think that we don't really believe we're going to

53
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:22.990
die even though we say we believe it.
As opposed,
for example,

54
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:27.310
that if you really did believe,
you know,
fundamentally,

55
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.280
unconsciously,
you know all the way down,
however we should put it,

56
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.340
if you really did believe you were going to die,

57
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.640
the horror of that would lead you to start screaming and just keep screaming.

58
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.720
Of course,
this example reminds us again of uh,

59
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.560
Ivan Illich who screams and screams and screams almost till his death.
Well,

60
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.980
suppose this was true.
Suppose that if you,
it's supposed to.

61
00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:54.220
We believed we had good reason to believe.

62
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.540
If you really took seriously the thought that you are going to die,

63
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.130
you couldn't stop screaming.

64
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.070
But of course nobody here is screaming from which we can conclude.

65
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.400
None of us really do believe fundamentally deep down that we're going to die.

66
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.430
That would be a good argument if we had good reason to believe the conditional

67
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.290
the if then claim,

68
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.190
if only you really truly believed you were going to die,

69
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.840
you would scream and scream and scream.

70
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.620
That's the crucial premise and of course we don't have any good as far as I can

71
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:33.130
see.
We don't have any good reason to believe that crucial premise

72
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.390
might ask,
oh is there some other behavior,

73
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:39.850
something else that should tip us off,

74
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:43.840
could tip us off as to whether or not re really do or don't believe that we're

75
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:46.900
going to die.
Well,
here's the best that I can do this is,

76
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:50.950
this strikes me is the most plausible contender for an argument like this.

77
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.890
As we know there are people who have brushes with death.
They might be,

78
00:04:56.891 --> 00:05:00.760
for example in an accident and come close to being killed,

79
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.880
but walk away without a scratch or suffer a heart attack and,

80
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.250
and be on the operating table for some number of hours and then,
you know,

81
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.480
thank thanks dog to cardiac surgery.
What have you,
uh,

82
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.510
be resuscitated when people had these near brushes with death,

83
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.860
it's easy to believe that the fact of their mortality is more vivid.

84
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.040
It's more before their mind's eye.

85
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.820
It's something that they now really true do truly do believe.

86
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.140
And the interesting point is many people who have this sort of experience for

87
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:43.060
whom their,
that their mortality has become vivid.
They often say,
you know,

88
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:44.290
I've got to change my life.

89
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:49.291
I need to spend less time at the office and more time with my family telling the

90
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:53.800
people that I love,
that I love them.
Doing the things that are important to me.

91
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.710
Spend less time worrying about getting ahead and making money,

92
00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:59.090
getting the plasma TV,
whatever it is.

93
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.830
<v 1>Okay,</v>

94
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.000
<v 0>let's suppose that this is true of</v>

95
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.650
all of us or at least most of us when we find the fact of our mortality is made

96
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:15.110
Vinod,

97
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.200
when we really truly can see that we're mortal,

98
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.690
then we change our priorities.

99
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.490
Stop giving all the time and attention to trying to get ahead in the rat race

100
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.790
and spend more time with our loved ones doing what's important to us.

101
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.150
Suppose that claim were true.

102
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.920
Well armed with that claim,
we might notice,
well look,

103
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.950
of course most of us do spend a lot of time trying to get ahead,

104
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.520
trying to earn a lot of money.

105
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.600
Don't spend the bulk of our time doing the things that we really,

106
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:53.270
truly think our most think are most important to us.

107
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.750
Don't tell our friends,

108
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.010
don't tell our family members how much they mean to us,
how much we love them.

109
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.480
What are we to make of that fact?
Well,
maybe the explanation is,

110
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:10.481
although we give lip service to the claim that we're mortal at some more

111
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.090
fundamental level,
we don't truly believe it.

112
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.230
The beliefs not vivid for us.
We don't believe it all the way down.

113
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.790
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

114
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.660
<v 0>Well this is an argument,</v>

115
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:24.410
at least it seems to me that has some chance of being right.

116
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.560
I'm not at all convinced that it is right,

117
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.020
but at least it doesn't seem to be the sort of argument.

118
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:33.080
Unlike some of the arguments that are considered last time about,
oh,

119
00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:35.840
nobody believes they're going to die because you can't picture being dead,

120
00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:40.640
what have you.
This argument I think has some possibility of being right.

121
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.120
It does seem as though people who have brushes with death change their behavior

122
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:47.570
in significant ways.

123
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:48.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

124
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.460
<v 0>The fact that we don't behave in those other ways gives us some reason to</v>

125
00:07:53.461 --> 00:07:58.461
believe that perhaps at some level we don't completely or fully or fundamentally

126
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.200
believe we're going to die.

127
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

128
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:07.420
<v 0>I just say,
I'm not sure whether that argument's right,
but at least it's a,</v>

129
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.620
it's an argument worth taking.
Seriously.

130
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.440
Let me turn out to a different claim that sometimes gets made about death.

131
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.350
This is the claim,
not that nobody believes they're going to die.

132
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:20.690
That's the one we've been talking about for the last lecture or so,

133
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.950
but instead the claim that everybody dies alone.

134
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.200
This sounds like one of those deep insights into the nature of death.

135
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.300
It's got that kind of air of profundity about it that that philosophy is thought

136
00:08:35.301 --> 00:08:39.770
to have or aspires to have that you know,
everyone dies alone.

137
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:44.860
This is telling us something deep and important and interesting about the nature

138
00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:46.880
of death.
Now as it happens,

139
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.820
this is what I'm going to be completely dismissive of.

140
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:53.990
I think as far as I can see that the claim,
we all die alone.

141
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.950
However we,

142
00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:00.060
it just ends up being implausible or false.

143
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:06.650
I give it such a hard time each time I teach this class that I'm often tempted

144
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.490
to just drop it from the discussion altogether.
Even though you know,
if you've,

145
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.370
if you've done the reading of the Edwards paper that I signed,

146
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:17.880
you have a series of quotes from Edwards in which people say things like they

147
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:21.930
die alone.
I sometimes come away after after this discussion thinking,

148
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.470
why am I wasting our time?
Nobody really believes this,
that we're all,

149
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:30.471
we all die alone and I was last year I was virtually ready to drop it and then a

150
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:35.490
kid you not that very afternoon,
I came across a quote,

151
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.790
I'll share it with you in a second.
Somebody saying,
oh,
we all die alone.

152
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.730
And then I think it was two days later,

153
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:45.870
a week later I came across another quote of somebody saying,
Oh,
we all die alone.

154
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.980
Maybe think,
Ugh,
I guess this is a common enough thought.

155
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.210
So you're the two quotes.
But I think once you start looking for them,

156
00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:58.920
you find them every place.
It's first one is from the folk singer,

157
00:09:58.921 --> 00:10:01.830
Loudon Wainwright,
the third from his song.

158
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:04.680
Last Man on earth quote,

159
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.810
we learn to live together and then we die alone.

160
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.083
We die alone.

161
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:16.080
Interesting claims seems they say something important about the nature of death.

162
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.580
Here's another quote.
This is from the children's book,

163
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.810
eldest by Christopher Pale.

164
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:27.120
Any the SQL of course to the Bestseller Aragon quote,

165
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:32.180
how terrible said Aragon to die alone separate even from the one who was closest

166
00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:37.110
to you,
the answer given to Aragon,
everyone dies alone.

167
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:38.040
Aragon,

168
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:43.130
whether you are a king on a battlefield or a lowly peasant line in bed among

169
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:46.950
your family,
no one can accompany you into the void.

170
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.210
Everyone dies alone.
All right?
As they say,

171
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.340
this is a common enough view to quotes could,
could certainly produce others.

172
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.670
Everyone dies alone.
The trick,

173
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.160
the question we're going to ask is,

174
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.520
can we find some interpretation of that claim under which first of all,

175
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.160
it ends up being true.
Secondly,

176
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.180
it ends up being unnecessary.

177
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.390
Truth about death.
You know,

178
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:22.470
suppose everyone happens to die on Monday due to some cosmic coincidence.

179
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.450
That might be sort of interesting,

180
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.900
but wouldn't tell us something deep about the nature of death.

181
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.080
If people could just as easily die on Tuesday if it happened to be that

182
00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:37.380
everybody dies in a room by themselves,
that would be interesting.

183
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.880
We might wonder what causes it,

184
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.330
but it wouldn't be some deep insight into the nature of death.

185
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.070
We've got to get a deep insight if it's unnecessary truth about death,

186
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.460
that everyone dies alone,
so it's gotta be true.

187
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.500
It's got to be unnecessary truth and course.

188
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.650
It's got to be an interesting claim.

189
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.430
If when we interpret the claim,
everyone dies alone.

190
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.550
That just ends up being a slightly pretentious way of saying everyone dies.

191
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.550
We might say,
Oh yeah,
that is true and it isn't necessary truth,

192
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.730
but it's not especially surprising.

193
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.240
It's not some deep surprising insight into the nature of death.

194
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.160
We all knew everyone dies.

195
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.310
You take that familiar fat and you wrap it up in the language.

196
00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:23.830
Everyone dies alone.
If that's all you're saying.

197
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:28.240
You're not saying anything interesting.
When people say,
you know,

198
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.590
everyone dies alone.

199
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.910
You're supposed to be gaining some deep insight into the nature of death.

200
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.183
Finally,

201
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:42.870
everyone dies alone is supposed to say something special about death.

202
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:49.530
It better not be that everyone does everything alone because it and whatever the

203
00:12:49.961 --> 00:12:53.450
relevant sense of alone turns out to be.
If everyone does everything alone,

204
00:12:53.451 --> 00:12:54.670
then of course that might be interesting.

205
00:12:54.671 --> 00:12:57.220
It might be very important and insightful,

206
00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.490
but it you're not saying anything especially interesting about death.

207
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.170
When you say everyone dies alone,

208
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.900
if it's also true that everyone eats their lunch alone,

209
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:11.550
so on this is is just as we begin to ask ourselves what could it possibly mean

210
00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:16.330
when people say everyone dies alone,
we're looking for something that's true,

211
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.980
necessary,
interesting,
and if not unique to death,

212
00:13:20.981 --> 00:13:23.710
at least not true of everything.

213
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:29.650
I put these conditions down because of course what I want to suggest is although

214
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.300
the sentence,
everyone dies alone,

215
00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:35.140
the claim that everyone dies alone is one of those things that people say

216
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.870
they're not really thinking very hard about what they mean by it because once

217
00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:45.070
you actually push people to,
to pin them down,

218
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:46.210
what do you mean by it?

219
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.470
You end up with something that's either just not true or not interesting or not

220
00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:52.930
necessary or not particularly unique to death.

221
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.820
Take a possible interpretation.
The most natural,

222
00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.050
straightforward,
literal,
flat footed interpretation.

223
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.760
To say that somebody does something alone means they do it,

224
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.450
not in the presence of others.

225
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:16.270
No.
Somebody who lives by himself goes to sleep.

226
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.020
If there's nobody else in the bedroom,
he's sleeping alone.
Right?

227
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:24.550
I'm that straightforward interpretation and say that everybody dies alone.

228
00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:27.490
What we're saying is that it's true of each one of us,

229
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:33.640
the he or she dies,
not in the presence of others.
That will be,
you know,

230
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.240
if that was true,
it'd be sort of surprising striking.

231
00:14:37.241 --> 00:14:38.830
We might wonder whether it's a necessary truth,

232
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:43.330
but at least it'd be something interesting there.
But of course it's not true.

233
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.780
We all know full well that sometimes people die in the presence of others.

234
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:53.120
We read earlier this semester,
Plato's Fito,

235
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.850
which describes the death scene of Socrates.

236
00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.940
Socrates drinks the hemlock and dies in the presence of his friends and

237
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:07.160
disciples.
Socrates does not die alone,
and of course,

238
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.630
we know that there are many,

239
00:15:08.631 --> 00:15:12.620
many other cases in which people die in the presence of their friends,

240
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:17.300
family loved ones.
It's just not true.
Given that interpretation to say,

241
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.620
we all die alone.
So if that's what the claim means,

242
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:29.140
our challenge is to find some other interpretation of the claim.

243
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.880
All right?
Second possibility.
When people say everyone dies alone,

244
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:39.620
they don't mean to be saying you die,
but not in the presence of others.

245
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.150
They mean to be saying,
rather,

246
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.650
even if there are others around you,

247
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.260
even if there are others with you,

248
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:52.310
dying is something that you're doing alone.

249
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.440
They aren't dying.
Soccer,
Jesus,
friends and disciples are not dying.

250
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.180
He's the only one dying,
and so everyone dies alone in that sense.

251
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.870
Well,
that's an interesting claim.
If it's true,
but it's not true,

252
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:11.950
we can certainly have battlefields in which many people are dying along with

253
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:17.450
others.
There's Jones dying,
but he's not dying alone.

254
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:20.870
There's Smith dying at the same time,
right next to him.

255
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:23.423
<v 1>Okay?</v>

256
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.090
<v 0>If that's what people mean when they say everyone dies alone,</v>

257
00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.600
then that's clearly false as well.
Well,

258
00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.640
I presume that's not what people meant either,

259
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:36.290
but then what was it that they did mean?
Well,
we could do better.
We could say,

260
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:40.460
look,
when when Socrates dies,

261
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:46.180
he's dying alone in the sense that he's doing it by himself.

262
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.120
He's not doing it in cooperation with anybody else in coordination with anybody

263
00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:56.750
else.
I'm the battlefield.
Even if Smith and Jones are both dying,

264
00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.730
it's not like this has some sort of cooperative joint undertaking.

265
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.160
You could be walking down the sidewalk and Linda could be walking down the

266
00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:09.830
sidewalk and you,
even though you're both walking down the sidewalk,

267
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:14.810
you're not walking down the sidewalk together.
In contrast,

268
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:19.370
you can walk down the sidewalk with somebody,
say,
hey,

269
00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:23.000
let's go to the library and you walked down the sidewalk together.

270
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:28.660
Walking is something you can do with others in the sense that it can be a joint

271
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.960
activity,
a joint undertaking.

272
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:39.310
Perhaps the claim then is that dying is not something that can be done in that

273
00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:42.020
way as a joint undertaking.

274
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.860
Even if you're in a room or a battlefield where people are dying at the same

275
00:17:45.861 --> 00:17:47.660
time as you to your left and your right,

276
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:52.930
dying is not and cannot be something that is a joint undertaking.

277
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:55.230
Well,

278
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.770
that might be a proposal about what people mean when they say everybody dies

279
00:17:58.771 --> 00:18:01.770
alone.
And if it is,
all I can say is,
again,

280
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.210
it just seems to be false.
Now,

281
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.103
admittedly,

282
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:12.170
dying as a joint undertaking is far rarer than joy dying alone.

283
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:19.350
But for all that,
we were looking for some deep insight into the nature of death.

284
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.800
Everyone dies alone.
Everyone must die alone.

285
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:28.220
That's only going to be true if dying as a joint undertaking is impossible,

286
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:33.390
but it's not impossible.
You could have,
for example,

287
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.300
some sorta suicide pact.

288
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.240
There had been cases gruesome as they,
uh,

289
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:46.270
maybe in which entire groups of people drink poison together so as to die,

290
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:53.900
not alone,
but die together,
die as part of jointly dying,

291
00:18:53.901 --> 00:18:57.800
dying as a group.
Or You could have

292
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.490
once told in this sort of thing happens,
you know,

293
00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.170
a couple in love who together jump off the cliff,

294
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:11.300
committing suicide together,
dying,

295
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:16.160
not alone,
but with each other as part of a joint undertaking

296
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.650
certainly seems possible.
I take it,
pick cases like this actually do occur.

297
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.640
So if somebody comes along and says,
no,
no,

298
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:29.400
everybody dies alone and dying as part of a joint undertaking is impossible.

299
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.650
They're just saying something false.

300
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.940
These joint undertakings are like,
well,

301
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:40.050
you might think of the analogous to playing chamber music with a,

302
00:19:40.051 --> 00:19:41.520
with a string quartet.

303
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.330
It's something you're doing with others.

304
00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:48.390
It's not just a coincidence that they are doing it.
At the same time,

305
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.300
all these people happen to be playing the violin.
Viola,

306
00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:53.240
what have you next to you?
No,
nope.

307
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.670
We deliberately coordinated with one another.

308
00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:01.730
So as to together produce this music seems possible in the case of string

309
00:20:03.481 --> 00:20:08.481
quartets seems possible in the case of joint suicide pacts as well.

310
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:14.340
Well,
a fan of the claim that we all die alone might come back and say,
well,

311
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.530
you know,
in the case of the string quartet,

312
00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:22.830
although it's true that I am uh,

313
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.620
playing with others,
somebody could take my part,

314
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.450
somebody else could play the second violin part for me.

315
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.470
Whereas in contrast,
when I die,

316
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.080
even if I'm dying with others,

317
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.990
nobody can take my part.

318
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.800
So perhaps that's what the claim is meant to be.
When people say,

319
00:20:47.801 --> 00:20:49.240
everybody dies alone,

320
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.950
nobody can die your death for you.

321
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.870
Nobody can take your part.
Now,

322
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.530
if that's what they mean,
then you know,
small observation,

323
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.010
they didn't express themselves very clearly.
It's,

324
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.850
it seems to me rather a long distance from the thought.

325
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:14.140
Nobody can die for me.
Nobody can take my part to the claim.

326
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.260
Everybody dies alone.
That seems rather misleading,

327
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:21.250
unhelpful way of making your point.
But let's just bracket that complaint.

328
00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.970
Is it true that nobody can take my part?

329
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.660
Certainly people can take my part in the string quartet.

330
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.050
Is it true that nobody can take my part in terms of my death?

331
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.800
Not so clear.
It is true.

332
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.470
I don't know how many of you have read tale of two cities.
Uh,
if not,

333
00:21:41.471 --> 00:21:45.190
I'm about to spoil the plot for you.
Uh,
here's,
you know,

334
00:21:45.191 --> 00:21:48.070
at least a strand of the story.

335
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:53.160
The hero of the story is in love with a woman who Alaskan Alac does not love

336
00:21:54.431 --> 00:21:59.320
him.
She loves another man.
This other man,

337
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.030
alas,

338
00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:05.030
and the lack has been condemned to death during the French revolution.

339
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.160
Now as it happens,
this is a novel.
As it happens,

340
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:14.670
our hero looks rather like the other man and so as the other man is being carted

341
00:22:17.741 --> 00:22:21.010
off to the guillotine to be killed,

342
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.820
our hero takes his place.

343
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:31.480
Hence the famous speech.
Tis a far,
far better thing I do today.

344
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.260
All right.

345
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:37.260
Our Hero sacrifices himself so that the woman he loves can have the man that she

346
00:22:38.411 --> 00:22:43.390
loves.
Well,
for our purposes,
the romances and crucial for our purposes.

347
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:48.450
The crucial point is to see that what seems to be going on there is our hero is

348
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:54.010
taking the place of somebody else who's about to die.

349
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:59.200
Just like somebody can take my place in the string quartet,

350
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.640
it seems that somebody could take my place.
I think he and team

351
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:09.970
in the American civil war,
there was a draft,

352
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
but you could avoid it by hiring somebody to take your place if you are rich

353
00:23:16.481 --> 00:23:20.110
enough.
Oh,
you know,
you're in some battle or leather,

354
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:24.160
your troopers in some battle and people are being killed left and right.
Well,

355
00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:28.540
I suppose it doesn't strike me as an implausible thing to say that if everybody

356
00:23:28.541 --> 00:23:31.540
in the troop got killed and you would have gotten killed had you been there

357
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:34.690
button instead,
the person you hired to take your place gets killed,

358
00:23:34.691 --> 00:23:39.430
then he took your place,
he substituted for you in the death.

359
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.510
So again,
we don't have any clear,

360
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.210
true interpretation of the claim that nobody can take my place,

361
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.550
even with a guard to dying,
well,

362
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:54.620
easy to imagine the fan of this view coming back yet again saying,

363
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:59.810
although it's true that our hero takes the place of the other man on the

364
00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.950
Guillotine,
what ends up happening of course,

365
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.270
is that our hero dies his own death.

366
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:14.290
He doesn't take over the death of the other man.

367
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.950
That death of the other man doesn't take place until 2030 40 whatever it is.

368
00:24:18.951 --> 00:24:19.790
Years later.

369
00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:26.620
Nobody can take my place at my death because of course if they take my place,

370
00:24:29.841 --> 00:24:34.841
they ended up living or going through rather their death,

371
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.190
not my death.

372
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:43.030
My death is something that only I can undergo,

373
00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:48.320
not again,
that's an interesting claim.
If it's true,

374
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.180
at least seems to be an interesting claim.

375
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.870
Seems to say something interesting about death.
Again,

376
00:24:53.871 --> 00:24:58.871
I want to just notice that it's a rather odd thing to try to express that point

377
00:24:59.091 --> 00:25:01.160
in the language.
Everyone dies alone,

378
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:06.590
but just bracket that have we at least found something interesting,
necessary,

379
00:25:06.591 --> 00:25:11.591
unique to death when we say nobody can die my death for me,

380
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:16.190
I am the only one who can undergo my death.

381
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:21.550
Each of us must undergo his own death and nobody else's death.

382
00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.810
Nobody else can undergo their death for them.
You know,

383
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.120
you know somebody else's death for them.
Well,

384
00:25:29.121 --> 00:25:34.121
that does seem to be true and it seems to be unnecessary truth,

385
00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.220
but we're not quite done.

386
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:42.250
Is it saying something deep and interesting about the nature of death?

387
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:47.530
Is that something that's fairly unique to the nature of death that nobody can

388
00:25:48.171 --> 00:25:51.860
die my death for me,
actually,

389
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.360
I don't think it is.

390
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:58.970
Consider getting your hair cut at the barber.

391
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:04.210
Now.
Of course,
somebody else can take your slot.
All right.

392
00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.510
There's somebody comes along and says,
oh,

393
00:26:05.511 --> 00:26:07.670
I need to go to a day and I'm going to be late.
You know?

394
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.990
Would you mind having your appointment using your appointment?
No,

395
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.710
I willing to wait.
It's okay.
Right.

396
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:17.270
So you might say in some loose sense they've gotten your haircut,

397
00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:22.190
but of course as it ended up,
they didn't really get your haircut.

398
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:27.590
They got their haircut.
Think about haircuts.

399
00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.780
Nobody can get my haircut.
For me,

400
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.940
I'm the only one who can get my haircut.

401
00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.090
If somebody else tries to get my hair cut,

402
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.640
they just end up getting their own haircut.

403
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:48.063
<v 2>Of course,</v>

404
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:52.490
<v 0>that's a special about haircuts.
Talk about getting your,
uh,</v>

405
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.980
you're a kidney stones removed.

406
00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:59.610
Nobody else can get my kidney stones removed from me.

407
00:26:59.611 --> 00:27:03.420
I'm the only one who can get my kidney stones removed from me.

408
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.250
I think about any lunch.
Nobody can eat my lunch for me.

409
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.000
If somebody else and tries to eat my lunch,
they end.
It becomes their lunch.

410
00:27:12.001 --> 00:27:13.800
They've eaten their lunch for themselves.

411
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.430
Nobody can eat my lunch for me except for me.

412
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:23.220
He think about it.
It's true about just about everything.
Maybe.
Indeed.

413
00:27:23.221 --> 00:27:27.870
Everything yet emphasize the word my enough.

414
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:33.290
Nobody can do much of anything for me and still have it be my such and such

415
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:42.870
and short,
even though it's true that nobody can die my death.
For me,

416
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:48.050
this isn't some deep insight into the special nature of death.

417
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.960
It's just a trivial grammatical point about the needing of the word.

418
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.733
My,

419
00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.360
<v 2>all right,</v>

420
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:01.820
<v 0>remember where we're at.</v>

421
00:28:01.821 --> 00:28:06.110
We're looking for interpretations of the claim.

422
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:11.200
Everyone dies alone and by now we've gone rather far a field in the search for

423
00:28:13.251 --> 00:28:15.230
an interpretation of that claim.

424
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:20.060
But we had not yet been able to find a claim and interpretation,

425
00:28:20.061 --> 00:28:24.890
which is true,
interesting,

426
00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:30.460
fairly special about death as opposed to trivially true about everything and

427
00:28:31.221 --> 00:28:34.940
giving us some relatively interesting insight into the nature of death.

428
00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.040
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

429
00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.460
<v 0>I can't see it for the claim.</v>

430
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.230
Everyone dies alone.

431
00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:47.860
At least not if we try to take these claims fairly literally or take them to be

432
00:28:48.861 --> 00:28:51.980
sort of metaphysical claims about the nature of death.

433
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:58.030
But maybe I've just been flat footed here,
uh,

434
00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:01.610
in thinking that this is some sort of claim about not being with others or

435
00:29:01.611 --> 00:29:03.260
things.
I do by myself.

436
00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:08.530
Maybe the claim we all die alone is intended as a kind of metaphor.

437
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:14.000
It's not that we all really do diet alone.

438
00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.820
It's that when we die,

439
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.580
it's as though we were alone.

440
00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:22.250
It's like being alone.

441
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:27.490
Maybe the claim we all die alone is a psychological claim that the psychological

442
00:29:28.881 --> 00:29:33.881
state we are in when we die is similar to loneliness.

443
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:42.190
It's similar to the feeling of being that we have in various situations.

444
00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.270
Now that would be interesting if it was true.

445
00:29:53.271 --> 00:29:56.030
Is it true that when we die,
we all die?

446
00:29:56.150 --> 00:30:01.150
Having this feeling of loneliness or perhaps feeling of alienation,

447
00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:06.820
it's easy enough to imagine somebody who is surrounded by other people as he's

448
00:30:09.441 --> 00:30:13.550
dying,
and yet for all that feels removed,

449
00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:18.560
distant,
alienated from the others,
feel as lonely,

450
00:30:18.561 --> 00:30:20.270
even in the crowd.

451
00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.160
<v 2>Okay?</v>

452
00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.950
<v 0>Is that true of all of us?
Remember,</v>

453
00:30:24.951 --> 00:30:28.820
we're looking for a claim that says that makes it true that everyone dies alone.

454
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Is it true that everyone dies feeling distant and removed?

455
00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:36.940
<v 2>Okay.</v>

456
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.470
<v 0>Maybe it was true of Ivan Illich.</v>

457
00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:44.220
Ivan Illich progressively grows more and more distant from his family and

458
00:30:45.491 --> 00:30:50.491
friends who indeed removing themselves psychologically from him.

459
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:57.270
He faces his death with a feeling of alienation and being alone to metaphor,

460
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:05.310
but still an important insight into her psychology question we have to ask is,

461
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.000
is that true of everybody?

462
00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:12.060
Is it true that everybody dies alone in this psychological sense doesn't seem to

463
00:31:14.681 --> 00:31:16.930
be true?
First of all,

464
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:20.710
just notice the obvious point that sometimes people die in their sleep

465
00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.040
unexpectedly,
they weren't ill,

466
00:31:24.041 --> 00:31:26.440
they just die of cardiac arrest while they're sleeping.

467
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:31.590
Such a person presumably is not feeling lonely or alienated while he dies.

468
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:35.891
While you might say,
okay,

469
00:31:35.891 --> 00:31:40.891
what we meant was anybody who sort of awake while they're dying dies alone.

470
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:46.810
That's not true either.
You're crossing the street,
talking to your friend,

471
00:31:46.811 --> 00:31:49.750
engaged in lively discussion,
so lively.

472
00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.830
You don't notice the truck that's about to hit you.
Truck hits you,

473
00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.180
you die painlessly and immediately.
Well,

474
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:03.130
when you're feeling alienated and distant during your final moments,

475
00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.200
no,
doesn't seem right either.

476
00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:10.560
So certainly it doesn't seem true to say that everybody dies feeling the

477
00:32:10.761 --> 00:32:14.320
psychological feelings of loneliness.
Well,

478
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.750
maybe we should have to do is revise the claim yet again,

479
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.760
everybody who dies awake realizing that they're dying,

480
00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:26.710
facing the fact that they're dying,
they all,
we all who have whom,

481
00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:29.230
that's true.
We all die alone.

482
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.160
As long as we realize we're dying now,

483
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.480
take care of the sleep case that would take care of the truck case.

484
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.830
Is the claim true?

485
00:32:35.831 --> 00:32:38.660
Then it would still be interesting if it was true even given this,

486
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:42.950
those restrictions,
but it doesn't seem true than either.

487
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.040
Again,
just recall Socrates.

488
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:51.220
Socrates is engaged in philosophical discussion with his friends,

489
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.310
knows he's about to die.
He's drunk.
The hemlock,

490
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.280
he's sitting there saying goodbye to everybody.

491
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:02.090
He's doesn't seem alienated,

492
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:05.540
doesn't seem to be feeling distant and alone.

493
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:10.570
It just doesn't seem true that everybody who knows they're going to die and it's

494
00:33:10.671 --> 00:33:13.940
facing their death feels lonely.

495
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:19.100
Another example of this is a another philosopher,
David Hume,

496
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:21.650
who will have a reading end of the semester.

497
00:33:21.651 --> 00:33:26.540
We'll be reading his essay on suicide.
Hume died,
had an illness.

498
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:30.920
He was quite sociable to the end.
He used to bring people into,

499
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:34.160
sit around his deathbed talking about various matters with Emily.

500
00:33:34.161 --> 00:33:38.720
He was so cheerful and pleasant to the end and theirs,

501
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.950
as far as I can see,

502
00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:44.390
no reason at all to believe that he was feeling lonely,

503
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.070
feeling distant,

504
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.060
feeling alienated from the people who are keeping him company.

505
00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:57.660
So the psychological reading doesn't do any better as far as I can see.

506
00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:03.850
Oh,
maybe there's some other interpretation and I invite you to reflect on the

507
00:34:03.851 --> 00:34:08.590
question.
Is it true that we all die alone?

508
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.800
Is there some way of understanding that claim where it's true I necessary truth,

509
00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.340
fairly special and unique,

510
00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:21.430
if not all together uniquely is fairly special about death.

511
00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:26.640
Showing us some deep insight into the nature of death as opposed to some trivial

512
00:34:27.851 --> 00:34:32.851
insight about the way the possessive first person Pronoun my works.

513
00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:35.590
I can't find it.

514
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:41.400
So despite the fact that the claim we all die alone is one of these things that

515
00:34:41.861 --> 00:34:45.820
one hears,
I think it's just nonsense.

516
00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:51.240
I think it's people talking without giving a moment's thought to what they meant

517
00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:53.410
when they said it.

518
00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:56.550
<v 2>All right,</v>

519
00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:58.840
<v 0>where are we?</v>

520
00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:03.460
For the first half of the course.

521
00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:07.450
We've been engaged in metaphysics.
Broadly speaking,

522
00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:12.690
we've been trying to get clear about the nature of the person,

523
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.510
what,

524
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:18.510
what were composed of so that we could then try to get clear about the nature of

525
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:24.510
survival and identity of persons so that we could think about the nature of

526
00:35:25.991 --> 00:35:28.420
death metaphysically speaking.

527
00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:32.080
What happens when we die?

528
00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.360
And as you know,
I've,

529
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:40.430
I've defended the list conception according to which all we are are just body's

530
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.780
capable of doing some fancy tricks,

531
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:51.230
capable of p functioning and details aside,

532
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.720
death is a matter of the body breaking so that it's no longer able to engage in

533
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:03.810
p functioning
as we saw,

534
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:08.870
depending on the particular details of which theory of personal identity you

535
00:36:09.301 --> 00:36:13.230
accept,
you know,
the body view,
the brain view,

536
00:36:13.231 --> 00:36:16.110
the personality theory of personal identity.

537
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:20.700
We might have to say slightly different things about whether the death of my

538
00:36:20.701 --> 00:36:23.160
body means I no longer exist.

539
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:25.950
Whether we should distinguish between the death of the body,

540
00:36:25.951 --> 00:36:27.660
the death of the person and so forth.

541
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.970
But those details aside,
roughly speaking,

542
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:37.050
the following is true.
When the body breaks.

543
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:42.860
I ceased to exist as a person and even if we can hold out the logical

544
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:49.370
possibility of my being resurrected or Mike continued to exist with a different

545
00:36:49.471 --> 00:36:51.840
body,
as long as it's gotten my personality.

546
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.030
If you happen to accept the personality theory,

547
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:59.240
even though there's the logical possibility of surviving my death or coming back

548
00:37:00.181 --> 00:37:01.014
to life,

549
00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:06.740
I see no good reason to believe that those logical possibilities are actual as

550
00:37:10.201 --> 00:37:14.880
far as I can see when my body dies,
that's it.

551
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:19.800
As a fan of the body view,
I believe I'll still exist for awhile.

552
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.270
I'll exist as a corpse,

553
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:25.950
but that's not the kind of thing about existence that mattered to me in terms of

554
00:37:25.951 --> 00:37:30.120
what mattered to me.
What I wanted was not just that I exist,

555
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:35.270
but that I'd be alive indeed be a person indeed be a person with pretty much the

556
00:37:35.341 --> 00:37:40.341
same personality and the truth of the matter is when my body dies,

557
00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:41.640
that's all history.

558
00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:47.740
That's where we're at in terms of the metaphysics.

559
00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.790
We could,
we could summarize this by saying,
when I die,

560
00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:56.770
I cease to exist.
That's,

561
00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.740
that's a little bit misleading given the view I just sketched,

562
00:37:59.741 --> 00:38:03.370
where even though I'm dead,
I still exist for a while as a corpse.

563
00:38:03.371 --> 00:38:08.371
But those issues won't concern us in what we're about to turn two.

564
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:14.470
Let's just suppose that for the sake of avoiding those complications,

565
00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:18.040
that when my body dies,

566
00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:19.780
it gets destroyed.

567
00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:24.070
And so the very same moment will be the end of my body,

568
00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.340
the end of my existence,
the end of my personhood.

569
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:30.400
Let's suppose that my personality doesn't get destroyed any sooner than the

570
00:38:30.401 --> 00:38:34.810
death of my body.
We've got the end of my exist,
you know,
here I am going along.

571
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.850
The atomizer comes along,

572
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
blows me up the simultaneously we've got the death of my person,

573
00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:46.240
the death of my body,
the end of what matters to me.

574
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.980
The end of my existence.
Death is the end.

575
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:55.840
And even though these things can come across,
can come apart slightly,

576
00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.630
uh,
under certain scenarios,
those,
those,

577
00:38:58.631 --> 00:39:02.680
those details won't matter for what we're about to turn to.
Well,

578
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:07.000
what do we about to turn two?
We're about to turn to value theory.

579
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.150
We spent the first half the semester,
you might say,

580
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:15.300
trying to get clear about the metaphysical facts and now that we've done that as

581
00:39:16.631 --> 00:39:17.590
best we can,

582
00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:22.000
we want to turn to the ethical or value questions.

583
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:25.600
How good or bad is death?

584
00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:31.150
Why is d know take it.
We all believe death is bad.

585
00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:35.950
Why is death bad?
How can death be bad?

586
00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.420
So this is the big continental divide for the course.

587
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.400
First half the class was metaphysics.

588
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:47.580
Now we turn to value questions and the first question we're going to be focusing

589
00:39:50.531 --> 00:39:51.700
on is justice.

590
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:55.630
The question of the badness of death,

591
00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:00.550
how and in what ways?
His deathbed and I take it,

592
00:40:00.551 --> 00:40:02.920
most of us do believe that death is bad.

593
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:07.900
That's why we wish maybe some of us believe,

594
00:40:07.901 --> 00:40:09.160
but at the very least the rest of us,

595
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:14.220
many of us hoped there were souls so that death wouldn't have to be the end.

596
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.640
If death is the end,
that seems to be horrible.

597
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.370
So we're going to turn to questions like this.

598
00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:25.330
How and in what ways is death bed?

599
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.550
And then we're going to turn to the question.

600
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:30.760
Is it really true that in mortality would be good?

601
00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:34.240
And eventually we turned to some other value questions about if death really is

602
00:40:34.241 --> 00:40:36.880
the end,
should we be afraid of death?

603
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:39.190
I take it that fear of death is quite common,

604
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:44.430
but we can actually evaluate different emotions and think about whether these

605
00:40:44.681 --> 00:40:47.110
emotional responses are appropriate or not.

606
00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.530
So we can ask whether or not fear of death is appropriate.

607
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.990
We'll turn eventually to the question,

608
00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:58.170
how should we live in light of the fact that death is the end?

609
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.980
And the last question we'll turn to is could it ever make sense to kill

610
00:41:02.981 --> 00:41:03.401
ourselves?

611
00:41:03.401 --> 00:41:07.750
So as these are the kinds of moral or value questions will be concerned with

612
00:41:07.751 --> 00:41:10.900
till the end of the term.
But the first one is simply,

613
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.550
is death bad as we typically take it to be?
And if so,

614
00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.570
what is it about it that makes it bad?

615
00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:21.910
So again,

616
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:26.320
I'm going to suppose here on out that the metaphysical view that I've been

617
00:41:26.321 --> 00:41:30.010
sketching is right that physicals and was true.

618
00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:34.880
The death of my body is the end of my existence as a person.

619
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.760
That is my end.

620
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:41.550
Well if that's right,

621
00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:47.810
how can it be bad for me to die after all,

622
00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:52.320
once I'm dead,
I don't exist.

623
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:54.630
If I don't exist,

624
00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:58.080
how can it be bad for me that I'm dead?

625
00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:03.570
It's easy to see how you might think how you might worry about the badness of

626
00:42:03.571 --> 00:42:06.990
death if you thought you would survive your death.

627
00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.920
If you believed in a soul,
then you might worry about,
oh gosh,

628
00:42:10.921 --> 00:42:13.260
what's going to happen to my soul after I die?

629
00:42:13.261 --> 00:42:15.690
Am I going to make it up to heaven?
Am I going to go to hell?

630
00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:20.730
You might worry about how badly off you're going to be once you're dead.

631
00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.500
Question makes perfect sense,

632
00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:27.620
but it's often seem to people that if we really believe that death is the end

633
00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:31.560
and that's the assumption that I'm making here on out.

634
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:36.600
If we really believe death is the end,
how can death be bad for me?

635
00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:42.320
How could anything be bad for me once I'm dead by don't exist?

636
00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:44.880
Can't be bad for me.

637
00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:53.280
Well,
sometimes in response to this thought,

638
00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.590
people respond by saying,
look,

639
00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.160
death isn't bad for the person who's dead.

640
00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.240
Death is bad for this survivors.

641
00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:09.170
John's death isn't bad for John John's death is bad for the people who loved

642
00:43:11.371 --> 00:43:16.371
John and now have to continue living without John John's death is bad for John's

643
00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:20.970
friends and family.

644
00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:25.290
When somebody dies,

645
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:30.770
we lose the chance to continue interacting with the person.

646
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:37.920
We're no longer able to talk with them,
spend time with them,

647
00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:42.510
watch a movie,
look at the sunset,
have a laugh.

648
00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:46.770
We're no longer able to tell our troubles with them and get their advice.

649
00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:50.130
We're no longer able to interact with them.

650
00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:53.880
All that's gone when somebody dies

651
00:43:55.710 --> 00:44:00.710
and the claim might be that the central bad of death,

652
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:04.710
not what it does for the person who dies.

653
00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:09.630
It's not bad for the person who dies.
It's what it does for the rest of them.

654
00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.880
Rest of us.
Now,

655
00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:17.720
I don't in any way want to belittle the importance of the pain and suffering

656
00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.080
that happen for the rest of us.

657
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:28.470
When somebody that we care about dies.
Indeed,

658
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:33.920
we take them home and read a poem that emphasizes this thought because this is

659
00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:37.740
certainly one central,

660
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.890
very bad thing about death.

661
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:44.700
It robs us of our friends.
We the survivors.

662
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.010
It robs us of our friends and loved ones.

663
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:53.120
Poem poem is called separation by the German poet Friedrich Gottlieb clop stock.

664
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:59.970
This is in one of the essays you'll be reading later in the semester by Walter

665
00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:04.290
Kauffman.
He quotes it.
Death without dread is they say is separation.

666
00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:10.310
You turned so serious when the corpse was carried past us.

667
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.410
Are you afraid of death?
Oh,

668
00:45:13.411 --> 00:45:18.411
not a vat of what are you afraid of dying.

669
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:24.360
I not even have that.
Then you're afraid of nothing.

670
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:30.030
Alas,
I am afraid,
afraid heavens of what?

671
00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:34.710
Of partying from my friends and not mine.

672
00:45:34.711 --> 00:45:37.320
Only of their partying too.

673
00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:43.280
That's why I turned more serious even than you did deeper in the soul when the

674
00:45:43.981 --> 00:45:48.981
corpse was carried past us poems called separation according to clop stock.

675
00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:55.610
The crucial badness of death is losing your friends when they die,

676
00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.790
you lose them.
As I say,

677
00:45:59.791 --> 00:46:04.791
I don't in any way want to belittle the central badness of that,

678
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:11.240
but I don't think it can be at the core in terms of what's bad about death.

679
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:17.300
I don't think that can be the central fact about why death is bad and to see

680
00:46:17.761 --> 00:46:21.870
this.
Let me tell you two stories,
comparing them.

681
00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:23.850
Story number one,

682
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:29.640
your friend is about to go on this space ship,

683
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.150
which is going to do the exploration of Jupiter

684
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:39.240
or whatever,
and they're going to be gone for years,

685
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:44.610
years and years.
So it takes so long that by the time

686
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:49.500
this spaceship comes back,
a hundred years will have gone by.

687
00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:54.450
Maybe it's not Jupiter,
it's farther away.
We're still,

688
00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:00.210
after about 20 minutes after the ship takes off,

689
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.590
all radio contact between shipping earth will be destroyed,

690
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.770
won't be possible because of the speed of me.

691
00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.570
It's not going to Jupiter to go to some other,
some other planetary system.

692
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.500
So all possibility of communication will be destroyed.

693
00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:18.330
Now this is horrible.
You're losing your closest friend.

694
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:23.490
You will no longer be able to talk to them,
share the moments,

695
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:25.830
get their insights and advice.

696
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:29.680
You'll no longer be able to tell them about the things that have been going on.

697
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:34.780
It's the same kind of separation the claps doc was talking about.

698
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:39.520
It's horrible and it's sad.
That was story number one.

699
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:42.370
Story number two,
just like story number one,

700
00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:47.490
this space ship takes off and about 15 minutes later it explodes in a horrible

701
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:53.830
accident and everybody on the spaceship,
including your friend,

702
00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.180
is killed.

703
00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:01.960
Now I take it that story number two is worse,

704
00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:07.120
something worse has taken place.
Well,

705
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.010
what's the worst thing we've got?
Of course,

706
00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:12.010
the very same separation we had in story number one,

707
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.660
I can't communicate in the future with my friend.
They can't communicate with me,

708
00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.090
but we had that already in story number one.

709
00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:23.230
If there's something worse about story number two,

710
00:48:23.231 --> 00:48:25.450
and I think it's pretty clear there is something worse.

711
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:28.330
It's not the separation.

712
00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:34.540
It's something about the fact that your friend has died,

713
00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:41.220
and of course this is worse for me as somebody who cares about my friend that

714
00:48:42.161 --> 00:48:42.994
he's died,

715
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:48.120
but the explanation of what's bad for me in his having died is the fact that

716
00:48:49.391 --> 00:48:54.391
it's bad for him to have died and the badness for him isn't just a matter of

717
00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:02.140
separation because that we already had a number one,

718
00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:05.200
we couldn't communicate with him.
He couldn't communicate with us.

719
00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:11.560
If we want to get at the central badness of death,

720
00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:16.860
it seems to me we can't focus on the badness of separation,

721
00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.480
the badness for the survivors.

722
00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:23.170
We have to think about how is it,

723
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:28.320
how could it be true that death is bad for the person that dies?

724
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:34.900
That's the central badness of death,

725
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:38.620
and that's the one I'm going to have us focus on.

726
00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:44.130
How could it be true that death is bad for the person that dies?

727
00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:48.940
That's the question we turn to next time.
