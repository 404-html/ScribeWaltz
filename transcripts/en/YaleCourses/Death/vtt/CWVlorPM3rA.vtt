1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.470
All right,

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.470
we've been talking about arguments that might give us reason to believe in the

3
00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:08.490
existence of an immaterial soul.

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.850
The kinds of arguments we've been considering so far,

5
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.170
all for fall under the general rubric of inference to the best explanation we

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.950
posit,
or the fans of souls,
positive existence of souls.

7
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.480
So as to explain something that needs explaining about us.

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.351
Now the,

9
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:28.530
I've gone through a series of such arguments in the one that we ended with last

10
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:32.640
time was the suggestion that we need to believe in is this existence of a soul

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.080
in order to explain the fact that we've got free will.

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.500
The fact that we've got freewill is something that most of us take for granted

13
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:44.190
about ourselves.
But the complaint then,

14
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:49.191
or the objection to the physical list takes the form that we couldn't be a

15
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:54.591
merely physical entity because no merely physical entity could have freewill.

16
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.070
But we've got free will.

17
00:00:57.071 --> 00:01:00.840
So there's gotta be something more to us than just being a physical object.
Now,

18
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:05.841
if we push the Dualis to explain what is it about freewill that rules out the

19
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:10.770
possibility that we are merely physical objects?

20
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:14.310
I think the natural suggestion does spell out the argument goes like this and

21
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:16.980
this is where we were at at the end of last time.

22
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.030
The thought is that there is a kind of in compatibility with being free and

23
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:28.590
being determined and after all from the physical,
physical,
his point of view,

24
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.680
we're just to kind of glorified robot able to do all sorts of things that the,

25
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.470
that most robots in most science fiction movies can do,

26
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:40.620
but still in a sense we're just to glorify physical object.
We're just,

27
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.570
we're just a robot and robots.
The objection goes our our program,

28
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:49.890
they necessarily follow their program more generally speaking we might say

29
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:52.620
they're subject to a deterministic laws.

30
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.020
The as physical objects.

31
00:01:55.021 --> 00:02:00.021
It's true of them that they must do what the laws of physics and laws of nature

32
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.710
require that they do.

33
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:06.711
And and the laws of physics are ha take a deterministic form that the

34
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.410
determinism being a bit of philosophers jargon for,

35
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.750
for when it's true of these laws,

36
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:17.751
that or a physical or a system that if you set it up a certain way cause and

37
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:22.020
effect plays out such that given that initial set up,

38
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.870
the very same effect must follow.

39
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.930
It's determined by the laws of nature that the effect that follows will follow

40
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:31.140
from that cause.

41
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.610
And so if you rewind the tape and play it again over and over and over again,

42
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:39.030
each time you set things up the very same way,

43
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.060
they must move or transform or change or end up in the very same state.

44
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.190
Well that's what determinism is all about.

45
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.920
And intuitively it seems plausible to many people that you couldn't have

46
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:57.921
freewill and be subject to determinism because the notion of free will was that

47
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:03.140
even if I was in the very same spot again the very same situation again I could

48
00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:08.141
have chosen differently so I wasn't determined or predetermined to make that

49
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:09.304
choice.

50
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.480
So if we were to spell out the argument somewhat more fully,

51
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:18.481
it might be we have free will but you can't both have freewill and be subject to

52
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.240
determinism or subject to deterministic laws and every physical object or every

53
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:33.040
purely physical object is subject to deterministic laws because the laws of

54
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:34.570
physics are deterministic.

55
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.380
You put these things together and you get the conclusion that we,

56
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.800
since we've got free will can't be a purely physical object.

57
00:03:42.801 --> 00:03:45.580
There must be something more than the purely physical to us.

58
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:50.581
That's the argument I put up on the board the end of last class and here we've

59
00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:55.510
got it up here.
Now one,
we have freewill to nothing.

60
00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:58.300
Subject to determinism has freewill.

61
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.890
Three all purely physical systems are subject to determinism.

62
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.360
So conclusion,

63
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.450
we are not a purely physical system to explain the fact that we've got free

64
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:13.510
will.
So the objection goes,
we have to appeal to,

65
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.810
we have to posit the existence of a soul,
something nonphysical,

66
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:18.970
something more than purely physical.

67
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.970
Well that's the argument,

68
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.500
but I don't myself find the argument compelling.

69
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:31.501
Now the first thing to notice is that to get the conclusion we need all three

70
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.470
premises,

71
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.850
give up the conclusion that we've got to give up the premise that we've got free

72
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:40.910
will,
it won't follow that were nonphysical.
Even if something that did have free,

73
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.960
it would have to be nonphysical,
wouldn't follow that we are nonphysical.

74
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.620
That's true for each one of the premises.
Give it up.

75
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.000
The conclusion doesn't go through.

76
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And the interesting thing is that each one of these premises could be plausibly

77
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.720
challenged.
Now as I said last time,

78
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.190
the subject of freewill or free will,
determinism,
causation,

79
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:03.881
responsibility.

80
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:08.881
This cluster of problems is an extremely difficult and complicated physical

81
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.770
problem and we could easily devote an entire semester to discussing it.

82
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.890
So all and so all we're doing here is the most quick and superficial glance.

83
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.790
But still,

84
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.790
let me quickly point out why you could resist the argument from freewill to the

85
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:30.880
existence of a soul.
First of all,
as I just noted,

86
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.220
the argument needs premise number one,

87
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.880
it's got to be the case to prove that we've got a soul,

88
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:39.460
at least for this argument,
to work to prove that we've got us all.

89
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.520
It's got to be the case that we've got freewill now that could be challenged.

90
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:47.140
There are philosophers who have said,

91
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.340
we certainly believe that we've got free will,

92
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.470
but it's an illusion.
We don't really have free will indeed.

93
00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.910
Why don't have free well for precisely the reasons that appointed Dubai,

94
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.170
the rest of the argument,
they might say,
look,
well,
you know,

95
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:06.020
we're physical objects.
Determinism is true of us.

96
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.400
No physical object that's subject to determinism could have free will so we

97
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:11.780
don't have free will.
Of course,

98
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.890
we mistakenly believe we've got freewill.

99
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.550
We are physical objects that Labor under the illusion that we have freewill,

100
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.160
but after all,
freewill isn't something that you can just see,
right?

101
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.220
You can't peer into your mind and see the fact that you've got free will.

102
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.410
Yes,
we've got the sense that we could have acted differently,

103
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.350
but maybe that's an illusion.
As I say,

104
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.650
there are philosophers who argued that way,

105
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.810
have denied that we have free will and if we do conclude that we don't actually

106
00:06:48.811 --> 00:06:53.160
have free will,
then we no longer have this argument for the existence of a soul.

107
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.100
It's a way to avoid the argument.

108
00:06:56.101 --> 00:07:01.101
Although for what it's worth I should mention I don't myself believe that it's

109
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.880
false that we have free will.
That is to say I do think premise one is true.

110
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.830
I myself think we do have free will so although I don't like,

111
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.310
I don't believe the argument is sound.

112
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.810
Premise one doesn't happen to be the premise I myself would walk to reject.

113
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.263
<v 1>Okay,</v>

114
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.740
<v 0>but there are other,
there are two other key premises.</v>

115
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.660
What about premise number three?

116
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.460
All purely physical systems are subject to determinism.

117
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.650
While we need that premise as well to make the argument go,
suppose we think,

118
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.060
look,
you can't have free will and determinism.

119
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.250
You can't combine them.

120
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.060
The view of that you can't combine them is sometimes known as incompatible

121
00:07:46.061 --> 00:07:47.710
wisdom for the obvious reason.

122
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.470
It's the view that these two things are incompatible.

123
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.840
You can't have determinism and free will.

124
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.113
<v 1>Okay.</v>

125
00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.270
<v 0>Suppose we do believe in determined incompatible wisdom and believe that we've</v>

126
00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:02.110
got freewill.

127
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.580
It would follow then that we're not subject to deterministic laws.

128
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.260
Well the Dualis says that shows us that we have to believe that there's

129
00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:16.261
something nonphysical about us because after all premise three all purely

130
00:08:16.331 --> 00:08:20.700
physical systems are subject to determinism isn't a true after all that the

131
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.680
basic laws of physics are deterministic laws

132
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.420
and the answer is well,
it's not so clear that it is true,

133
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.840
which is just to say that premise three of the argument can be rejected as well.

134
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.513
Now,

135
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.370
you know at this point I have to just confess as I've confessed at other times

136
00:08:39.371 --> 00:08:44.371
before the the three is out is a claim about a empirical science.

137
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.990
What is our best theory about the laws of nature?
Tell us,

138
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:54.580
and I'm no scientist and I'm no specialist and sort of empirical matters and

139
00:08:54.581 --> 00:08:58.950
believe I'm no authority on quantum mechanics,

140
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.690
our best theory of fundamental physics still I take it,

141
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:05.580
I gather.
Here's what I'm told,

142
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.940
that the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics says that despite what

143
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:15.990
money many of us might have otherwise believed,

144
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:21.120
the fundamental laws of physics are not in fact deterministic.

145
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:22.523
What does that mean?

146
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:28.430
Supposedly have got some sort of radioactive atom which has a certain chance of

147
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.490
decaying.

148
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

149
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.530
<v 0>What does that mean?
Well,
it means that you know,</v>

150
00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:38.531
there's maybe let's say an 80% chance that in the next 24 hours it will break

151
00:09:38.931 --> 00:09:39.764
down.

152
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:40.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

153
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.810
<v 0>80% of atoms that are set up like that breakdown in the next 24 hours,</v>

154
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.930
20% of them don't.
Now,

155
00:09:47.931 --> 00:09:50.900
according to quantum mechanics on the standard interpretation,

156
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.790
that's all there is to say about it.

157
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:58.330
You have an Adam like that 80% chance in the next 24 hours,
it'll break down.

158
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:03.440
Suppose it does break down.
Can we say why it broke down?

159
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.800
Sure.
We can say,
well,
after all,

160
00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:09.740
there was an 80% chance that it would take an Adam that after 24 hours hasn't

161
00:10:09.741 --> 00:10:13.760
broken down,
can we say why hasn't broken down?
Sure.

162
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.550
There was a 20% chance that it wouldn't.

163
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.990
Can we explain why?

164
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.360
The ones that do breakdown breakdown and the ones that don't break down don't

165
00:10:26.361 --> 00:10:28.700
break down.
No.

166
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.600
All we can say is there was an 80% chance it would 20% chance it wouldn't,

167
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.150
so most of them do.
Some of them don't.

168
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.840
That's as deep as the explanation goes.

169
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:47.000
There's nothing more.
Now,
you know when we've got our deterministic hats on,

170
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:52.090
we think to ourselves there's got to be some underlying causal explanation.

171
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.640
Some feature about the breakdown Adams that explained why they broke down.

172
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.160
That was missing from the non breakdown Adams.

173
00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:05.420
That explained why they don't break down after all determinism.
Right.

174
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.050
If you set up the atoms exactly the same way,
they've always got a breakdown,

175
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.440
but the answer is according to the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics,

176
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.790
that's not how it works.

177
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:20.920
All there is to say is some of these are going to break down and some of these

178
00:11:20.921 --> 00:11:21.754
won't.

179
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:26.170
The fundamental laws of physics according to the standard interpretation of

180
00:11:26.171 --> 00:11:31.171
quantum mechanics are probabilistic determinism is not true.

181
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:34.830
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

182
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.450
<v 0>At the level of fundamental physics.</v>

183
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:37.590
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

184
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.020
<v 0>Oh,
that's what I'm told.
Leave me.
I'm in no position to say,</v>

185
00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.230
but that's what I'm told.
And of course if that's true,

186
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.500
then premise three is false.

187
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.280
It just isn't true that all purely physical systems are subject determinism.

188
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:55.750
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

189
00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.340
<v 0>so even if it does turn out that you can't have free will and determinism,</v>

190
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.890
that doesn't rule out the possibility that we are purely physical objects
because

191
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:07.170
<v 1>okay,</v>

192
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.440
<v 0>not all purely physical systems are subject to determinism.</v>

193
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.430
If determinism isn't true of us at the fundamental level.

194
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.760
<v 1>Okay,</v>

195
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.700
<v 0>then even if you couldn't both have determinism and free will,</v>

196
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.680
we could still have free will and yet for all that still be purely physical

197
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:30.560
systems.
Well,

198
00:12:30.561 --> 00:12:33.500
I'm busy pointing out ways in which the argument doesn't succeed.

199
00:12:33.501 --> 00:12:38.501
I also want to just take a moment and mentioned that premise two is also subject

200
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.010
to criticism.

201
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:45.230
Premise too though is that was the incompatiblist claim that nothing subject to

202
00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:48.860
determinism has free will.
You can't combine them.

203
00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.830
They're incompatible.
Now,

204
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:57.070
incompatible ism I take it is probably something like the common sense view

205
00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.670
here.
So if you have that,
probably most of you believe,
but again,

206
00:13:01.671 --> 00:13:04.820
it's worth noting that philosophically it can be challenged.

207
00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:09.350
There are philosophers,
and here I'll tip my hat and say I'm one of them.

208
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.530
There are philosophers who believe that in fact,

209
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:18.190
the idea of freewill is not incompatible ism with incompatible with determinism.

210
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:26.000
So even if determinism work true of us,

211
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:31.870
that wouldn't rule out our having freewill because you can appearances to the

212
00:13:32.721 --> 00:13:34.310
contrary,
not withstanding,

213
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.940
have both determinism and free will.

214
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:42.230
They're compatible,
hence this views known as compatible wisdom.

215
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.320
If we accept compatible ISM will be able to say,
look,

216
00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:52.310
maybe we have free will and determinism is true of us.

217
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.120
But for all of that we're still just purely physical systems.

218
00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:58.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

219
00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:02.310
<v 0>Even if quantum mechanics was wrong and somehow,
you know,</v>

220
00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:07.220
at the macro level it all the in determinism,
nope,
come boils out,

221
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.460
whatever.
And at the macro level,
we are deterministic systems.

222
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.810
So what if a deterministic system could nonetheless have freewill?

223
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.540
We could still be purely physical systems.
Now mind you,

224
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:24.720
I haven't said anything today to convince you of the truth of compatiblist them.

225
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.240
Nor am I going to try to do that.

226
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:29.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

227
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:34.750
<v 0>My point here was only to say we shouldn't be so quick to think that we have to</v>

228
00:14:36.411 --> 00:14:41.411
believe in the existence of a soul in order to explain our having free will.

229
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:48.640
It takes all of the premises of the argument to get the conclusion that the soul

230
00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:52.340
exists and each one of the premises can be challenged

231
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:58.310
and here,
I mean not merely,
well,
logically speaking,
you know,

232
00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:01.490
of course you can reject and print any premise of any argument.
No,

233
00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:06.491
I mean there are reasonable philosophical or scientific grounds for worrying

234
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:09.350
about each one of the premises.

235
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:13.790
The argument requires a lot that doesn't prove that the argument fails,

236
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.420
but it does mean that you're going to have your work cut out for you if you're

237
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:21.020
going to use this route to arguing for the existence of a soul.

238
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.130
All right,
let's,
let's recap.
As I said,

239
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:29.810
we've been considering different kinds of arguments for the existence of a soul,

240
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:34.460
each of which appeals to some feature about us,
our creativity,

241
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.690
our ability to feel,
the fact that we have a qualitative aspect of experience.

242
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.760
Our ability to reason what have you.

243
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:45.850
Some fact about us that calls out for explanation and the claim on the part of

244
00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:51.521
the dual list was we couldn't explain it without appealing to a soul and I've

245
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:53.391
argued,
I've,

246
00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:57.170
I've shared with you my reasons for thinking that those arguments are not

247
00:15:57.171 --> 00:15:58.004
compelling,

248
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:03.050
but notice that all of the kinds of considerations I pointed to so far are what

249
00:16:03.051 --> 00:16:08.051
we might think of as every day familiar features about us.

250
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.590
It's an everyday occurrence that we can think and reason and feel and be

251
00:16:12.591 --> 00:16:17.591
creative or choose otherwise and have freewill maybe the better arguments where

252
00:16:18.681 --> 00:16:23.681
the sole focus not on the everyday but on the unusual on the supernatural here

253
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:31.730
we might then have an entire other family of arguments,

254
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:36.800
set of arguments.
Again,
still have the form inference to the best explanation.

255
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.870
Maybe we need to posit the soul in order to explain ghosts.

256
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.400
Maybe we need deposit the soul in order to explain ESP.

257
00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:51.401
Maybe we need to posit the soul in order to explain near death experiences.

258
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.540
Maybe we need to posit the soul in order to explain what goes on and say on says

259
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:58.670
or communications from the dead or what have you.

260
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:04.310
For any one of those,
we could again run an argument where he say,
look,

261
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:09.020
here's something that needs explaining the best explanation appeals to the soul.

262
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.940
Now I'm going to be rather quicker in discussing this family of arguments about,

263
00:17:13.941 --> 00:17:18.110
let me take at least a couple of minutes and do something about that.

264
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.190
Take for example,
near death experiences.

265
00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.470
This is something that you read a bit about in the selection foam Shichen Vaughn

266
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.330
in your course packet.

267
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:34.250
The basic idea is probably familiar to most of you anyway,

268
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.400
that the following thing happens with people who,

269
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.340
you know,
maybe their heart goes into a cardiac arrest,
what have you,

270
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.340
they they die on the operating table,

271
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.290
but then they're brought back to life as we,
as we put it,

272
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.560
and many such people when we questioned them afterwards,

273
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.680
have a very striking experience and one of the things that's striking is how

274
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.520
similar the experience is from person to person and from culture to culture.

275
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.920
That they've got some notion as they were dead on the operating table of leaving

276
00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:12.030
their body.

277
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.730
Perhaps they begin to view their body from up floating up above,

278
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.960
above it.
Then she will leave.

279
00:18:18.961 --> 00:18:23.220
Perhaps they leave the operating room altogether in this,

280
00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.300
in this experience that they're having and they have a feeling of joy and

281
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:31.440
euphoria.
They have some experience of going through a tunnel,

282
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.200
seeing some light at the end of the tunnel,

283
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.050
perhaps at the other end of the tunnel,

284
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:42.110
they begin to have some communications or see some loved one who's died

285
00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:46.680
previously or perhaps some famous religious person in their,

286
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.500
in their true teachings of their tradition,
their religious tradition.

287
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.230
They have the sense that what they done is basically died and gone to heaven,

288
00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:00.950
but then suddenly they get yanked back and they wake up in the hospital room so

289
00:19:04.291 --> 00:19:08.280
they've had near death experiences or perhaps a better word to put it would be

290
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:13.060
they've had death experiences but then had been brought back to life now,
no,

291
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.490
there it is right in your survey people and people have these experiences and

292
00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:22.491
now we have to ask ourselves what explains this and here's a perfectly straight

293
00:19:24.101 --> 00:19:28.830
forward and natural explanation.
These people died,

294
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:34.250
there are bodies died and they went to the next world.

295
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.920
They went to the next life they went to heaven but then were yanked back.

296
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.820
Now their bodies were lying there on the operating table.

297
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.960
They're bodies weren't in heaven,
so something non bodily went to heaven.

298
00:19:48.961 --> 00:19:52.530
That's how the explanation goes.
It's a natural,

299
00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:57.300
straightforward explanation of what's gone on here.

300
00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.360
Hence inference to the best explanation.

301
00:20:00.361 --> 00:20:03.180
We need to posit the soul,

302
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:07.830
something in material that survives the death of the body that can leave the

303
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:12.000
body go up to heaven.
Though as it happens in these cases,

304
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.870
you know the,
the ties never completely broken.
They get yanked back,

305
00:20:15.871 --> 00:20:19.680
the soul gets yanked back by whatever cause and reconnected to the body.

306
00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:24.540
It's as though we might think of there being two rooms.

307
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:26.190
He was a kind of analogy here.

308
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.610
There's the room that this world represents,

309
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:34.670
this life represents and what happens in these experiences is that your soul

310
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.570
leaves this room and goes into a second room,

311
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.900
the room of the next world or the next life,

312
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.490
but for various reasons isn't allowed to stay in the next room.

313
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.010
It gets yanked back to this room.

314
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.920
Well that's a possible explanation.

315
00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.610
And in a moment I'll ask whether it's the best possible explanation,

316
00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:03.730
but before we do turn to that question there an objection to this entire way of

317
00:21:05.241 --> 00:21:09.740
looking at things that's probably worth pausing for a moment and considering the

318
00:21:09.741 --> 00:21:14.741
objection is similar to the kind of dismissive attitude that we saw at the

319
00:21:15.411 --> 00:21:18.680
beginning of the course about the question,
you know,
could I survive my death?

320
00:21:18.681 --> 00:21:21.710
Well dog,
could there be life after there's no more life?
Well,
of course not.

321
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.840
Here in the objection says this two room notions gotta be mistaken.

322
00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:34.690
It can't be that what's going on in near death experiences is that people are

323
00:21:35.481 --> 00:21:40.481
reporting about what it's like to be dead because so the objection says they

324
00:21:41.031 --> 00:21:45.050
never really died after all.

325
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:49.070
No 20 minutes later,
whatever it is,
there they are up and about,

326
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.130
well not up and about the presumably line in their hospital beds,

327
00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.600
but they're clearly alive,
hence at files that they never really died.

328
00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.710
Or if you want,
you could say maybe they died,

329
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.800
but since they obviously didn't die permanently after all,

330
00:22:06.321 --> 00:22:07.460
we were brought back to life.

331
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:13.060
How can they possibly tell us what it's like to be permanently dead?

332
00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:19.810
How can we take their experiences as vertical reports of the afterlife?

333
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:26.720
Because what we want to know is what does it like to be permanently dead and

334
00:22:26.721 --> 00:22:29.330
these people were never permanently dead.

335
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:32.660
So whatever unusual experiences they may be having,

336
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.700
they are not reports of the afterlife.
That's how the objection goes.

337
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:45.130
Although I think it was pausing for a moment to raise that objection.

338
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.640
It's not an objection that I think we should take all that seriously.

339
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.870
I suppose we were to agree.
All right.
Strictly speaking,

340
00:22:54.871 --> 00:22:59.490
these people didn't die or strictly speaking,
they didn't die,

341
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.520
certainly at least permanently does it follow from that that their experiences

342
00:23:04.861 --> 00:23:08.160
should not be taken as evidence of what the afterlife is like?

343
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:13.810
I think that's really a,
a misguided objection smell.

344
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:14.820
Somebody said,
look,

345
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:20.180
I spent 20 years living in France and then I came back to the United States.

346
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.770
And so I want to tell you what it's like in France.
And somebody says,
you know,

347
00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:31.860
you never really moved to France permanently,

348
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:36.750
so your experiences in France,
whatever they are interesting as they may be,

349
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:41.870
can't really cast any light on what it would be like to permanently move to

350
00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:47.060
France.
We'd say,
yeah,
give me a break.
Right.

351
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:51.680
It's true that of course I didn't move to France permanent lease still.

352
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.250
No,

353
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:57.250
I have some experience of France and so I can,

354
00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.780
you know,
a great deal after all 20 years,

355
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:04.190
I can give you a pretty good idea of what it's like to live in France,

356
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:09.440
even if I didn't move there for the rest of my life without ever coming back.

357
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.870
Keck say quite as much.

358
00:24:12.871 --> 00:24:16.260
If you've only been in France for a couple of days before,
I'll coming back.

359
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:19.710
But still you can say something relevant.
Indeed.

360
00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.680
Suppose I never went into France at all.

361
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.400
Suppose all that happened was I stood right on the border.

362
00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:27.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

363
00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:32.750
<v 0>And peered into France.
Talk to some people in France.</v>

364
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:35.840
They were on the French side of the border.
I was on the other side,

365
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:39.170
but I talked to them for a while.
Still,
I never went in,

366
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.040
but for all that I might have something helpful to say about what it's like in

367
00:24:43.041 --> 00:24:43.874
France.

368
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.470
<v 1>Okay,</v>

369
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.440
<v 0>well that's the right thing to say about the France case.</v>

370
00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:52.640
Then why not say the same thing about the near death near death experience case.

371
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:58.010
Even if these people didn't stay in the second room,

372
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.020
they didn't stay dead.
They had some experience of being dead.

373
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:09.020
Isn't that relevant to what it would be like to be dead?
Or even if we say no,

374
00:25:09.021 --> 00:25:11.810
strictly speaking,
these people didn't die at all.

375
00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.310
They were just on the border looking in.

376
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.730
They never strictly speaking died at all.

377
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:24.760
So what they were on the border looking in to suggested that couldn't be

378
00:25:24.951 --> 00:25:26.840
relevant.
Evidence is like saying,

379
00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:31.490
I can't tell you anything interesting about what's going on in the hallway right

380
00:25:31.491 --> 00:25:35.960
there now because after all,
I'm not in the hallway.
I'm hearing the lecture hall,

381
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.240
but so what,
even though I'm hearing the lecture hall,

382
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:43.300
I can see into the hallway and tell you what's going on in it.

383
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.800
So attempts to dismiss the appeal to near death experiences on what we might

384
00:25:53.091 --> 00:25:57.110
call philosophical grounds.
This would be the bad notion of philosophy.

385
00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.670
I'm philosophical grounds.

386
00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.690
I think that's gotta be misguided still.

387
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:07.930
That doesn't mean that we should believe the argument for the existence of the

388
00:26:08.031 --> 00:26:13.031
soul from near death experiences because the question remains what's the best

389
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.290
explanation of what's going on in near death experiences.
Now,

390
00:26:18.291 --> 00:26:22.700
one possibility as I suggested was you know what I call a second ago that the

391
00:26:22.701 --> 00:26:24.410
two room explanation,

392
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:28.820
there's the room of this life and there's the room of the next life and people

393
00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:33.260
who have near death experiences either temporarily we're in the second room or

394
00:26:33.261 --> 00:26:36.290
else at least they were glancing into the second room.

395
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.690
That's one possible explanation.

396
00:26:38.691 --> 00:26:41.690
But of course there's a different possible explanation.

397
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.000
The one room explanation.

398
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.730
There's just life,

399
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:53.750
this life and as you come very close to the wall of the room,

400
00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:01.580
things end up looking and seeming and feeling rather different

401
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:06.450
then they do in the middle of the room.

402
00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:11.403
<v 1>Now</v>

403
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:15.930
<v 0>maybe the one room metaphor is not the best metaphor because it immediately</v>

404
00:27:15.931 --> 00:27:19.050
prompts the question,
well,
what's on the other side of the wall?

405
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:21.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

406
00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:22.640
<v 0>And of course the physical,</v>

407
00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:27.641
his suggestion is there isn't anything on the other side of the wall.

408
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:32.930
So maybe a better way would talk about it would just be life's a biological

409
00:27:32.931 --> 00:27:36.530
process.
We're all familiar with that process,

410
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.840
sort of in its middle stretches

411
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.830
and it's closing stretches.

412
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.910
Some fairly unusual biological processes kick in.

413
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:48.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

414
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.310
<v 0>In rare but not unheard of cases.</v>

415
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.290
Some people begin to have those unusual biological processes and then return to

416
00:27:56.291 --> 00:28:00.790
the normal biological processes and can talk about what was happening in the

417
00:28:00.791 --> 00:28:03.160
unusual biological processes,

418
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:08.310
which is just to say we need to offer a biological slash physical explanation of

419
00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.420
what goes on in near death experiences.

420
00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:16.000
Now mind you,

421
00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:20.590
that's not yet to offer the physical explanation.

422
00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:23.140
It's just a promissory note.

423
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:26.620
We now have two rival explanations,

424
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:31.710
the sole dualist explanation that we went into the other world and the physical

425
00:28:32.421 --> 00:28:32.920
list,

426
00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:37.920
promissory note that we can explain the white lights and the feeling of euphoria

427
00:28:38.351 --> 00:28:41.950
and the D and C in your body from a distance in physical terms.

428
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:43.790
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

429
00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:48.590
<v 0>We don't really have very much of a physical explanation until we begin to offer</v>

430
00:28:48.591 --> 00:28:53.591
scientific accounts of each of those aspects of near death experience.

431
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:59.660
But this is in fact an area on which scientists work.

432
00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:04.100
And you saw some of the beginnings of an explanation offered in the reading by

433
00:29:04.101 --> 00:29:06.740
Shichen Vaughn.
So for example,

434
00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:11.450
when the body's in stress as would likely happened towards the end of the

435
00:29:11.451 --> 00:29:14.300
biological processes,
when the body's in stress,

436
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.150
certain endorphins get released by the body,

437
00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.060
perhaps that explains the feelings of euphoria.

438
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:22.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

439
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.970
<v 0>When the body's in stress,</v>

440
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:29.540
we have various unusual stimulations of the visual sections of the brain and

441
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.300
perhaps that explains the,

442
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.520
the white light or the feeling of compression and the tunnel.
Now.
Again,

443
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:43.300
I'm not any kind of scientist and so I'm not in any position to say,

444
00:29:43.301 --> 00:29:46.180
look,
here's the details of the explanation,

445
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.560
but you get the beginnings of that sketched in the readings.

446
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:53.523
<v 1>No,</v>

447
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.110
<v 0>it's a judgment call you've got to make.</v>

448
00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.560
Does it seem more plausible that we can explain these experiences in terms of

449
00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:07.300
the traumatic stress that your body and brain is going through,

450
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:11.920
your brain is going through when you,
you know,
are near dying

451
00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.960
towards it?
More plausible to suggest no.

452
00:30:15.961 --> 00:30:20.130
What's happened here is a soul has been released from connection with the body

453
00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.010
for mine money.

454
00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:28.550
I find the beginnings of the scientific explanation sufficiently persuasive and

455
00:30:29.461 --> 00:30:34.140
sufficiently compelling that I don't find the argument from near death

456
00:30:34.141 --> 00:30:36.690
experience as an argument for the existence of a soul.

457
00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.970
I don't find it a specialty persuasive.

458
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:42.643
<v 1>Of course,</v>

459
00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:46.970
<v 0>there are various other things we could appeal to in terms of supernatural</v>

460
00:30:46.971 --> 00:30:50.870
occurrences.
Right.
I've only mentioned,
only discussed now in detail one of them,

461
00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:55.010
but there's a variety of things about people who can communicate from the dead

462
00:30:55.011 --> 00:30:59.570
or ghosts or say answers or what have you and what the physical list would need

463
00:30:59.571 --> 00:31:03.260
to do for each one of those.
You know,

464
00:31:03.261 --> 00:31:07.520
for each one of those you can imagine a dual list who says we need to believe in

465
00:31:07.521 --> 00:31:10.670
a soul.
So as to explain seances,

466
00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.760
how do we explain the fact that the person who's conducting the seance knows

467
00:31:16.491 --> 00:31:19.130
things about you know,
your history,

468
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:21.620
that only your dead uncle would know.

469
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:26.150
The dual is can explain that by appealing to ghosts and the like.

470
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:29.030
How does the physical list explain things like that?

471
00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.590
Short answer is,
I don't know.

472
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:39.040
I'm not the kind of person who makes it his business to try to explain away

473
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:44.510
those things in physicalist,
naturalistic,

474
00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.150
materialistic,
scientific terms.

475
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:51.740
But there are people who make it their business.
So for example,

476
00:31:51.741 --> 00:31:53.600
there's a magician.
The question it's not,

477
00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:58.660
could I explain to you how the seance managers to do the amazing things that it

478
00:31:58.971 --> 00:32:03.050
does?
You're wasting your time asking somebody like me.
The person to ask is,

479
00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:04.280
is a magician,

480
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:09.970
somebody who's profession it is to fool people and they could look like they can

481
00:32:12.051 --> 00:32:15.050
do things with magic.
So in fact,

482
00:32:15.051 --> 00:32:20.051
there are professional magicians who make it their business to debunk people who

483
00:32:20.391 --> 00:32:25.391
claim to genuinely be in contact with the dead and the like.

484
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:28.131
There's a magician,

485
00:32:28.131 --> 00:32:32.090
I think his name is the amazing Randy who has a sort of standing offer.
He says,

486
00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:32.690
you know,

487
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:36.800
you show me what happened in the seance or in communication with the dead,

488
00:32:36.801 --> 00:32:38.900
what have you,
and I'll show you how to do.

489
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.790
I'll debunk it for you.
Spoiler alert.
Right?

490
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:49.430
And there's a standing offer.
He says,
you know,
I'll pay whatever the amount is,

491
00:32:49.431 --> 00:32:49.910
you know,

492
00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:54.910
$10,000 10 the first person who can document some effect,

493
00:32:55.310 --> 00:33:00.310
dawn in supernatural terms that I can't reproduce through trickery so far,

494
00:33:02.451 --> 00:33:06.730
he's never had to pay out.
Oh,
again,

495
00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:10.030
that doesn't prove that the dual list is wrong.

496
00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:13.390
It could be that there are genuine say answers.

497
00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.060
It could be if there really are ghosts,

498
00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.630
it could be that there really is communication from the dead

499
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.550
as is typically the case.

500
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:28.610
You've got to decide for yourself what strikes you as the better explanation.

501
00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

502
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:36.100
<v 0>Is the supernatural dualist explanation the more likely one or is the physical</v>

503
00:33:37.961 --> 00:33:40.640
list explanation?
The more likely one.

504
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.313
<v 1>What</v>

505
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:50.140
<v 0>you haven't dream where your dead mother has come back to talk to you.</v>

506
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.120
One possible explanation to dual list.

507
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:58.160
That's the ghost of your mother in material soul that she is communicating to

508
00:33:58.161 --> 00:34:03.110
you while you're asleep.
Second possible explanation.

509
00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.180
It's just a dream.

510
00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:10.250
Of course you dream about your mother because your unconscious cares about her.

511
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:12.890
What's the better explanation?

512
00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:18.940
We don't have the time here to go case by case by case and ask ourselves how

513
00:34:21.951 --> 00:34:25.130
does the evidence fall down one side versus the other.

514
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:29.330
But when I review the evidence,

515
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:35.350
I come away thinking there is no good reason to move beyond the physical.

516
00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.050
So again,
let's recap.

517
00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:45.590
One group of arguments for the existence of a soul says we need to posit a soul

518
00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.460
in order to explain something,

519
00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:54.330
whether it's something every day or something supernatural.

520
00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.160
<v 1>Okay.</v>

521
00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:02.160
<v 0>The existence of a soul would be the beginnings of a possible explanation.</v>

522
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.950
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

523
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:08.700
<v 0>but the question is never is that a possible explanation,</v>

524
00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.920
but is it the best explanation

525
00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.040
and when I review these various arguments,

526
00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:21.340
I come away thinking the better explanation falls with the physical list.

527
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:23.833
Mind you.

528
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:25.810
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

529
00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:30.810
<v 0>I don't want to deny that there are some things the physicalist has not yet done</v>

530
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:36.580
a very compelling job of explaining in,

531
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.270
as I've mentioned previously,

532
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:43.800
I think there are mysteries and puzzles about the nature of consciousness,

533
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:47.010
the qualitative aspect of experience,

534
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:52.050
what it's like to smell coffee or taste pineapple or see red.

535
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:56.580
It's very hard to see how you explained that in physical,
his terms.

536
00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.460
So to that extent,

537
00:35:59.461 --> 00:36:03.060
I think we can say the jury may still be out.

538
00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:05.220
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

539
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:10.220
<v 0>But I don't think what we should say is the better explanation lies with the</v>

540
00:36:11.581 --> 00:36:16.581
dual list because I think positive in his soul doesn't really yet offer us the

541
00:36:18.511 --> 00:36:19.500
explanation.

542
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:23.670
It just holds out the promise of an explanation.

543
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:29.030
So at best that's a tie and hence no compelling reason to accept the existence

544
00:36:29.701 --> 00:36:30.534
of a soul.

545
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:38.650
It would be one thing if we could see that no conceivable physicalist

546
00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:43.420
explanation could possibly work,

547
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.840
but I don't think we're in that situation.

548
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:48.210
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

549
00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:52.650
<v 0>All we're in right now is perhaps an existence up with a guard to consciousness.</v>

550
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:56.940
Maybe some other things we don't yet see how to explain it,

551
00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.670
but not yet seen.

552
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:04.700
How to explain it is not the same thing as seeing that it can't be explained on

553
00:37:05.581 --> 00:37:08.960
physicalist terms.
Of course,
again,

554
00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:13.700
if we had a dualist explanation with some details really worked out

555
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.210
<v 1>okay,</v>

556
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.730
<v 0>maybe we'd have to say,
look,
this is the better explanation,</v>

557
00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:22.620
but dualism doesn't so much offer the explanation.
Typically as just say,

558
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.370
well,
maybe we'd be better off positing something immaterial

559
00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.140
that I think is not a very compelling argument.

560
00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:31.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

561
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:36.950
<v 0>Well let's ask what other kinds of arguments could be offered for the existence</v>

562
00:37:38.131 --> 00:37:38.730
of a soul?

563
00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:42.210
I want to emphasize the point that the various arguments I've been talking about

564
00:37:42.211 --> 00:37:43.200
so far,

565
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:48.390
although they have this common strand inference to the best explanation are each

566
00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.150
separate and distinct arguments.

567
00:37:51.151 --> 00:37:53.610
One of them might work even though the other ones don't work,

568
00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.200
but I want to turn now to a rather different kind of argument.

569
00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:03.860
The argument I'm about to sketch is a purely philosophical argument.

570
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:12.770
Not really so much a matter of who can explain this or that feature of us better

571
00:38:12.771 --> 00:38:13.880
than anybody else.

572
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:19.510
It's an argument that doesn't seem to have any empirical premises works from

573
00:38:20.301 --> 00:38:25.301
purely armchair philosophical reflection and the striking thing is that many

574
00:38:26.241 --> 00:38:29.000
people find this a pretty compelling argument.
The argument,

575
00:38:29.001 --> 00:38:33.200
I'm going to give traces back to Descartes,

576
00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.520
the great early modern philosopher,

577
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.180
well not going to follow the details,
it was talking about be the basic idea.

578
00:38:42.181 --> 00:38:47.181
It goes back to Descartes and it starts by asking you to imagine a story.

579
00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.520
So I'm going to tell the story in the first person I'm not tell about myself,

580
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.350
but you'll sort of,
you'll find the argument sort of perhaps more persuasive if,

581
00:38:57.351 --> 00:39:01.550
as I tell the story,
you imagine the story being told about you.

582
00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:05.180
So each one of you should translate this into a story about yourself.
You know,

583
00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.940
your morning.
So this is a story about my morning.

584
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:10.340
Imagine this isn't of course actually happen.

585
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:14.180
But imagine the crucial point here is simply that we can imagine this story

586
00:39:14.181 --> 00:39:15.014
happening.

587
00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:16.350
<v 1>Okay?</v>

588
00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:21.120
<v 0>Not even that we think it's so impuricably possible.
Just it's,
it's conceivable.</v>

589
00:39:21.121 --> 00:39:23.610
It's an imaginable story.
All right,

590
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:27.120
so suppose that I woke up this morning.

591
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.470
That is just say at a certain point,

592
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:36.800
I look around my room and I see the familiar sights of my dark and bedroom.

593
00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:38.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

594
00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:43.780
<v 0>I hear it.
Perhaps the sounds of the cars outside my house,</v>

595
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:47.320
my alarm clock ringing,
what have you.

596
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:50.920
I move out of the room toward the bathroom,

597
00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:55.870
planning to brush my teeth as I enter the bathroom.
It's much more light.

598
00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:01.200
I look in the mirror and here's where things get really weird.

599
00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:06.700
I don't see anything.
Normally.
Of course when I look in the mirror,

600
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:10.330
I see my face,
I see my head,

601
00:40:10.331 --> 00:40:14.980
I see the reflection of my torso,
but now as I'm looking into the mirror,

602
00:40:14.981 --> 00:40:19.660
I don't see anything at all.
Instead,
I see the shower reflected behind me.

603
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:24.310
Normally that's blocked of course by me,
by my body,

604
00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:28.150
but I don't see my body slightly freaked out.

605
00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.340
I reach for my head,

606
00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:34.840
or perhaps we should say I reached for where I would expect my head to be,

607
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.290
but I don't feel anything there.

608
00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:39.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

609
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:44.290
<v 0>Glancing down at my arms,
I don't see any arms.</v>

610
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.830
Now I'm really panicking.

611
00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:52.810
As I began trying to touch my body,
I don't feel anything.

612
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.600
I don't,
not only can I feel,
I think with my fingers,

613
00:40:55.870 --> 00:41:00.070
I don't have any sensations where my body should be.

614
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:02.980
Now we could continue this story,

615
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:08.760
but I probably said enough for you to grant that what I've just started doing,

616
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:14.770
a novelist could do a better job of telling the story than I just did.

617
00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.840
But what I've just done was basically,

618
00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:22.100
imagine I've imagined a story in which I discovered that my body doesn't exist,

619
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:28.230
or I've imagined a story in which my body's perhaps ceased to exist or I've

620
00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:33.260
imagined a story in which I exist,
or at least my mind exists.
You know,

621
00:41:33.261 --> 00:41:38.210
I'm,
I'm,
I'm thinking thoughts like,
why can't I see my body in the mirror?

622
00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:43.010
Why can't I feel my head?
What's going on?
I'm panicking,
right?

623
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:48.130
We've got a story in which I'm thinking all sorts of thoughts.

624
00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:54.020
My mind clearly exists and yet for all that my body does not exist.

625
00:41:56.350 --> 00:42:00.980
We,
we can certainly it Siemens.
Imagine that possibility.

626
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:07.420
Now the brilliant thing about this argument is it goes from that to a conclusion

627
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:13.210
about there being a difference between my mind and my body.

628
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:19.930
What we've just done after all is imagine that my mind exists,

629
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.840
but my body does not.

630
00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:29.610
And what does that show day cart says what it shows is the mind and the body

631
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.680
must be to logically distinct things.

632
00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:41.820
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

633
00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:46.820
<v 0>the mind and the body cannot be the same thing.</v>

634
00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:49.650
Because after all,

635
00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:54.680
what I just did was imagine my mind existing with out my body.

636
00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.920
But how could I even do that?
Even in imagination?

637
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:07.100
How could it even be possible to imagine my mind without my body if talking

638
00:43:10.021 --> 00:43:14.010
about my mind is just a way of talking about my body.

639
00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:19.290
If they're really bottom line,
metaphysically speaking,
the same thing,

640
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:23.880
then you couldn't have one without the other.

641
00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:28.950
I mean after all so,
so,
so,
so here's a podium,

642
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:35.850
try to tell a story in which this podium exists,

643
00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:38.730
but this podium does not exist.

644
00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:43.860
You can't do it right.
If the podium is just one thing,

645
00:43:43.861 --> 00:43:44.700
the podium,

646
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.420
and if there's just one thing you could tell a story in which it exists,

647
00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:50.640
you could tell a story in which it doesn't exist,

648
00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:54.270
but you can't tell a story in which it exists and doesn't exist.

649
00:43:56.690 --> 00:44:01.690
If I can tell a story in which a exists and B doesn't exist,

650
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:07.580
it's got to follow that.

651
00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:12.610
A and B are not the same thing because if B was just another word for another

652
00:44:17.361 --> 00:44:22.361
way of talking about a than to imagine a existing but be not existing would be

653
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:30.490
imagining a existing but well B is just a not existing,

654
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:36.710
but of course you can't imagine a world in which a exists but a doesn't exist.

655
00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:40.790
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

656
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:42.440
<v 0>put the same point the other way around.</v>

657
00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:47.560
If I can imagine a without B,

658
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:53.650
then a m B have to be logically distinct things.

659
00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:58.400
They cannot be identical.

660
00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:01.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

661
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:06.200
<v 0>But since I can imagine my mind existing without my body,</v>

662
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:14.990
it follows that my mind and my body have to be logically distinct things.

663
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:23.010
They cannot be identical.

664
00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:27.690
My mind cannot just be a way of talking.

665
00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:32.640
Talking about my mind cannot just be a way of talking about my body

666
00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:39.560
now.
It's very cool.
Argh.

667
00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:39.830
You know,

668
00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:44.830
philosophers love this argument and I've got to tell you to this day,

669
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:50.390
there's a debate in the philosophical community about whether or not this

670
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:52.650
argument works.

671
00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:03.350
It's one thing to be clear,
a couple of things to be clear about.

672
00:46:03.351 --> 00:46:06.680
What exactly is this argument not doing?

673
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.250
The argument is not sane.

674
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.410
If something is possible,
if I can imagine it.
It's true.

675
00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:18.440
Yeah.
I can imagine unicorns.

676
00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.020
That doesn't mean unicorns exist.

677
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:26.280
That's not what the argument is saying.

678
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:31.080
The argument is only making a much more specific claim.

679
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:35.790
If I can imagine one thing without the other,

680
00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:38.760
they must be separate things.
Now,
of course,

681
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.580
it could still be that in the real world,

682
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:44.550
the one thing cannot exist without the other.

683
00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:49.650
There may be some sort of metaphysical laws that tie the two things so tightly

684
00:46:49.651 --> 00:46:53.160
together that you will never actually get one without the other.

685
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.630
That's not the question.

686
00:46:55.350 --> 00:47:00.350
The point is just if I can at least imagine the one thing without the other,

687
00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:06.290
they must in fact be two separate things because if it was really just one thing

688
00:47:08.641 --> 00:47:12.360
there,
you couldn't imagine it without it.

689
00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:18.710
Since I can imagine my mind without my body,

690
00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:24.860
it must be the case that my mind is something separate and distinct from my

691
00:47:26.971 --> 00:47:28.650
body.
Otherwise,

692
00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:33.740
how could I imagine it existing without the body if they were the same thing,

693
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.080
I couldn't.
I can't imagine the body existing without the body.

694
00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:40.570
If the mind is just a way of talking about the body,

695
00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:42.940
how could I imagine the mind without the body,

696
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:47.590
since I can imagine the mind without the body,

697
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:52.210
it follows that they're separate.
So the mind is not the body.

698
00:47:52.211 --> 00:47:55.360
After all,
it's something different.
It's the soul.

699
00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:00.250
Is that a good argument or not?
That's where we'll start next time.
