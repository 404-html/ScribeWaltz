00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.620
We've been working our way through Plato's arguments for the immortality of the

2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:09.621
soul and last time I spent a fair bit of time working through objections to uh,

3
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.230
not quite the last argument we're going to look at,

4
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:14.370
but the pen ultimate argument,

5
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:17.700
which Plato tries to argue for the simplicity of the soul,

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.730
the set of connected ideas you recall were these,

7
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:24.960
that Plato wants to suggest that in order to be destroyed,

8
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:28.830
you've got to have parts to destroy something is to basically sort of take its

9
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:33.060
parts apart.
If he could only convince us that the soul was simple,

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.660
it would follow that it was indestructable and hence immortal.

11
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.740
You asked what's our evidence for some things being in disruptable?

12
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:43.830
What kinds of things are simple while these are,

13
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:48.660
he then goes on to claim invisible things.
Things that don't change after all.

14
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.230
Changing is a matter of the rearrangement of the parts.

15
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.220
And so if something can change,
it can't be simple.

16
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.660
Maybe it could be destroyed.

17
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.010
But if we could become convinced that the soul was not composite,

18
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:05.640
if it was something that did,
couldn't change,
than it would be simple.

19
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.440
Perhaps then it would be in disruptable.

20
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.150
And then he goes on to suggest that the invisibility of the soul is evidence for

21
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:16.290
its being.
Changeless enhance simple and hence indestructable.

22
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.350
So that's the argument we worked through last time and I spent a fair bit of

23
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:24.351
time suggesting that if you pin down precisely what Plato means by invisible,

24
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.640
the argument doesn't actually go through
before leaving at argument.

25
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:33.540
There's a couple of extra remarks I want to make about it.
First,

26
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.080
we probably shouldn't have been so quick to want to buy into this suggestion

27
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.740
that the soul is changeless after all.

28
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.180
If you think about it,
it seems that at least on the face of it,

29
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:52.890
the soul does indeed change on one day.
You believe,

30
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:56.130
for example,
that a,
it's hot on another day.

31
00:01:56.131 --> 00:02:00.540
You believe that it's cold on one day.
Uh,
you believe that you know,

32
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:03.570
so and so a is a nice person on the next day.

33
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:06.230
I believe that so and so's a mean person.
You're you,

34
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.410
you desire to learn the piano the next day you give up on that desire,

35
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.680
your beliefs,
your goals,
your intentions,
your desires.

36
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.780
These things are all constantly changing and so at least on the face of it,

37
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:22.110
it looks as though we might well want to say the soul.

38
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.730
If we do believe there are souls,

39
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:27.870
the soul is changing as well in terms of what thoughts and beliefs it's housing,

40
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.180
so we should have been skeptical in the first place of any argument that said,

41
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.000
based on the invisibility of the soul,

42
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:41.001
we can conclude that it's changeless doesn't seem to be in fact changeless.

43
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.820
Furthermore,
we should be,

44
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:49.530
or at least we might well be skeptical of the claim that the soul is simple.

45
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.610
Indeed,

46
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.610
Plato himself in other dialogues argues against the simplicity of the soul.

47
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.890
Now,
that doesn't mean he's right in other dialogues,

48
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:03.190
but at least suggests that we shouldn't be so ready to assume that that sort of

49
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:06.710
position is correct.
In the republic famously played.

50
00:03:06.711 --> 00:03:10.450
It goes on to argue that the soul has at least three different parts.

51
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:14.680
There's a rational part that's control,
that's in charge of reasoning.

52
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.670
There's a spirited part that sort of like the will.
There's an APP,

53
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.380
a part that has to do with appetite.
Uh,
the desires for food,
drink,

54
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:24.430
sex,
what have you.

55
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.570
Plato elsewhere argues the soul is not simple at all.

56
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.080
So perhaps it shouldn't shock us that the argument he's sketching here for the

57
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:40.261
simplicity of the soul based on the changeless and visible nature of the soul,

58
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.140
perhaps it shouldn't shock us that that argument doesn't succeed after all.

59
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.800
Finally,

60
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.310
although I gave Plato previously the assumption that if only we could establish

61
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:59.200
the simplicity of the soul,
it would follow.

62
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:01.630
The soul was indestructable after all,

63
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.590
you couldn't break a soul by tearing it's pieces apart.

64
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.130
If it didn't have pieces,
if it didn't have parts.
Nonetheless,

65
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:14.080
I just want to register the thought that it's not actually obvious that simple's

66
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.080
can't be destroyed.
Well,

67
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:22.030
they clearly can't be destroyed by the particular method of destruction that

68
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:25.510
involves taking them apart.
They don't have parts,

69
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.810
you can't take them apart.
But for all that,

70
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:33.370
it still seems conceptually possible for a simple to be destroyed in the

71
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:37.840
following sense.
It goes out of existence.

72
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.160
After all.
Where did the simples come from in the first place?
Well,

73
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:44.650
at least from a logical point of view,

74
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:49.651
it seems as though there's no difficulty in imagining that at one point a given

75
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:54.691
simple didn't exist and then at the next point it popped into existence.

76
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.400
Well,
how did that happen?
Maybe God said,
you know,

77
00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:01.840
God says the beginning of Genesis,
let there be light.
You know,
so maybe he says,

78
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.410
let there be symbols right given moment.

79
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:09.970
They weren't there the next moment they were.
Well after a while,
maybe God says,

80
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.270
let the simples no longer exist given moment there they were the next moment

81
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.670
they no longer exist.
Seems as though that idea makes sense.

82
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.990
And so even if we agreed that the soul was simple,

83
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:29.530
even if we granted everything in Plato's argument up to this point and said,

84
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.540
there's soul really is simple,
it's still wouldn't follow that it's a mortal.

85
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.990
We'd still have to worry about the possibility that the simple soul might simply

86
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.450
pop out of existence at a given point,

87
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.570
perhaps the very point when the body gets destroyed.

88
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.820
So I'm inclined to think that this most recent argument of Plato's,

89
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:55.900
the argument from simplicity that's not successful either.

90
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.000
Before that argument,
there's one other piece of business.

91
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:03.740
I want to discuss this as a footnote that I put aside or a a point that I put

92
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:04.760
aside previously.

93
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.260
You'll recall that we were worried about the objection got raised,

94
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:14.261
that the right way to think about the soul is like the harmony of a harp.

95
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.810
And this was originally offered as a counter example to,
uh,
the,

96
00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:20.720
the thought that invisible things couldn't be destroyed,

97
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:22.700
but harmony could be destroyed.
It was invisible.

98
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:27.440
So invisible things could be destroyed.
But I noticed,

99
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.190
I mentioned that,
look,
whether or not this is a problem for the argument,

100
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:36.140
it's an interesting suggestion in its own right because the suggestion that the

101
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:40.700
mind is to the body,
the soul is to the body.
Like harmony is to a,

102
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:45.701
an instrument with strings seems to need to be an early attempt to describe

103
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:51.161
something like the physicalist conception of the mind just as harmony is

104
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:55.250
something that gets produced by a well tuned instrument.

105
00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.260
The soul or the mind is something that gets produced by a well tuned body.

106
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.440
Now Plato's got some objections to the suggestion that we should think of the

107
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:11.441
mind as the harmony of the body and so I want to take just a moment and talk

108
00:07:12.591 --> 00:07:17.591
about those objections because of course if they were compelling objections that

109
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:22.520
might well give us reason to doubt the physicalist view whether or not play

110
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:25.370
those arguments for the immortality of the soul work.

111
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.880
He might still have some good arguments against the physicalist conception,

112
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.760
but in thinking about these objections,

113
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:36.530
it's important to bear in mind that it's only meant the harmony analogies only

114
00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:41.360
meant as just that as an analogy,
right?
The claim isn't,

115
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:43.670
or at least it shouldn't be understood as sane.

116
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:49.040
Literally the mind is harmony.

117
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.350
It's rather the mind is like harmony.

118
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.500
It's the sort of thing to the body like harmony is to a harp up something that

119
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:04.610
can be produced by a well functioning,
well tuned physical object.

120
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.080
A well tuned instrument can produce melody and harmony are well tuned.

121
00:08:09.081 --> 00:08:13.400
Properly functioning body can produce mental activity.

122
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.360
That's the suggestion and so even if it turns out that there are some ways in

123
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:22.361
which the mind isn't exactly like harmony doesn't show us that the physical list

124
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:28.700
views wrong,
we'll still,
let's quickly look at what Plato's arguments were first.

125
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.350
This is I think an interesting argument.

126
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:35.470
Plato says harmony clearly cannot exist before the existence of the harp itself,

127
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:41.360
right?

128
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.360
The melodious ness of the harp can't exist prior to the physical construction of

129
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:47.534
the harp

130
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.720
and if mind where the sort of thing that were pro that was produced by the

131
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:56.020
proper functioning of the body,

132
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.200
then pretty obviously the mind could not exist prior to the creation of the

133
00:09:01.361 --> 00:09:03.010
physical body.
However,

134
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:04.560
<v 1>okay.</v>

135
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.560
<v 0>Plato has already argued earlier in the dialog that the soul does exist prior to</v>

136
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:13.320
the existence of the body.
That's the argument from recollection.

137
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.850
Soul exists prior to the body.
It can't be like harmony.

138
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.830
Physicalism is clearly gotta be false.

139
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

140
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.620
<v 0>But I said that I didn't find the argument.</v>

141
00:09:23.621 --> 00:09:27.220
I tried to explain why I didn't find the argument from recollection persuasive.

142
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:32.370
I certainly do want to agree that if we became convinced that the soul did exist

143
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.810
prior to the existence of the body,

144
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.130
we would certainly want to agree that the soul is not like harmony.

145
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.030
But I don't think the argument from recollection succeeds.

146
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:51.540
Plato's second objection is to point out that harmony can vary.

147
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.730
You know,
we talk about the melodious newness of the,

148
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.270
the harp will,

149
00:09:58.271 --> 00:10:02.890
it can be harmonious in a variety of different ways and indeed to different

150
00:10:02.891 --> 00:10:03.820
degrees.

151
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.233
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

152
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.340
<v 0>Something,
an instrument can be more or less harmonious.</v>

153
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.910
What it's playing can be in greater or lesser harmony,

154
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.540
but it doesn't seem as though souls come in degrees.

155
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.750
You've got a soul,
you don't have a soul.
That's the argument.

156
00:10:23.751 --> 00:10:26.120
That's the objection.
You've got a mind you don't have in mind.

157
00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:27.970
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

158
00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.250
<v 0>but perhaps we should.
That's the objection.
Of course.
If that was right,</v>

159
00:10:30.251 --> 00:10:34.360
then again,
we might have to conclude,
well,
whatever the mind is,

160
00:10:34.361 --> 00:10:37.030
it's not quite like harmony is to the body,

161
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.670
but I'm not so sure we should agree that the mind can't come in degrees.

162
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.430
It can at least the,

163
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.610
the mental aspects can come in degrees.

164
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.210
We can have varying degrees of intelligence,

165
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.170
varying degrees of creativity,

166
00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.800
varying degrees of reasonableness,

167
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.130
varying degrees of ability to communicate.

168
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.180
So just as we might say,

169
00:11:07.181 --> 00:11:12.181
just as the functioning of the harp can come in varying degrees,

170
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.430
more or less harmony.

171
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:17.483
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

172
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:22.570
<v 0>The functioning of the body in terms of its mind can come in varying degrees.</v>

173
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:30.950
So that second objection doesn't seem to me very compelling.
Third Objection.

174
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.330
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

175
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.230
<v 0>Plato points out,</v>

176
00:11:34.231 --> 00:11:39.231
Socrates points out that the soul can be good or it could be evil.

177
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:40.674
Wicked.

178
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.600
When the soul is good,

179
00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:50.601
when you've got somebody who's sort of got their stuff together,

180
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.670
we might speak of them having a harmonious soul.

181
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

182
00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.420
<v 0>If the soul were to the body like harmony is to the instrument and the soul can</v>

183
00:12:02.901 --> 00:12:04.010
be harmonious,

184
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.940
it would seem as though we'd have to be able to talk about harmony being

185
00:12:07.941 --> 00:12:08.870
harmonious.

186
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:10.520
<v 1>Okay,</v>

187
00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.550
<v 0>so just as we can talk about the harmony of the soul,
we'd have to be able to,</v>

188
00:12:13.551 --> 00:12:15.740
if the soul is like the harmony of the body,

189
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.990
we'd have to go to talk about the harmony of the harmony,

190
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.960
but we don't talk about harmony of the harmony,

191
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.450
not quite sure what to make of this objection.

192
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:28.810
This might be a point where it'd be well to remind ourselves of the fact that

193
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:33.400
the suggestion was never that the soul just literally is harmony.

194
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:38.490
It's just similar to harmony says the physical list in the way that harmony gets

195
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:43.240
produced by the body,
by the,
by the instrument.
In that same way,

196
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.020
mind or mental activity gets produced by the body.

197
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.920
We don't have to say that everything that's true of the mind is true of harmony.

198
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:51.970
Everything that's true,

199
00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:56.470
harmony is true of the body or the mind still.

200
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.940
I think there's a bit more we can say in response to this objection.
That's this.

201
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

202
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:08.550
<v 0>Just as it's true that we can talk about minds or souls being good or wicked,</v>

203
00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.640
we can talk about different kinds of harmony.

204
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:22.250
There's
certain harmonies are sweeter than others.

205
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.620
Some of them are more jarring and a tone or discord,

206
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:35.760
although we might not normally talk about how harmonious the harmony is.

207
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:41.300
It seems as though harmonies can come in different sorts of different kinds,

208
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.600
and then it turns out that really what happened in the allergy to the mind,

209
00:13:45.601 --> 00:13:48.870
which can come in different sorts and different kinds.

210
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.890
So I think this third objection isn't really compelling either.

211
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.073
Finally,

212
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.660
<v 1>yeah,</v>

213
00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.970
<v 0>Plato Racist,
one more objection.
He says,
look,</v>

214
00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:04.690
the sole is capable of directing the body,

215
00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.680
bossing it around,

216
00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:11.900
and indeed capable of opposing the body.
Know your,

217
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.100
your body might want that piece of chocolate cake,
but your soul says,
no,
no,

218
00:14:16.101 --> 00:14:17.810
you're on a diet.
Don't eat it.
All right.

219
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.170
Your soul can oppose the body.

220
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:28.170
But if the soul was just harmony of the body,

221
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:33.940
how can it do that?
After all,

222
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
the harmoniousness of the harp can't affect what the harp does.

223
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.060
The Ha,
it's all the,
all the causal interactions.

224
00:14:46.061 --> 00:14:51.061
One way as we might put it in the case of the harp and the and the musicality

225
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:53.930
and the melodious and and the harmony,

226
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:59.140
the physical state of the harp causes the melodious and this to be the way it

227
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:00.074
is,

228
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:05.350
but the harmoniousness of the harp doesn't ever change or alter or direct the

229
00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:11.090
way the physical object to harp is.

230
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:13.503
<v 1>Okay.</v>

231
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:18.380
<v 0>In contrast,
not only can the body affect the soul,</v>

232
00:15:18.381 --> 00:15:21.430
the soul can affect the body,
so that's ingested,

233
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.850
can't really be like harmony and the harp after all.

234
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:32.200
I think that's a pretty interesting objection since we do think at least in the

235
00:15:32.201 --> 00:15:36.970
kind of position that we've been taking for this class that the soul can affect

236
00:15:36.971 --> 00:15:37.804
the body.

237
00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:43.260
We might ask how could it be that it's that the physical list view is right.

238
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:44.130
If,

239
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:49.130
if talk about the mind is just a way of talking about what the body can do,

240
00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:54.780
how can the abilities of the body affect the body itself?

241
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.110
I think the answer to this objection is probably going to be something like,

242
00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:05.570
<v 1>yeah,</v>

243
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:10.570
<v 0>what's really going on when we talk about the soul affecting the body is that</v>

244
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:19.450
when we say certain functions of the body are affecting the body,

245
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:22.070
there are certain mental functions are affecting the body.

246
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.260
How does this happen causally?
Well,

247
00:16:24.261 --> 00:16:29.261
something like the physical parts of the body that underwrite that lie beneath

248
00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.600
the proper functioning,
the proper mental functioning of the body,

249
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:41.120
those are able to alter the other parts of the body.

250
00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:46.070
So look right now I'm telling my body,
wiggle my fingers.

251
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.840
My soul is getting instructions to my body.
How does that happen?

252
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.850
That's my mind giving instructions to my body.

253
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.450
How does that happen on the physical list view?
Well,

254
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.400
my mind giving instructions and my body wiggle.

255
00:16:59.401 --> 00:17:02.810
My fingers is just one part of my body.

256
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:08.710
My brain giving instructions to another part of my body,

257
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.180
the muscles in my fingers.

258
00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:18.650
So although we talk about the mind altering the body strictly what's going on

259
00:17:24.241 --> 00:17:24.860
there,

260
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:29.860
it says the physical list is just one part of the body affecting another part of

261
00:17:31.471 --> 00:17:32.304
the body.

262
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

263
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:38.610
<v 0>Can we have something like that with a harp?
Well,
you know,
maybe not.
Right.
Maybe.</v>

264
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.130
Maybe the harps too simple.

265
00:17:41.131 --> 00:17:45.870
A machine to have one part of it affect another part of it in that way.

266
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.730
Even if that was true,

267
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.850
that wouldn't give us reason to the physicalist conception.

268
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.530
It would just give us reason to think.

269
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:57.000
The harps not very much like the mind and the body.

270
00:17:57.001 --> 00:18:02.001
It's just the beginnings of a picture of a physicalist picture still.

271
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.460
Even if we think about the harp and musicality,

272
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.700
I think we can see something analogous.

273
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:14.570
Suppose I pluck a string on my harp producing a certain note.

274
00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.920
As we know the vibrations of one string can set into play the other strings

275
00:18:24.371 --> 00:18:26.140
vibrating as well.

276
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.380
<v 1>Okay,</v>

277
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:33.210
<v 0>and so suddenly what's happening in one part of the harp affects what's going on</v>

278
00:18:33.211 --> 00:18:34.470
in other parts of the harp.

279
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.680
The musicality of my plane is certain chord on the harp may create certain kinds

280
00:18:41.431 --> 00:18:45.690
of overtones in the harp setting,

281
00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:50.190
the harp vibrating and various other ways.
Well,
that would be analogous.

282
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.110
Perhaps not a precise analogy,

283
00:18:52.111 --> 00:18:57.111
but at least a rough analogy to what goes on when my mind affects my body to it.

284
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.600
One part of my body affects other parts of my body.

285
00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:06.030
<v 1>So</v>

286
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:11.030
<v 0>on the one hand I want to give Plato a fair bit of credit for taking the</v>

287
00:19:12.581 --> 00:19:17.560
physical list view seriously enough to try to criticize it.

288
00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.320
And since when he was writing it,
then,
you know the word,

289
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:24.500
the kind of complicated thinking machines that we've got nowadays.

290
00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:29.560
It's no criticism of Plato that he used simple machines like musical instruments

291
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.290
to try to think about what a physical his picture would look like.

292
00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:33.940
Want to give him credit,

293
00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:39.230
but also want to suggest that the objections that he raises to the physicalist

294
00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.750
view just don't succeed.

295
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

296
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.841
<v 0>All right.</v>

297
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:47.841
Now there's one other argument that I want to consider in our dialogue and after

298
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.060
the appeal to the simplicity of the soul,

299
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.740
there's a very long complicated discussion about what constitutes an adequate

300
00:19:55.741 --> 00:19:59.070
explanation.
And Socrates gives some of his,
uh,

301
00:19:59.071 --> 00:20:02.220
his history there and talks about what he's looking for and trying to find

302
00:20:02.221 --> 00:20:05.670
adequate explanations of things.
And these passages are very,

303
00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:08.640
very difficult and you know,
happily for our purposes,

304
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:13.140
we don't really need to go there before the dialogue ends though.

305
00:20:13.141 --> 00:20:17.700
There's one further argument which I'll dub the argument from essential

306
00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:22.440
properties.
Now again,

307
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:26.970
it's important to bear in mind is we tried to make sense of this passage that

308
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:30.240
Plato is writing at a time when,

309
00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:32.330
<v 1>okay,</v>

310
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:33.290
<v 0>we don't have,</v>

311
00:20:33.291 --> 00:20:38.291
we didn't have all the conceptual apparatus that we have nowadays.

312
00:20:38.961 --> 00:20:41.780
We are,
we stand on his shoulders.

313
00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:47.260
We've inherited some of the distinctions that he was the first to try to into

314
00:20:47.411 --> 00:20:51.610
play
and so although again,
he's about to,

315
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:52.550
I'm about to sketch a,

316
00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:57.551
reconstruct an argument and and claim that the argument doesn't actually work is

317
00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.940
isn't really meant by way of dis be dismissive of Plato.

318
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.280
I wanted to give him a tremendous amount of credit.

319
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.400
He's trying to see his way through a morass of issues that are still confusing

320
00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:10.690
to us today.

321
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:14.470
Though I think we can see somewhat further than he was able to see any rate.

322
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.210
That distinction,
we need to understand.

323
00:21:16.211 --> 00:21:21.211
The final argument is the distinction between an essential property and a

324
00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:23.320
contingent property.

325
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.340
And essential property is a property that again,

326
00:21:28.341 --> 00:21:30.490
an object must have.

327
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.300
It always has as long as it exists at all.

328
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:39.100
A contingent property is a property that an object may have,

329
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.930
may happen to have its entire existence,
but could have existed without.

330
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:48.760
So my car is blue,

331
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:52.390
that's a contingent property of my car.

332
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:56.500
I could take it to the paint shop and get it painted red,

333
00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.560
in which case it wouldn't be red,
it would no longer be blue,

334
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:04.300
but the car would still exist.
My car is blue,

335
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.880
but it could be red,

336
00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.610
it could exist as a red car.

337
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.710
And even if I never over the entire course of existence of my car,

338
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.210
never get it painted.

339
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.290
So that from the moment it came into creation to the moment gets smashed.

340
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:24.100
It's always blue.
Still,

341
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:29.160
we understand perfectly well the idea that it could have been read it if there's

342
00:22:29.411 --> 00:22:34.240
nothing to incompatible with the idea that this car exists and is red.

343
00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.790
So that's an example of a contingent property.

344
00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:42.190
And you know,
I might have a pencil and the pencil is,
is uh,

345
00:22:42.191 --> 00:22:45.580
is whole and I never break it,
but I could have broken it.

346
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.330
That's contingent property.
Whether the Pencil is whole or broken.

347
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.760
I take a piece of metal,
it's contingent property,
whether it's straight or bent,

348
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:59.440
my bend it now it's bent.
I might straighten back out.
Now it's straight.
Many,

349
00:22:59.441 --> 00:23:03.640
many properties are contingent properties.
You're happy,

350
00:23:03.641 --> 00:23:05.860
you're sad,
you're awake,
you're asleep.

351
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:12.240
But some properties and contrast are essential properties for the particular

352
00:23:14.531 --> 00:23:16.360
thing that we're thinking about.

353
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.750
It's not possible to have that thing and not have the property in question

354
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:29.370
played or gives the example of fire and being hot.

355
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.690
Fire is hot.
That's a property that it's God,

356
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.430
but it's not a contingent property.
It's an essential property.

357
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.520
It's not as though some fire is hot and some fire is cold or oh yes,

358
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.390
it just happens.
It over the entire life of the fire.
The fire is hot,

359
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:55.280
but we could have made it cold.
There was no such thing.

360
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.750
There could be no such thing as cold fire.

361
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:07.190
As long as you got a bit of fire.
It's hot.

362
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.480
Take away the heat.

363
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.170
You take away the fire,
you destroy the fire.

364
00:24:15.171 --> 00:24:18.680
You can't have cold fire.

365
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:23.330
That's an example of an essential property.

366
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.380
They say Plato sees as an D.
I take it.

367
00:24:28.381 --> 00:24:32.820
We all see at least roughly that there's some sort of distinction there and he's

368
00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:36.660
trying to see his way clear on these matters.

369
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.980
That's a remains.

370
00:24:37.981 --> 00:24:42.981
A controversial question today until today are they're really essential

371
00:24:44.191 --> 00:24:48.600
properties and the way we take their to be.
If so,

372
00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:53.250
which properties are essential?
Which ones are contingent?

373
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:58.890
Water's composed of h two o.
That's its atomic structure.

374
00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.770
Is that an essential property of water?

375
00:25:01.771 --> 00:25:06.771
Could you have something that was water without being composed of h two o

376
00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.760
hydrogen and oxygen and that way?
No.
Some people say yes.
Some people say no,

377
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.040
but it most of us who want to say,
oh,

378
00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:17.100
there's an example of an essential property to be water.

379
00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:21.600
You must have that atomic structure.
All right.
That's the thought.

380
00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:26.400
Now armed with this distinction,
Plato says,

381
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:30.900
here's any essential property for the soul.

382
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.780
Wherever there's a soul.

383
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:35.973
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

384
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:36.913
<v 0>it's alive</v>

385
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.500
now by alive.
I take it,

386
00:25:42.501 --> 00:25:47.501
Plato means it's thinking or it's capable of thought.

387
00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:53.330
Wherever you've got a soul,
you've got something capable of thought.

388
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:55.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

389
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.750
<v 0>I suppose one could try to resist this claim of Plato's,</v>

390
00:25:58.751 --> 00:26:02.020
but I find it reasonably plausible.

391
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.630
I start thinking about mines and I asked myself,

392
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.860
could there be a mind that was incapable of thought?

393
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:10.360
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

394
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.830
<v 0>maybe,
maybe not.
Maybe that sort of just sort of built in to mines.</v>

395
00:26:14.831 --> 00:26:16.840
By definition,
we're just like,

396
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.290
you couldn't have something that was fire without it being hot,

397
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.260
so you couldn't have something that was a mind without.

398
00:26:23.261 --> 00:26:27.430
It's being capable of thought.
Important to say the word capable here,
right?
Not.

399
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.800
It's not as though all mine's always are thinking.

400
00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:34.990
I presumed there are stretches during the night when my mind is not thinking,

401
00:26:34.991 --> 00:26:37.810
not dreaming.
Still it's capable of thought,

402
00:26:37.811 --> 00:26:39.910
even though it's not thinking at the time,
but

403
00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.410
you say,
no,
here's a mine that's not even capable of thought I want to say.

404
00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.360
Then it's just not a mine.
So all right.

405
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:53.940
Maybe being capable of thought is an essential property of the mind.

406
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.880
Plato thinks about the mind in terms of souls,

407
00:26:56.881 --> 00:27:00.810
so maybe being capable of thoughts and essential property of the soul.

408
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:05.340
And I think that's what played on means when he suggests the mind is essentially

409
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:08.250
the sole is essentially alive.

410
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.630
It's a necessary property as we might put it,

411
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:16.980
of the soul,
that it's alive and it's capable of thoughts.
So to say,

412
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:21.300
loud an implausible claim,
let's give it to Socrates.

413
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.090
But once we give it to Socrates,

414
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:30.210
Plato thinks now he's pretty much done.
After all,

415
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.640
think about what it means to say that something's got an essential property.

416
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.550
Fires got the essential property of being hot.

417
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.530
I mean it's the only two possibilities.

418
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:46.340
Either you've got some fire and it will be hot or the fire's been destroyed.

419
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.830
It's been put out.
There was the only two possibilities you'll either have,
if,

420
00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:55.500
if heat is an essential property of fire,

421
00:27:55.501 --> 00:28:00.501
either you've got some fire and it's hot or the fire no longer exists.

422
00:28:01.411 --> 00:28:02.244
It's been put out.

423
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:07.340
There's no third possibility of a non hot fire of a cold fire.

424
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:15.050
So if you've got the claim that life's in essential property of the soul,

425
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.330
only two possibilities.
Either you've got the soul and it's alive to it.

426
00:28:21.331 --> 00:28:22.650
It's capable of thought

427
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.330
or this soul's been destroyed,

428
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:35.140
but Plato thinks we can rule out that other possibility.

429
00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:42.390
How well it's by thinking about this particular essential property.

430
00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:49.480
There's nothing in the idea that fire has the essential property of being hot to

431
00:28:49.481 --> 00:28:52.210
make us think it couldn't be destroyed.

432
00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.840
But there is something Plato thinks in the idea of being essentially alive to

433
00:29:00.681 --> 00:29:05.240
rule out the possibility of it's being destroyed.
In fact,

434
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:09.410
as you say the very words,
you begin to feel the horse,

435
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.720
the pool of Plato's position,

436
00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.950
if the soul is essentially alive,

437
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.700
if it's necessarily alive,
it's got to be alive.

438
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.150
<v 1>Okay?</v>

439
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:23.520
<v 0>Can't be destroyed.
That's,
I think,</v>

440
00:29:23.521 --> 00:29:27.150
at least the kind of argument that played a means to put forward.

441
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:33.740
He does it in terms of the phrase deathless.

442
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:36.343
<v 1>Okay,</v>

443
00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:41.440
<v 0>says,
let's actually get this up here.
The board one</v>

444
00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.413
<v 1>life</v>

445
00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:51.770
<v 0>is an essential property of the soul,</v>

446
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.110
but if you think about what that means,
it follows that the soul is deathless

447
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:15.050
after office.
Soul.
If it's essentially alive,

448
00:30:15.051 --> 00:30:18.560
that means a can't be dead.
So it's deathless.

449
00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

450
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.870
<v 0>But after all,
anything that's deathless can't die.</v>

451
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.050
So the soul cannot die,

452
00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:35.690
which is just to say it's indestructable.

453
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.960
So soul cannot be destroyed.

454
00:30:58.410 --> 00:30:59.243
<v 1>Okay.</v>

455
00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:05.910
<v 0>Something like this seems to be played,
those argument,
one license,</v>

456
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.150
essential property of the soul.

457
00:31:07.151 --> 00:31:10.180
But we can just summarize that by saying the soul is deathless,

458
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:15.700
but the soul deathless it can't die.
It can't die,

459
00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:18.010
can't be destroyed.
It's indestructible,

460
00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.700
so the soul cannot be destroyed.

461
00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:27.250
I remember once we said the soul was alive,
there are only two possibilities.

462
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:30.970
So it was essentially alive.
Either we have the soul,
it's alive,

463
00:31:30.971 --> 00:31:33.610
capable of thought,
or it's destroyed.

464
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.700
But if the soul cannot be destroyed,

465
00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.510
that leaves only the possibility the soul is alive,
capable of thought.

466
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.980
That's just what Plato thinks.
The soul will always exist capable of thought.

467
00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:50.440
Well,
won't shock you to hear that.

468
00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:52.930
I don't think this argument actually works.

469
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:58.570
And I think where it goes wrong is there's a certain kind of ambiguity

470
00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.500
in the idea of being deathless.

471
00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:13.070
What does it mean to say that something is deck lists?

472
00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:19.070
I think there's two possible interpretations of that phrase.

473
00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:21.920
If something is deathless,

474
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:31.500
then it can't be that.
Well,

475
00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:36.510
what one possibility is it can't be the sole exists and his dad.

476
00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:52.670
That's one possible interpretation to say that something is deathless means

477
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:58.290
you'll never have a soul that exists at the same time that it exists.

478
00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.153
It's dead,

479
00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.230
but there's a second possible

480
00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:09.910
interpretation of deathless.

481
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:13.730
It can't be that.

482
00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:18.130
<v 1>Okay,</v>

483
00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:19.420
<v 0>so was destroyed.</v>

484
00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:38.860
Very easy to confuse these two interpretations of deathless a and B.

485
00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.260
<v 1>Okay?</v>

486
00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.780
<v 0>And basically this is what I think is going on with Plato.</v>

487
00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:51.610
He's running back and forth between these two interpretations.

488
00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:59.080
If life is an essential property of the soul,

489
00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:02.740
then that means we will never have,

490
00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:07.860
you know as or a soul in our hand that exists and is dead

491
00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.800
just in the same way that you'll never have a piece of fire in your hand as it

492
00:34:15.801 --> 00:34:19.340
were that exists and is cold,

493
00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:25.130
can't happen wherever you've got a soul,

494
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.170
it is alive.

495
00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:33.080
So it's deathless incense number sense,

496
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.460
a,
since wherever you've got a soul,

497
00:34:37.461 --> 00:34:38.990
it must be alive.

498
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:44.480
It couldn't be the case that the soul exists.
And is dead.

499
00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:46.600
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

500
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:51.280
<v 0>so the deathless in Sensei,
but for all of that,</v>

501
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
it could still be logically speaking that the soul could be destroyed just like

502
00:34:57.431 --> 00:34:58.990
the fire can be put out.

503
00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.980
We could imagine something that couldn't be destroyed.

504
00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:05.370
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

505
00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:10.370
<v 0>Then of course it would be death listen sense be a much stronger sense of</v>

506
00:35:10.471 --> 00:35:11.304
deathless.

507
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:14.343
<v 1>Okay.</v>

508
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.130
<v 0>What Plato needs,</v>

509
00:35:17.131 --> 00:35:21.780
what Plato wants is to convince us that the soul is deathless incense.

510
00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:24.900
B.
That's true of the soul,

511
00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.960
that it can't be that it was destroyed,

512
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.730
but all he's entitled to his Sensei.

513
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:40.510
You'll never have a soul that exists and is dead because being alive and

514
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:43.230
essential property of the soul,

515
00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:49.150
but the mere fact that where there's a soul,
it's alive,

516
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.160
it doesn't mean the sole couldn't be destroyed.

517
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:54.130
Just like from the fact that where there's fire,

518
00:35:54.131 --> 00:35:56.740
it's hot doesn't mean the fire can't be destroyed.

519
00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:01.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

520
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.210
<v 0>They say it's I think,</v>

521
00:36:04.211 --> 00:36:09.211
pretty easy to get confused in thinking about these issues.

522
00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:16.890
It's difficult to see your way clearly to these two different notions of

523
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:20.323
deathless.

524
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:25.500
It's difficult to get to a point where you can clearly use the language of

525
00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:31.480
essential properties without getting screwed up still.

526
00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:33.220
I think that's what happened here.

527
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:39.810
We grant Plato the thought that the soul has an essential property being alive

528
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:46.720
from this.
It follows that where there's a soul,

529
00:36:46.721 --> 00:36:51.220
it is alive and hence it's deathless in Sansei,

530
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:55.240
but once we started thinking about the category,
the notion of being deathless,

531
00:36:55.390 --> 00:37:00.390
we're tempted to re understand that as being deathless incense be can't be

532
00:37:01.511 --> 00:37:05.050
destroyed and that I think doesn't follow.

533
00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.800
All right,
where does that leave us?

534
00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.143
<v 1>Okay.</v>

535
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:15.230
<v 0>Plato's gone through a series of arguments for the immortality,</v>

536
00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.200
the indestructibility of the soul,

537
00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:21.100
and I've argued that none of them work.

538
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:24.010
Some of them are worth taking seriously.

539
00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.340
That's why we've spent the last week or so going over them,

540
00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:32.520
but none of them as far as I can see are successful and I hardly need to remind

541
00:37:33.131 --> 00:37:38.131
you that this comes on the heels of your previous week or two in which we talked

542
00:37:39.281 --> 00:37:44.281
about various other arguments for the very existence of an immaterial soul.

543
00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:50.370
And I've argued that none of those arguments work either as far as I can see.

544
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:57.510
Then the arguments that might be offered for the existence of an in the arterial

545
00:37:57.831 --> 00:37:59.800
soul,
let alone an immortal soul.

546
00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.920
The arguments don't succeed.

547
00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.640
It's not that the idea of a soul is in any way silly.

548
00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:11.530
It's not that it's not worth thinking about.
It's that when we ask ourselves,

549
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:16.710
do we have any good reason to believe in an immaterial soul and actually try to

550
00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.560
spell out what those reasons might be.

551
00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:25.450
As we look more carefully,
we see the arguments are not very compelling.

552
00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:31.200
So I'm prepared to conclude there is no soul,

553
00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:35.320
there's no good reason to believe in souls.

554
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.520
And so I conclude at least there's no good enough reason to believe in souls.

555
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.580
And so I conclude there are none.

556
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.863
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

557
00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:48.910
<v 0>and this is the position that sort of here on out,</v>

558
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.810
I'm going to be assuming for the rest of the class,

559
00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.990
I'm going to have us continue to think about death,

560
00:38:56.230 --> 00:39:00.610
but now think about death from the physical list perspective.

561
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:06.540
Given the assumption that the body is all there is that talk about the mind is

562
00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:12.661
just a way of talking about the abilities of the body to do certain special

563
00:39:13.511 --> 00:39:14.620
mental activities.

564
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:19.570
There are no extra things beyond the body.

565
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.460
No immaterial souls

566
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:28.650
now wouldn't be unreasonable at this point to accuse me of begging the question.

567
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.710
After all I think about what I've done.

568
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.800
I put all of the burden of proof on the fan of souls are the asked the the dual

569
00:39:42.911 --> 00:39:43.510
list.

570
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:48.510
Give me some reason to believe your position and they've said the arguments on

571
00:39:48.791 --> 00:39:51.670
behalf of dualism aren't very convincing.

572
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:56.890
Dominate.
I now need and fairness to do the same thing for the physical list.

573
00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.380
Don't I need to turn to the physicalist and say,

574
00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.650
give me some reason to believe that physical,
isn't this true?

575
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:06.970
Give me some reason to believe souls don't exist.

576
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.330
After all,
I turned to the dual list and said,

577
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:15.190
give me some reason to believe in souls.
Those arguments didn't work.

578
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:18.640
Don't I now need to turn to the physical list and say,

579
00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:22.060
give me some reason not to believe in souls.

580
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:26.500
Prove that souls don't exist.
Isn't that fair?

581
00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.073
<v 1>Okay,</v>

582
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.370
<v 0>so let's pause and ask ourselves.</v>

583
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:39.020
How do you go about proving that something doesn't exist or to put it in a

584
00:40:42.751 --> 00:40:43.830
slightly better way,

585
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:49.400
when do you need to prove that something doesn't exist?

586
00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.353
<v 1>When we</v>

587
00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:59.490
<v 0>have examples of things whose existence we don't believe in,</v>

588
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:04.740
how do we decide when we're justified in disbelieving them?

589
00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.150
Take something like dragons.

590
00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:15.290
Let me assume that everybody in this class in this room does not believe in the

591
00:41:16.231 --> 00:41:17.670
existence of dragons.

592
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.470
How do I prove that there aren't any dragons?

593
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:29.733
<v 1>I mean,</v>

594
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:34.610
<v 0>could be dragons couldn't there,
but there aren't any.</v>

595
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.560
You don't believe in dragons,

596
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:42.610
so don't you need to disprove the existence of dragons before you continue on

597
00:41:43.281 --> 00:41:44.870
your way of not believing in them?

598
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:54.200
I imagine nobody in this room believes in the existence of Zeus,

599
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:57.630
the Greek God.

600
00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:04.510
How do you disprove the existence of Zeus?

601
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:05.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

602
00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:10.770
<v 0>Don't we have an obligation to prove that Zeus doesn't exist,</v>

603
00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:16.420
but,
but how could you do that?
Well,
I'm surprisingly,

604
00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:22.560
I don't actually think you do have an obligation to disprove those things.

605
00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:26.890
It doesn't mean you don't have any obligations.

606
00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:31.000
Just have to be very careful about what the intellectual obligations come to.

607
00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:37.600
So back to dragons.
What do we need to do for dragons?
Well,

608
00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:42.780
the most important thing you need to do to justify your skepticism about dragons

609
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:50.910
is to refute all of the arguments that might be offered on behalf of dragons.

610
00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:59.820
My son's got a book about dragons with some very nice photographs.

611
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:07.300
So one of the things I need to do in order to justify my skepticism about

612
00:43:10.281 --> 00:43:15.281
dragons is explain away the photographs I need or the,

613
00:43:15.711 --> 00:43:18.140
you know,
the,
the good drawings or what have you.

614
00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:23.380
I need to explain why it is that we have pictures,

615
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:27.530
even though there really aren't any dragons.
Well,
you know,

616
00:43:27.531 --> 00:43:29.870
some of these are just drawings and people were drawing things out of their

617
00:43:29.871 --> 00:43:32.660
imagination.
The things that look like photographs,
you know,

618
00:43:32.661 --> 00:43:36.500
nowadays with computer generated graphics you can make things that look like

619
00:43:36.501 --> 00:43:40.760
photographs and given Photoshop you can make things look like,
uh,
you know,

620
00:43:40.761 --> 00:43:42.900
pictures or just about anything that doesn't even exist.

621
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:45.543
<v 1>Okay.</v>

622
00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:49.050
<v 0>How do I prove there aren't any UNICORNS?</v>

623
00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:51.840
Well,

624
00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:56.820
I look at the various reported sightings of Unicorns and I try to explain them

625
00:43:56.821 --> 00:43:59.340
away.
Well,
you know,
first time people,

626
00:43:59.341 --> 00:44:04.140
European saw the rhinoceros sort of reminded them of a horse with a,
you know,

627
00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:07.500
a big horn.
And maybe that's why the reports that were Nasir bus came,

628
00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:12.740
all the various unit reports to the Unicorn came from the various unicorn horns

629
00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:17.010
that had been offered,
you know,
in uh,
in various collections.

630
00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:22.130
Upon examination by biologists turn out to be nar wall horn,

631
00:44:22.151 --> 00:44:24.960
certain horns from Wales and so forth and so on.

632
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:30.500
You look at each bit of evidence that gets offered on behalf of the,

633
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:36.030
and you debunk it.
You explain why it's not compelling

634
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:43.410
and when you're done,
you're entitled to say,
you know,

635
00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:47.790
as far as I can tell,
there aren't any UNICORNS.
As far as I can tell,

636
00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:49.680
there aren't any dragons.

637
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.520
It's not as though you've got some obligation to look in every single cave

638
00:44:56.550 --> 00:45:01.500
anywhere on the surface of the earth.
And so not no dragons in there,

639
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:04.350
no dragons in there,
no dragons,
and there no dragons.

640
00:45:04.351 --> 00:45:09.150
And there you're pretty much justified in being skeptical about the existence of

641
00:45:09.151 --> 00:45:09.900
dragons.

642
00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:14.610
Once you've undermined the arguments for dragons.

643
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:21.590
Now there might be something more that you could do in at least some cases you

644
00:45:22.201 --> 00:45:23.970
can go on to argue.

645
00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:29.360
The very idea of the kind of thing we're talking about is impossible.

646
00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.340
It's not just take take dragons.
Again,

647
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:39.430
it's not just that there's no good reason to believe in dragons.

648
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:46.940
The very idea of a dragon may be scientifically and coherent,

649
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:50.690
at least given the science as we understand it.

650
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.750
I mean dragons I supposed to breathe fire.

651
00:45:53.751 --> 00:45:55.970
So that must mean that got fire in their belly.

652
00:45:55.971 --> 00:46:00.790
But how does the fire continue to exist in their belly?
You know,
absent Latin,

653
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.990
the lack of oxygen,
why isn't the fire in their belly busy?
You know,

654
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:07.910
burning and destroying the membranes of their stomach or whatever.
Right?

655
00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.470
You could,
I suppose,

656
00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:13.910
try to prove that dragons were scientifically impossible

657
00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:21.160
and if you could,
then you'd have an extra reason to not believe in them.

658
00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.800
But it's not as though you have to prove that something's impossible to be

659
00:46:26.801 --> 00:46:28.900
justified in not believing in it.

660
00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.730
I don't think Unicorns are impossible.

661
00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:35.990
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

662
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:37.940
<v 0>I just don't think there are any.</v>

663
00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:43.760
Surely there could be horses with a single long horn growing out of their

664
00:46:43.761 --> 00:46:46.850
forehead.
There just aren't any.

665
00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.073
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

666
00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:54.920
<v 0>So armed with these ideas,
come back to the discussion of souls.</v>

667
00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:00.600
Do I as a physical list who does not believe in the existence of souls,

668
00:47:00.601 --> 00:47:03.140
in material entities above and beyond the body?

669
00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:07.580
Do I need to disprove the existence of souls?
Well,

670
00:47:07.581 --> 00:47:09.410
it was no soul here.
No souls there.

671
00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:14.800
Know what I need to do is to take a look at each argument that gets offered for

672
00:47:20.001 --> 00:47:23.570
the existence of a soul.
Andrew brought it.

673
00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:27.590
Explain why those arguments are not compelling.

674
00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:33.130
I don't need to prove that souls are impossible.

675
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:38.700
I just need to undermine the case for souls.

676
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:44.020
If there's no good reason to believe in souls,

677
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:49.860
that actually constitutes a reason to believe there are no souls.

678
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.490
Now,
if you want to,

679
00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:59.610
you could go on and try to prove that souls are impossible in the same way that

680
00:48:01.601 --> 00:48:03.520
maybe dragons are impossible,

681
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:11.150
but I'm not sure that I myself fine.
Such impossibility claims,

682
00:48:11.151 --> 00:48:12.710
especially persuasive.

683
00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.640
I don't believe in the existence of souls,

684
00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:22.330
but that doesn't mean that I find the idea of an immaterial entity like the soul

685
00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:26.870
impossible.
Now,
some people might say,
well,
you know,

686
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.980
it violates science as we know it.

687
00:48:29.981 --> 00:48:32.930
It violates physics to have the be something immaterial.

688
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.700
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

689
00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:39.700
<v 0>but science is constantly coming around to believe in entities or properties</v>

690
00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:44.030
that it didn't believe in previously.

691
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:49.750
Maybe it just hasn't gotten around to believing in souls yet.

692
00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:54.590
Or if current signs rules out the possibility of souls,

693
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:57.830
maybe we should say so much the worse for current science.

694
00:48:59.020 --> 00:48:59.853
<v 1>Okay,</v>

695
00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:05.160
<v 0>so I'm not somebody who wants to say we can disprove the existence of souls.</v>

696
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:10.210
I don't think we can disprove them.

697
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:14.620
I don't think the idea of a soul is in any way in coherent.

698
00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.770
There are philosophers who thought that I'm not one of them,

699
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:24.600
but I don't think I need to disprove the existence of a soul to be justified in

700
00:49:25.121 --> 00:49:26.500
not believing in it.

701
00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:30.130
UNICORNS aren't impossible,

702
00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:34.390
but for all that I'm justified in thinking there aren't any.

703
00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:35.973
Why?

704
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:41.190
Because all the evidence for Unicorns just doesn't add up to very convincing

705
00:49:41.891 --> 00:49:42.724
case.

706
00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:49.050
Souls are not impossible.
But for all that,

707
00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:53.730
I think I'm justified in believing there.
Our antennae.
Why?

708
00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:56.010
Because when you look for the art,

709
00:49:56.011 --> 00:49:59.340
look at the arguments that have been offered to try to convince us of the

710
00:49:59.341 --> 00:50:00.630
existence of souls.

711
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:05.870
Those arguments just aren't very compelling or so it seems to me.

712
00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.730
So from this point on out,

713
00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:12.480
I'll be assuming the physical list view is correct,

714
00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:17.130
and we'll be thinking about the issues of death as they'd be understood from the

715
00:50:17.131 --> 00:50:18.450
physical list point of view.
