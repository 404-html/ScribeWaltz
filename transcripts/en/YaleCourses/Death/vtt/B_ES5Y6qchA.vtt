1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.980
We've begun gone the turn to Plato's dialogue of Thedo and what I started doing

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:09.480
last time was sketching the basic outlines of Plato's metaphysics.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.330
Not so much to give a full investigation of that.

4
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:13.710
Clearly we're not going to do that here,

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.530
but just to provide enough of the essential outlines of Plato's metaphysical

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.650
views so that we can understand the arguments that come up later in the fito

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.870
basically all of which are many of which presuppose something certain essential

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.270
aspects about Plato's metaphysical views.

9
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.270
The key point behind his metaphysics then was the,

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.280
was the thought that in addition to the ordinary empirical physical world that

11
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:39.330
we're all familiar with,

12
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.220
we have to posit the existence of a kind of second realm,

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.360
uh,

14
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.360
in which exist the platonic as their nowadays called the platonic forms or

15
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:55.620
platonic ideas sort of thing that perhaps we might call or think of as abstract

16
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.250
objects or abstract properties.
And the,

17
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.850
and the reason for positing these things is because we're clearly able to think

18
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:07.851
about these ideas and yet we recognize that the ordinary physical world,

19
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:11.820
although things may participate in them to varying degrees,

20
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.940
we don't actually come across these objects or entities in the physical world so

21
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:22.050
that we can talk about things being beautiful to varying degrees,

22
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.140
but we never come across beauty itself in the actual empirical world.

23
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.640
We,

24
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.570
we are able to talk about the fact that two plus one equals three but it's not

25
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:38.571
as though we ever come across numbers number three itself,

26
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.490
anywhere in the empirical world.

27
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.890
Further point to that distinguishes the empirical world from this sort of this

28
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:51.891
realm of platonic ideal objects is that indeed the,

29
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.170
there's,
there's something perfect about them.
They don't change.
And in contrast,

30
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.300
physical objects are constantly changing.

31
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:05.301
Something might be short at one point and become tall at another point.

32
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.510
Ugly at one point it become beautiful.
Like,
like the ugly duckling.

33
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.140
It starts out ugly becomes a Beautiful Swan and contrast.

34
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.560
Justice itself never changes.

35
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.500
Beauty itself never changes.

36
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.120
We have the thought that these things are eternal.
And,

37
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.751
and,

38
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:29.751
and indeed the beyond change and in contrast to the empirical world,

39
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.280
in fact,
if you start thinking more about the world from this perspective,
the,

40
00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:36.870
the,
the world we live in is crazy.

41
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:40.800
It's almost insanely contradictory.
Plato thinks of it as,
as,

42
00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:45.030
as crazy in the way that a dream is when you're,

43
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.960
when you're caught up in the dream,
you don't notice just how insane it all is.

44
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.560
But if you start to step back and reflect on it,
oh,
let's see.

45
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:57.561
I was eating a sandwich and suddenly the sandwich was the statue of liberty,

46
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.910
except the statue of Liberty was my mother.

47
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.200
And she's flying over the ocean,
except she's really a piece of spaghetti.

48
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.670
But that's how dreams are.
And when you're in it,
it sort of all makes sense.

49
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:14.450
Right?
UK caught up,
but yet a step back and say,
that's just insane.
Well,

50
00:03:14.451 --> 00:03:19.451
Plato thinks that the empirical world has something of that kind of insanity.

51
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.550
Something of that kind of contradictory Enos built into it that we don't

52
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:28.990
ordinarily notice.
Uh,
he,
he's a basketball player,

53
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:33.040
so he's really,
really tall,
except he's only a six feet.
So he's really,

54
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:37.090
really short.
Uh,
for a basketball player,
you know,
this is a baby elephant,

55
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:39.970
so it's really,
really big except it's a baby elephant.
So it's really,

56
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:40.930
really small.

57
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.270
The world is constantly sort of rolling.

58
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:50.860
This is a platonic expression rolling between sort of one form and the other

59
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.190
and,
and it's hard to make sense of.

60
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.230
In contrast,

61
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.150
the mind is able to grasp the platonic ideas,

62
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.900
the platonic forms,
and they're stable,
they're reliable,

63
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.410
they are there,
they're law like,
and we can,
we can grasp them.

64
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.980
They don't change their eternal that,
as I say,

65
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.200
the platonic picture now,

66
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.710
it's not my purpose here to try to argue for or against Platonism with regard to

67
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:22.810
abstract entities.

68
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.490
As I suggested and talking about the example of math last time,

69
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.040
it's not a silly view,

70
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.400
even if it's not a view that we all take automatically.

71
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:36.550
But in thinking about math,
most of us are inclined to be politeness.

72
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.920
We all do believe something makes it true.

73
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:43.921
The two plus one equals three but it's not the fact that empirical objects w we

74
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.390
don't do empirical experiments to see whether two plus one equals three rather

75
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:52.690
we think our mind can grasp the trues about numbers.

76
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.320
Plato thought everything was like that.
Well,

77
00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:57.790
I'm not going to argue for and against that.

78
00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:01.660
If you just wanted to sketch it for the so as to understand the arguments that

79
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:03.550
turn on it.
So for our purposes,

80
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.640
let's suppose Plato was right about that and ask what follows or Plato thinks.

81
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:15.220
What's going to follow is we have some reason to believe in the immortality of

82
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.010
the soul as again he was.

83
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:22.060
We indicated last time that the picture is that the mind,

84
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.090
the soul is able to grasp these eternal platonic forms.

85
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.390
The ideas.

86
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.430
Typically we're distracted from thinking about them by the,

87
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.560
by the distractions provided by the body,
the desire for food,
drink,

88
00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:40.450
sex,
what have you,
sleep.

89
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.190
But by distancing itself from the body,
the mind,

90
00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:48.670
the soul is able to better concentrate on the forms.
And if you're good at that,

91
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:53.350
if you practice while you're alive,
separating yourself from the body,

92
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.760
then when your body dies,

93
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.120
the mind is able to go up to this platonic realm and commune with,

94
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.500
with Gods and other immortal souls and think about the forms.

95
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.650
But if you are not separated yourself from the body while in life,

96
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.710
if you're too enmeshed in its concerns,

97
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.320
then upon the death of your body,

98
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.380
your soul will get sort of sucked back in reincarnated perhaps in another body

99
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:21.980
if you're lucky,
as another person,

100
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.910
if you're not so lucky as a pig or a donkey or an aunt or what have you.

101
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.240
So your goal,

102
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.390
Plato says your goal should be in life to practice death,

103
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.240
to separate yourself from your body.

104
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.920
And because of this Socrates who's facing death isn't distressed at the

105
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:46.550
prospect,
but,
but happy he's,

106
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.050
he's happy that the final separation will take place and he'll be able to go to

107
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:51.884
heaven.

108
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.793
<v 1>Okay.</v>

109
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.110
<v 0>The dialogue ends of course with the death scene,</v>

110
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.980
Socrates has been condemned to death by the Athenians,
uhh,

111
00:06:59.981 --> 00:07:01.750
and it ends with his drinking,

112
00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:05.690
the hemlock knocked distressed but rather sort of joyful.
Uh,

113
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.740
and the dialogue ends with one of the great moving death scenes in western

114
00:07:10.901 --> 00:07:15.700
civilization.
And as,
as Plato says,
let's get the quote here.
Exactly right.

115
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.100
Of all those we have known he was the best and also the wisest and the most

116
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.963
upright

117
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.330
just before the death scene.
There's a long myth,
which I draw your attention to,

118
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:32.060
but I don't want to discuss in any kind of detail.

119
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.090
Plato says it's a story,
it's a myth.

120
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.210
He's trying to indicate that there are things that we can't really know in a,

121
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:43.820
in a scientific way,
but we can,
we can glimpse.

122
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.120
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.760
<v 0>And and the myth has to do with these sort of pictures I was just describing</v>

124
00:07:48.761 --> 00:07:52.510
where we don't actually live on the surface of the earth,

125
00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:57.370
sort of in the light but rather live in certain hollows in the dark where were

126
00:07:57.371 --> 00:08:00.460
mistaken about the nature of reality.

127
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.810
Some of you who are maybe familiar with Plato's later dialogue,

128
00:08:04.811 --> 00:08:09.160
the republic may recognize at least what seems to me what we have here is a a

129
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:10.480
foreshadowing of the,

130
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:15.190
the myth of the cave or the allegory of the cave which Plato describes there as

131
00:08:15.191 --> 00:08:16.024
well.

132
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:17.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

133
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:22.870
<v 0>Our concern is going to be the arguments that make up the center of the dialogue</v>

134
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.370
because in the center of the dialogue before he dies,

135
00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:32.420
Socrates is arguing with his friends.
Socrates just say,
look,
I'm not worried,

136
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:33.680
I'm going to live forever.

137
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.670
And His disciples and friends are worried whether this is true or not.

138
00:08:37.671 --> 00:08:38.260
And so the,

139
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:43.040
the heart of the dialogue consists of a series of arguments that in which

140
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:47.570
Socrates attempt to lay out his reasons for believing in the immortality of the

141
00:08:47.571 --> 00:08:50.180
soul and that's going to be our concern,

142
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:55.181
but I'm going to do is basically run through my attempt to reconstruct my

143
00:08:56.701 --> 00:09:01.701
attempt to lay out the basic ideas from this series of four or five arguments

144
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.780
that Plato gives us.
I'm going to criticize them.
I don't think they work though.

145
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.950
I wanted a remark before I turn to them that insane.
This,

146
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:15.780
I'm not necessarily criticizing Plato as we'll see.

147
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.080
Some of the later arguments seem to be deliberately emailed at answering

148
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:27.650
objections that we can raise to some of the earlier arguments and so it might

149
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:33.231
well be that Plato himself recognized that the initial arguments aren't as

150
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:37.290
strong as they need to be.

151
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.620
Plato wrote the dialogues as a kind of learning device as a tool to help the

152
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:50.900
reader get better at doing philosophy there.

153
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.720
They don't necessarily represent in a kind of systematic fashion.

154
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.900
Plato's worked out axiomatic views about the nature of philosophy.

155
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:00.960
It couldn't.

156
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.960
It could be that Plato's deliberately putting mistakes in earlier arguments so

157
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:11.310
as to encourage you to think for yourself,
oh,
oh,
this is the,

158
00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:14.190
here's a problem with this argument.
Here's an objection with that argument.

159
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.120
Some of these Plato then may address later on.

160
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:23.910
But whether or not he doesn't dress them,
we're not doing Plato any honor.

161
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.320
We're not doing them any service.

162
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.190
If we limit ourselves to simply trying to grasp,

163
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:34.410
here's what Plato thought,
we could do the history of ideas and say,

164
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.110
here's Plato's views.
Aren't they interesting?

165
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.160
Notice how they differ from Aristotle's views.
Aren't they interesting?

166
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.420
And move on like that.
But that's not what the philosophers wanted us to do.

167
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.020
The full,

168
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.940
the great philosophers had arguments that they were putting forward to try to

169
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:54.780
persuade us of the truth of their positions.

170
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.960
And the way you show respect for a philosopher is by taking those arguments

171
00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:03.750
seriously and asking yourself,
do they work or not?

172
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.240
So whether or not the views that are being put forward in Socrates,

173
00:11:08.241 --> 00:11:13.241
his mouth are the considered reflective judgments of Plato or not.

174
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:17.010
For our purposes.

175
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:22.011
We can just act as though they were the arguments being put forward by Plato and

176
00:11:22.441 --> 00:11:26.580
we can ask ourselves do these arguments work or don't think so.

177
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.630
I'm going to run through a series of these arguments.
I'm going to,

178
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.950
as I've mentioned before,

179
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:36.090
be a bit more exegetical than is normally the case where our readings,

180
00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:39.930
I'm going to actually pause periodically look at my notes and make sure I'm

181
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:43.920
remembering how I think Plato understands the arguments.

182
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.020
Of course since the dialogue is indeed a dialogue,

183
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.160
we don't always have the arguments laid out with a series of premises

184
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.710
conclusions and so it's always a matter of interpretation.

185
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.700
What's the best reconstruction of the argument.

186
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:05.650
He's gesturing towards how can we turn it into an argument with premises and

187
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:08.110
conclusions,
but that's what I'm going to try to do for us.

188
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:14.930
Also going to give the argument names.
These are not names that Plato gives,

189
00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.160
but it'll make it easy for us to get a fix roughly on the different arguments as

190
00:12:19.161 --> 00:12:20.300
we moved from one to the next.

191
00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:24.950
So the first argument and the worry that it gets the whole thing going is this.

192
00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:29.810
So we've got this nice platonic picture where Plato says,
all right,

193
00:12:29.811 --> 00:12:32.330
so the mind can grasp the eternal forms,

194
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.080
but that has to free itself from the body to do that.

195
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:40.790
And so the philosopher who has sort of trained himself to separate his mind from

196
00:12:40.791 --> 00:12:44.390
his body,
did it disregard his bodily a cravings and desires?

197
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.890
The philosopher will welcome death because at that point he'll truly finally

198
00:12:48.891 --> 00:12:50.600
make the final break from the body.

199
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:55.930
And the army's worry that gets raised in the dialogue at this point is this,

200
00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:02.000
how do we know that when the death of the body occurs,

201
00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:07.010
the soul doesn't get destroyed as well.
That's the natural worry to have.

202
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:07.370
You know,

203
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:12.370
maybe what we need to do is separate ourselves as much as possible from the

204
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:19.600
influence of our body without actually going all the way and breaking the

205
00:13:21.891 --> 00:13:24.470
connection.
If you think of it like a rubber band,

206
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.670
maybe the more we can stretch the rubber band,
the better.

207
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.530
But if you stretch too far and the rubber band snaps,
that's not good.

208
00:13:33.531 --> 00:13:34.490
That's bad.

209
00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:40.240
It couldn't be that we need the body in order to continue thinking.

210
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:46.520
We want to free ourselves from the distractions of the body,

211
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.810
but we don't want the body to die because when the body dies,

212
00:13:50.811 --> 00:13:55.520
the soul dies as well.
Even if we are dualists,
as we've noticed before,

213
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.980
even if the soul is something different from the body,

214
00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:01.130
it could still be the case logically speaking,

215
00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.940
that if the body gets destroyed,
the soil gets destroyed as well.

216
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.600
And so Socrates friends ask him,

217
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:13.610
how can we be confident that the soul will survive the death of the body and

218
00:14:13.611 --> 00:14:17.840
indeed be a mortal?
And that's what prompts the series of arguments.
Now,

219
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.880
the first such argument,

220
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:25.460
I dub the argument from the nature of the forms.

221
00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

222
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.280
<v 0>And the basic thoughts fairly straight forward.</v>

223
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.580
The ideas or the forms?
Justice itself,
beauty itself.

224
00:14:36.581 --> 00:14:37.660
Goodness itself.

225
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:43.120
The forms are not physical objects,
right?

226
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.080
We don't,
we don't ever bump into justice itself.

227
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.650
We bumped into societies that may be more or less just or individuals who may be

228
00:14:51.651 --> 00:14:54.920
more or less just,
but we never bump into justice itself.

229
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.410
The number three is not a physical object.

230
00:14:57.411 --> 00:14:59.390
Goodness itself is not a physical object.

231
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.190
Perfect roundness is not a physical object.
Now,

232
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.420
roughly speaking,

233
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.250
soccer seems to think it's going to follow straight forwardly from that,

234
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:16.210
that the soul must itself be something nonphysical.

235
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:22.200
If if the
forms are not physical objects,

236
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.500
then Socrates thinks it follows.
They can't be grasped.

237
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.290
We can certainly think about the forms,
but if they're not physical,

238
00:15:28.291 --> 00:15:31.290
they can't be grasped by something physical like the body.

239
00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.700
They've got to be grasped by something nonphysical,
namely the soul.

240
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.370
But although that's I think the,
the sketch of where Socrates wants to go,

241
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:45.360
it doesn't quite give us what we want.
On the one hand,

242
00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:50.660
even if it was true that the soul must be nonphysical in order to grasp the

243
00:15:51.121 --> 00:15:54.360
nonphysical forms,
wouldn't follow that.

244
00:15:54.361 --> 00:15:56.760
The soul will survive the death of the body.

245
00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.250
That's the problem we've been thinking about for the last minute.

246
00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.780
And there's something puzzling we might wonder.
Well,

247
00:16:03.781 --> 00:16:08.781
just why is it that the body can't grasp the forms?

248
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.350
So there's a sort of fuller version of the argument.

249
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.520
That's the one I want to focus on.
And indeed,
I've put it up on the board.

250
00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.800
So platonic metaphysics gives us premise number one,

251
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:29.690
that ideas forms are eternal and their nonphysical

252
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.350
<v 2>okay</v>

253
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:37.350
<v 0>to that which is eternal or nonphysical can only be grasped by the eternal and</v>

254
00:16:40.721 --> 00:16:44.260
the nonphysical.
Suppose we had both of those.

255
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.870
It would seem to give us three.
That conclusion.

256
00:16:46.871 --> 00:16:51.871
We want that which grasps the ideas or the forms must be eternal or nonphysical.

257
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:56.140
<v 2>Okay.</v>

258
00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.590
<v 0>What is it?
The grass,
the ideas or the forms?
Well,
that's the soul.</v>

259
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.310
If that was grasped,
the idea is a forms must be 29 physical.
Well,

260
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.020
one thing we're going to get is since that was grasps the,

261
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.180
the forms must be nonphysical.
The is not the body.

262
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.700
Since that was grasp,
the idea of forms must be eternal or nonphysical.

263
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.720
It's eternal.
It's not.
It's immortal.
All right,

264
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:22.880
let's look at us again more carefully.

265
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.490
Ideas or forms are eternal.
They're nonphysical.
Well,

266
00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:33.290
I've emphasized the nonphysical aspect and I've emphasized as well if they're

267
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:34.520
not changing,

268
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.840
but perhaps it's worth taking a moment to emphasize the eternal aspect of the

269
00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.950
forms.
People may come and go,

270
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.110
but perfect justice.

271
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.470
You know the idea of perfect justice that's timeless.

272
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:56.090
Nothing that happens here on earth can change or alter or destroy.

273
00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.720
The number three,
two plus one equals three.

274
00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:03.930
Before there were people,
two plus one equals three.

275
00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:06.900
Now two plus one will always equal three.

276
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.850
The number three is eternal as well as being nonphysical.

277
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.760
So the platonic metaphysics says quite generally,

278
00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.830
if we're thinking about the ideas or the forms,

279
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.510
the point to grasp is they're eternal.
There.
Nonphysical.

280
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.370
The crucial premise since we're getting Plato,
number one,

281
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.260
the crucial premise for our purposes is premise number two.

282
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:37.250
Is it or isn't it true that those things which are eternal or nonphysical can

283
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:46.010
only be grasped by something that is itself eternal and nonphysical?

284
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:49.980
Again,
it does seem as though the conclusion that he wants.

285
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:52.110
Number three follows from that.

286
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.020
If we give him number two,

287
00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:00.000
it's going to file that whatever is doing the grasping call that the soul,

288
00:19:00.001 --> 00:19:04.140
since the soul is just Plato's word for our mind,
if whatever's doing,

289
00:19:04.141 --> 00:19:08.030
the grasping of the eternal nonphysical forms must itself be eternal and

290
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.180
nonphysical.
It follows that the soul must be nonphysical.

291
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:17.040
So the physical,
his view is wrong and the soul must be eternal.

292
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.510
The soles are mortal.

293
00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:25.410
So Socrates has what he wants once we get him.

294
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.000
Premise number two,

295
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.660
that the eternal nonphysical can only be grasped by the eternal nonphysical

296
00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.793
<v 2>as</v>

297
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.790
<v 0>Socrates puts it at one point,</v>

298
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.600
the impure cannot attain the pure bodies corruptible destroyable physical,

299
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.673
you know,

300
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.680
passing whether they exist or not exist for a brief period than they ceased to

301
00:19:55.681 --> 00:20:00.540
exist.
They sort of impure objects cannot attain,
cannot grasp,

302
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.660
can not have knowledge of the eternal changeless nonphysical forms.

303
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.270
The impure cannot attain the pure.

304
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.970
That's the crucial premise and what I want to say is as far as I can see,

305
00:20:14.971 --> 00:20:19.971
there's no good reason to believe number two.

306
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.100
Now number two is not an unfamiliar premise.

307
00:20:23.101 --> 00:20:25.890
Number two is not an unfamiliar claim.
I take it.

308
00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:30.420
The claim basically is that it has to put it in more familiar language.

309
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.740
It takes one to know one
or to use it.

310
00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.830
Some other kinds of language of Plato users at various points.
You know,

311
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:42.260
like so known by likes,
but it takes one to know.

312
00:20:42.261 --> 00:20:46.800
One is probably the most familiar way of putting the point.
Plato saying,

313
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.110
what is it that we know what we know?

314
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.350
The eternal forms takes one to know one.

315
00:20:53.351 --> 00:20:58.250
So we must ourselves be terminal.
Unfortunately,

316
00:20:58.251 --> 00:21:02.750
this thought populars that may be that it takes one to know one just seems

317
00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:07.110
false.
Think about some examples.
Well,
let's see.
Uh,

318
00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:11.870
I buy all just might study or a zoologist might study cats.

319
00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:17.090
Uh,
takes one to know one.
So the biologist must himself be a cat.

320
00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.060
Well,
that's clearly false.

321
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:25.340
You don't have to be feline to study.

322
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:30.350
The feline
takes one to know one.
So,

323
00:21:30.351 --> 00:21:31.100
uh,

324
00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:36.100
you can't be a Canadian and study Mexicans because it takes one to know one.

325
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:40.040
Well,
that's just clearly stupid.
Of course,

326
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:44.060
the Canadians can study the Mexicans and the Germans can study.

327
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:48.230
The French does not take one to know one.

328
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.720
To understand the truth about the French.

329
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:55.870
You do not yourself need to be French or take the fact that some doctors study,

330
00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.740
you know,
dead bodies.
Huh?

331
00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:06.290
So to study and grasp things about dead bodies,
corpses,

332
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:10.550
you must yourself be a dead body.
No,
that certainly doesn't follow.

333
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:14.970
So if we start actually pushing ourselves to think about example,

334
00:22:14.971 --> 00:22:16.670
does it really take one to know one?

335
00:22:16.671 --> 00:22:20.600
The answer is at least as a general claim,

336
00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:25.670
it's not true.
It doesn't normally take one to know one.

337
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.140
No.
Strictly speaking,

338
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:35.180
that doesn't prove that premise two is false.

339
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:37.670
It could still be that,

340
00:22:37.671 --> 00:22:42.671
although normally you don't have to be like the thing that you're studying in

341
00:22:44.391 --> 00:22:48.140
order to study it.
Although that's not normally true.

342
00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.560
It could be that in the particular case of nonphysical objects in the particular

343
00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:58.010
case of eternal objects,

344
00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.630
you do have to be eternal nonphysical to study them.

345
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:08.210
It could be that even though the general claim it takes one to know one is

346
00:23:08.211 --> 00:23:08.900
false,

347
00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:13.850
that particular claim eternal nonphysical can only be grasped by the eternal

348
00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:14.810
nonphysical.

349
00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.440
Maybe that particular claim is true and it's only the particular claim that

350
00:23:21.171 --> 00:23:24.500
Plato needs.
Still,

351
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:30.310
all I can say is why shouldn't we believe too?

352
00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:36.440
Why should we think there's some,
you know,
even though normally the the,

353
00:23:36.441 --> 00:23:41.180
the barrier can be crossed and exes can study the Nanex,

354
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.630
why should that bear?

355
00:23:44.631 --> 00:23:49.580
You're suddenly uncrossable in the particular instance when we're dealing with

356
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:54.581
platonic forms give us some reason to believe premise too.

357
00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:02.320
I can't see any good reason to believe premise too and as far as I can see,

358
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:07.300
Plato doesn't actually give us any reason to believe it in the dialogue.

359
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.210
Consequently,
we have to say as far as I can see,

360
00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:15.360
we haven't been given any adequate argument by the conclusion that the soul

361
00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:21.010
which admittedly can think about forms and ideas,

362
00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:26.410
we have no good reason yet to believe to be persuaded that the soul must itself

363
00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.450
be eternal and nonphysical.

364
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.140
That's the first argument.
As I say though,

365
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:38.850
Plato may well recognize the inadequacy of that argument because after all

366
00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:42.630
Socrates goes on to offer a series of other arguments.

367
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:44.280
So let's turn to the next.

368
00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.690
I call the second argument.

369
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:54.300
The argument from recycling.
It's not the best label I suppose,

370
00:24:54.301 --> 00:24:58.560
but I've never been able to come up with a better one.
And the basic idea is,

371
00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.860
well that parts get reused,

372
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:07.160
things move from one state to another state and then back to the first state.

373
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.480
So for example,

374
00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.180
to give an example of that player actually gives him the dialogue.
You know,

375
00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:17.280
we are all awake now,
but previously we were asleep.

376
00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:22.790
We went from being in the realm of the asleep to being in the realm of the awake

377
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:27.960
and we're going to return from the realm of the awake back to the realm of the

378
00:25:27.961 --> 00:25:30.480
asleep and over and over and over again.

379
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.180
Hence recycling.

380
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:37.380
I think I'm actually a better example for Plato's purposes.

381
00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:41.790
Not that I expected to have this particular example,
but would be a car.

382
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:47.840
Cars are made up of parts that existed before the car itself existed.

383
00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:53.340
No,

384
00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:58.140
there was the engine and the steering wheel and the tires and so forth.

385
00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:03.350
And these parts got assembled and put together to make up a car.

386
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.840
So the parts of the car existed prior to the existence of the car itself.

387
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
And the time's going to come when the car will cease to exist,

388
00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:24.080
but it's parts will still be around and it'll get taken apart for parts sold for

389
00:26:24.451 --> 00:26:25.470
parts,
you know,

390
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.470
there'll be the distributor cap and there'll be the tires and they're all way

391
00:26:28.471 --> 00:26:30.780
the carburetor there.
I mean the steering wheel,

392
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:35.910
hence the uh,
the name like dub,
the argument,

393
00:26:35.911 --> 00:26:37.470
the argument from recycling.

394
00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:43.220
That's the nature of sort of reality for things.

395
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.270
And it seems like a plausible enough view.

396
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:51.530
Things come into being by being composed of previously existing parts.

397
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:58.710
And then when those things cease to have the form they had,

398
00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.580
the parts get used for other purposes,
they get recycled.

399
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.900
If we grant that to Plato,

400
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:11.670
he thinks we've got an argument for the immortality of the soul.

401
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:16.750
Because after all,
what are the parts that make us up?
Well,

402
00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.490
it was the various parts of our physical body,
but there's also our soul.

403
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.970
I remember,
as I said,
in introducing the Fito,

404
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:29.150
Plato doesn't so much argue for the existence of something separate the soul as

405
00:27:31.981 --> 00:27:33.450
presuppose it his,

406
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.770
his fundamental concern is to try to argue for the immortality of the soul,

407
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:41.220
so he's just helping himself to the assumption that there is a soul.

408
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:46.260
It's one of the parts that makes us,
makes that goes up.
It did.
Making this up,

409
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:48.270
it goes into making this up.

410
00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:53.510
One of the pieces that constitutes us given the thesis about recycling.

411
00:27:54.451 --> 00:27:55.500
Then we have reasonable leave.

412
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.670
The soul will continue to exist after sort of,

413
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:04.730
we break even after our deaths are parts will continue to exist.

414
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.000
You know,
our body continues to exist even after our death.

415
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.180
Our soul will continue to exist.

416
00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:17.470
Well,

417
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:22.270
there's a problem with the argument from recycling and it's this,

418
00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:28.770
even if the recycling thesis shows us that we're made up of something that

419
00:28:29.591 --> 00:28:32.140
existed before our birth

420
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.930
and that some kinds of parts are going to have to exist after our death,

421
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:44.400
we can't conclude that the soul is one of the parts that's going to continue to

422
00:28:44.831 --> 00:28:47.200
exist after our death.

423
00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:55.170
Consider some familiar facts about human bodies.
We as we nowadays,

424
00:28:55.180 --> 00:29:00.180
no human bodies are made up of atoms and it's certainly true that the atoms that

425
00:29:01.481 --> 00:29:06.481
make up my body existed long before my body existed,

426
00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.550
and it's certainly true that after my death,

427
00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.460
those atoms are going to continue to exist.

428
00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:16.660
So there's some and we'll eventually get used to make something else.

429
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:22.350
So Plato certainly right about recycling as a fundamental truth.

430
00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:29.040
The things that make me up existed before and will continue to exist after my

431
00:29:29.231 --> 00:29:30.064
death.

432
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.800
But that doesn't mean that every part of my body existed before I was born and

433
00:29:41.381 --> 00:29:46.381
that every part of my body will continue to exist after I die.

434
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.060
Take my heart.

435
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.960
My heart is a part of my body.

436
00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:58.920
Yet for all that it didn't exist before my body began to exist.

437
00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:04.020
It came into existence as part of a long with the creation of my body

438
00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.800
and it won't continue to exist,

439
00:30:07.801 --> 00:30:11.880
at least not very long after the destruction of my body.

440
00:30:11.881 --> 00:30:14.280
There'll be a brief period in which as a cadaver,

441
00:30:14.281 --> 00:30:19.281
I suppose my heart will continue to exist but eventually my body will decompose.

442
00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:24.210
We certainly wouldn't have any grounds to conclude my heart is immortal will

443
00:30:24.211 --> 00:30:28.080
exist forever.
That just seems wrong.

444
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:34.280
So even though it's true that some kind of recycling takes place,

445
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:40.910
we can't conclude that everything that's now a part of me will continue to exist

446
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.050
afterwards cause it might not have been one of the parts,

447
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.540
one of the fundamental parts from which I'm built,

448
00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.690
like the heart
and if that's right,

449
00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:00.680
if there can be parts that I have now that more one of the parts from which I

450
00:31:02.131 --> 00:31:03.240
was made,

451
00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.250
there's no particular reason to think it's going to be one of the parts.

452
00:31:07.251 --> 00:31:09.570
It's going to continue to exist after I die.

453
00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.770
Once we see that kind of worry,

454
00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:19.050
we have to see,
look,
same thing could be true for the soul.

455
00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:24.230
Even if there is an immortal soul,
sorry.

456
00:31:24.231 --> 00:31:28.930
Even if there is a nonphysical soul,
that's part of me.

457
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:34.180
We don't yet have any reason to believe that it's one of the fundamental

458
00:31:34.181 --> 00:31:36.820
building blocks that were being recycled.

459
00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:41.920
We don't have adequate reason to conclude that it's something that existed

460
00:31:41.921 --> 00:31:44.140
before I was put together.

461
00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:49.210
It's something that will be recycled and continue to exist after I fall apart

462
00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.230
after my body.
You know,
decomposers after I'm separated from my body,

463
00:31:53.231 --> 00:31:54.064
what have you.

464
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.240
Even if recycling takes place,

465
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:03.600
we don't have any good reason yet to believe that the soul is one of the

466
00:32:06.191 --> 00:32:07.720
recycled parts,

467
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:14.010
so it seems to me the argument from recycling as I call it is not successful

468
00:32:16.511 --> 00:32:17.344
either.

469
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:21.363
<v 2>Okay.</v>

470
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:23.710
<v 0>No.
As I say,</v>

471
00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.840
many times when you read the dialogue this or other dialogues by Plato,

472
00:32:28.841 --> 00:32:33.841
it seems as though he's fully cognizant of the objections that at least an

473
00:32:35.921 --> 00:32:40.921
attentive reader will raise about earlier stages of the argument because

474
00:32:41.241 --> 00:32:46.241
sometimes the best way to understand a later argument is to see it as responding

475
00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:52.331
to the weaknesses of earlier arguments and I think that's pretty clearly what's

476
00:32:53.361 --> 00:32:57.830
going on in the very next argument that comes up in the dialogue.

477
00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:03.840
What the objection I just raised after all to the argument from recycling said

478
00:33:05.241 --> 00:33:09.800
in effect,
even though some kind of recycling takes place,

479
00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:15.550
not all my parts get recycled because not all of my parts were among the

480
00:33:15.771 --> 00:33:20.771
preexisting constituent pieces from which I'm built up.

481
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.700
We don't have any particular reason to take my heart's one of the premier prior

482
00:33:25.701 --> 00:33:26.930
existing pieces.

483
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.830
We don't have any good reason to assume that my soul is one of the prior

484
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:34.040
existing pieces.
Well,

485
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:39.590
Plato's very next argument attempts to persuade us that indeed we do have reason

486
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:47.830
to believe that the soul is one of the prior existing pieces

487
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.200
and this argument

488
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.900
is known as the argument from recollection.

489
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:04.420
The idea is he's going to tell us certain facts that need explaining and the

490
00:34:06.441 --> 00:34:10.610
best explanation involves a certain fact about recollecting or certain claim

491
00:34:10.611 --> 00:34:12.650
about recollecting or remembering,

492
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:18.080
but we can only remember he thinks in the relevant way if our soul existed

493
00:34:18.081 --> 00:34:21.560
before the birth of our body,
before the creation of our body.

494
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:29.370
All right.
What's the,
what's the,
what's the crucial fact?
Well,
let's,

495
00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:32.070
let's start by.
Plato starts by telling us,

496
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.360
reminding us of what it is to remember something,

497
00:34:36.361 --> 00:34:41.361
or perhaps a better word would be what it is to be reminded of something by

498
00:34:43.381 --> 00:34:44.310
something else.

499
00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:45.900
<v 2>Okay?</v>

500
00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.980
<v 0>That resembles it,
but it's not the thing.
It reminds you of,</v>

501
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:56.010
I might have a photograph of my friend Ruth

502
00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:02.820
and looking at the photograph reminds me of Ruth.

503
00:35:02.821 --> 00:35:07.080
It brings Ruth to mind.
I start thinking about Ruth.

504
00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:11.610
I remember various things I know about Ruth.
The photographs is,

505
00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:15.330
is able to do that,
is able to trigger these thoughts,

506
00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:20.400
but of course the photograph is not Ruth,
right?
Nobody would,

507
00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:25.460
who's thinking clearly would confuse that photograph with my friend,

508
00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:29.190
but the photograph resembles Ruth.

509
00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:34.860
It resembles Ruth well enough to remind me of her,

510
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.190
and interestingly it do that.

511
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.090
Even if it's not a very good photograph.

512
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.650
It might hold up the photograph and I might say,
gosh,

513
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.650
that really doesn't look very much like Ruth does it.

514
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:54.720
Even though I see that it is a photograph of Ruth,
it reminds me of her.

515
00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:01.310
Now how could it be that a photograph reminds me of my friend?

516
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:07.470
Oh,
this is some deep mystery.
Presumably the way it works is,

517
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.270
as I just said,
it looks sort of like her.

518
00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:16.530
It doesn't have to look very much like here it looks sort of like her,
you know,

519
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:20.940
you're your young brother or sister.
My little children can draw

520
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:27.530
pictures of family members that barely look like family members.

521
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.170
My,
my,
my niece drew a picture of my family once when she was here.
Three,

522
00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.620
it didn't look very much like us at all.

523
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:39.390
But we can sort of see the resemblance in a vague kind of way.
Right?

524
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:40.403
So

525
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.880
it's got to look at least somewhat like the missing friend.

526
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.860
But that's not enough.
You've never met Ruth.

527
00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.970
Let's suppose I hold up the photograph without having told you anything about

528
00:36:53.971 --> 00:36:58.530
her photographs.
Knock on to remind you of Ruth.
Why not?

529
00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.480
Well,
you don't know Ruth.

530
00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:06.620
So the pieces we need are not only an image of Ruth,

531
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.060
even if an imperfect image of Ruth,

532
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:14.040
we also need some prior acquaintance with Ruth.

533
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:16.920
That's pretty much what it takes,
right?

534
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:21.330
So on the one hand sort of temporal sequence.

535
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:25.680
First,
Ya Know Ruth,
you meet Ruth,
you get to know Ruth.

536
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.830
Then at a later time

537
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.940
you're shown an image of Ruth.

538
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.760
Maybe not even an especially good image of Ruth,

539
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:40.910
but good enough to remind you and suddenly you're remembering things you know

540
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:47.400
about Ruth.
That's how recollection works.

541
00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.020
<v 2>All right?</v>

542
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.080
<v 0>Now,</v>

543
00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:58.080
Plato points out that we all know things about the platonic forms.

544
00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:02.580
<v 2>Okay,</v>

545
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.930
<v 0>but the platonic forms,</v>

546
00:38:03.931 --> 00:38:08.790
as we also know are not to be found in this world.

547
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:12.810
Then number three is not a physical object.

548
00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.080
Perfect roundness is not a physical object.

549
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:19.410
Perfect goodness is not a physical object.

550
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.280
We can think about these things.
Our mind can grasp them,

551
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.420
but they're not to be found in this world yet.

552
00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:33.410
Various things that we do find in this world get us thinking about those things.

553
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:40.630
I look at the plate on my kitchen table.

554
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.290
It's not perfectly round.
It's got imperfections,

555
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:49.360
but suddenly I start thinking about circles,
perfectly round objects.

556
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.730
I look at somebody who's pretty,

557
00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:59.570
he or she is not perfectly beautiful,

558
00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:03.080
but suddenly I start thinking about the nature of beauty itself.

559
00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:09.520
Ordinary objects in the world participate to a greater or lesser degree in the

560
00:39:11.871 --> 00:39:14.430
platonic forms.
That's the,
that's played,

561
00:39:14.431 --> 00:39:19.431
I was picture of metaphysics and we bump up against,

562
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.660
we look at,

563
00:39:20.661 --> 00:39:25.661
we have interactions with these every day objects and somehow they get us

564
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:31.820
thinking about the platonic forms themselves.

565
00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:37.400
How does it happen?
Plato has a theory.

566
00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.520
He says these things remind us of the platonic forms.

567
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:49.810
We see something that's beautiful to some degree and it reminds us of perfect

568
00:39:52.461 --> 00:39:53.294
beauty.

569
00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:58.840
We see something that's more or less round and it reminds us of perfect

570
00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:00.440
circularity.

571
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:06.370
We see somebody who's fairly decent morally and it reminds us of perfect justice

572
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:10.250
or perfect virtue.

573
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:15.380
It's just like the photograph,

574
00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.440
perhaps the not very good photograph.

575
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:22.760
That reminds me of my friend Ruth.

576
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.220
Alright,

577
00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:27.890
well there was an explanation of how it could be that things that are not

578
00:40:27.891 --> 00:40:30.350
themselves perfectly round could remind us,

579
00:40:30.351 --> 00:40:34.370
could make us think about perfect roundness,
but,
but then Plato says,
okay,

580
00:40:34.371 --> 00:40:39.371
but keep in mind all what you need in order to have reminding to have

581
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:46.390
recollecting take place in order for the photograph to remind me of Ruth,

582
00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:53.480
I have to all ready have met Ruth.

583
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:56.960
I have to already be acquainted with her

584
00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:02.960
in order for uh,

585
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:08.050
more or less round plate to remind me of roundness.

586
00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:13.840
Plato says I have to have all ready met perfect roundness itself in order for a

587
00:41:18.111 --> 00:41:23.111
more or less just society to remind me of justice itself.

588
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.930
So that can start thinking about the nature of justice itself.

589
00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:32.140
I have to somehow have already been acquainted with perfect justice,

590
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:39.630
but how and when did it happen?
Not In this life,

591
00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:44.520
not in this world.
In this world.
Nothing is perfectly round.

592
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.500
Nothing is perfectly beautiful.

593
00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:51.650
Nothing is perfectly just so it's got to have happened before.

594
00:41:55.410 --> 00:42:00.410
If seeing the photograph of my friend now can remind me of my friend.

595
00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:04.680
It's got to be because I met my friend before.

596
00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:06.640
<v 2>Okay.</v>

597
00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:11.560
<v 0>If seen things that participate in the forms,</v>

598
00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.140
remind me of the forms.

599
00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:19.590
It's got to be because I've met or been acquainted with directly with the forms

600
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:21.640
before,

601
00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.200
but you don't bump up against,
you don't meet,

602
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:32.470
you don't see or grasp or become directly acquainted with the forms in this

603
00:42:33.261 --> 00:42:34.094
life.

604
00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.720
So it's got to have happened before this life.

605
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:43.340
That's Plato's argument.
Plato says,

606
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.520
thinking about the way in which we grasp the forms helps us to see that the soul

607
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
must have existed before birth in the,

608
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.440
in the platonic heavenly realm,
directly grasping,

609
00:43:03.441 --> 00:43:08.441
directly communing with directly understanding the forms.

610
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:14.570
It's not taking place in this life.
So it has to have happened before.

611
00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.533
<v 2>Well look,</v>

612
00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:20.710
<v 0>now we've got the kind of argument we were looking for earlier.</v>

613
00:43:20.711 --> 00:43:25.360
The objection was we had no good reason to think the soul was one of the

614
00:43:25.361 --> 00:43:29.440
building blocks from which were composed.
We have no good reason to think.

615
00:43:29.441 --> 00:43:34.441
It's one of the pieces that was around before our body got put together before

616
00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:40.060
you know,
before our birth,
Socrates says no.
On the contrary,

617
00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:45.480
we do have reason based on the argument from recollection to conclude at this

618
00:43:45.861 --> 00:43:49.030
soul was around before we were born.

619
00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:53.733
<v 2>Okay.</v>

620
00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:59.040
<v 0>All right,
so next question is,
is the argument from recollection a good one?</v>

621
00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:02.943
<v 2>Now</v>

622
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.510
<v 0>Z ,
I'm not really much concerned with whether this is an argument that Plato</v>

623
00:44:06.511 --> 00:44:08.340
thought worked or not.

624
00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:12.180
Our question is do we think it works or not?

625
00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:15.870
Although this is a form of an argument that Plato does put forward and other

626
00:44:15.871 --> 00:44:18.660
dialogues as well and so talk to me,
so there's,

627
00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.810
there's at least some reason I think this is an argument that he thought might

628
00:44:21.811 --> 00:44:26.700
well be right.
The crucial premise,
again,

629
00:44:26.701 --> 00:44:29.700
we're going to just grant Plato the metaphysics.

630
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.820
The crucial questions going to be,

631
00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:39.300
is it right that in order to explain how it is,

632
00:44:39.301 --> 00:44:44.301
we could have knowledge of the forms now that we have to appeal to a prior

633
00:44:47.371 --> 00:44:50.460
existence in which we had direct acquaintance.

634
00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>

635
00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.140
<v 0>It's not obvious to me if that's true.</v>

636
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:01.240
It's not obvious to me for a couple of reasons.
One,
one question is this,

637
00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:07.000
is it really true that in order to think about the perfectly straight,

638
00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:12.600
I must have somehow somewhere at some point come up against,

639
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:17.440
had direct knowledge of the perfectly straight?

640
00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:23.970
Isn't it enough for me to extrapolate from cases that I do come up against in

641
00:45:27.131 --> 00:45:31.300
this life?
I come across things that are bent,

642
00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:35.530
I come across things that are more straight,
more and more straight.

643
00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:40.770
Can't my mind take off from there and push straight ahead to the idea of the

644
00:45:45.341 --> 00:45:46.420
perfectly straight,

645
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:51.520
even if I never have encountered it before?

646
00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:56.240
Let me stop with this idea.

647
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.510
Even if Plato was right,

648
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:06.290
that we need to have acquaintance with the platonic forms and selves in order to

649
00:46:06.661 --> 00:46:10.800
think about them,
and even if Plato was right,

650
00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:14.520
that we never get the acquaintance in this world,

651
00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.330
in the interaction with ordinary physical objects,

652
00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:23.900
why couldn't it be that our acquaintance with the platonic forms comes about in

653
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:31.260
this life for the very first time?

654
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:35.150
All right.
That's the question.
That's the objection.
That will turn to it.

655
00:46:35.151 --> 00:46:36.210
Start up next class.
